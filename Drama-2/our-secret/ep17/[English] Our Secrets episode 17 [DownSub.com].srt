Our Secret
EP17

2
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,030
It's our Comics Club.

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,080
This is the club's pictorial.

4
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,520
Anyway, the task to select candidates

5
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,670
will be handed to you.

6
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,240
I truly trust your vision.

7
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,030
President

8
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,760
This is the pictorial you asked me to draw last week.

9
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,200
Right, Ding Xian.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,590
Let me introduce her to you.

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,440
This is the chief editor of Dream Journey Press.

12
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,270
She's also the organizer of this competition.

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,880
This is Ding Xian.

14
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,630
Pretty good!

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,320
A freshman?

16
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,190
Have you ever taken part in

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,520
other competitions organized by other presses?

18
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,680
No.

19
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,079
Drawing is just my hobby before.

20
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,320
Well, your president is right.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
The girl

22
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,350
is truly talented.

23
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,400
I feel so relieved that you have such a great drawer.

24
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,630
I'll leave to you the rest of the issues of the competition.

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,470
I should go now.

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Okay. Take care.

27
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,320
How's that? Are you interested in the competition?

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
President, I have something to do.

29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,550
I'll go now.

30
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,550
How do you know I like this?

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,750
It's a gift from the store.

32
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,350
Don't be like before,

33
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,040
sleepless after drinking coffee.

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,960
You've been doing the paper for two days,

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
and you haven't finished yet?

36
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,040
Stop doing it if you can't.

37
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,880
Didn't you forbid me to join in the scientific research group?

38
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,190
It's none of your business.

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,910
The store's closing. Go back earlier.

40
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,029
Let me walk you balk.

41
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,909
Didn't you say you wouldn't go back to the campus?

42
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,030
I will go to the laboratory tomorrow morning.

43
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,750
To save the time.

44
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,630
What are you smirking about?

45
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,310
Nothing.

46
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,470
Wait!

47
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,030
Who is it?

48
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,910
Is it our Zhou Siyue, Boss Zhou?

49
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,430
Why do you come back to the dormitory?

50
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,590
I should guarantee that stalker

51
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,030
doesn't reappear.

52
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,560
Stalker?

53
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,400
Just tell me

54
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
you sent Ding Xian to her dormitory!

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
Did you?

56
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,909
Did you?

57
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,150
Did you?

58
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,030
Did you?

59
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,120
Tell me! We're brothers!

60
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,000
Morning.

61
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,030
Morning, bro.

62
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,350
You look so different after sleeping in the dormitory!

63
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,120
Have a look.

64
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,350
Circuits and Electronics: Data Integration of Analog and Digital Electronics.

65
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,080
Haven't we learned it as freshmen? Why did you do with it?

66
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,870
To have a review.

67
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,800
What a complete one!

68
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,080
If any student

69
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,310
who wants to join in our group this year finds this,

70
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,120
he or she will be so happy!

71
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,520
Are you going to bribe a girl with this?

72
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,840
You can tell me, and I'll borrow you.

73
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,030
No.

74
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,630
If I do what you said, I'll make it by myself.

75
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,280
-Give it back.  -Wait.

76
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,560
You…you've already made it.

77
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
Borrow it to me. Do me a favor.

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,030
What can I get from it?

79
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,280
You see,

80
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
if I succeed,

81
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,310
I'll serve you in any way you like.

82
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
Let me tell you, I know a girl.

83
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,120
She lives in the same dormitory as Ding Xian.

84
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,430
So beautiful!

85
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,630
Okay. I'll borrow it to you.

86
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,910
If you succeed, treat me a meal.

87
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,190
Of course!

88
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm leaving.

89
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,630
Didn't you just come for a while?

90
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,190
To get more sleep.

91
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,080
Bye-bye.

92
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,520
Don't worry, Jiayu.

93
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,159
The material can really help you a lot.

94
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,789
Thanks, Yuan.

95
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,870
We can be WeChat friends.

96
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,750
If you have any question, just ask me directly.

97
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
See? Yuan Fang

98
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,230
is really blunt at reading other people's mind!

99
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,550
Ban Jiayu has no reactions at all.

100
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,310
Obviously, she has no interest in him.

101
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,600
Why does he still help her?

102
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,550
What's this?

103
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,750
A test material given by Yuan Fang.

104
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,960
Well, I don't understand

105
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,280
why you want to join in the scientific research group.

106
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,670
Tiring and hard to pass the test.

107
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,520
See? Here comes the instruction.

108
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,190
Let me see.

109
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,430
Ding Xian

110
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,310
What about copying one for you?

111
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,400
Great! I really need it.

112
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,870
Before answering any question,

113
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,990
be careful of

114
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,550
the information given by the question.

115
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,080
This question.

116
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,960
Prove…

117
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,870
I bet you didn't read it carefully.

118
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,080
You even didn't notice the wrong word.

119
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,480
Who'd like to

120
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,310
find wrong words on the paper?

121
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,960
I do.

122
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,230
Hello.

123
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,080
Hello.

124
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,110
I want to ask you something.

125
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,480
How to order food on my phone?

126
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,040
Could you please teach me?

127
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,110
According to your demands,

128
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,400
click the goods on your phone,

129
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,670
and pay the bill directly.

130
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,840
Then you can take your food by the counter with the number you get.

131
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,920
But there's no introduction of the food in this page.

132
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,870
Could you please give me some recommendations?

133
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,430
What's your specialties?

134
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,160
You can order according to

135
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,230
the menu.

136
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,720
Can I add you as a WeChat friend?

137
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,550
I'll often drop by the store!

138
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,870
This is the QR code of the store.

139
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,600
If you need to order a seat,

140
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,400
you can scan the QR code directly.

141
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,230
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,720
Go!

143
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,840
What? Hurry up!

144
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,630
Aren't you busy?

145
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,110
I should eat anyhow.

146
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,520
Isn't the test coming?

147
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,960
Why do you have time to be here?

148
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,520
Don't worry.

149
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,160
I accidentally got a good treasure.

150
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,310
I'm sure I'll pass the test.

151
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,840
The scientific research group of Professor Ye

152
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,550
is not that easy to get in.

153
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,550
I also felt I had no hope.

154
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,550
But after reading through the material just now,

155
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,430
I find it much easier to understand.

156
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,040
I suddenly understand so many knowledge nodes in it.

157
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,550
See?

158
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,990
There're a table of content and conclusions,

159
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,430
and examples of wrong answers.

160
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,750
So thoughtful!

161
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,430
Seriously,

162
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,630
the strange habit to pick up wrong words

163
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
is really like yours!

164
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,990
Are you kidding me?

165
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,870
Did I really have an illusion?

166
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,520
Don't think too much.

167
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,870
Ding Xian

168
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,990
If now I still

169
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,920
want to persuade you not to do it,

170
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,630
am I too late?

171
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,630
It's good you're clear about it.

172
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,430
Then wish you good luck.

173
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,600
Thanks.

174
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,670
Why don't you give me a meal? I also want to eat.

175
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,110
I'm a guest today!

176
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,520
I also want to eat!

177
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,040
Let me tell you.

178
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,750
I've inquired about it yesterday.

179
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,840
The list is shown up today.

180
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,430
Ban Jiayu

181
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
You must be in it!

182
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,160
I dare not see it.

183
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,110
Let me help you to look at it.

184
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,280
Help me to look at it.

185
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,840
Okay.

186
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,280
No, there's not.

187
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,990
Don't look for my name if I'm not there.

188
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,230
Aren't you worried?

189
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,550
I didn't have any hope at the beginning.

190
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,960
I can change another field.

191
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,080
Well, it's just a choice.

192
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,310
Ding Xian

193
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,430
You got in!

194
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,720
See? She got in!

195
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,550
Look!

196
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,790
I've told you that you would be chosen.

197
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,280
I got in! I got in!

198
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,990
Siyue, the girl called Ding Xian we met last time

199
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,230
really got in our group.

200
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,230
Is she junior to you?

201
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,720
No.

202
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,990
We were classmates in senior high school.

203
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,720
She studied in the high school for another year.

204
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,870
I didn't expect that she could get such a high grade!

205
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,230
She makes me a little bit astonished.

206
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,990
Her solutions to questions are just like yours.

207
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,310
It's not strange that she got in.

208
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,920
She is always a clever student.

209
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,160
Zhou Siyue! Zhou Siyue!

210
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,520
I passed…

211
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,310
Here she comes.

212
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,400
Sorry, Professor Ye.

213
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,870
I didn't see you just now.

214
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,550
I've seen your paper.

215
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Pretty good.

216
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
But after getting into the scientific research group,

217
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,750
there will be an assessment period.

218
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,430
You should be prepared.

219
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,360
I will. Thank you, Professor Ye.

220
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Continue your chat.

221
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,110
Great!

222
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,400
I approached closer to studying abroad with you!

223
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,600
It will be more difficult in the assessment period.

224
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,080
If your task is not passed,

225
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
you have no way to get into the core experiment group.

226
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,600
Don't always discourage me.

227
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Ding Xian

228
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,430
Are you sure you will like to do all of these?

229
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,230
Doing experiments,

230
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,480
writing programs,

231
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,990
and collecting data every day.

232
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,430
You won't be interested in all of these.

233
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,480
If you like these,

234
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,480
why won't I?

235
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,630
Alright. I won't bother you.

236
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm leaving now.

237
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,280
The fried chicken is ordered by me!

238
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,790
I fetched it!

239
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
You want to eat?

240
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,670
Then apologize to me.

241
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,670
Call me daddy if you want to eat.

242
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
-Daddy.  -Sorry.

243
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay. Okay.

244
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,880
Here you are.

245
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,310
Disgusting!

246
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,080
Tell you something.

247
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,790
Ding Xian has got in our scientific research group.

248
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,000
Good. She's close to you.

249
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,550
Good?

250
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,760
Think about it.

251
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,760
Ding Xian reviewed for another year.

252
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,480
She was so arduous for me.

253
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,150
She got into Hua Qing University for me.

254
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
And she got in the scientific research group for me!

255
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,510
She doesn't like these at all!

256
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,880
Just like Kong Shadi.

257
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,720
If Kong Shadi

258
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,760
gives up what she likes

259
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,670
because of you,

260
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,600
do you like it?

261
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,120
So I ran away from her.

262
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,760
In my opinion, even so,

263
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,480
you must

264
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,390
have no way to resist from showing her your love.

265
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,000
No way.

266
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,550
I don't believe you.

267
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,550
In the next three months,

268
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,310
we'll do a task assessment every month.

269
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,960
The student who passes all assessments

270
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,910
is able to stay eventually.

271
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,030
For the first week, Dong Zhengfei will

272
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,000
lead you to get familiar with the environment.

273
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,550
From the next week,

274
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,390
every student should hand in your new task.

275
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,790
I won't say any other words.

276
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,270
Dong Zhengfei, make an arrangement.

277
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,310
Okay.

278
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,670
Follow me.

279
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,390
The laboratory

280
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,550
is open for 24 hours every day.

281
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,600
Professor Ye gives classes

282
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,910
from 6:30 pm to 10:30 pm.

283
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,360
As for other time, you can arrange by yourself.

284
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,270
However, if you really intend to

285
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,790
join in our scientific research group,

286
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,640
you should sacrifice

287
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,270
all the time for entertainment

288
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,390
and stay in the laboratory from day till night.

289
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,120
Be prepared at any time.

290
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,840
Have a seat.

291
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
The scientific research

292
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,790
is truly a boring thing to do.

293
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,430
And because of it,

294
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,510
everyone should be fully concentrated.

295
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,550
If you don't have enough passion,

296
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,150
you'd better give up as early as possible.

297
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,310
Come on!

298
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,960
I'm sure I'll stay in the scientific research group!

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,720
Why are you in such a hurry for a whole day?

300
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,960
Lou Feng. Do you have anything to eat?

301
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,190
Yes.

302
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,510
Hurry up.

303
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,640
Another one.

304
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,310
No. I really have no time.

305
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,910
I'll go now.

306
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,640
Get another one!

307
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,760
There's no time!

308
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm sorry. I'm late.

309
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Again? Go ahead.

310
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,720
The assignment is… Let me see…

312
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,030
Love is always making people tired!

313
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,430
Don't slack off!

314
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,840
Professor

315
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,150
Did you hand in your task?

316
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,760
Almost done. Give me another five minutes.

317
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,880
Why should I wait for you?

318
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,550
Everyone's handed in theirs!

319
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,840
Is that your attitude to do scientific research?

320
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you have sense of time?

321
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,720
Go back now.

323
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,310
No.

324
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,960
Bugs in the program

325
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,510
haven't been found.

326
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,030
You'll tire to death sooner or later.

327
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,840
You do much more things than me,

328
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,310
but why aren't you tired?

329
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,310
You should ask yourself

330
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
why you make yourself so tired.

331
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,390
Run the following program…

332
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,880
No way! Ding Xian!

333
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
Are you living in the library?

334
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,640
Professor Ye has told me.

335
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
As long as I can answer this question,

336
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,000
the assessments in the next three months will be exempted,

337
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,030
and I'll be a true member of the group.

338
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,720
What if…you cannot solve it?

339
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,640
Pack up and go.

340
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,840
Professor Ye

341
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,360
You are deliberately making hard on her.

342
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,390
She's making hard on herself.

343
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,150
If the question is given to juniors or seniors,

344
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,360
they may not solve it.

345
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,430
What's going on?

346
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,150
The code is wrong.

347
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,480
Siyue

348
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,550
Not only her.

349
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,310
You also should figure out

350
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,480
what on earth you are doing.

351
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,030
I won't make mistakes again.

352
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,670
What are you looking at?

353
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,240
Give me an idea.

354
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,960
In what way

355
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,190
can I talk with him?

356
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,480
Ask him how to solve the question.

357
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,840
Good idea.

358
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,910
Well, hello.

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,270
I have a question. I don't know if you have any time.

360
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,480
Could you please have a look at it?

361
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,960
Okay. Let me see.

362
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,190
You're only a freshman.

363
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,310
Why does your professor give you such a hard question?

364
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,510
It's a question given to Ding Xian by Professor Ye.

365
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,960
Only when Ding Xian solved the question

366
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,430
can she stay in the scientific research group.

367
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,270
What a surprise!

368
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,480
She's really hard-working!

369
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,960
She does this for his high school classmate Zhou Siyue.

370
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,910
The girl works late at night every day.

371
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,270
She's tired as a dog!

372
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,550
Just to get in the scientific research group,

373
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,640
and to go abroad with him.

374
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,310
Is she

375
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,270
that confident?

376
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,310
Let me tell you,

377
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,310
in order to get in the scientific research group…

378
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,390
I cannot solve the question right now.

379
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,030
It's okay.

380
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,480
Add you as a WeChat friend.

381
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,600
If you solve the question, send the answer to me.

382
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,360
Okay.

383
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,840
There's only one quota for the overseas exchange every year.

384
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,760
Does Professor Ye really appoint Zhou Siyue secretly?

385
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,030
How's that?

386
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,720
I've got his WeChat!

387
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,510
I mean the question.

388
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,150
The question? He doesn't know how to solve it.

389
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,080
That hard?

390
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,880
Does Professor Ye

391
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,670
make it difficult for you deliberately?

392
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,240
I'll go now.

393
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,600
Bro, I'm also leaving now.

394
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,640
Bye-bye.

395
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,080
Bye-bye.

396
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,150
Zhou Siyue

397
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,790
The assignment given by Professor Ye

398
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,000
is out of my capability.

399
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,080
I won't help you.

400
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,880
Please.

401
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,480
No way.

402
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,120
Help me!

403
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,430
Only once!

404
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
Don't act like that!

405
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,360
Please! Only once!

406
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,840
Have you done the experimental demonstration?

407
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,430
Not yet.

408
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,790
Then in accordance with your thoughts in your mind,

409
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,760
write those codes down.

410
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,120
No need to read books?

411
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,030
It's of no use to read so many theories.

412
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,190
If you don't practice,

413
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,390
you cannot find the true question.

414
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,600
Write them down first.

415
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,430
What are you doing instead of solving the question?

416
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,150
I cannot help doing it.

417
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,480
Sorry.

418
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,840
What do you think of my drawing?

419
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,190
Better than solving the question.

420
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,720
Really?

421
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,600
I don't think it's as good as my drawings before.

422
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,880
Before?

423
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,510
What did you draw?

424
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,760
It's a secret!

425
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,080
As you wish.

426
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,270
Didn't you say it was a secret?

427
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,480
How could you tell me?

428
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,120
Anyway, I like you, and I like to draw.

429
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,360
They're not secrets anymore.

430
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,150
Ding Xian

431
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,480
Actually, I just hope

432
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,190
you can choose

433
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,000
what you really like to do.

434
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,550
I will.

435
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,480
So don't talk to me anymore.

436
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,960
I should try to solve the question.

437
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,430
Communication is forbidden.

438
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,960
Mr. Zhou

439
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,310
You've finished?

440
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,790
Finished?

441
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,360
Zero point.

442
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,150
Why?

443
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,390
What about the bugs of the information security?

444
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,790
The information holes are so obvious.

445
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,000
Didn't you notice them?

446
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,270
If someone from the tech company

447
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,390
gives you a task,

448
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,240
you will be sued now.

449
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,390
Didn't you tell me to write in this way?

450
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,430
So we've found the problem.

451
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,270
Redo it.

452
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,880
Zhou Siyue

453
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,790
I think now we're

454
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,390
just like when we were in senior high school.

455
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,000
When division of Arts and Sciences, you taught me mathematics.

456
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,120
You are just... like before.

457
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,840
How?

458
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,360
You're mean like before.

459
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,000
You're also the same.

460
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,480
You still don't make any progress.

461
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,760
According to your present professional level,

462
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,840
you should consider changing your major.

463
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,190
Don't be too harsh on me!

464
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,760
I'm only a freshman.

465
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,310
No one cares if you're a freshman or not.

466
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
They only know that you're a student from Huaqing University.

467
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,670
Besides,

468
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,080
it's you who must get in the scientific research group.

469
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,510
If you don't pass the assessment,

470
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,030
it's pretty normal.

471
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,150
Professor Ye is strict.

472
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,150
Besides, I also think

473
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,670
you don't need to get in the scientific research group.

474
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,790
Zhou Siyue. You really look down upon me!

475
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,270
Besides, I have you, such an expert!

476
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,240
I'm sure I'll pass it.

477
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,670
What do you mean?

478
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
I ask you for a favor, and you act like this?

479
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,360
Wait me for a while.

480
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,510
The university holds a fraternity for the freshman.

481
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,510
Are you going there with me?

482
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,190
No.

483
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,840
Zhou Siyue

484
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,190
It's not good if you keep like this.

485
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,310
Don't you have many

486
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,190
entertainments before?

487
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,000
Why do you stop chatting with others who are alive?

488
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,030
Do what you should do in every period,

489
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,720
so that you won't regret.

490
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,430
Boring.

491
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,390
Fine.

492
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,600
I should learn from you. I won't go there, either.

493
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,000
I'll go back to the laboratory.

494
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,480
Do what you should do. No regret.

495
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,400
Ding Xian

496
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,199
Ding Xian

497
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,989
Ding Xian

498
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,030
Where are you?

499
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,880
Ding Xian

500
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,880
Are you okay?

501
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,360
Why are you hiding here stealthily?

502
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,440
Why are you so timid?

503
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,680
Who is timid?

504
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,550
Don't talk nonsense!

505
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,400
Didn't you leave? Why do you come back?

506
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,550
The power's off.

507
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,680
What if the data are missing?

508
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,360
Shouldn't I come back and check?

509
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,920
I'll go.

510
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,510
Didn't you say

511
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,270
that you wouldn't help her

512
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,400
after she got in the group?

513
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,470
What were you doing?

514
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,160
I didn't resist it.

515
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,550
What did I day?

516
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,510
You're so stubborn!

517
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,640
Eat your food!

518
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,400
Eat with me!

519
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
No. I won't.

520
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,030
If people are iron, food is steel.

521
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,640
You'll be hungry if you miss one meal.

522
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,360
You work and study every day,

523
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,080
and often do experiments late at night.

524
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
You should take care of your health.

525
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,840
You know?

526
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,360
How can you stay active if you don't eat?

527
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,200
Why do you act like my mom?

528
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,030
Come here. Good boy. Have a meal.

529
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,510
Come on. Come on!

530
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,230
The pork hock tastes good!

531
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,230
Do you have any problem with your brain recently?

532
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,030
What?

533
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,640
Chopsticks.

534
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,470
They're opposite down.

535
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,270
Professor Ye

536
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,470
Did I pass it?

537
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,200
Pretty good.

538
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,160
But there's another one

539
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,640
who used the same solution as you did.

540
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,880
You know who I'm talking about.

541
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,310
Professor Ye

542
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,160
It's true that I asked Zhou Siyue for help.

543
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,750
But, I…

544
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,440
You understand Zhou Siyue better than I do.

545
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,550
He has a great passion on scientific research.

546
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,600
And he can pass the passion

547
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,030
to others.

548
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,680
He's the one whom others want to chase after

549
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,360
but cannot be caught up with forever.

550
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,510
Ding Xian

551
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,120
You're very clever.

552
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,080
You should know what to do.

553
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,120
Chocolate! Let me eat one.

554
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,920
No way.

555
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,230
It's a present for someone else.

556
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,710
I'll buy it to you next time.

557
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,550
A present?

558
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,880
Is the robot

559
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,950
drawn for Zhou Siyue?

560
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,840
What's Zhou's feeling?

561
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,840
What do you mean?

562
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,990
You've been chasing him for such a long time.

563
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,310
If you two

564
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,600
are really good as what you said before,

565
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,080
he should have

566
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,600
expressed love to you now.

567
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,160
I didn't ask him to be my boyfriend.

568
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,440
Then what do you want from him?

569
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,600
I didn't mean it.

570
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,640
I just think you chased him so hard.

571
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,950
I feel pretty bad!

572
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,950
I think

573
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,990
being happy is the most important thing.

574
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,470
As long as you don't regret.

575
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Okay. I'll go wash now.

576
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,790
Go to bed early.

577
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,080
Good night.

578
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,840
Good night.

579
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,360
I don't care if you like Zhou Siyue or not.

580
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,200
But, Ding Xian,

581
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,310
I cannot feel your passion about the scientific research.

582
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,510
I don't know how much

583
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,640
you know about the prospect of the major.

584
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,600
I also don't know how you plan for

585
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,160
the future.

586
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,840
I just hope

587
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,920
before deciding to do scientific research,

588
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,790
you can think about it clearly.

589
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,440
You should be clear if Zhou Siyue is not here,

590
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,470
what on earth your choice is.

591
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,080
Ding Xian

592
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,470
Dong

593
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,790
Did you pass the exam set by Professor Ye?

594
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,750
Kind of.

595
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,880
Will you go abroad?

596
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,750
I'm still trying.

597
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,790
Actually, I always think

598
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,840
you're such a smart girl.

599
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,470
Why do you waste

600
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,440
your time on such kind of things?

601
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,270
What do you mean?

602
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,400
You're just like a tail of Zhou Siyue.

603
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,310
I really admire you.

604
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,840
You're able to give up so many things

605
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,710
for the person you like.

606
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,640
But I don't think it worth

607
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,640
doing it.

608
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,470
Dong

609
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,750
Whether it's worth or not isn't judged by

610
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,750
how much you paid out.

611
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,230
It's true that Zhou Siyue has marvelous

612
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,160
professional competence.

613
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,750
You are willing to

614
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,400
do anything you don't like for him,

615
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,230
but he will definitely not give up what he likes

616
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,990
for anyone else.

617
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,750
For example,

618
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,680
giving up going abroad for you.

619
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,510
It doesn't matter.

620
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,840
I don't expect him to do anything for me.

621
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,440
Then what if I tell you that

622
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,750
it was him who told Professor Ye

623
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,880
that you're not capable of doing scientific research?

624
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,230
It's not important.

625
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,600
Ding Xian

626
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,440
Ding Xian

627
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm sorry, President.

628
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,880
What did you just say?

629
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,710
I said thanks for

630
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,600
the task today.

631
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,470
It's okay.

632
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,840
Hello.

633
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,270
Hello, Zhou Siyue.

634
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,550
Where are you?

635
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,950
Do you have anything to tell me?

636
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,640
I knew you must be here!

637
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,550
There's another problem in the program.

638
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,470
Please help me check it.

639
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,710
Thanks.

640
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,840
What are you busy in doing?

641
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,920
You didn't reply to me on WeChat every time.

642
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,160
I was doing experiments.

643
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,470
But you shouldn't always be in the laboratory.

644
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,400
So boring!

645
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,310
Why don't you join in our Comics Club?

646
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,310
It's so fun!

647
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,230
Right. We recently received an invitation

648
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,790
of a drawing competition.

649
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,950
Drawing competition?

650
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:48,880
Right.

651
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,360
The winner can sign with

652
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,880
the Comics Press directly!

653
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,710
Did Ding Xian take part in it?

654
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,990
She?

655
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,550
Actually, I thought she was really talented.

656
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,920
If she took part in the competition,

657
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,550
she might get a reward.

658
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,790
But she refused.

659
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,600
She said she was too busy to take part in it.

660
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,990
I don't understand what a freshman like her

661
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,270
is busy in doing.

662
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,470
I've helped you revise it.

663
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,880
No other problems.

664
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,360
However,

665
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,080
if you deliberately modify the program,

666
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,440
I won't help you.

667
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,030
You found it anyway.

668
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,750
Okay. If you have nothing else to do, just leave.

669
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,120
Okay. Let me treat you a meal.

670
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,470
Why are you touching my thing?

671
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,270
What?

672
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,990
Isn't it just chocolate?

673
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,790
Why did you say like that?

674
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,680
The chocolate is given by someone else!

675
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,120
Why are you so fierce to me?

676
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,790
I didn't know it was given by someone else!

677
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,680
I'll just buy you

678
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,950
the same kind of chocolate!

679
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,310
So mean!

680
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,470
Thanks.

681
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,880
Did you finish making tools?

682
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,120
Almost done, President.

683
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,360
Wait me for a while.

684
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,470
Ding Xian, what's wrong with you today?

685
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,510
Do you feel uncomfortable?

686
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,160
Are you going to have a rest?

687
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,120
I'm fine. I'm fine.

688
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,400
It's almost finished.

689
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,840
I won't retard the rehearsal tomorrow.

690
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:32,680
Okay.

691
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,840
President. Does Xing Lufei come here?

692
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,200
They're asking for costumes again.

693
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,080
Wait a minute.

694
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,400
I'll call her.

695
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,160
Okay.

696
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,920
What's the hurry? Here I come.

697
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,550
Great! Xing.

698
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,440
How are the costumes prepared?

699
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,950
They've decided. We only need another two.

700
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,710
Look at my chart.

701
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,920
Check what steps haven't been finished.

702
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,550
Xing, where is the chocolate from?

703
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,120
Zhou Siyue gave it to me.
