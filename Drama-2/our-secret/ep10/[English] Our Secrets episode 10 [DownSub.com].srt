Our Secret
EP10

2
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,400
Hurry up and eat.

3
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,190
I'll take you home after meal.

4
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,160
I don't wanna go back.

5
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,440
Could you let me stay here for one night.

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,190
You wish.

7
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,720
You must go home, like it or not.

8
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,270
You're so petty.

9
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,880
Grown up already, ha!

10
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,550
able to run away from home?

11
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,390
Hello.

12
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,190
I

13
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,720
came across Ding Xian down the road.

14
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,670
so I took her to dinner.

15
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,800
Then I walked her home.

16
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,829
Thank you, Siyue.

17
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,110
You're welcome.

18
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,079
Siyue

19
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,910
Xianxian is a bit strange recently.

20
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,829
By the way,

21
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,360
Does Xianxian

22
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,880
have a boyfriend at school?

23
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,160
She didn't mention anything alike to me.

24
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,390
Maybe it's all in my head.

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
Xianxian has been

26
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,600
particularly rebellious recently.

27
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,550
She keeps a lot of things from me.

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,830
I can't help asking.

29
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,470
But I think Ding Xian is quite obedient.

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,630
So

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,550
you don't have to worry too much.

32
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,110
Please, don't let me keep you.

33
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Take care.

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,750
Thank you for sending Xianxian back.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
You're welcome.

36
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,240
Goodbye.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Tell me.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,190
What have you done to my daughter?

39
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm worried about her.

40
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,000
So I read her diary.

41
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,829
But I didn't say anything.

42
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,470
You just know how to conceal her faults.

43
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,910
Conceal her faults?

44
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,600
You infringed her privacy.

45
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,390
Do you know that?

46
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,600
You can't do this.

47
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,390
Better go cheer her up.

48
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,240
No.

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm still angry.

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,080
You...

51
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,720
You're so stubborn.

52
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,440
Someone says that

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,230
when a person can confront loss calmly

54
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,350
and have learned to accept the reality,

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,200
his youth

56
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,350
begins to fade.

57
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm sorry, sir.

58
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,550
I didn't do well on the exam.

59
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,830
You're not sorry for me.

60
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,040
You should be sorry for yourself.

61
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,230
These are the ones you can usually answer correctly.

62
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,110
How could  you make it all wrong?

63
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,830
That is it.

64
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,790
Go and think it over

65
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,440
Change your seat. Put more efforts on study.

66
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,440
Really?

67
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,040
Did you really fail the exam?

68
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,760
I was too nervous, so I didn't do well on the exam.

69
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,830
All right. Let's change seats.

70
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,270
What's going on?

71
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
I sit here?

72
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,110
All right.

73
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,270
I'm fine.

74
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,390
Please pass them on.

75
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,950
On this set of papers are the classic questions from previous years.

76
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,550
Please finish it today.

77
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,670
I'll explain it tomorrow.

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Please take it seriously.

79
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,550
An extra point is gained

80
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,600
by getting one more question right.

81
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,480
Please take care

82
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
on your way home.

83
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,640
Parents' company is highly recommended.

84
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,070
If your parents can't come,

85
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,600
please go home in groups.

86
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,320
Class's over.

87
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,320
Siyue

88
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,510
Have you ever heard of Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School?

89
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,480
Let me tell you, my friend's brother

90
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
was robbed the other day.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
That man bullies even children.

92
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
It's really scary.

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,510
Don't go.

94
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,350
Wait for me.

95
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't you go after him?

96
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,200
I don't know what to say to him.

97
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,480
It doesn't matter, just tell the truth.

98
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm afraid he'll go tell my aunt if I tell him.

99
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,440
So you're going to stay like this?

100
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,350
So you must help me think of

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,909
a good excuse to change the seat.

102
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,110
It's easy.

103
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,470
Just say you can't see the blackboard clearly.

104
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,320
My mom just got me a new pair of glasses.

105
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,790
Just say you're afraid of affecting Zhou Siyue's study.

106
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,670
Frankly speaking,

107
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,400
Song Ziqi affects his study more than me.

108
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,470
Or,

109
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,590
you can say you wanna sit with Kong Shadi.

110
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,400
He certainly won't believe such excuses.

111
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,230
I'm at my wit's end, sorry...

112
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,590
Zhou Siyue

113
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,080
Zhou Siyue is coming.

114
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,230
Didn't he go back?

115
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,080
What a coincidence.

116
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,550
You can't see me.

117
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,880
Order so much delicious food.

118
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,080
Don't order.

119
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,350
Let's sponge.

120
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,550
Please.

121
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,960
It occurs to me that

122
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,030
I have an art class to attend.

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,520
I gotta run.

124
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,590
Liar, you don't have any classes at all.

125
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
I can't stay here anymore.

126
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,280
Bye. I gotta run.

127
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
What's wrong

128
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
with you two?

129
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,400
It's okay.

130
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,550
All right.

131
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,840
All right.

132
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,710
Enjoy yourself.

133
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,080
Why do you walk so fast?

134
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,710
The teacher said we should

135
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,790
go home quickly after school.

136
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,640
It'll be terrible if we run into Evil Dragon.

137
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,670
Is there nothing you wanna tell me?

138
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,150
Why did you change the seat?

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
I'm not in good shape this time.

140
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,710
I'll definitely do well in the exam next time.

141
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,960
Can I not change the seat?

142
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Sure.

143
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,200
Let Zhou Siyue come to me.

144
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,030
He has helped you so many times anyway.

145
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,440
So he can help you this time.

146
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,840
Forget it.

147
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,150
Let's go home.

148
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,080
Why do girls suddenly alienate someone?

149
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,150
It means you make her angry.

150
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Who?

151
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,030
But I have no idea what I did wrong.

152
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,000
Girls are angry for no reason.

153
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
Kong Shadi is an example.

154
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,230
Who?

155
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,350
So what should I do?

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,280
It's easy to make girls happy.

157
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,280
Give her a present.

158
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,710
Who the hell is that?

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,400
He hasn't spoken to me all day.

160
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,640
You haven't talked to him either.

161
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,110
I didn't because I didn't find a proper chance.

162
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,110
If you don't talk to him,

163
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,710
someone will.

164
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,550
Why is Yang Chunzi

165
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,400
so close to Siyue?

166
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,590
Haven't you heard that

167
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,520
the boy who is close to her

168
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
has gone abroad?

169
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,080
So she starts going to Siyue again.

170
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,030
She always chops and changes.

171
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,030
Cut it out.

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,200
Stop taking up the cudgel for her.

173
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,030
Ding Xian hasn't spoken yet.

174
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,400
It seems that my change of seat

175
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,150
has no effect on him.

176
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,200
It's me who flatter myself.

177
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,640
You're jealous.

178
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,880
Go persuade her.

179
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
One track-minded

180
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,470
Song Ziqi, why do you drink my milk tea?

181
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,470
Terrible taste. Save it for yourself

182
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,670
Have I begged you to drink?

183
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,520
What happened to Ding Xian? so lost

184
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,520
Come on, nothing serious

185
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,110
Come on.

186
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
Can you hear what they're saying?

187
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,880
Hurry, use your pigsney to read

188
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,030
what they are saying.

189
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,840
Three strings of fish balls or nothing.

190
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,400
How dare you fish in troubled water.

191
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,440
Four strings.

192
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,470
My treat.

193
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,640
Deal.

194
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,470
Have you chosen the play yet?

195
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,080
They are going to see a play together?

196
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,670
I've already booked it.

197
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,400
I'll use the computer to send it to you later.

198
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,760
He said they weren't friends.

199
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,200
Liar.

200
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,590
Crows are all back.

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,150
I also think something is wrong with Siyue recently.

202
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,000
We discussed it in the group yesterday.

203
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Zhou Siyue, you said you didn't know her well.

204
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,710
Then why do you go to the play together?

205
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,590
I'll study hard from now on.

206
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,470
I'll never talk to you again.

207
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,080
Why are you so angry?

208
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,110
I heard that

209
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,280
a new play has been staged in Binhe Theatre recently.

210
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,670
It's called Secret Love In Peach Blossom Land.

211
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,110
seems quite good.

212
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,280
You like watching plays?

213
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,280
I just got to know it casually.

214
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,760
Don't you like it?

215
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,470
I haven't seen a play.

216
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,320
But

217
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,350
I can learn about it.

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
I just knew it.

219
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,910
She wants to date me.

220
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm back.

221
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,960
Xianxian is back.

222
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,230
Hurry up cleaning.

223
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,470
Let's go to Siyue's house.

224
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,080
His parents are back from a business trip.

225
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,520
Enjoy yourself and leave me alone.

226
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,840
Then no dinner for you.

227
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,230
I'm not hungry.

228
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,470
Mom, you look great in this makeup today.

229
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,680
You are also beautiful without makeup.

230
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,520
You look even better with makeup on.

231
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,000
What do you want?

232
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,800
Umm...

233
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,710
Pocket money...

234
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,109
Here you are.

235
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,310
Mom, can you give me more?

236
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,310
Ding Juncong

237
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,160
Multiple times this month already

238
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,430
Just five yuan.

239
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,880
Not a penny more

240
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,470
Ding Wencheng, hurry up.

241
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm coming.

242
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,280
Let's go, Ding Juncong.

243
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,400
Okay, one second.

244
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,640
Hurry up.

245
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,470
Sister, you look so good today.

246
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,800
Don't even think about it.

247
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,190
Mom's right.

248
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,110
You should get rid of

249
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,110
the habit of wasting pocket money.

250
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,680
I wouldn't squander.

251
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm going to give...

252
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,070
Forget it.

253
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,470
Even if I tell you, you don't understand.

254
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,190
What?

255
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,710
You just resort to sophistry.

256
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,430
By the way.

257
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,880
Why didn't Xianxian come?

258
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,000
She

259
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,190
didn't do well in the monthly exam, so she studies at home.

260
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
She really worries me.

261
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,920
It happens

262
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,280
to fail in the exam.

263
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,590
Everyone makes mistakes.

264
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,680
Xianxian

265
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,830
is different from Siyue,

266
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,230
who is very clever and learns faster.

267
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,000
See? He knows high technology things.

268
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,800
And Xianxian has become self-willed now,

269
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,520
Wanting to choose sciences.

270
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,190
Her score has deteriorated.

271
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,190
It'll be nice if she can get enrolled by a second-tier university.

272
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,000
We don't expect more

273
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,280
out of her.

274
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,920
Auntie

275
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,830
In fact,

276
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,920
Ding Xian's character is like this.

277
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,000
As long as she sets her mind on a thing,

278
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,400
she will stick to the end.

279
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,950
So even if it's difficult to be admitted to a key university,

280
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,590
I believe she can do it.

281
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
You don't have to worry.

282
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,160
Xianxian is a promising girl.

283
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,470
Don't worry.

284
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,230
Well.

285
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,830
Ding Xian

286
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,680
I've got a new information.

287
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,040
Would you like to listen?

288
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm too lazy

289
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,800
to listen to girls' gossip. Bye.

290
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,880
It's about Zhou Siyue and Yang Chunzi.

291
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,640
It's okay to listen.

292
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,470
They once participated in a math competition together

293
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,430
in junior high school.

294
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,520
But gradually the rumors came.

295
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,680
In order to avoid suspicion,

296
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,400
Zhou Siyue estranged from Yang Chunzi.

297
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,560
Let it be.

298
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,160
I don't care about him and Yang Chunzi.

299
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,470
From now on, I'll study hard

300
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,640
and no more Zhou Siyue.

301
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,640
Don't disturb me.

302
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,880
Oh no.

303
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,430
Oh no.

304
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,470
Another one being possessed.

305
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,710
Siyue, here.

306
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,160
Wrong again.

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Song Ziqi

308
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,230
Do you have an eraser?

309
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,640
No, I don't

310
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,800
Thank you.

311
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,430
You're welcome.

312
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,800
What are you going to do this weekend?

313
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,000
Have fun of course.

314
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,190
A new game center has opened nearby.

315
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,350
It's so much fun. Let's go together.

316
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,830
What happened to your eyes?

317
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,920
What about you, Xianxian?

318
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,710
I may study at home.

319
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,640
I don't know if my mother will let me out.

320
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,400
What about you, Siyue?

321
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,640
We'll see.

322
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,280
Song Ziqi, come out.

323
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,430
Why?

324
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,310
Hurry up.

325
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,760
Kong Shadi, what the hell do you want?

326
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,280
I can't stand it.

327
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,920
I can't stand it either. Do I provoke you?

328
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,040
Not you.

329
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,470
There is something wrong with them.

330
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,880
I can't let it go on this way

331
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,190
As long as they don't get along,

332
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,830
we won't live a happy day,

333
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,280
right?

334
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,280
Right.

335
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,000
What should we do?

336
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,230
Listen.

337
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,310
Let's get them out this weekend

338
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,110
and leave them alone.

339
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,310
I'm in charge of Ding Xian.

340
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,830
You're in charge of Siyue.

341
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,230
Why Siyue?

342
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,110
I don't care how you will do it, just do it well

343
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,310
don't come to me anymore if you failed

344
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,710
Kong Shadi

345
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,160
what about our brotherhood you mentioned?

346
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,430
You betray me

347
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,310
for Ding Xian.

348
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,160
We're not friends.

349
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,280
Idiot.

350
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,350
Or what?

351
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,950
Think for yourself.

352
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
Kong Shadi

353
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,760
You wanna

354
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,160
be my girlfriend?

355
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,800
Don't be narcissistic, okay?

356
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,590
You're disgusting.

357
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,640
Xianxian

358
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,830
Shasha

359
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,830
What will you do this weekend? Let's hang out.

360
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,400
Weekend? My mother won't let me go out.

361
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,070
Oh no. It's been a long time

362
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,470
since we hung out.

363
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,070
And let me show you.

364
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,160
Where did you get this ticket?

365
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,280
My dad's company.

366
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,280
He doesn't need this.

367
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,310
We need.

368
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,710
Forget it.

369
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,310
My mother will definitely not agree.

370
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,470
Why don't you go with Song Ziqi?

371
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,430
No, I just wanna go with you.

372
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,830
It's up to you.

373
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,590
Come on

374
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,590
Remember to dress up beautifully.

375
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,190
What are you doing?

376
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,560
How is the thing going?

377
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,950
You can always count on me

378
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,710
Really?

379
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,560
Sure thing.

380
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,470
-Why are you here?  -Just you two?

381
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,920
What about Siyue?

382
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,000
Is he still angry with me?

383
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,520
Don't flatter yourself.

384
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,430
Why are you here?

385
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,590
Call for help

386
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,590
I run out of my money.

387
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,760
Your dad deducted your pocket money again?

388
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,760
Soon after I get my lucky money at the end of the year,

389
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I'll pay you back.

390
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,880
Double back

391
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,470
Shadi, you are so kind to me.

392
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Here you are.

393
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,160
I...

394
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,800
I...

395
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,040
I don't have much money.

396
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,710
Spin out

397
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,400
I saw a 100 yuan there just now.

398
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,760
No.

399
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,190
You're robbing me.

400
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,350
Who the hell are you? robbing my friend?

401
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,640
I didn't.

402
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,830
Cut the crap

403
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,310
You're Little Loach in Shen Hai High School

404
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,190
who likes to rob nearby, right?

405
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,640
That's Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School.

406
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,830
Came clean? Good

407
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,920
That's you. I'll call the police now.

408
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,710
Don't do it. He is one of us.

409
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,470
Let me introduce.

410
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
This is my friend Jiang Chen.

411
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,110
He is the school bully of No.18 Middle School.

412
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,230
Who is she?

413
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,710
I'm You Keke, the school babe of Shen Hai High School.

414
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,830
I know you.

415
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,070
You always

416
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,070
hang out with the boys at our school.

417
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,470
Don't talk nonsense.

418
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
The boys in your No.18 Middle School

419
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,430
are all jerks.

420
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,430
Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School is from your school.

421
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,350
What if it's not?

422
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,520
Impossible.

423
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,520
All right.

424
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
Let's find him out.

425
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,520
I must let you know that

426
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,560
the boys of No.18 Middle School are innocent.

427
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,800
All right. I'm not afraid of you.

428
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,680
Let's go then.

429
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,830
Go now.

430
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,000
Why do I feel like

431
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,640
we're both redundant?

432
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,760
Are you still studying the unreliable horoscope and fortune?

433
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,230
Don't talk nonsense.

434
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,880
This is very reliable.

435
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,950
That's what little girls would believe.

436
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,560
superstitious

437
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,710
You don't believe it?

438
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,310
I'll show you,

439
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,830
and you will know whether it is reliable or not.

440
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,280
All right. Go ahead

441
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,830
I just can’t wait to hear more

442
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,230
Umm...

443
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
What's the matter?

444
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
What's your zodiac sign?

445
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,640
Kong Shadi

446
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,430
We grew up together, and

447
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,070
You don't know my zodiac sign?

448
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,110
Should I have to mind everything about you?

449
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Give it to me.

450
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,350
I'll read it for myself.

451
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,920
I'm an Aquarius. Please remember that.

452
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,230
Aquarius, here.

453
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,830
Aquarius should reduce travel this week

454
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,710
in case of losing money and red ruins...

455
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,430
Nonsense.

456
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,880
You're screwed, Song Ziqi.

457
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,350
Loss of money and a fatal disaster.

458
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,350
Shut up.

459
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,680
Ding Wencheng

460
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,350
Wake up, please.

461
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,830
What's up?

462
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,230
Look.

463
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,640
What?

464
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,110
Cinema tickets.

465
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,640
How strange.

466
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,640
It's been more than ten years

467
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,280
since we last saw a movie.

468
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,800
Why did you suddenly buy movie tickets?

469
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,920
They're not for you.

470
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
They're for Xianxian.

471
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,470
You let her go with her friends.

472
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,920
And together

473
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,950
with this dress to her.

474
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,710
You figured it out?

475
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,280
You started it

476
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,110
Go fix it by yourself. I won't go.

477
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,430
You such a guy!

478
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,070
Why is it so difficult to count on you?

479
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,920
This is your business.

480
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,680
If I give them to Xianxian,

481
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,590
should I do it in your name

482
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,880
or in my name?

483
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll go

484
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,400
Mom

485
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,800
What's up?

486
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,710
You're going out?

487
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,230
Shadi asks me to a concert.

488
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,590
I have no choice

489
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,830
but to say yes.

490
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,190
Umm...

491
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,760
Mom, can I go?

492
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,680
Yes.

493
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,310
Thank you, mom.

494
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,190
You're gonna wear this?

495
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,230
I haven't made up my mind.

496
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,110
Umm...

497
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,520
I bought you a dress.

498
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,520
Take it

499
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,430
Mom

500
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,680
I

501
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,280
don't do anything wrong, right?

502
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,350
Oh no, poor thing.

503
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,000
Can't I be nicer to you?

504
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,190
Take this.

505
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,190
500 yuan.

506
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,400
300 yuan.

507
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,430
Mom, this is too expensive.

508
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,040
You better return it.

509
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,400
Just put it on

510
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,000
Enjoy yourself.

511
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,590
Remember to come back early.

512
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,880
Remember to answer my call

513
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,400
Thank you, mom.

514
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,880
You scared me.

515
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,830
What's the matter?

516
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,400
You come out in this?

517
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,880
So what?

518
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
The important thing is not to be discovered, correct?

519
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,430
Do I look handsome in it.

520
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,110
Hello, Shadi, where are you?

521
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,400
I'm on my way.

522
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,190
I'll be there in a minute.

523
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,520
I'll hang up first, bye.

524
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,310
Hang up so fast.

525
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,880
Is Zhou Siyue here or not?

526
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,830
I don't know. I already told him.

527
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,920
Zhou Siyue

528
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,680
What are you doing?

529
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,070
If I don't do this,

530
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,190
I'm afraid he would see me.

531
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,430
Why are you here?

532
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,160
I come to the concert.

533
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,470
They went in.

534
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,800
How did you ask Zhou Siyue out?

535
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,040
It's very simple. I said Ding Xian would go too,

536
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,190
and then here he is. I'm great, right?

537
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,640
Done, mission completed.

538
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,760
Retreat

539
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,680
Wait.

540
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,760
My dad gave me four tickets.

541
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,040
Thanks, dad.

542
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,880
You're welcome.

543
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,880
Let's go.

544
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,590
You're shoving me.

545
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,190
What's up?

546
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,920
Nothing serious. I just sprained my ankle.

547
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,000
Take a sit

548
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,800
Let me have a look.

549
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,280
This foot?

550
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,520
It's okay. I just need a break.

551
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,040
I felt that

552
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,920
you don't like talking.

553
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,430
I was born this way.

554
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,710
I don't know how to refuse

555
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,800
I dare not ask favors.

556
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,590
worrying too much most of the time

557
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,880
Even with words on the tip of my tongue,

558
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,430
I swallowed it

559
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,760
You don't have to worry.

560
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,400
We're friends.

561
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,040
Friends

562
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,040
should help

563
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,190
each other.

564
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,760
But I always give you trouble.

565
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,680
No one in this world

566
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,520
can do everything perfectly.

567
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,830
What's more,

568
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,590
I don't feel being troubled at all.

569
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,920
Can you tell me

570
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,830
what happened to you now?

571
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,800
Actually,

572
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,840
The Aunt came to me some time ago.

573
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,320
said

574
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,870
someone reported that we got along too close.

575
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
He asked me to change my seat.

576
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,840
I promised him that

577
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,800
as long as the score of this monthly exam was improved,

578
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,150
I wouldn't have to change my seat.

579
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,870
But

580
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,600
I didn't do well in the exam.

581
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,190
Just because of this petty thing,

582
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,429
you concocted excuses and lied to me?

583
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,710
No.

584
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,120
The Aunt said that every time something happened to me,

585
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,000
you helped me.

586
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,000
I don't want to get you into trouble

587
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,909
because of my own businesses anymore.

588
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,040
Luckily, you're not mad at me.

589
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,320
What?

590
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,389
It doesn't matter.

591
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,560
In short,

592
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,430
you just need to study hard in the future.

593
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,630
Leave the rest to me.

594
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,190
Starting from tomorrow,

595
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,320
I will tutor you alone.

596
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,470
I don't believe you can fail again in the exam.

597
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,000
What are you doing?

598
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,710
Look, how well I am disguised myself

599
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,150
Perfectly fit into environment

600
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,760
There is something wrong with me.

601
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,670
I can't believe I didn't hang out on weekends,

602
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,320
but accompany you here to wait for blackmailers

603
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,470
and endure the cold wind.

604
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,630
I'm leaving.

605
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,000
Bye.

606
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,470
You don't even try detaining me?

607
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,320
I think you're right.

608
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,870
You can leave now.

609
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,630
I'll wait here.

610
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,120
Nobody asked you out?

611
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,280
Who dares

612
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,630
Right, no one dares to ask you out.

613
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,520
You are smarter than me.

614
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,840
Otherwise, we both can't even catch a taxi.

615
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,360
Of course.

616
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,080
I consulted today's fortune before departure.

617
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,670
It says I'd better walk today

618
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,600
and fortune awaits

619
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,950
It's all a coincidence.

620
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,950
It also says that I'll have a fatal disaster.

621
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,190
But this week is coming to an end,

622
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,390
and I am still fine.

623
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,000
No one shows up for so long.

624
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,840
Is your bro countable?

625
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,560
Or...

626
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,390
What are you doing?

627
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,520
There are people here.

628
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,710
Does it cool down at night?

629
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,760
I'm so cold.

630
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,390
Here they come.

631
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,040
Let me give you some warmth?

632
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,630
What are you doing? You're so cheesy.

633
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,710
Where to go?

634
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,520
Go to the bathroom.

635
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,120
Don't follow me, psycho.

636
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,870
Rogue.

637
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,600
He's also very lecherous.

638
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,630
You stay here.

639
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,760
I'll go meet him.

640
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,630
If anything bad happens, call the police immediately.

641
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,040
Psycho?

642
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,150
I'm a psycho?

643
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,840
I think I look handsome in this coat.

644
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,520
Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School

645
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,390
You really don't need me to carry you?

646
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,870
My sprain has recovered a lot.

647
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,360
Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School

648
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,710
I must give you a piece of my mind.

649
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,080
The voice sounds so familiar.

650
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,560
It seems to be Jiang Chen's voice.

651
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,950
Wait here for a minute.

652
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,190
Let me take a look.

653
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,280
There you are.

654
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,360
He is Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School.

655
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,910
I must beat him up.

656
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:00,950
Don't hit me.

657
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,280
You're Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School.

658
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,000
What are you doing?

659
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,470
He is Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School. Hit him.

660
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,390
He is Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School?

661
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,870
Hit him.

662
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,320
Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School

663
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,710
Hit him.

664
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,910
Kong Shadi

665
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,600
He also knows my name is Kong Shadi?

666
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Hit him.

667
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,280
Kong Shadi

668
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,870
You're stupid. It's me.

669
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,760
Kong Shadi

670
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,430
No.

671
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,840
Wait.

672
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,470
Why does his voice sound so familiar to me?

673
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,910
Who?

674
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,560
It turns out that I had fatal disaster.

675
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Jiang Chen is to blame

676
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,080
for this today.

677
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,870
He told me about Evil Dragon when I came over.

678
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,670
You apologize to him.

679
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,840
Please have some food.

680
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,870
Don't touch me.

681
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,390
Don't touch me.

682
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,670
Are you a sore loser?

683
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,800
Let me beat you up?

684
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,910
All right.

685
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,190
I admit that

686
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,280
we both did something wrong today.

687
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,840
All right. Just cry.

688
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,470
Everything will be fine after you cry.

689
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,230
Here you are.

690
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,120
This works very well.

691
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,430
Ding Xian

692
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,520
It's OK if they are both bad.

693
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,670
Even you've gone bad.

694
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,080
I just got hurt too.

695
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,800
Can you compare your injury with my injury?

696
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,190
I suffered both mental and physical injuries.

697
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,430
I didn't cry either.

698
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,390
Enough.

699
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm in pain.

700
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,000
Shut up.

701
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,080
Let go of me.

702
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,040
I have no money.

703
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,520
It sounds like my brother's voice.

704
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,870
Let go of me.

705
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,630
It's really my brother's voice.

706
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,950
Just wait here.

707
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,600
Hurry up.

708
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,230
Give me the money.

709
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,950
You are Evil Dragon in Shen Hai High School?

710
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,600
Who are you?

711
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
It's all misunderstanding.

712
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,870
Misunderstanding?

713
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,320
Look at my face.

714
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,840
It's all because of you.

715
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,320
How dare you cry.

716
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,520
You don't even know to tell me about the blackmail?

717
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,120
Are you stupid?

718
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,910
I was going to tell you then.

719
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,190
But you were particularly aggressive that day.

720
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,950
It's your usual misbehavior to blame.

721
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,080
You either squander pocket money

722
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,390
or you love to talk back.

723
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,840
So I...

724
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,080
So it doesn't matter if I say it or not.

725
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,190
Your brother is just like you.

726
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,190
Brother

727
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,560
I know you're with my sister.

728
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,190
You're not with your sister?

729
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,280
No.

730
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,360
She especially hates me.

731
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,840
She's always mean to me.

732
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,000
How can she do this to you?

733
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,470
I'm right, right?

734
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,520
Look,

735
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,280
your sister sprained her ankle,

736
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,470
but she insisted on looking for you.

737
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,630
After she found you,

738
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,230
she tried to beat you angrily.

739
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,560
Fortunately, I stopped her.

740
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,470
She can't be so aggressive.

741
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You don't even know my sister.

742
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,560
We're almost home. Please walk quickly.

743
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,520
You can go home if you want to.

744
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:08,950
Goodbye.

745
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,320
Take your time.

746
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,470
Your brother

747
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,080
is fine.

748
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:27,910
So I...

749
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,760
Goodbye.

750
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,470
Just give me a second.

751
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,000
What is it?

752
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,320
My present to you.

753
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,670
-Painting tools.  -Painting tools.

754
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,600
Painting tools?

755
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,800
You're welcome.

756
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,320
So

757
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,000
this's why you came to Yang Chunzi last time?

758
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,600
She has family members abroad.

759
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,560
So I asked her to book one for me.

760
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
What's the matter?

761
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,280
It seems I misunderstood you.

762
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,120
Misunderstood?

763
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
For what?

764
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,150
You remain silent again.

765
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,150
All right.

766
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,390
I'm going home.

767
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,120
Thank you.
