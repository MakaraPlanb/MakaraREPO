Our Secret
EP05

2
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,720
What are you doing up so lateï¼Ÿ

3
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm going to sleep.

4
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,630
Come on.

5
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,160
Someone says

6
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,670
the people who accompany you

7
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,670
through the zero point into the new year

8
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,880
will be by your side

9
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,000
in the coming year.

10
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,630
I hope whoever says that

11
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,360
doesn't lie to me.

12
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,270
They're selling Kongming lanterns.

13
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,240
Come on.

14
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,190
How do you find this place?

15
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
When I was young,

16
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
my mom used to bring me here.

17
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,910
You are so happy.

18
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,470
Xianxian, let's write this.

19
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,960
Come on.

20
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,960
Let's do it.

21
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
You go there to write.

22
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,750
You're too naive.

23
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,750
Let me take a look.

24
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,160
No, go away.

25
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,110
You are so stingy.

26
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,160
Let's write it.

27
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,159
What do you wish for?

28
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,159
I wish

29
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,390
I wouldn't be your deskmate next semester.

30
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,510
If I'm your deskmate

31
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,950
next semester,

32
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,070
your Kongming lantern won't work.

33
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,270
I wish really hard, and I'll get what I want.

34
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,200
Xianxian, don't talk to him.

35
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,790
Go away.

36
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
Come on.

37
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,550
Three, two, one...

38
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,880
I hope I still can be

39
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
Zhou Siyue's deskmate.

40
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,159
I hope I still can be

41
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
Ding Xian's deskmate.

42
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,950
What are you humming?

43
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,200
That's terrible.

44
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,110
You don't understand.

45
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,040
It's called B-Box.

46
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,320
Few people can do it.

47
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,440
I've been practicing for so long.

48
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,110
I won't do it if you don't want to listen.

49
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,200
I don't care.

50
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,950
I don't want to hear it.

51
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,440
I've always wanted to change a deskmate.

52
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,480
Really?

53
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,510
That's too bad.

54
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,790
I made a wish

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,640
to still be your deskmate.

56
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,880
Really?

57
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,440
I'm kidding you.

58
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,920
You are getting on my nerves.

59
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,830
I'll never speak to you again.

60
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,390
No, no, no.

61
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,159
My wish is to have a new game console.

62
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,230
But the wish to be your deskmate

63
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,320
is true.

64
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,670
Don't be angry anymore.

65
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,110
You're so stupid.

66
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,790
I've told you my wish.

67
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,510
Can you tell me your wish?

68
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,040
I won't tell you.

69
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
Xianxian

70
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,160
Are you OK?

71
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,000
You can ask the teacher for a leave.

72
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm in the examination room now.

73
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,320
I should have listened to my mother

74
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,320
and wear more.

75
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,790
I have already told you.

76
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,040
I'm done this time.

77
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,510
It's okay. Just do your best.

78
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,830
Choose A for the sixth question.

79
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,200
I got it wrong. English exam is over.

80
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,400
We're free.

81
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,350
I'm screwed.

82
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,669
Almost as I estimated.

83
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,110
Are you sure you made all the right choices?

84
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
Look who your deskmate is.

85
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,880
I'm over.

86
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,760
I have to spend my vacation in tutoring class.

87
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,080
Me too.

88
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,790
If we change seats next semester,

89
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm gonna sit in the last row.

90
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,150
You're already in the second to last row.

91
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,440
That's different.

92
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,440
If we change seats next semester...

93
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,440
We're gonna have to change seats next semester.

94
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,470
Don't think about this mess.

95
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,440
Go home and have a rest.

96
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,880
Don't burn your brain

97
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,350
before next semester begins.

98
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,960
Let's go.

99
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,670
That's a good thing.

100
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,640
I don't have to take the test.

101
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's go.

102
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Ding Xian

103
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Siyue comes to deliver your homework.

104
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Come here, Siyue.

105
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,440
Sorry, Siyue.

106
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,760
It's okay, auntie.

107
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm just dropping off her homework.

108
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,230
She was ill and missed the homecoming day.

109
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,030
I'll tell her.

110
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,400
Thank you for

111
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,470
coming here in person.

112
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,350
It doesn't matter.

113
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,670
You can have a talk.

114
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200
OK.

115
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,470
Your photos

116
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
look very unique.

117
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,640
You enter my room privately.

118
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't care about it.

119
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,590
Don't look around.

120
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,590
Come on, you're not well yet.

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,080
Have a rest.

122
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,150
Sit down please.

123
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,520
Don't look around.

124
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,590
I told you not to look around.

125
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,790
You...

126
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,520
Is there anything

127
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,280
you can't tell my mom?

128
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,840
You have to come into my room.

129
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,110
Of course.

130
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,280
Then I'll tell your mother.

131
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,320
I'll give this report card directly

132
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,790
to your mother.

133
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,910
No, no.

134
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,640
Let me see

135
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,550
the report card first.

136
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,910
Your report card,

137
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,400
homework,

138
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,640
and notes.

139
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
They're all here.

140
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,440
It's all right.

141
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,080
It's not as bad as you think.

142
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,200
It's good to get this result

143
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,840
with illness.

144
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,760
Do you want to know how many points I got?

145
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,880
Forget it.

146
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
Don't stimulate me

147
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,150
with your performance.

148
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,710
Well, I won't tell you.

149
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,840
Anyway, you should take care of your illness first.

150
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,350
If I have nothing to do

151
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,400
this holiday,

152
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,880
I'll come and make up a missed lesson for you.

153
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,910
Your math is not good enough.

154
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,150
I'm going back to my hometown

155
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,150
this Spring Festival.

156
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,350
I didn't know about it until a few days ago.

157
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,280
This is my phone number.

158
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,470
If you have any problems that you can't understand,

159
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
you can call me.

160
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,470
I'm leaving.

161
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,590
Thank you.

162
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,150
See you next semester,

163
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,590
my deskmate.

164
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,470
See you.

165
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
My deskmate...

166
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,080
I'm back.

167
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,350
You're back.

168
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,000
You have already started to decorate.

169
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,440
Let me help you.

170
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,910
OK.

171
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
Pack some red envelopes.

172
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,880
Look.

173
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,960
This year is cold and cheerless again.

174
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,000
Your father has to come back on Chinese New Year's Eve.

175
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,320
He is always busy

176
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,350
every year.

177
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,550
There are so many exhibitions.

178
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,000
How could he be so busy?

179
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,110
I think it's good.

180
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,440
You like to be cold and cheerless

181
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
instead of excitement.

182
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,670
You're right.

183
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,790
But I'm getting old.

184
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,960
It is inevitable to be lonely when the house is cold and cheerless.

185
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,840
Now

186
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,150
I miss the past.

187
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,520
It's lively for a large family

188
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,880
to celebrate the New Year together.

189
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,910
By the way,

190
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,550
a few days ago,

191
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,790
I heard that it seems that Uncle Ding and his family

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,640
are going back to their hometown for the New Year.

193
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,670
Yeah. Xianxian's mother told me

194
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,200
when I met her.

195
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,350
What's the matter?

196
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,590
Do you know the telephone number of their hometown?

197
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,640
Ding Xian doesn't have a cell phone.

198
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,320
If I find her, I can only call her parents.

199
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,470
It's quite troublesome.

200
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,960
You usually don't bother to say one more word to others.

201
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,400
What do you want to

202
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,520
talk to her alone?

203
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,320
No.

204
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,150
No, it's not me.

205
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,880
It's Kong Shadi.

206
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,150
They girls

207
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,000
like talking on the phone.

208
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,760
So she asks me to inquire.

209
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,470
I'm not looking for her.

210
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
You buy so many flowers.

211
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,640
This orange is good.

212
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,320
But it seems better to put it here.

213
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,200
Right?

214
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,470
Leave it there.

215
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,640
I'll ask about it for you later.

216
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,400
It's really not asked by me.

217
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,110
Xianxian

218
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,910
Can you help Su put up the couplets?

219
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,520
Pick up the vegetables for me later.

220
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,200
OK.

221
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm coming.

222
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,470
OK, just in time.

223
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,320
Let me see if you have grown taller this year.

224
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,880
Aren't you embarrassing me?

225
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,640
How could I touch it?

226
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,640
It's not that difficult.

227
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,310
You are tall. Of course you can touch it.

228
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,470
Okay, you're right.

229
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,520
Come on. You paste the Fu character.

230
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,680
I'll watch it for you.

231
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,710
A little bit down.

232
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,950
A little more to the right. Okay.

233
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,710
Good.

234
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,000
It's OK, Xianxian.

235
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,710
By the way, Xianxian,

236
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,350
I haven't had time to ask you.

237
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,190
How was your first semester?

238
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,560
Have you been overwhelmed by Shen Hai High School?

239
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,800
Of course not.

240
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,070
But

241
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,470
I'm a little worried.

242
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,640
I didn't do well in the final exam.

243
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,470
It's a bit uncomfortable

244
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,880
to think of changing the deskmate.

245
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,760
Your seats are arranged according to your academic performance.

246
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,280
Do you feel the pressure?

247
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,880
I actually expected it all.

248
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,400
I can't keep up with other classmates.

249
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,710
Unlike my deskmate,

250
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,560
he is the champion of National Olympiad Mathematics.

251
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,280
He can do everything easily.

252
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,880
You can't think so.

253
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,230
Many people work hard secretly

254
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,400
in places you can't see.

255
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,950
He didn't work hard secretly.

256
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,590
He plays basketball and games.

257
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,110
None of them are left behind.

258
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,470
But he still learns everything very well.

259
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,280
Why do you always mention your deskmate?

260
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,560
Am I?

261
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,110
Yes.

262
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,710
No.

263
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,350
We are all classmates.

264
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Are you two just classmates?

265
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,070
Okay, I'm not kidding you.

266
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,000
Let's go out and set off firecrackers later.

267
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,110
Today...

268
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,280
Forget it.

269
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,430
I remember you loved setting off firecrackers

270
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,160
when you were young.

271
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
I think

272
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,950
it's also good to spend the New Year at home.

273
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,110
Why don't you take my brother?

274
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,710
Ding Xian,

275
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
still not ready yet?

276
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,560
It's done.

277
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,280
Ding Juncong

278
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,800
Put down what you're holding.

279
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,880
Who allows you to eat?

280
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,190
Thank you, Su.

281
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Coming, aunt.

282
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,110
Why do you always mention your deskmate?

283
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,310
Zhou Zongtang

284
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,710
You finally come back.

285
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,400
You're still reading your books.

286
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,760
Can't you spend a year happily

287
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,430
with us?

288
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,000
I've always been reluctant to join in this kind of thing.

289
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,640
You know it.

290
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,760
I don't see you a few times a year.

291
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,520
You still feel you're right.

292
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,430
I've told you so many times.

293
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,110
You two move to Jiangling with me.

294
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,280
Wouldn't it be better?

295
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,310
I'm not going.

296
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,160
I'm fine here.

297
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,880
Why do I have to move to Jiangling?

298
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,710
Why don't you move back?

299
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,470
Our son says that

300
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,230
he doesn't mind where to stay.

301
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,350
You just want to stay here.

302
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,590
I'm not moving.

303
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,760
During the summer vacation, you tell me

304
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,920
anywhere is okay.

305
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,950
I changed my mind.

306
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,160
Shen Hai High School is quite good.

307
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,880
Come on.

308
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,710
Our son and I,

309
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,430
we both like Shen Hai High School.

310
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,640
You are the only one who likes Jiangling.

311
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,040
Come on, my son.

312
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,680
Okay, you two are right.

313
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,830
It's Chinese New Year today. Don't be so serious.

314
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,040
Add another dish.

315
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,950
Come on, come on.

316
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,190
Welcome the bright spring

317
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,000
of the new year together.

318
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,000
Countdown ten,

319
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,560
nine, eight, seven,

320
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,400
six, five, four,

321
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,830
three, two, one.

322
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,230
Xianxian

323
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,160
hello

324
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,880
hello

325
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,680
Happy New Year!

326
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,950
Happy New Year!

327
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,760
By the way,

328
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,230
how did you do in that exam?

329
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,230
Now you want to know.

330
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,800
But I won't tell you.

331
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,590
Forget it.

332
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Anyway,

333
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,800
I'll know when school starts.

334
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,400
OK, you'll know when school starts.

335
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,000
All right, go to rest.

336
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,310
I'll hang up.

337
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,800
See you, my deskmate.

338
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,160
See you at school.

339
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,950
Eat more, Ding Juncong

340
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,470
Come on, my granddaughter.

341
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,520
Grandma, happy New Year!

342
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,350
Happy New Year!

343
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,280
Come on, let's have a toast.

344
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,430
Let's have a toast. Come on.

345
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,470
Let's have a toast.

346
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,190
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

347
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,470
Everything goes well!

348
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,950
Don't need to look.

349
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,310
The seat has not changed.

350
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,590
You don't believe me.

351
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,950
It hasn't changed.

352
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,920
It really hasn't changed.

353
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,400
You're so procrastinating.

354
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,710
Why are you still my deskmate?

355
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,800
It hurts me when you say that.

356
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,560
When I said I didn't want to change my deskmate,

357
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,830
I'm very sincere.

358
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,710
If I had known my mouth was so useful,

359
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,280
I should say I wanted to sit with Yang Chunzi.

360
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,430
You don't deserve it.

361
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,640
Yes, you're right.

362
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,400
So I sit next to you.

363
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,590
So you mean I don't deserve it, right?

364
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,350
No, no, no.

365
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,230
I'm following your words.

366
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,310
I have a good heart to take you in.

367
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,680
Yes, yes, yes.

368
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,280
I overstepped my authority.

369
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,350
You are a fairy who descends to earth.

370
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,800
You are the princess who comes to the south of the Yangtze River.

371
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,310
As a pleb,

372
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,710
I should greet you.

373
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,640
That sounds good.

374
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
What's up?

375
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,160
I told you

376
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,560
we can still be deskmates.

377
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,430
Really?

378
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,950
Your score is almost the same as mine.

379
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,830
You didn't mean to fail the exam, did you?

380
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,430
It's not right.

381
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,230
How do I get your score...

382
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,560
I can know your score

383
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,830
without thinking.

384
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,880
You really failed the exam for me.

385
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
What?

386
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,800
What for you?

387
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,310
I promised you to be your deskmate.

388
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,040
I definitely have to keep my word.

389
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,560
I did fairly well

390
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,190
in the math test.

391
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Let me treat you this weekend.

392
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,400
I'll see if I have time.

393
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
That's too much.

394
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,950
I have to thank you deeply.

395
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,310
You've been tutoring me with my lessons wherever you are.

396
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,920
It makes my head bigger.

397
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,230
You still have some conscience.

398
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,310
It's okay

399
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,830
to have a good meal, right?

400
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,760
After all, today is my birthday.

401
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,070
Happy birthday!

402
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
Thank you.

403
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,920
What birthday gift do you want?

404
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,950
Have you finished eating?

405
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,800
Go. Take you to a place.

406
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,110
Where to go?

407
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,400
Why do you bring me here?

408
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,800
Give me a second.

409
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,160
Mr. Liu

410
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,160
Siyue

411
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,470
Long time no see.

412
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,400
Long time no see.

413
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,590
How is your father recently?

414
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,830
He's still the same.

415
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,800
By the way, Mr. Liu,

416
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,280
could you please do me a favor?

417
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,640
Tell me.

418
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,310
Why you bring me here?

419
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,350
Wait a minute.

420
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,880
So mysterious.

421
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,230
Zhou Siyue

422
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,920
Why do you want to be my deskmate?

423
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,920
Come on, compliment me.

424
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,190
Because you're stupid.

425
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,430
Play by yourself.

426
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,400
I'm going home.

427
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
All I can say is that

428
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,760
there is no pressure to be your deskmate.

429
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,640
You don't care how many marks I get.

430
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,040
You won't ask me

431
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,470
how late I learn at night.

432
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You won't tell me

433
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
I'm wasting my time

434
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,430
in those competitions.

435
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,950
You don't care about me,

436
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,070
so I feel very relaxed.

437
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,470
I thought you're not afraid of anything.

438
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm not afraid.

439
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,000
I just feel annoyed.

440
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,830
All right.

441
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,800
Stand there.

442
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,110
There?

443
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,160
Stand in the middle.

444
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
This is...

445
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,000
The nebula map on your birthday.

446
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,160
On my birthday?

447
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,400
It's your universe.

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,880
What about yours?

449
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,520
Do you want to see it?

450
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,710
Wait a minute.

451
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,430
How beautiful!

452
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,190
I really want to have a star

453
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,000
that never fades.

454
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,110
You dare to think about this.

455
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,590
No star

456
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,590
will never fade.

457
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,160
They are all a flash in the pan in the universe.

458
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,560
But just like the universe,

459
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,760
in everyone's life,

460
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,880
there will be many stars.

461
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,400
Although they look ordinary,

462
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,400
after they took tens of millions of light years

463
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,920
to form a unique nebula,

464
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,920
everything will make sense.

465
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,110
Happy birthday, Xianxian.

466
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,640
This gift is a little late.

467
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,760
Do you mind?

468
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,880
Of course not.

469
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,830
Thank you.

470
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,950
Open it and have a look.

471
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,520
I have an identical one.

472
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,110
We can use the same style in the future.

473
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,880
No, this is too expensive.

474
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,830
I can't accept it.

475
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,880
Not expensive.

476
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,160
Besides,

477
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,920
don't you want to use the same style with me?

478
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,070
It's really...

479
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,520
Just take it.

480
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,310
Just take it. It's all right.

481
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,070
Open it and have a look.

482
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,640
Thank you, Shadi.

483
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That's very kind of you.

484
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,160
Let's go and beat down those in Class 1.

485
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
It relies on your performance.

486
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,800
Of course.

487
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,830
Stop.

488
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,520
We are on duty today.

489
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
You're not forgetting, are you?

490
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,880
What should we do?

491
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,710
We made an appointment to play at 5:30.

492
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,830
Let them wait.

493
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,560
You're funny.

494
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,000
They will say we don't have the spirit of contract.

495
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,880
I am called Kobe of Shen Hai High School.

496
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,280
You don't care but I care.

497
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,470
Then you can go by yourself.

498
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,070
Bro, how can I play by myself?

499
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,710
I'll help you on duty.

500
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,070
Then it's decided so happily.

501
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,430
Ding Xian, you're cool.

502
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,560
Does she say that she helps you?

503
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,920
She helps Zhou Siyue on duty.

504
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,230
My dear deskmate,

505
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,710
just help me this time.

506
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,190
I'll treat you when I get back.

507
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,830
I'll help when you are on duty from now on.

508
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,830
OK?

509
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,070
It's OK.

510
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,590
But you have to help me do all the duty this semester.

511
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,760
OK.

512
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,110
I will.

513
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,070
Go ahead.

514
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay, go ahead.

515
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Xianxian, you are too kind.

516
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,280
You shouldn't spoil men.

517
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,120
All right, let's do the duty.

518
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,600
He just took you to a planetarium.

519
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,909
I think the planetarium is quite good.

520
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,389
It's quite romantic.

521
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,320
That's boring.

522
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,000
By the way, Shadi,

523
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,670
I drew a picture for Zhou Siyue.

524
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,870
Can you help me see if the painting is good?

525
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,760
OK.

526
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,469
You take a look.

527
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,469
I know you draw quite well.

528
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,800
But I don't expect it to be so beautiful.

529
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,949
Really?

530
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,670
It's so pretty.

531
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,150
Hello, are you Ding Xian?

532
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,910
What's the matter?

533
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,080
Can you do me a favor?

534
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,950
What?

535
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,630
Give this to Zhou Siyue for me.

536
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,560
I'll leave it to you.

537
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,120
I'll invite you to dinner.

538
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,600
Thanks.

539
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,360
You're stupid.

540
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,390
Why don't you just refuse her?

541
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,560
To Zhou Siyue...

542
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
She's so direct.

543
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,150
Does Zhou Siyue know her?

544
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,600
What should I do now?

545
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,000
Don't worry.

546
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,710
Why don't you just tear it up?

547
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,360
How can you tear other people's letters?

548
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,080
Why can't?

549
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,150
You dare not tear it. I'll tear it for you.

550
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,470
Kong Shadi, what are you doing?

551
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,520
What do I do? Why are you yelling at me?

552
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,670
How can you tear other people's letter?

553
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,670
How can I tell Zhou Siyue?

554
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,150
You still want to talk to him.

555
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,910
We don't tell him.

556
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,080
Will he know?

557
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,390
I'm doing this for you.

558
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,560
Besides, do you know who she is?

559
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,000
You Keke

560
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,600
A famous girl in our school.

561
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,430
She always plays with boys.

562
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,190
And if you give this letter to Zhou Siyue,

563
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,630
there will be one more girl around him.

564
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Don't you care?

565
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,040
That's his own business.

566
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,230
OK.

567
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,630
I stop you from being silly.

568
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,910
You also yell at me.

569
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,430
Ding Xian, you really have no conscience.

570
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,040
Whether I'm stupid or not,

571
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,950
tearing up other people's letter

572
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,710
is immoral.

573
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,470
Immoral?

574
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,630
Others can't see it.

575
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,040
But I can see it.

576
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,000
I did what you wanted to do most

577
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,390
in your heart,

578
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,120
didn't I?

579
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
You still don't admit it.

580
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,910
Let's go home. Finished cleaning?

581
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm leaving.

582
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,560
Won't you wait for them?

583
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,670
You can wait if you like.

584
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,190
Then I'll go. Bye.

585
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,870
What's wrong with her?

586
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,470
What's up?

587
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Zhou Siyue

588
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,840
Let's go separately in the future.

589
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,120
What's the matter?

590
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,360
You get angry when you're on duty.

591
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,470
I'm afraid others will think we're too close.

592
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,390
This would create a bad impression.

593
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,950
OK.

594
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,390
Others can't see it.

595
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,710
But I can see it.

596
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,080
I did what you wanted to do most

597
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,320
in your heart.

598
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,040
You still don't admit it.

599
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,230
Did I deny it?

600
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,760
I just think

601
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,190
people around him

602
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,670
are all better than me.

603
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,600
This really tastes bad.

604
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,190
What do I say?

605
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,080
I say you don't know if it tastes good.

606
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,230
You should buy less. You're wasting money.

607
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,520
I have to buy it to eat

608
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,190
before I know if it tastes good.

609
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,630
How can I know if I don't try?

610
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,670
False reasoning.

611
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,630
Little Monster,

612
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,710
do you have breakfast?

613
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,230
You can judge it.

614
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,360
Do you think this thing is delicious

615
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,910
or not?  Give it to me.

616
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,040
What's wrong with you two?

617
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,120
What is this?

618
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,230
Let me have a look.

619
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,840
That's cool.

620
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,000
Someone confessed to you so soon?

621
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Let me take another look.

622
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,430
Stop.

623
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,040
There is a problem.

624
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,320
You used to throw away such things

625
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,800
at a glance.

626
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,600
Why are you hiding this time?

627
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,190
There is different... Don't bother me.

628
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,910
You're so boring.

629
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
Do you know what I saw

630
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,840
in Zhou Siyue's drawer?

631
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,950
Why are you telling me?

632
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,000
Don't you have a good relationship with Ding Xian?

633
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
You should tell her.

634
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,320
Are you all taking the wrong medicine today?

635
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,950
Deng Wanwan

636
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,560
Let's have lunch together.

637
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,230
OK.

638
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,870
I heard that there is braised pork in the second canteen today.

639
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,120
Hurry up.

640
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,150
It's sold out in a while.

641
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,230
OK, let's go.

642
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,430
Did you two quarrel?

643
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,760
It doesn't matter.

644
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,670
I have quarreled with her many times.

645
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,320
I know her.

646
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,280
She is like this.

647
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,600
She'll come back to you

648
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,950
when she's relieved of her anger.

649
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,760
Really?

650
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,390
Yes.

651
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,120
Thank you.

652
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,870
It's all right.

653
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,430
Let's have lunch.

654
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,430
Will you go?

655
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,390
You can go first.

656
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,230
I haven't finished my notes yet.

657
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,190
Let's go.

658
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,840
All right, class.

659
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,600
Let's do another physical fitness test.

660
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,360
Boys and girls all do sit-ups.

661
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,230
Team up freely in pairs.

662
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,320
Count for each other, okay?

663
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,840
Come on.

664
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You can find your partner

665
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,950
and gather over there.

666
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,190
Wanwan, let's go together.

667
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,120
OK.

668
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,630
Liu Xiaofeng, let's team up.

669
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,870
OK. Let's go.

670
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,080
What are you doing? Hurry up.

671
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,150
Go to play basketball after we're done.

672
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,120
OK.

673
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,150
Ding Xian, come on.

674
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,840
Come on, Ding Xian.
