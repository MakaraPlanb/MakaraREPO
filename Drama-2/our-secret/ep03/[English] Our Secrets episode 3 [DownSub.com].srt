Our Secret
EP03

2
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,680
Make her happy.

3
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,400
If you can make up, I'll concede you three points.

4
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,509
Little Monster, you're a big man.

5
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,630
Never mind.

7
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,040
Siyue, let's play basketball.

8
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,440
Move to the left a little.

9
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,030
You scared me.

10
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,320
Well, but you can change with yours.

11
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,630
Probably not gonna happen.

12
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,670
I'll think about it.

13
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,960
You're so nice, Little Monster.

14
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,080
You not only didn't get upset,
but give chocolate to me.

15
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,190
It's for Shadi.

16
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,440
Thanks, Ding Xian.

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,750
Here you are.

18
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,440
Little Princess,
give me a piece of it, will you?

19
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,270
Now you call me princess.

20
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,390
What were you doing before?

21
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,190
No.

22
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,270
We've been known for many years.

23
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,910
It's no big deal to
have a piece of chocolate.

24
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,910
No.

25
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,960
Haojie, have some chocolate.

26
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,720
Thanks, Shadi.

27
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,470
Little Monster, may I get one?

28
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,750
Sure.

29
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,829
Xianxian, here you are.

30
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,079
Xianxian, getting along with classmate

31
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,520
should be step by step.

32
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,800
As time goes by,

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you'll find everyone

34
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
can be so nice.

35
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,240
Here you are.

36
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,720
No snacks in classroom.

37
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,000
Really?

38
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,110
Why did I see you

39
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,520
eat Bugles the other day?

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,270
It's in Article 11 of the campus code.

41
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,750
Ding Xian, haven't you seen it?

42
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,790
Come on, who would?

43
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,269
That's right.

44
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,880
Besides,

45
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
even if you want to eat chocolate,

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,550
you can't eat this kind, either.

47
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
What I have at home

48
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,040
are all imported.

49
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,320
Siyue, if you want,

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
I'll bring you some tomorrow.

51
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,480
Why do you eat this?

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,350
I'm a little hypoglycemia.

53
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,159
I'll go back.

54
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,880
-Bye.  -Bye.

55
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,320
Siyue

56
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,270
Where's your bike?

57
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,880
-I didn't ride.  -Why?

58
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,830
Why so many questions?

59
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Wait, wait.

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,950
There's another one.

61
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,550
I found that

62
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,480
you've been noticing
Little Monster a little more lately.

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,790
We're classmates,

64
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,670
and both families knew each other.

65
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,200
So I take care of her,
what's the matter?

66
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,600
Nah.

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,790
Something is wrong.

68
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
There's a story.

69
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,600
You have something wrong.

70
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,480
Do you go to the game center on Saturday?

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,510
Xianxian

72
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,440
Do me a favor to pick up your brother

73
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,390
at the Hobby Group.

74
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,159
If you can't find him around here,

75
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,550
get him at the game center.

76
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,640
He must be there.

77
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,000
Game center again?

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,320
It's okay to
have a little fun on the weekend.

79
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,640
Hurry up.

80
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,480
How did I forget?

81
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,760
Hurry!

82
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,230
Ding Juncong, go home.

83
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,550
One more round.

84
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,350
One more?

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
You don't agree?

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,440
Then I'll tell mom

87
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,510
you hit me.

88
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,920
I hit you?

89
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,270
Ding Juncong

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,760
You've got something, right?

91
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,160
Hurt!

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,350
Help! She's gonna sell me!

93
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,230
I'm your sister!

94
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,200
Hurt! Let me go! Hurt!

95
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:29,950
Xianxian

96
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,830
Help!

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
Aren't you Little Pepper?

98
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,920
No, no, I'm kidding.

99
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Don't take it seriously.

100
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm getting the coins.

101
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,350
Move back on Monday.

102
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,110
I was planned to call you

103
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,159
to join us last night.

104
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,040
But I realized
I don't have your number.

105
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,640
Remember to give it to me next time.

106
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Ding Xian

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,790
Let's switch seats back on Monday.

108
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,830
I didn't mean to grab
your seat last time.

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,230
Don't get angry.

110
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,200
And Siyue told me about it.

111
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,350
About what?

112
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,440
He said you have a poor foundation.

113
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,350
If you sit at the back of the classroom,

114
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,070
he can help you with your homework.

115
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
And he said I should be responsible

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,270
as the class leader.

117
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Then that's it.

118
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,720
We switch back on Monday.

119
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
I'll get you guys something to eat.

120
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,040
Coins ready.

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,720
Let's go challenge.

122
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
What are you doing here?

123
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Go and play.

124
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,670
Who said I have a bad foundation?

125
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,920
It's up to you.

126
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,440
Whether you want to move back

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,110
or still be deskmate with He Xingwen.

128
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,040
You...

129
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,110
You're welcome.

130
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,070
Kid

131
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,070
Thanks, brother.

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,760
Let's go.

133
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,160
Hurry up.

134
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,950
Uncontested top dog.

135
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,070
Didn't you just win a few rounds,

136
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
what's the big deal.

137
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,480
Little Monster

138
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,950
Dance with me.

139
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,350
I don't dance with him.

140
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,830
Come on, I'll do with you.

141
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,640
I don't know how...

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
It's okay, come on.

143
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
I really don't know.

144
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,520
Come on!

145
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,350
Have a try.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,030
Try it.

147
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,789
Come on.

148
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,350
I really can't.

149
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,640
Take him down.

150
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,880
Song, you can't make it.

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't worry.

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,080
Awesome.

153
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,280
I'm not convinced.

154
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
One more round.

155
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
If you lose, you lose.

156
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,590
Big deal.

157
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,280
Let's go and catch doll.

158
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,710
Come on, let's go.

159
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
What?

160
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,840
That one is pretty.

161
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,150
The bunny is cute.

162
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,080
Nah, I prefer this pig.

163
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,350
I like that one.

164
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,280
Are you a girl?

165
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,470
It's really cute.

166
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,200
Come on, come on.

167
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
You play with her.

168
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,960
She is acting up today,

169
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,440
winning me all the time.

170
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Boring.

171
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,910
Are you scared?

172
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,710
What do you want to compete?

173
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,710
On what?

174
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,670
Here, catching dolls.

175
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,200
After you.

176
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,590
Which one do you want?

177
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,230
This one.

178
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,280
Awesome, Siyue.

179
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,640
Wanwan, which one?

180
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,080
This one.

181
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,520
OK.

182
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,320
Sorry, Wanwan.

183
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,280
Come on.

184
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,910
Which one do you want?

185
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,520
I'll do it myself.

186
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,910
Sister, you're not good at this.

187
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,520
Just let Brother Siyue catch it for you.

188
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,760
That's it today.

189
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,400
I'll take him home first.

190
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,710
Come on, let's go.

191
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,200
Gone?

192
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,080
We're back.

193
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,520
Ok.

194
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,230
Wash your hands for dinner.

195
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,880
How are you doing at school?

196
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Quite good.

197
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,960
Help your brother with his math

198
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,320
if you're free tonight.

199
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,840
Well, mom,

200
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,710
I want a phone.

201
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,470
My classmate asked
me for my phone number,

202
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,590
but I don't have one.

203
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,150
Not study hard at this age,

204
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,760
but contact for nothing.

205
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,350
A new one is expensive,

206
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,910
and I don't have money.

207
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,520
But you didn't oppose Ding Juncong

208
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,960
going to the game center.

209
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,400
He's kid. Why compare to him?

210
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,670
Just finish eating.

211
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,320
Mr. Liu

212
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,320
Siyue, why don't you go in?

213
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,520
Mr. Liu, I want to talk to
you about something.

214
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,670
Go ahead.

215
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,550
Can you switch Ding Xian back to be my deskmate?

216
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,080
Zhou Siyue

217
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,880
You're only a freshman in high school.

218
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,440
You should still focus on your studies.

219
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,760
I know.

220
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,840
Then tell me

221
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,670
why you want to be
deskmate with Ding Xian?

222
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,790
Morning, Ding Xian.

223
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,910
Morning, is there still
a free breakfast today?

224
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,710
Nah.

225
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,790
Alright.

226
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,520
Switch seats.

227
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,200
You're moving back?

228
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,710
So many books.
Let me help you with that.

229
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,470
Okay.

230
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,350
I found

231
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,710
Liu Xiaofeng had some thoughts.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
You're the only one in the class who has some thoughts.

233
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,470
It's not fair to say that. We're similar.

234
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,760
Didn't you help Little Monster
change seats?

235
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,520
How did you do that?

236
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,790
It goes like this.

237
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,400
Mr. Ding answered questions for me before.

238
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,230
And Ding Xian has few friends

239
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,670
in our class.

240
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,910
I help her

241
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,880
for repaying Mr. Ding.

242
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,350
Repaying Mr. Ding?

243
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,030
Do you think I'll buy that?

244
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,590
Who are you still waiting?

245
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,670
-Mr. Ding  -Mr. Liu

246
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,880
Mr. Ding, morning.

247
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,960
Morning.

248
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,350
Siyue, those questions you asked a few days ago,

249
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
have you understood?

250
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I got them.

251
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,880
Siyue really worked hard.

252
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,230
It'll be good if Xianxian

253
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,350
can learn from you.

254
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,440
I was just talking about
this with Mr. Liu that

255
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,110
if Ding Xian can be

256
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,230
my deskmate again.

257
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,910
Ding Xian's liberal arts
performance is better

258
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,910
and she can help me.

259
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,000
That's good.

260
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,080
Then you two be deskmate

261
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,320
and learn from each other.

262
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,840
Great.

263
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Mr. Liu, sorry to bother you.

264
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,520
Yeah.

265
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,400
Thank you, thank you.

266
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,110
Well, for study.

267
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,350
Absolutely right.

268
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,030
-I'm leaving first.  -Okay.

269
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,790
Hurry to class.

270
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,760
Mr. Liu, thanks.

271
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,200
Never mind.

272
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,000
Xianxian

273
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,440
Wonderful.

274
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,150
See you.

275
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,150
You're back.

276
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,840
Xianxian, it's for you.

277
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,230
You got it!

278
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,840
It wasn't me.

279
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,790
It's your deskmate.
He let me give it to you.

280
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,230
Let's go for the class.

281
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,470
Go.

282
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,840
You're welcome, not a big deal.

283
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,230
Why?

284
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,840
Kong Shadi and others all have,

285
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,440
so I grab one for you.

286
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,790
You're so well considered,

287
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,320
such a considerate guy.

288
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,280
Give it back if you don't want it.

289
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,760
Why not?

290
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,790
Give it to me.

291
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Here.

292
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,320
I don't want an ugly
little dinosaur like that.

293
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,520
It's not, and besides,

294
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,080
it's an alligator.

295
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,030
It's a dinosaur.

296
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,440
It looks exactly like you.

297
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,000
No personal attacks.

298
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,069
A dinosaur.

299
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,920
An alligator.

300
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,000
Definitely a dinosaur.

301
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,680
Definitely an alligator.

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,640
Look,

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,560
baby dinosaur.

304
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,560
From now on,

305
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm your owner.

306
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,400
I say you're an alligator,

307
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,430
then you're an alligator.

308
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,040
You two are taking
so long. Class begins!

309
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,560
Coming.

310
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,280
Dear diary,

311
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,760
the bad high school life I thought

312
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,710
is getting better.

313
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,310
What a gap between people...

314
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,070
What're you looking at?

315
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,350
I was thinking

316
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,830
why people need to learn math.

317
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,640
Would we use the function

318
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,310
to figure the equation when shopping?

319
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
Maybe it's for

320
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,950
blowing the poor students like us.

321
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,710
Deskmate, the situation there is rather severe.

322
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,280
Never mind.

323
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,680
I'm a salted fish anyway,

324
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,350
no big goals.

325
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,710
And I never thought about going to a key university.

326
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,280
My goal

327
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,710
is to go to a university
in other province.

328
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,350
Other province?

329
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,800
I wanna go to Hangzhou.

330
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,880
Hangzhou

331
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
is good.

332
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
It's a beautiful city.

333
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,070
You've been there?

334
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,640
Have you ever seen the West Lake?

335
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
And the Leifeng Pagoda,

336
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,590
as well as Broken Bridge
besides the West Lake.

337
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,640
You watched Tale of the
White Snake too much.

338
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,000
Tale of the White Snake

339
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,640
You know, you could have asked me.

340
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,070
You don't even listen to the class.

341
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,310
Do you know what I said if I do?

342
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,230
I'm better than you
even I didn't listen.

343
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,520
Give me your test paper.

344
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,470
The most important thing in math
is the thought to figure it out.

345
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,000
Like this question,

346
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,190
we know that tan α is two.

347
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,190
So we can find out

348
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,880
Sin α is equal to twice cos α.

349
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,760
So substitute it into this formula,

350
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,160
we can figure out sin α times cos α

351
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,710
is equal to two fifth.

352
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,590
Why are you laughing?

353
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,070
Write it down.

354
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,160
So you didn't listen to me, did you?

355
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,070
Yes, I did.

356
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,070
So what did I say?

357
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,110
You said...

358
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,880
You really are a salted fish

359
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
and can remember nothing.

360
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,640
I don't know how you got in this school.

361
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,040
I know a really great guy.

362
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,110
It was him who encouraged me here.

363
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,640
Some senior

364
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,590
having lunch with you, right?

365
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,230
I didn't get good grades
when I was a kid.

366
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,280
Other kids

367
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,000
knew all 26 letters by heart so early.

368
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,830
I did it for a month.

369
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
Then I met Su Bocong.

370
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,680
He told me

371
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,400
there's nothing that others can do

372
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,590
but you can't.

373
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,470
If you can't,

374
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,000
that means you didn't work harder.

375
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,190
Believe it or not,

376
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,070
there is something in what he said.

377
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,040
Because of his words,

378
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,800
I know that a slow sparrow
should make an early start.

379
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,160
If it took others one hour,

380
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,400
then I would spend two hours on it.

381
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,400
So you stay up late to 2 or 3 a.m

382
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,070
every night,

383
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,880
and have no energy
in class during the day?

384
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,760
You think everyone is like you?

385
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,400
Just need to look at it once
and memorize them all?

386
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,470
The gap between individuals

387
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,040
is actually not wide.

388
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,470
The problems you met

389
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,560
are because of your method.

390
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,400
Look at your note.

391
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,070
Didn't I tell you

392
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,760
to write down the important
things when taking notes.

393
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,830
You wrote everything down here.

394
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,190
How can you recite all these?

395
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,190
I'll be surprised if you got a high score.

396
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,040
Then

397
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,310
please give me your
advice in the future.

398
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,310
It's up to you.

399
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,680
Please help me with this one again.

400
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,920
Dinner is ready!

401
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,950
Ding Xian, take out your note.

402
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,760
Xianxian, come for dinner.

403
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,560
Ding Xian

404
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,950
Why are you making fewer notes?

405
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,590
Do you not study hard?

406
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,520
Mom, it's called sticking to the point.

407
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
What point?

408
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,400
You're just slacking off.

409
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,590
I didn't.

410
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,040
Mom, the way how you think about learning

411
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,560
is out of date.

412
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,190
Exactly, making notes in this way

413
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,950
is really clearer.

414
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,560
Stop reading.

415
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,110
Dinner first.

416
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,920
That's what Zhou Siyue told me.

417
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,800
Then you need to learn from him.

418
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,680
So do I.

419
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,310
Dad, mom,

420
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,640
I was elected class leader.

421
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
Class leader?

422
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,590
It's good.

423
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,920
My son is great.

424
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,950
You're an honor to me.

425
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,760
I'll buy you snacks

426
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,430
later.

427
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,230
It seems that our class
will also elect class cadres.

428
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,280
Really?

429
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,710
So which position
do you want to run, Xianxian?

430
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,920
No idea.

431
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,430
Will it influence your study?

432
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,680
Nah.

433
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,640
You know what, Xianxian?

434
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,350
You're good at painting.

435
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,310
You're more than enough to be
a commissary of literature and art.

436
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,230
I think your painting

437
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,070
can represent the school
to take part in match.

438
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,160
Am I right?

439
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,880
My sister is a big coward.

440
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,190
She won't run for that.

441
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,070
Who said that?

442
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,040
You're a big coward.

443
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,160
You're a big coward.

444
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,040
Alright, alright.

445
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,040
Go for it, you have to.

446
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,520
If Xianxian makes it,

447
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,190
we'll have two cadres in our family.

448
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,760
Good.

449
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,680
Here, the breakfast.

450
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,800
When did you go to bed last night?

451
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,310
One o'clock.

452
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,110
You?

453
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,110
Three.

454
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,160
You worked so hard.

455
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
I didn't.

456
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,680
I was playing video games all night.

457
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,680
That's the way you are.

458
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,920
Can you walk a little faster?

459
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,310
Are you a snail?

460
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,560
My bag is too heavy.

461
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,160
Who let you put all

462
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,470
the teaching materials in it?

463
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
It's heavy, of course.

464
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Hurry.

465
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,070
We're at school, and I'll do it myself.

466
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,400
Hurry up.

467
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,430
Siyue

468
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,040
Long time no see.

469
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,230
You healed up?

470
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,760
Yeah, but...

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,430
I missed a lot on my study.

472
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,950
You can do it.

473
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,830
Thanks, see you later.

474
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,470
She's the girl

475
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,070
who asked for leave in our class?

476
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,880
Yang Chunzi

477
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,560
Siyue

478
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,760
Isn't she Yang Chunzi?

479
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,230
She got prettier than
she was in junior high school.

480
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,400
Why do I think Zhou Siyue and you

481
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,710
are a little different?

482
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,070
He even took bag for you.

483
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,880
No...

484
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,830
It's because my bag is too heavy.

485
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,710
I really want to be deskmate
with Yang Chunzi.

486
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,920
What did you say?

487
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,520
It hurt!

488
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,350
I said I really want to be
deskmate with you.

489
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,880
Is it?

490
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,040
Why did I hear that

491
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,310
you really want to be
deskmate with Yang Chunzi?

492
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,430
No, you must have imagined it.

493
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,040
How could it be?
You're way better than her.

494
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,350
No, no, no, hurt, hurt.

495
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,160
Still not telling the truth?

496
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,470
I will.

497
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,640
Yang Chunzi is

498
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,110
good at study and everyone likes her.

499
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,800
And she's pretty...

500
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,230
Nah...

501
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,760
Why are you pulling hard
when I'm telling the truth?

502
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
I just want to hear the truth.

503
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,040
Keep talking.

504
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,830
Let me go and listen to me.

505
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
That...

506
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Though everyone likes her,

507
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,880
it's not my business.

508
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,560
Well, you know,

509
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,830
in junior high school,

510
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,310
she was close to Siyue.

511
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
Right, Siyue?

512
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,760
Don't you remember?

513
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,190
In the middle school,

514
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,160
they made fun of you two
as a golden couple.

515
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,880
Boring.

516
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,830
Don't be mad.

517
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,830
What are you thinking?

518
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,590
Nothing.

519
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,640
Chunzi, here.

520
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,710
Show off.

521
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,110
Envy makes a girl ugly.

522
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,070
Really?

523
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,880
You're not jealous?

524
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,830
She's sitting next to Zhou Siyue.

525
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,680
Why do I care?

526
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,160
Well,

527
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,590
does everyone like

528
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,070
girls like her?

529
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,710
Maybe, probably.

530
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,520
But honestly,

531
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
I think you look much better
than she does if you dress up.

532
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,310
For sure.

533
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,430
You just

534
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,710
have a high forehead.

535
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,470
Why don't you try bangs?

536
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,040
What do you think?

537
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,070
I can't. My mom told me my fortune.

538
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,280
I can become an official
because of this forehead.

539
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,280
I can't get it covered.

540
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,280
Oh, no, you believe that?

541
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,520
Well, hurry to eat.

542
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,230
I have to run for the
election this afternoon.

543
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,830
Well, sounds like you're
going to sign up.

544
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,400
I wanna try.

545
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,830
Stand up.

546
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,040
Good afternoon, sir.

547
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,350
Sit down, please.

548
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,800
It's been a while since school was started.

549
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,640
You've all got used to

550
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,280
high school, haven't you?

551
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,710
Next,

552
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,070
there will be many activities at school

553
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,430
that need people to
organize and manage.

554
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,710
Our class

555
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,070
is going to elect cadres today.

556
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,680
First, the class leader.

557
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,470
It had been represented by Deng Wanwan.

558
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,070
Does anyone else want to sign up now?

559
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,400
Classmates

560
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,160
I've been a represented class leader

561
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,350
for a while.

562
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,400
And I've been doing
my best for everyone.

563
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,160
I hope you can elect me
an official class leader.

564
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,520
Thank you all.

565
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,040
Bravo.

566
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,520
Commissary in charge of studies

567
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,880
Zhou Siyue, how about you?

568
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,280
Pass me, sir.

569
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,830
Sorry about that.

570
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,470
Then He Xingwen, I name you.

571
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,470
I...

572
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,920
...Okay.

573
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,830
-Commissary in charge of sports  -Me.

574
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,800
Sit!

575
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,950
Can you let me do it?

576
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,710
No, there should be justice and equity.

577
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,160
You can borrow my
limited edition basketball.

578
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,640
I...

579
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
...trust you.

580
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,560
Be at ease, everyone.

581
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,190
I'll have fun with you in PE class.

582
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,160
Commissary in charge of arts

583
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,590
Does anyone want to sign up?

584
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,160
Ding Xian, commissary in charge of arts.

585
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,040
Go!

586
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,920
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

587
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm Yang Chunzi.

588
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,430
I like singing, dancing and drawing.

589
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,710
I used to be the
commissary in charge of arts

590
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,470
for three years in junior high school.

591
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,190
If I am elected this time,

592
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,430
I will be more strict with myself,

593
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,640
serving everyone with all my heart

594
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,830
and live up to everyone's expectations.

595
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,110
Great!

596
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,280
Good, Yang Chunzi.

597
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,430
Here are some forms,

598
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,430
hand them out after class.

599
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,710
Everybody needs to fill it out

600
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,830
the information

601
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,880
and specialties of yours.

602
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,430
Give it back to me
in the next two days, okay?

603
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,680
Next, commissary in charge of
physical labor.

604
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,590
Sir, I love to do manual labor
since childhood.

605
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
My specialty is doing labor.

606
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,520
Good, make good use of your strength.

607
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,640
Thanks sir.

608
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,520
Xiaofeng, have you finished?

609
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,710
Xianxian, why did you
cross out your specialty?

610
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,470
I saw your painting

611
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,310
was quite good the other day.

612
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,760
Mr. Marinated egg

613
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,560
Why does this look familiar to me?

614
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Ding Xian, your painting is so great.

615
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,830
But I also feel like it looks familiar.

616
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,430
Ding Xian, are you interested in

617
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,160
making blackboard newspaper
for our class with me?

618
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay.

619
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,190
Great.

620
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,920
The first theme of it is

621
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,920
National Day in autumn.

622
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,070
But it's due next week,

623
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
so please make it after school this week.

624
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,710
Okay.

625
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,400
-Have you done?  -Yeah.

626
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Siyue

627
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,830
Thanks.

628
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,710
See you.

629
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,280
Are you jealous

630
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,110
now?

631
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,040
Jealous?

632
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,110
About what?

633
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Nothing.

634
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,520
Nothing.

635
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,800
You are really going to
paint board with her?

636
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,110
Yeah, I said yes.

637
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,680
She is such a hypocrite.

638
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,760
If she bullies you,

639
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
just tell me.

640
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,520
I think she's good,

641
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
so sweet.

642
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,350
Hey, it's just manifestation.

643
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,590
Manifestation, you know?

644
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,310
If you had a haircut like her,

645
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,230
and speak like she does,

646
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,400
you're just like her.

647
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,000
Just like this now.

648
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,280
Kong Shadi

649
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,280
You're starting to sound like her.

650
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,600
Siyue, long time no see.

651
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,429
Do it.

652
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,949
No, I won't.

653
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,909
Siyue

654
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,670
You look good.

655
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,150
She wore perfume.

656
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,560
It's all your fault.

657
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,760
For sure.

658
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,520
Concede me three points today.

659
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,190
Nice try.

660
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,800
Or I'll help you make your
deskmate happy today,

661
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,840
and then you concede me.

662
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,950
Boring.

663
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,760
Well, you're really...

664
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,870
Zhou Siyue

665
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,230
Let's go.

666
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,120
Ding Xian

667
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,360
We're gonna make blackboard this PE class.

668
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,710
I have already asked leave
to the teacher.

669
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,910
OK.

670
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,760
Poor you.

671
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,840
Then I'll go to watch them
playing basketball by myself.

672
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,150
I have to.

673
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,630
A lot of girls are going to

674
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,600
watch them playing these days.

675
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Especially Siyue.

676
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm ok with that,

677
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,520
why do I care.

678
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,950
You're reluctant to admit.

679
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,150
Bye. I gotta go.

680
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,430
Xuanxuan, let's go.

681
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,560
Coming.

682
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,470
Let's start.

683
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,150
Do you have an overall composition?

684
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,000
We're running out of time.
Just paint whatever you want.

685
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,760
I'll find some suitable
sentences to write.

686
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,760
Okay.

687
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,320
You can use mine.

688
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,710
He doesn't like people
touching his stuff.

689
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,520
It doesn't matter if it's me.

690
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,470
It's quite a special relationship.

691
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,600
What's up, Song?

692
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
Those guys in Class 8
really get me annoyed.

693
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,470
I'll beat them if I see them.

694
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,600
Bad luck!

695
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,190
All right, I'll figure it out
for you next weekend.

696
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,320
By the way,

697
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,470
is your robot competition
about to start?

698
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,230
You know what I recalled?

699
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,630
I thought of Yang Chunzi and you.

700
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,230
You were really a good match.

701
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,080
There's nothing you guys can't do.

702
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,230
Now she came back to our class.

703
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,870
Don't you have a little stir inside?

704
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,870
Just stir?

705
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,520
I think you have waves in your heart.

706
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,470
No, no.

707
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,080
I'm not a man for that sort of thing.

708
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,910
Was that obvious?

709
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,150
Yang Chunzi

710
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,280
How dare you!

711
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,760
Yang Chunzi, what are you doing?

712
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,870
I'm making blackboard newspaper.

713
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,520
You're back.

714
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,630
You are slacking off.

715
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,670
This is drawn by you, Little Monster?

716
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,910
Nice!

717
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Who else?

718
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,630
I noticed that ever since
you sat with Siyue,

719
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,430
you're getting really bad-tempered.

720
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,040
Yang Chunzi

721
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,390
This must be drawn by you.

722
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,230
No matter the color

723
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,150
or the shape...

724
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,910
Does it look good?

725
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,870
What are you doing?

726
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,080
What am I doing?

727
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,800
Can't you learn from Yang Chunzi? You...

728
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,630
-Why should I learn from her?  -Will you stop...

729
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,600
... -beating me so frequently?  -What if I do it?

730
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,910
I'm warning you not to beat me again.

731
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,630
Xianxian

732
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,080
Your, your face...

733
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,710
Much better than usual, right?

734
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,320
Yeah, looks like you're
wearing makeup. Look!

735
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,040
Right?

736
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,840
No!

737
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,190
I was just trying to help you.

738
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
You did it on purpose.

739
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,950
You'll fall without my help.

740
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,950
You did it on purpose, stop talking!

741
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,710
That's the so-called flirting.

742
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,360
I think so.

743
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,320
Shut up!

744
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,000
It's not...

745
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
What are you laughing?

746
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,430
Someone is cramming at the last minute.

747
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,390
I can still cram,

748
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,910
what about you?

749
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,230
Have you recited the English text?

750
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
How could it be possible?

751
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,910
So many new words,

752
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,630
and you recited all in one night?

753
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,190
I didn't.

754
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,040
Read it a few times and then I can.

755
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,120
Yeah, I know you're ace.

756
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm running out of time.

757
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,360
Give it to me.

758
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,150
Are you reciting Chinese

759
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,520
or English?

760
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,190
Stop joking me.

761
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,430
I'm not.

762
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,910
You have to memorize
the phonetic symbols.

763
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,600
No one remembers English
with Chinese characters.

764
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,320
Leave me alone.

765
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,230
It's good for me.

766
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,280
Have you recited

767
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,870
the text yet?

768
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,710
Any volunteers?

769
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,150
No one?

770
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,670
I'm calling the roll.

771
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,950
Ding Xian

772
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,630
You first.

773
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,280
My name is Wang Kun.

774
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,320
Ever since middle school... I have...

775
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,520
No laughing!

776
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,320
You need to practice your
spoken English more.

777
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,000
Recite it one more time to me later.

778
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,080
Sit down.

779
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,800
Yang Chunzi

780
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,840
It's your turn.

781
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,320
My name is Wang Kun.

782
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,470
Ever since middle school,

783
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,040
my sister Wang Wei and I have dreamed about

784
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,120
taking a great bike trip.

785
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,670
Xianxian

786
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,120
Here are the English tutorial
you asked for.

787
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,390
Thanks.

788
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,120
The English teacher said
you had an accent?

789
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,670
That's normal.

790
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,520
When we were kids,

791
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,390
we didn't pronounce ABCD well.

792
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,800
Just follow the tape,
and read and practice more.

793
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,470
What's on your mind?

794
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,710
There is a girl in our class
who is brilliant.

795
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,670
Good-looking, and studying well.

796
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,280
Everyone likes her.

797
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,630
Moreover,

798
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,000
my deskmate seems to
care about her very much.

799
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,360
So do you care about her

800
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,800
or your deskmate?

801
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,150
Your deskmate is a boy, isn't he?

802
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,560
It's not like what you think.

803
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,000
In adolescence,

804
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,040
I can understand.

805
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,190
No, we're just friends.

806
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,150
Since when you start gossiping?

807
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,840
Okay, I won't make fun of you.

808
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,630
Come on. Let's go.

809
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Zhou Siyue

810
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,710
Where's Ding Xian?

811
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,760
She went to the restroom.

812
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,760
Still asleep? Wake up.

813
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,320
Where did you go?

814
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,190
I'm not telling you.

815
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,710
Now you can skip class?

816
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,470
I can do many things.

817
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,630
You really have something now.

818
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,390
This is the English note.

819
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,000
I re-wrote for you.

820
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,040
Look what you wrote before.

821
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,150
It's a wretched scrawl.

822
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,360
Thanks!
