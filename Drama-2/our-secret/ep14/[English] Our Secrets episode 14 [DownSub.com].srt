Our Secret
EP14

2
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,080
In this exam,

3
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,590
the performance of our class

4
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,030
is very satisfying.

5
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,350
A couple of students

6
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,390
have made obvious progress.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,200
Ding Xian,

8
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,120
538.

9
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:48,990
Excellent.

10
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,080
Keep it up.

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,880
Sun Jiacheng,

12
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,030
559.

13
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,320
Hello everyone,

14
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,520
I am Zhou Siyue from Senior Three Class Three.

15
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,040
Perhaps many students

16
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,880
have had this kind of moments.

17
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,079
You may think the article of classical Chinese is so long,

18
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,470
and the math problems

19
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,550
are so difficult.

20
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,550
We feel sleepy every day,

21
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,680
because we can't even sleep for six hours every day.

22
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,800
Every two day we run out of

23
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,630
the ink of a brand new gel pen.

24
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,270
In days exhausting our life like these,

25
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,600
I always ask myself one question.

26
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,600
Does everything we are doing now

27
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,270
really worth it?

28
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,110
But it is exactly

29
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,110
in these insipid and dull days

30
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,110
that we meet the group of people,

31
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,750
lovely and kind, around us.

32
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,630
We share the same goal,

33
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,440
and we together

34
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,110
work hard

35
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,350
towards this goal.

36
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,910
Within the broad space and infinite time,

37
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,000
even if we end up in separation,

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,030
looking up at the stars with you,

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,520
is already the best thing happened in my life.

40
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,720
So, just keep moving forward.

41
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,470
Don't be afraid.

42
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,190
Those days after days that may seem little to you

43
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,080
will make you understand the meaning of persistence

44
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,470
one day in the future.

45
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,350
I always believe in one sentence,

46
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,560
"there is still glory on the other side."

47
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,560
Why are you here?

48
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,310
Who are you expecting then?

49
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,120
How was it?

50
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,000
Where do you want to go after the exam?

51
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
I want to get drunk.

52
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,910
Okay.

53
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,470
I happen to know some nice places.

54
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,190
We can call Song Ziqi and the others.

55
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,840
No. No.

56
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,400
Just Shasha and me will be fine.

57
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,750
We girls have a lot to talk about.

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,680
Let's go.

59
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,080
Cheers!

60
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,960
You couldn't drink in this way.

61
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
What's going on?

62
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know.

63
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,560
My brain went blank when I was taking the exam.

64
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,400
I couldn't recall anything.

65
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,190
Same. Me too.

66
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,520
I couldn't answer many questions.

67
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,870
Now that the exam is over,

68
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,750
stop thinking about these anymore.

69
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,630
There is no chance for me.

70
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,960
It's fine. It's fine.

71
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,910
It's fine. It's fine.

72
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,560
I thought I could be closer to Zhou Siyue.

73
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,750
I have studied so hard.

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,520
Finally I still failed, Shadi.

75
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,840
I'll never keep up with him, won't I?

76
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,280
You fool.

77
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,040
You said I was a fool?

78
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,520
You are a fool yourself.

79
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,480
You like Song Ziqi, don't you?

80
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,630
I don't.

81
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,920
Just

82
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,080
as soon as I think of our parting,

83
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,720
I feel sad.

84
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,520
That's all.

85
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Right.

86
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,190
We are going to separate now.

87
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,310
Not only Zhou Siyue and I are separating,

88
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,230
but also you and me,

89
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,870
Song Ziqi,

90
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,310
and You Keke.

91
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,110
We are all about to be parted.

92
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,310
Why... Why are you talking about this so early?

93
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,520
I have never thought about these.

94
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,750
Forget about these.

95
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,750
Xianxian

96
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
If we could restart our high school life,

97
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,520
I would be your best friend on day one.

98
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,520
Me too.

99
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,310
We must be friends forever.

100
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,230
Don't forget me when you go to the university.

101
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,190
You too.

102
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,430
Why are you crying so ugly again?

103
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,280
You are the ugly one.

104
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,040
Well, well.

105
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,750
Let's sing.

106
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,190
Sing.

107
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,630
Shadi

108
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,870
I really don't want to separate with you.

109
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,480
Then let's go back.

110
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,040
Let me take a rest.

111
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,870
Zhou Siyue

112
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,480
Zhou Siyue

113
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,310
Ding Xian, you are so funny.

114
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,870
You mistake the trash can for Zhou Siyue.

115
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,080
He is Zhou Siyue.

116
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,840
Look, he is over there.

117
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,040
Liar.

118
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,400
Ding Xian

119
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,160
Come over here.

120
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,670
You two make us uneasy.

121
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,630
Siyue and I searched every shop.

122
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,630
But we couldn't find you.

123
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,360
I'll take her back home.

124
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,960
Why are you ignoring me?

125
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,630
I don't want to talk to you.

126
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,480
After all, we are not deskmates

127
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,310
or neighbors anymore.

128
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,920
Who cares about you?

129
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,550
You care about me.

130
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,790
I want you to care about me all the time.

131
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,720
Ouch.

132
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,550
I don't want to care about you.

133
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,080
Slow down.

134
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,080
You.

135
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,280
I don't want to go with you.

136
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,040
You always walk so fast

137
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,230
that I am left behind.

138
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,310
How about you walking ahead of me from now on?

139
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,670
Whether I walk ahead of you or behind you,

140
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,790
I can't walk with you anymore.

141
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,480
Stand up, ok?

142
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,190
Come.

143
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,630
Get on.

144
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,670
Didn't we agree

145
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,400
that we should face everything together?

146
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,550
Siyue

147
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,840
Zhou Siyue

148
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,230
I'm here.

149
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,840
I am always wondering,

150
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,960
what will we be like

151
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,840
when we are adults?

152
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,230
Will we be like when we were in high school?

153
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,400
Every day is simple and happy.

154
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,870
We will.

155
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,870
You are lying to me.

156
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,480
People change after they get separated.

157
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,190
Will we

158
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,600
be strangers one day?

159
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,480
Come off it. You're drunk.

160
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,670
I'm not.

161
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,310
Zhou Siyue

162
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,870
Have you ever heard about this saying?

163
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,280
"I'm not afraid that the moon will be shadowed by the clouds,

164
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,720
for you are brighter than the stars."

165
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,550
You future

166
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,750
is just like the stars.

167
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,360
Silly.

168
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,960
Stars don't shine.

169
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,400
I don't care.

170
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,630
If I say they shine,

171
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,430
they do.

172
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,550
Silly.

173
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,360
Open your mouth.

174
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,870
Better? Have some more?

175
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,520
Song Ziqi

176
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,190
What should I do?

177
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,990
After this vacation,

178
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,520
I can't see you next term.

179
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,840
We have been together since childhood

180
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,520
for so many years.

181
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,670
How can you live without me?

182
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,160
It's okay.

183
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm fine. I'm fine.

184
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,550
But I can't bully you anymore,

185
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,920
and can't play tricks on you anymore.

186
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,040
I'm fine.

187
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,480
You are lying.

188
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,190
You have been lying to me since we were kids.

189
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
When did I lie to you?

190
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
When I met my pants

191
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,990
once in kindergarten,

192
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,360
you said I should stand on the playground

193
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,870
for my pants would dry up faster that way.

194
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,280
And when we were in primary school,

195
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,670
you lied that girls also have beards.

196
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,990
and let me to shave them with a razor.

197
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,230
Then I got chased and beaten by my mom.

198
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,990
Most egregious of all, during the senior high school entrance examination,

199
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,080
you lied to me that the essential balm could help energize me,

200
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,430
so that I should rub it on my eyelids.

201
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,720
Song Ziqi, if you don't like me,

202
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,990
you should just tell me.

203
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,550
No, you listen to me.

204
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,230
I, every time I see you,

205
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,400
I find you interesting.

206
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,630
That's why I want to play tricks on you.

207
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,750
Are you an idiot?

208
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
I let you do these to me for so long.

209
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,720
Can't you see that I like you?

210
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,150
You're always angry with me,

211
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,310
beat me,

212
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,880
tell me to do this and that,

213
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
treat me as your underling.

214
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,640
How can I tell that you like me?

215
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,119
Don't change the subject.

216
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,240
Just tell me.

217
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,190
Do you like me?

218
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,030
Kong Shadi

219
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,480
For so many years,

220
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,190
I have always been behind you.

221
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,080
If I don't like you,

222
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,550
whom will I like?

223
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,670
Then

224
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,030
are we going to have a long-distance relationship?

225
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,910
It doesn't matter.

226
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,480
Maybe

227
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,760
when we're in a long-distance relationship,

228
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,120
you'll find me more pleasant to be with.

229
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,310
I am serious!

230
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,960
Don't worry.

231
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,150
Even if it's a long-distance relationship,

232
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,310
I won't let you go.

233
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,190
Then it's a deal.

234
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,910
You need to call me every day.

235
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,600
You can't miss my calls.

236
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
Or my messages.

237
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,000
Sure.

238
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,430
We need to meet once a month.

239
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,840
Sure.

240
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,720
You can't lie to me or scold me.

241
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,880
You need to care about me.

242
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,790
Sure.

243
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,670
If I am bullied,

244
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,720
you should go to me as soon as possible.

245
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,360
And,

246
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,120
during festivals, anniversaries,

247
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,270
and birthdays, you...

248
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,480
What are you doing?

249
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,670
Mom, you scared me.

250
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,190
You silly girl,

251
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,270
it is afternoon already. Get up now.

252
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,310
I called you yesterday, but you didn't pick up.

253
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,840
You got home so late and drunk.

254
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,310
How free you are after the exam.

255
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,270
Then how did I get home?

256
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,390
Siyue brought you home.

257
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Get up quickly.

258
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,640
How was the exam?

259
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,640
Have you estimated your scores?

260
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Not yet.

261
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,790
Mom, I need to wash my face first.

262
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,960
Ding Xian

263
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,390
Your teacher said that your score

264
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,030
can be enrolled in Hangzhou's key universities.

265
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,360
Mom.

266
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,480
I'm not going to apply for universities.

267
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,120
What did you say?

268
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
I said I'm not going to apply for universities.

269
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,840
I want to be in school for another year.

270
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,880
You can go to a key university already,

271
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,840
but still want to pay to study for another year, right?

272
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,760
Did too much study break your brain?

273
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,120
I could have done better

274
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,510
in this exam.

275
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,310
I can't be reconciled.

276
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,480
I don't agree.

277
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,430
I'll ask your teacher now

278
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,150
to fill the application form for you.

279
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,600
Don't even think of another year.

280
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,640
Mom.

281
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,840
Can you just leave me alone?

282
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,840
This is my life, not yours.

283
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,310
Can you for once let me make my own decision?

284
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,550
No matter the result is good or bad, I'll take it.

285
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,600
Okay?

286
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,640
Fine.

287
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,270
From now on,

288
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,550
I will not mind your business.

289
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,640
Rest assured.

290
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,030
I have packed my luggage.

291
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,670
We'll go to you this afternoon.

292
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,640
We should stay by your side at this kind of moment.

293
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,080
Okay.

294
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,000
See you.

295
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,760
What happened, mom?

296
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,670
Are you going out?

297
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,960
Siyue,

298
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,720
have a seat.

299
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,670
Let me tell you something.

300
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,080
What happened?

301
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,390
Siyue,

302
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,670
we're going to Jiangling early than expected.

303
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Is it because

304
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,510
something happened to Dad?

305
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,790
It's a little complex

306
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,080
to explain.

307
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,960
I see.

308
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,510
Mom, I need to go out for a while.

309
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,310
I'll be back soon.

310
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,640
Just go.

311
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,270
I failed in the exam.

312
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,760
I can't go to Jiangling.

313
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,670
Then, where do you apply to?

314
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,510
I plan to

315
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,670
study for another year.

316
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,120
Another year?

317
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,310
You can wait for me in Huaqing University.

318
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,240
Maybe

319
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,910
I can outdo myself.

320
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,480
And I can go find you then.

321
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,150
All right.

322
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,720
Actually I have one thing

323
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,840
to tell you.

324
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,910
I'm leaving soon.

325
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,480
Will you be back during the vacation?

326
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm afraid...

327
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,550
not.

328
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,310
Fine.

329
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,270
I will miss you.

330
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,670
I should leave now.

331
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,880
I am going to start

332
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,670
a new round of senior three life tomorrow.

333
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,360
Wait.

334
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,000
I have a parting gift for you.

335
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,840
Isn't this the D2-T3 robot

336
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
you showed me last time?

337
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,910
Good for you.

338
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,840
You still remember this.

339
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,670
Why is it called D2-T3?

340
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,120
I named it randomly.

341
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,480
Then let me give it a name.

342
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,150
Good. What do you want to call it?

343
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,430
April.

344
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,270
April?

345
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,840
I will always remember

346
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,030
the summer of my 18.

347
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,270
Extremely hot.

348
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,430
And extremely difficult to endure.

349
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,510
The past

350
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,190
is saying goodbye to me.

351
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,270
All I can do

352
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,640
is to face it frankly.

353
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,670
Smile and say goodbye to it.

354
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,390
Xianxian

355
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,670
Here's the thing.

356
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,880
Mr. Wang of senior three,

357
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,080
is always the head teacher of the key class,

358
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,390
and his class has a very high university enrollment rate.

359
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,150
Your mom and I thought it over.

360
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,720
Maybe

361
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,080
you can study in his class this year?

362
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,600
Okay. I also heard that he's amazing.

363
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,030
Perhaps I can make bigger progress.

364
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,240
Great.

365
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,080
I need to go.

366
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,120
Finish quickly and go to school.

367
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,430
Dad, I'm almost done.

368
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
Let's go together.

369
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,000
Sure.

370
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,030
Go.

371
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,760
I'll take it.

372
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,640
Go.

373
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,840
We are leaving.

374
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,240
Okay.

375
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,390
Everyone,

376
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,000
Let's cut the chase.

377
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,390
As to the tension of senior three,

378
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,310
I believe that you guys know it well already.

379
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,600
I

380
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,760
will not do empty talks with you.

381
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,150
But

382
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,510
I have one request.

383
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,640
Fill in your dream university seriously.

384
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,000
Work hard towards it from now on.

385
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,480
We have a couple of old students in our class.

386
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,760
I hope you

387
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,480
can face the past,

388
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,510
review yourself,

389
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,790
and make better choice this time.

390
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,640
My new term started.

391
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,910
I feel that I am

392
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,390
further away from the guys.

393
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,120
Everyone is following the normal track

394
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,310
and moving forward,

395
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,120
while only I seem to go off track.

396
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,480
I missed

397
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,310
Zhou Siyue and the others.

398
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,120
Though these days are tough

399
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,270
and dim,

400
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,190
I do not dare to slack off.

401
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,150
I am afraid that as soon as I stop,

402
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,000
numerous people will surpass me.

403
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,720
One after another.

404
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,080
Hello, Professor Ye.

405
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,880
I am the son of Zhou Zongtang.

406
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,270
You are Siyue, right?

407
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,670
Zhou used to mention you.

408
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,390
I finally get to meet you today.

409
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,480
Yes. I heard it before

410
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
that you and my dad are good friends.

411
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,150
Sorry to bother you today.

412
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,480
It is okay.

413
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,270
Professor Ye,

414
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,640
do you know

415
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,120
what on earth happened to my dad?

416
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,910
Ding Xian,

417
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,430
you want to go to Huaqing University?

418
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,000
Yes.

419
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,120
Ding Xian,

420
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,670
this year is neither short nor long.

421
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,120
If your goal is Huaqing University,

422
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,120
you may need to make more efforts

423
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,080
than the others.

424
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
I understand.

425
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,480
I will.

426
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,600
Hello.

427
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,150
Hello.

428
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,880
Zhou Zongtang's mail. Please sign for it.

429
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,640
Thank you.

430
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,190
Thank you.

431
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,390
Let's eat.

432
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,030
Mine?

433
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,190
Yes.

434
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,150
You continue eating. It's OK.

435
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I need to make a call.

436
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,760
Mr. Wang,

437
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,480
sorry for bothering you.

438
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,600
Zhou's paper issued before

439
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,360
was reported for copying and counterfeiting.

440
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,550
He is being investigated now.

441
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Siyue

442
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,670
What are you thinking about now?

443
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,120
Eat.

444
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,080
You too.

445
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,360
I have thought it through.

446
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,390
I will wait unit the truth comes out.

447
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,910
Dad

448
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
What is going on?

449
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,880
I have experienced hypoglycemia lately.

450
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,760
A doctor prescribed some medicines to me.

451
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,190
Rest assured.

452
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,840
Go have some rest.

453
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,240
Dad

454
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,390
I went to see Professor Ye today.

455
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,190
I know

456
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,510
you are afraid

457
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,480
that I will be affected in school.

458
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,600
But I am not afraid.

459
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,670
I believe you.

460
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,150
Sorry.

461
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,360
I brought troubles to you and mom.

462
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,880
We are family.

463
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,880
You don't need to say things like this.

464
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,510
Besides,

465
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,440
you are not the only professor in Huaqing University.

466
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,880
Perhaps nobody knows you,

467
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,880
nor me.

468
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,949
You have not eaten, right?

469
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,270
I'll warm the dishes for you.

470
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,080
Hello?

471
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,120
Hello?

472
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,680
Do you know

473
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,470
your scores in the entrance exam today?

474
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,360
How about it?

475
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,920
Fine.

476
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,160
My rank is good.

477
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,030
How come you think of calling me now?

478
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,950
I just want to tell you

479
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,790
that I have settled down here.

480
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,920
I can go to my university tomorrow or the day after.

481
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,710
You don't need to worry about me.

482
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,030
How about you?

483
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
How are you doing in school?

484
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,510
Ding Xian

485
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,880
What happened to you?

486
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,470
I'm fine.

487
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,310
The score and rank

488
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,640
of this exam

489
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,790
are kind of great.

490
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,600
The teacher said that there's good chance that

491
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,840
I could go to Huaqing.

492
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,440
Right.

493
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,840
When you go to Huaqing University,

494
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
can you take some photos for me?

495
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,310
Silly.

496
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,550
Of course.

497
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,710
I really want to know what Huaqing University is like.

498
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,990
You will know when you are here.

499
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,030
I hope things can go smoothly.

500
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,840
Are you really all right?

501
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,840
I'm just tired.

502
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,790
Sleepy.

503
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,550
Then go to sleep.

504
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,790
Everything will be all right.

505
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,840
Everything will be all right.

506
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,550
Siyue

507
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,230
Mom

508
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,990
You haven't slept?

509
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,920
I just finished washing the clothes

510
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,680
and want to hang them up on the balcony.

511
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,990
Why don't you sleep?

512
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,080
Why are you putting these away?

513
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,200
Just some useless things.

514
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,510
I wonder whether I can sell them all.

515
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Aren't these your favorites?

516
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,120
I liked them as a kid.

517
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,550
But now I've grown up.

518
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,360
Right, mom.

519
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,750
Perhaps before the term starts,

520
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,790
I need to go back to Shen Hai.

521
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,440
Ding Juncong

522
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,750
Did you stay up late all night and play video games?

523
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,470
It's weekend.

524
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,680
What's wrong with playing video games?

525
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,990
You are about to go to junior high school.

526
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,230
You need to focus on your study.

527
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,880
If you study half as hard as your sister,

528
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,400
I will never scold you.

529
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,360
Sis studies too hard to be a normal guy.

530
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,230
Nonsense.

531
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,840
Xianxian

532
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,200
You studied all night?

533
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,030
A few days ago, Mr. Wang talked to me.

534
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,270
He said you made a huge progress.

535
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,030
You did very well in the exam.

536
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,440
But I want to remind you,

537
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,550
don't push yourself too hard.

538
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,160
Make sure you get enough rest. Be careful with your health.

539
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,400
I understand.

540
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,950
I'm going back to my bedroom.

541
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,200
Why did you eat so little?

542
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,950
I'm full already.

543
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,600
She can't continue this way.

544
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,200
Her mental state is getting worse.

545
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,030
I heard her talk in her sleep last night.

546
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,640
She was reciting formulas in her dream.

547
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,840
I don't know what to do now.

548
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
Perhaps you can talk to her.

549
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,640
No.

550
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,640
I refused to let her study for another year back then.

551
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,310
Because I was afraid that she would get stuck in it.

552
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,120
What for?

553
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,470
Fine, stop saying things like this.

554
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,470
It is pointless.

555
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,030
Then what should we do?

556
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,440
I don't know what to do.

557
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,710
Sis may listen to

558
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,990
one guy.

559
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,230
Who?

560
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Mom, I am not hungry.

561
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,270
I won't have lunch. You don't need to wait for me.

562
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,080
Xianxian, it's me.

563
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,270
Su,

564
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,310
didn't you go to Jiangling?

565
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,200
I come by to visit Uncle and Aunt.

566
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,230
And you.

567
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,160
Go. Let's take a walk.

568
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,080
Don't stay in the room all day studying.

569
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,510
My parents asked you to come, didn't they?

570
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,550
They worried about you.

571
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,880
I am fine.

572
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,030
Studying for another year

573
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,640
must be hard, right?

574
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,950
Many people live a harder life than me.

575
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,230
It is nothing.

576
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,160
Su

577
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,470
Do you know?

578
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,550
There is a girl called Lin You in my class.

579
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,840
She has studied for three extra years.

580
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,400
Every year, she wanted to go to Nanjing University.

581
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,750
But every year, she did worse

582
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,310
than her last year.

583
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,400
I think she is the most serious

584
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,880
and hard-working student in my class.

585
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,310
However, the harder she learned, the worse result she got.

586
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,440
Once, in my class,

587
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,030
she got a mental breakdown.

588
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,360
She tore all her books and papers apart.

589
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,790
Studying for another year

590
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,160
is really horrifying.

591
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,310
Xianxian

592
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,990
Do you really think like this?

593
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,950
Actually,

594
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,360
if you are tired,

595
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,310
and stop to have some rest,

596
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,600
nobody will blame you.

597
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:53,750
Su,

598
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,750
I'm so tired.

599
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,550
I'm really so tired.
