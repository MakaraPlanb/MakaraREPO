Our Secret
EP11

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Let me tell you something.

3
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,590
Our city will hold a painting competition

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,350
a few days later,

5
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,350
which requires each school to recommend several students to participate.

6
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,479
If you wanna sign up,

7
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,030
Kong Shadi

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,120
just come here now to get the registration form.

9
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,990
Sir, Ding Xian can do it.

10
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,759
Yes, she can.

11
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,080
Sir, she can.

12
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,030
Here you are.

13
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,440
Ding Xian,

14
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,710
Can you do it?

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,110
Mom

16
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,190
How do you think about it?

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
It's quite good.

18
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,750
But

19
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,079
you are now in the second semester of high school.

20
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,750
If it were any other time, I would definitely allow you to do it.

21
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,079
But now is the critical time.

22
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,800
You must focus on your study.

23
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,270
Painting is just one of your hobbies.

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,829
Don't pay much attention to it.

25
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,240
OK.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,240
Ding Xian,

27
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,830
I'm talking to you.

28
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,630
Don't give me that deep freeze.

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,320
You wouldn't agree anyway.

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
You talk to me in this attitude?

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,680
I do it all for your own good.

32
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,160
I won't be bad to you.

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,079
Mom, water cures anger.

34
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,800
Show me

35
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
your composition.

36
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,630
My family.

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,110
It's always noisy at home.

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,190
My mother is very similar to my sister.

39
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,550
They often get angry.

40
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,040
When something goes wrong with them,

41
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,550
they will speak very loudly,

42
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,440
loudly enough

43
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,520
to wake the dead.

44
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,550
That's what I am in your mind?

45
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,400
Speak loudly enough to wake the dead.

46
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,240
Good idiom.

47
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,710
Rewrite.

48
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,630
Why wouldn't she let me tell the truth?

49
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,430
Dad

50
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,430
I don't wanna get married in the future.

51
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
Hey, little boy.

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,000
I understand you.

53
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,080
Go rewrite it.

54
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Don't hesitate.

55
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,960
Let me accompany you to sign up.

56
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,150
What's going on?

57
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,350
Please persuade her.

58
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,560
She doesn't wanna sign up for the painting competition.

59
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,350
I heard that Yang Chunzi also signed up.

60
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,150
Come on Little Monster.

61
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,280
Don't be afraid.

62
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,840
It is always good to participate.

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,000
Forget it, let me think again.

64
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,750
The class is about to start.

65
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't be afraid.

66
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,910
Sit down.

67
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,680
Dad, why are you dressed like this?

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm awesome this time.

69
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,720
Let me tell you.

70
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,750
Just play it by ear later.

71
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,800
Ding Wencheng

72
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,240
Does this look good on me?

73
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,840
Yes, you look good.

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,430
Well.

75
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,430
Is my lipstick too red?

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,430
Too red? No.

77
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,590
Xianxian,

78
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,680
do you think she is good-looking?

79
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes.

80
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,240
Mom

81
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
You look good in this lipstick.

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
You are so beautiful today.

83
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,150
Where are you going?

84
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,030
Your dad follows the fashion.

85
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,560
He'll take me to the concert and eat western food.

86
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,030
I have never been to such a place.

87
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,400
We should also enjoy

88
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,470
the elegant life from time to time.

89
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,960
So I will cultivate our taste

90
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,960
with your mother and Congcong.

91
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,000
Good habits need to be developed

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,680
from an early age.

93
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,560
Xianxian, you just stay at home.

94
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,840
Don't worry, I'm not a child either.

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,400
Well.

96
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,120
Ding Juncong

97
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,630
Ding Juncong, hurry up.

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,870
Congcong, come here.

99
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,800
Let's go.

100
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,470
What's wrong with you?

101
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,800
What are you doing?

102
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,240
What's the matter?

103
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,470
I refuse to be with you.

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
I wanna watch cartoons at home.

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,520
Watch cartoons?

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,560
Don't be a good-for-nothing boy.

107
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,030
It's not easy for your dad to get tickets.

108
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,720
Right, these tickets are very expensive.

109
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,190
You must come with us.

110
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,150
Right, the concert is so good.

111
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,840
If I don't need to do my homework at home,

112
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,840
I'll also like to go. So you go.

113
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,080
That's your business. I won't go anyway.

114
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,120
Then stay at home!

115
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,000
Ding Xian, take care of him.

116
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,800
Let him do his homework, and I'll check when I come back.

117
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,870
Let's go.

118
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,030
Dad

119
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,720
That's all I can do for you.

120
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,720
Ding Wencheng

121
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,750
Hurry up.

122
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,350
Hello.

123
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,960
Come on.

124
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,240
Let me take you to the venue.

125
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,430
I may not be able to go.

126
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,150
Why?

127
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
OK.

128
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,280
Hello.

129
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,400
You two come here now.

130
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,630
Would you like some?

131
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,240
Put it there.

132
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,560
OK.

133
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,430
Juncong

134
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
It's such a fine day today.

135
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,430
Won't you go out?

136
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,750
I don't want to.

137
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,750
It's rare that mom and dad are not home.

138
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,430
You wanted to

139
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,720
go to that game center just the other day, right?

140
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,240
You can go there.

141
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,680
I'll keep your secret.

142
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,470
Don't think I don't know what you want.

143
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm not going.

144
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,000
I just wanna piss you off.

145
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,549
Why are you here?

146
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,190
Let us help you take care of your brother.

147
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,190
You just feel free to participate in the competition.

148
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,750
I'm King of Children of Shen Hai High School.

149
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,480
Don't worry.

150
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
My brother is very...

151
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,919
Don't hesitate. Get ready.

152
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,080
-My Brother...  -Go.

153
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,430
Hurry up.

154
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,600
Hello bro.

155
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,550
Let me

156
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,520
stay with you today, okay?

157
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,160
What are you doing?

158
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
Don't look.

159
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,430
Oh, little boy.

160
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,670
Why can't I take a look?

161
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,870
What are you doing?

162
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,480
Show me, will you?

163
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,630
OK.

164
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,230
Let me stay with you today, okay?

165
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,190
OK.

166
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,990
So can you teach me

167
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,190
how to play this game?

168
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,520
OK.

169
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,670
This is my favorite game.

170
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,190
Wenwen is the little flying flag.

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,280
This is Jiang Chen's motorcycle, right?

172
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Come on.

173
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,430
Please wear the helmet.

174
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,630
Are you ready?

175
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,190
The great escape.

176
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
Where's my motorcycle?

177
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,960
Jiang Chen

178
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,840
You're going to

179
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,310
take me for a ride on this bike?

180
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Yes.

181
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,480
Look,

182
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,920
it's a lovely day.

183
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,480
This beautiful bike

184
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,750
suits you very well.

185
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
Come on.

186
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,600
No, it's a shame.

187
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,430
You have a really good appearance.

188
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,870
But why are you so melodramatic?

189
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,430
Come on.

190
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,040
Or I'll leave.

191
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,720
Why do you call me melodramatic?

192
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,040
All right.

193
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,670
It's too late.

194
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,040
Do it.

195
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,990
Goodbye.

196
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,040
Ding Xian

197
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,230
Go for it.

198
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,630
The competition is in proposition mode.

199
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,920
Please choose one of the three topics

200
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,960
of youth, family affection and striving

201
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,990
to draw.

202
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,080
What did you draw?

203
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,230
This is my secret.

204
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,480
All right.

205
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,840
Anyway, winning a prize

206
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,990
won't be difficult for you.

207
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,790
Actually, the result is not important.

208
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,600
I suddenly understood what you told me earlier

209
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,630
during the competition today.

210
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,480
You said that

211
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,920
many seemingly ordinary things

212
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,790
will eventually come together

213
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,480
and

214
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,750
have different meanings again.

215
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,080
Now I think

216
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,960
painting

217
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,630
is not just a hobby

218
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,630
for me.

219
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,160
Anyway,

220
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
thank you today.

221
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,190
Release.

222
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,190
Spike score.

223
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,430
Ding Juncong, add five points, victory.

224
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,630
Defeat.

225
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,520
Ding Juncong

226
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,790
He is not a schoolboy,

227
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,870
but a demon child definitely.

228
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,080
I don't care. Do my homework for me.

229
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,360
Otherwise, I will tell mother about it.

230
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,630
Mom.

231
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,360
What time is it now?

232
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,430
I'm done.

233
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,920
My mother will be back soon.

234
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,920
What should I do?

235
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Let me help you with your homework.

236
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,630
Clean up quickly.

237
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,920
-Which one?  -This.

238
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,790
Why are there so many people?

239
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,160
Hello, aunt and uncle.

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
You guys...

241
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,960
We are a study group.

242
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,720
Zhou Siyue is teaching Juncong to do his homework.

243
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,960
Right.

244
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
That's nice.

245
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,870
Show me your homework.

246
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,080
Not bad.

247
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,750
You finished your homework very well today.

248
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,110
How did you solve this problem?

249
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,870
This...

250
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,360
Didn't Zhou Siyue teach you just now?

251
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,360
This...

252
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
You forgot?

253
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,990
I know you.

254
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,750
So many

255
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,280
brothers and sisters tutor you.

256
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,750
Why don't you seize the opportunity

257
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,310
to learn from them?

258
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,750
Copy this question

259
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,870
into the notebook

260
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,990
and do it again later.

261
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,080
Just stay here.

262
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,280
I will cook for you.

263
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,160
Wait.

264
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,550
It doesn't matter.

265
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,600
We gotta go.

266
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,360
Goodbye, uncle.

267
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,670
Goodbye, auntie.

268
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,430
My mom called me.

269
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,520
How is it?

270
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,920
Be careful this week.

271
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,400
Beware of bad guy.

272
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,160
Who is the bad guy?

273
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,280
Who is the bad guy?

274
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,190
Ding Xian

275
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,520
Just come to me.

276
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,630
You did something wrong again?

277
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,430
No.

278
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,870
This is too accurate, right?

279
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,670
How are you?

280
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,750
He scolded you?

281
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,990
It's all right.

282
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,870
What the hell?

283
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,310
Xianxian, you're wonderful.

284
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,430
You are really a great painter.

285
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,190
Look, Xianxian won the first place.

286
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,040
Great job, Little Monster.

287
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,550
You are great, Ding Xian.

288
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,360
Give it to me.

289
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,550
You are like crazy people.

290
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,480
Can you guys be more mature?

291
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,600
How are you?

292
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm fine.

293
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,040
A marinated egg, please.

294
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,870
Come on.

295
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,310
Today is Ding Xian's treat.

296
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,080
I will order some unordered

297
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,920
and expensive ones.

298
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,040
Why do you take advantage of everyone?

299
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,400
I just wanna

300
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,870
thank you all very much today.

301
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Without you guys,

302
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
I wouldn't have been able to go to the competition.

303
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
Song Ziqi is right.

304
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,230
I'll order more too.

305
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,920
Just do it.

306
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,480
You've ordered so much, but you still order?

307
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,910
I can't?

308
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,079
You can.

309
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,640
Can we eat it all?

310
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,000
Are you guys that hungry?

311
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,000
We can definitely eat it all.

312
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,030
You're like a greedy hungry ghost.

313
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,150
You've made me poorer by eating at my house these days.

314
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,760
You argued with your father again?

315
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
What is the reason this time?

316
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,960
This time it's different.

317
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,030
A little bit serious.

318
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,000
So I just wanna...

319
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,550
He just wants to be a soldier, but his father

320
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,190
won't allow it.

321
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,600
You're the only one with a mouth.

322
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,120
You will say it sooner or later anyway.

323
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,270
I'll order.

324
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,310
Here's the menu.

325
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,240
Don't talk with me.

326
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,670
I've made up my mind.

327
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,360
I won't advise you.

328
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,390
You told me you wanted to be a soldier when you were eight.

329
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,030
Have you forgotten?

330
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
I told you at that time that

331
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,390
if you were a soldier,

332
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,550
I would engage in national defense research.

333
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,600
This is equivalent to

334
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,080
defending our country together.

335
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,510
I haven't forgotten.

336
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,510
We must not go back on our word.

337
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,600
Keep your word.

338
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
OK.

339
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Don't worry.

340
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,640
We're with you.

341
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,600
It seems that there is nothing to eat.

342
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,480
Let's go back.

343
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,720
Everyone has a dream.

344
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,270
My dream is to be a pilot.

345
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,760
If you wanna be a pilot,

346
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,030
I will be a flight attendant.

347
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,390
I wanna graduate before you.

348
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,000
I will fly before you.

349
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,030
Clumsy birds have to start flying early.

350
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,120
You call me a clumsy bird?

351
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
I'm a clumsy bird.

352
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,120
What about you?

353
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,510
What do you want to do in the future?

354
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,840
Have you finished ordering?

355
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,390
So I'll call the boss.

356
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,670
Please.

357
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,790
I'm coming.

358
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,640
Yes, I want these.

359
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,670
OK.

360
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,030
Did you just order that French Toast?

361
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,720
Yes.

362
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,430
Yes?

363
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
Right.

364
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,390
What is

365
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,790
my dream?

366
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,270
His father is a soldier.

367
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,550
Why doesn't he support Jiang Chen?

368
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,880
Jiang Chen

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,120
had a bad relationship with his father since he was a child.

370
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,030
He always doesn't

371
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,550
listen to his father.

372
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,360
So his father thinks that he can't endure hardship

373
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,790
and is not suitable for being a soldier.

374
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,840
And you don't know Jiang Chen very well.

375
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,670
That boy

376
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,270
is stubborn.

377
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,360
He is sure to stick to it.

378
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,030
What is on your mind?

379
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,430
I feel that you all have dreams

380
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,150
and goals.

381
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,880
You are great.

382
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,480
You just won the first prize.

383
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,550
Why do you think so much?

384
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
Painting is just

385
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
one of my hobbies.

386
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,030
Dreams should

387
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,480
be grand.

388
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,150
All dreams

389
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,430
begin with hobbies.

390
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,600
And I believe

391
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,600
you can do anything

392
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,000
you want.

393
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,960
Hobbies.

394
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,390
I wanna be a painter.

395
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,310
It's not easy.

396
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,240
Ding Xian, why don't you sleep?

397
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,550
Right away.

398
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,240
How are you?

399
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,030
I shouldn't have stayed up all night.

400
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,600
Why do I feel like you're dying?

401
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,430
Don't talk nonsense.

402
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,960
You certainly don't understand the pain during the period.

403
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,150
I don't wanna understand either.

404
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,480
It's too torturing.

405
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,910
Don't go to this physical education class.

406
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,190
Where did you get this?

407
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,550
The infirmary.

408
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,670
Let's go.

409
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,270
Let's go.

410
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,240
Xianxian, I gotta go.

411
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,190
You're awake?

412
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,640
Why are you back?

413
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,790
It's too hot outside.

414
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,270
I don't wanna have class.

415
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Zhou Siyue

416
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,270
Have you always wanted to go to Huaqing University?

417
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,840
Why do you suddenly ask this?

418
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,600
After you told me that day,

419
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,720
I've been thinking about it since I got home.

420
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,480
You said to start with interest.

421
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,310
I think since I like painting,

422
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,390
I will become a painter.

423
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
But

424
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,960
I didn't learn to draw systematically.

425
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,790
I can't take it for granted.

426
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,430
Why do you smile?

427
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,790
I'm thinking about this very seriously.

428
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,510
I shouldn't smile.

429
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,080
Actually, I think

430
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,030
it's good to be realistic sometimes.

431
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,360
For example,

432
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,430
I always wanna be admitted into Huaqing University.

433
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,030
Actually, I just wanna

434
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,880
go to a bigger place

435
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,080
to test my ability.

436
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,150
It's that simple?

437
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,080
Yes.

438
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,910
Dream.

439
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,360
Goal.

440
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,480
In fact, it just

441
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,000
gives us

442
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,910
a driving force to move forward.

443
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,270
So

444
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,430
is it a dream for me to wanna do well in the exam?

445
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,240
Why are you laughing again?

446
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,760
I wanna say

447
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,640
this dream of yours

448
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,840
can actually be a little bit bigger.

449
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,910
Then get into a key university.

450
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,550
This is the first step I want to take.

451
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,360
Everyone thinks that

452
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,000
I can only get into an ordinary university at most.

453
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,430
But I think about it.

454
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,240
I'm still unconvinced.

455
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,880
I can also be admitted into a key university.

456
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,910
Well.

457
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,910
Let me help you.

458
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,270
You can take a nap again.

459
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,390
When you wake up, let me help you with your test paper.

460
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,960
Otherwise, if I speak now, you can't listen

461
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,030
and you can't remember anything.

462
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,910
Just sleep.

463
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,310
Zhang Haojie

464
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,640
Tang Jiamin

465
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,000
It seems that you did well in the exam.

466
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,120
Safe.

467
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,240
It's impossible for you to fail the exam with my guidance.

468
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,080
Our class

469
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,790
ranks first in the whole grade

470
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,880
this time.

471
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,000
But

472
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,550
I think many people

473
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,240
have begun to be overconfident.

474
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,600
Song Ziqi

475
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,360
You are not going into your senior year of high school soon.

476
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,190
You've already been seniors in high school now .

477
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,030
Xianxian

478
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,880
Make-up classes

479
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,600
will begin immediately after the summer break.

480
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,190
Don't forget to camp together.

481
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,760
The last carnival of the senior year.

482
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,910
So don't go too far.

483
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,270
Please put your heart on your study.

484
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,310
Got it?

485
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,190
I'm back.

486
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,910
Xianxian, look who's here.

487
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,000
Xianxian

488
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,310
Hello.

489
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,000
Why are you here?

490
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,790
I'm on holiday, so I come to see you.

491
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,030
How are you doing?

492
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,880
I'm fine.

493
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,030
Mom

494
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,430
Let me discuss something with you.

495
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,150
Kong Shadi asked me

496
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,640
if I wanted to

497
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
hang out with her next week.

498
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,150
I wanna talk to you...

499
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,080
You can't.

500
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,840
Mom, it's the last summer vacation.

501
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,430
It is because this is the last summer vacation

502
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,840
that I disagree.

503
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,430
Where are you going?

504
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,910
We agreed to go camping.

505
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,910
Is it

506
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,640
next to the museum?

507
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,640
Auntie, this is the last holiday.

508
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,600
Shen Hai High School students are really stressful.

509
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,430
It's good to relax at this time.

510
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,670
I also hung out at that time.

511
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,150
But it didn't affect my grades.

512
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You're not like her.

513
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,720
She's different.

514
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,510
It happens that some of our college classmates

515
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,670
are going there, too.

516
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,430
We will take care of them.

517
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,510
You can rest assured.

518
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,550
Mom, just let me go.

519
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,910
I'll only play in this last summer vacation.

520
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,510
Mom

521
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,000
All right.

522
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,270
But you must focus on study after you get back.

523
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,240
OK.

524
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,790
Thank you, mom.

525
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, take your time and I'll cook.

526
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,030
Auntie, let me give you a hand.

527
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,670
I'm so looking forward to

528
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
this last summer.

529
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,240
Hello.

530
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,030
Xianxian

531
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,550
He's so handsome.

532
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,030
He has been even more handsome since he graduated.

533
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,600
You bring so many things.

534
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,270
Hello.

535
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
I've heard a lot about you.

536
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,670
You must be Zhou Siyue.

537
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,360
I know you.

538
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,390
I grew up with Xianxian.

539
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,150
She's told me about you.

540
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,080
This is a war, let's get out of it.

541
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,270
Let's go.

542
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,670
Where shall I put this first?

543
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,150
There you are.

544
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,360
Let me take it over for you.

545
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,510
It doesn't matter.

546
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,080
I'll do it.

547
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,880
Let's go.

548
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,360
Xianxian

549
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,000
We're going to have a campfire dinner later.

550
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,190
Do you want to join us?

551
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,670
OK.

552
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Let's play together.

553
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,910
You guys get ready first.

554
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,120
I'll meet you later.

555
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,840
OK.

556
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,150
See you later.

557
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,640
See you later.

558
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,030
Let's go.

559
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,880
Let's go.

560
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,240
Why do I feel that

561
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,310
he is getting more and more handsome?

562
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,840
I feel that he is still like that.

563
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,510
Maybe it's because

564
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,760
you grew up with him.

565
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,640
You already know him well.

566
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,430
Anyway, I think

567
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,510
he is more handsome after going to college.

568
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,240
Do you

569
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,430
want to meet him?

570
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,430
I'll be too shy if I go by myself.

571
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,270
Please introduce him to me.

572
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,510
I feel that

573
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,469
even the air is sweet where he is.

574
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,949
Song Ziqi

575
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,469
Why do you take mine?

576
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,840
It's too late.

577
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,840
Don't catch me.

578
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,199
This is not very tasty.

579
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,989
Why do you steal food too?

580
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
What's up?

581
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,880
You and Kong Shadi chat about Su Bocong

582
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,080
so fascinating.

583
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,360
So you neglect it.

584
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,030
I don't.

585
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,840
I've seen it all.

586
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,440
You are so childish.

587
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,270
Me?

588
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,360
Stop chasing me.

589
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,880
I can't run anymore.

590
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,440
-It's your fault for eating my food.  -I'm sorry.

591
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,310
By the way.

592
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,920
I solved that problem last night by myself.

593
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,600
You're great.

594
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,080
What about that last function problem?

595
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,160
That's too much.

596
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,160
Please don't talk about studies when playing.

597
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,790
We don't ask you to listen.

598
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,550
I don't want to listen.

599
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,550
Let me take you to the sunset.

600
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,310
Wait a minute.

601
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,080
Was there a function

602
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,030
in the last question last night?

603
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,920
Isn't it a special training for solid geometry?

604
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,710
The one you are talking about

605
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,990
is the 18th set of special training, right?

606
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Our homework is the 18th set of exam papers.

607
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,470
Kong Shadi

608
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,160
Did you memorize the papers I asked you to memorize correctly?

609
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,360
Yes, the 18th set.

610
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,640
Which one of the 18th set?

611
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,920
Are you crazy?

612
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,510
Isn't that the 18th set?

613
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,920
He's funny.

614
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,950
Where are we going?

615
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,840
Don't we watch the sunset?

616
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,030
Printing shop.

617
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,360
You remember the paper wrong.

618
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,950
The new semester will start the day after tomorrow.

619
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,270
Oh.

620
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,160
Last year.

621
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,160
Right.

622
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,680
Jiangsu University.

623
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,880
Thank you.

624
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,270
C.

625
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,510
Because this one plus this one

626
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,840
equals 16, so 16/3.

627
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,600
So it's (16*π)/3.

628
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
-Draw another one on this one.  -Xianxian

629
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,440
They say they are going to have a bonfire dance later.

630
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,550
Do you want to join us?

631
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,710
OK.

632
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,200
The bonfire dance is great.

633
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,200
Let's do it together.

634
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,680
Can you dance?

635
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,840
No, but you can teach me.

636
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,550
You

637
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,230
shouldn't mind, right?

638
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,080
Right.

639
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,510
Let's go.

640
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,440
Let's dance together.

641
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Go away.

642
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,950
Are you happy today?

643
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,950
Yes.

644
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,400
It's beautiful here.

645
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,080
Let's dance together.

646
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,030
Let's dance together.

647
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,840
How to dance?

648
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,310
Left and right.

649
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,360
Friends

650
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,510
We have a custom here.

651
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,080
Dancing around a bonfire

652
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,360
can make our relationship better and better.

653
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
So let's all

654
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,550
dance around the bonfire, okay?

655
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,750
OK.

656
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,750
OK, let's hold hands.

657
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,200
Come on.

658
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,400
Hand in hand.

659
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,600
Come on.

660
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Please

661
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,270
hold hands, okay?

662
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,680
Right.

663
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,360
You sing very well.

664
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,030
What is this?

665
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,600
You lost your diary.

666
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,230
So I

667
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,510
made a small website in my spare time.

668
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,270
It is similar to Blog.

669
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,440
But it doesn't need to be connected to the network.

670
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,640
So what you want to say

671
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,950
can be written on it.

672
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,360
No one else can see it.

673
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
You are great.

674
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,160
This is a very basic operation.

675
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,400
It can be used as a small reward for doing well on your exams.

676
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,750
I like it very much, thanks.

677
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,470
I actually

678
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,600
lied at that time.

679
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,550
What?

680
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,030
I said at that time that

681
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,160
my dream was to be admitted into a key university.

682
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,790
Actually, I don't really think so.

683
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,160
At that time, I always thought about

684
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,510
what kind of person I want to be

685
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,270
and what dreams I have.

686
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,880
Then

687
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,200
I didn't know why I thought of you.

688
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,840
I don't mean anything else.

689
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,920
I...

690
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,790
I just think you're good.

691
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,120
Not only do you study well

692
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
and care for others,

693
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,880
but you also have a sense of responsibility.

694
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,200
It hit me that

695
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,990
if only I could be

696
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,080
such a good person.

697
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,270
So at that time, my dream was

698
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,600
to become a better person.

699
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,470
But you know I'm not smart.

700
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,600
I don't know where to start.

701
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,950
After careful consideration,

702
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
I think I should just

703
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,310
start with the petty things as you said.

704
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,840
I should study hard first,

705
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,440
then go to a key university

706
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,470
and stick to painting.

707
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,270
If there's a chance...

708
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,920
Do you also think I'm stupid?

709
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,510
No.

710
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,030
You're right.

711
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,750
To be a better person,

712
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,750
you must first go to a wider

713
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,510
and bigger place.

714
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,080
At least I think so.

715
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,270
And

716
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,750
you're on that path now.

717
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,750
You

718
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,080
won a prize in the painting competition.

719
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,470
After you chose science,

720
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,310
your record was also increased.

721
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,920
You are now...

722
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,950
I also got to know you.

723
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,080
I used to be very introverted.

724
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,270
I didn't have many friends either.

725
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,750
I didn't know how to get along with people.

726
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,030
Anyway, I think

727
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,790
it's great

728
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,440
to have Ziqi, Shadi

729
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,790
and you.

730
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,310
You're actually pretty good.
