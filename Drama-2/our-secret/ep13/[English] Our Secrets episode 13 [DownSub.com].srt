Our Secret
EP13

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,030
Ding Xian

3
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,670
Why don't you

4
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,800
study in Jiangling too?

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,310
What have you dreamed about?

6
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520
You blushed.

7
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,590
It's a sweet dream, huh?

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,630
No.

9
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,910
No?

10
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,240
Tell me, what's it about?

11
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,160
Nothing.

12
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
Nothing?

13
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,079
What?

14
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,240
Ding Xian

15
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,880
What's up?

16
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,190
Don't talk to me in class.

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,750
Your glasses fell off.

18
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,880
Tell me,

19
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,079
what was your dream?

20
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,880
You were so happy.

21
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,520
I didn't.

22
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,079
Did you dream about things

23
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,320
you wish you could have in real life?

24
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,270
Stop it.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,470
You look guilty.

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,190
No.

27
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,829
You do.

28
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,440
I don't.

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Why don't you get it?

30
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,880
Cherish your high school years!

31
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,040
After graduation,

32
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,240
you two will be far apart from each other.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,440
Draw a guiding line,

34
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,110
then the angle ACD will be...

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,040
What's wrong? You've been weird all day.

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,750
Nothing.

37
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm listening.

38
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,960
Is there anything on my face?

39
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,800
No.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,910
You haven't even looked at me these days.

41
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,829
How did you know there's nothing?

42
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,910
Are you gonna go on or not?

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
If not, I'll go to bed.

44
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,550
Forget the thing you keep from me,

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,960
but my tutoring time is priceless.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,040
After I go to the contest in a few days,

47
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,800
you won't be able to find me even you want.

48
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,149
But you don't cherish this now.

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,430
Siyue

50
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,750
The power is off!

51
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,190
I see!

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Wait a second,

53
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,630
I'll have a look.

54
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
Why is the power suddenly off?

55
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,720
What's up?

56
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,630
Are you afraid of the dark?

57
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,470
No, I'm not.

58
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,680
Here,

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
now you're not scared, are you?

60
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,590
I like this song, too.

61
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
Zhou Siyue

62
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,430
I also want to study in Jiangling.

63
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
You're not allowed to go out today.

64
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,960
I'm gonna break your legs!

65
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll leave even if you do!

66
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,280
Go ahead!

67
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,310
Leave? Try it!

68
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,470
What should we do?

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,630
How did you do your job?

70
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,630
What can I do?

71
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,870
Before I talked to him well,

72
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,840
he was taken away by his dad.

73
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,560
Look how you spoiled him!

74
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,960
Then beat me!

75
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,909
Stop talking!

76
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,909
What' wrong?

77
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,150
You're finally here, look.

78
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,190
Siyue

79
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,190
Jiang, Siyue is here.

80
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,520
You two really are...

81
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,840
What are you doing?

82
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,030
Uncle, auntie!

83
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,750
Siyue

84
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,590
You've come just at the right moment.

85
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,910
You two are best friends.

86
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,840
Help him figure out gains and losses.

87
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,750
Go to the college first,

88
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,870
then think about other things.

89
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,630
You may consider Siyue to be your son!

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,310
He's such a good student!

91
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,150
What did you say?

92
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,310
One more word?

93
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,120
Stop it!

94
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,350
-Well.  -Uncle

95
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,190
Let me talk to you.

96
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,080
He's unreasonable!

97
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,120
Yeah.

98
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,080
Siyue, please talk to him.

99
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,000
OK.

100
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,030
Auntie

101
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,190
I'll have a good talk with Jiang Chen.

102
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,870
Right, go ahead.

103
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,350
Don't be so stubborn.

104
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,590
Come here.

105
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,520
Buddy

106
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,840
I owe you once.

107
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,520
So it's okay?

108
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,910
Let's go.

109
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,230
Still awake?

110
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,080
You scared me.

111
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,080
I'm so hungry.

112
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,960
With no slippers,

113
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,790
you might catch a cold again.

114
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,670
Put them on.

115
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,670
That's mine.

116
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,870
You look like a little old man now.

117
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,520
Old man?

118
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,110
You seem to be very experienced.

119
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,520
No wonder you could convince Jiang Chen's dad.

120
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,600
How did you make it?

121
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,670
It's actually

122
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,110
not a big deal.

123
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,110
I said that

124
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,920
the reason why Jiang Chen wants to be a soldier

125
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,720
is that he wants to be a man

126
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
as excellent as his dad.

127
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,870
Awesome!

128
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,310
You're good at talking.

129
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,790
It must be tough to prepare for National Olympiads.

130
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,750
Go for it!

131
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,160
I almost forgot.

132
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,920
I heard that your score of math

133
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,670
was only 90-something this time.

134
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,310
It's a tough situation, girl.

135
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,430
It's past two o'clock.

136
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,040
Can't you give me a break?

137
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,230
I see you're not sleepy yet.

138
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,670
Come on, tutoring begins.

139
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm sleepy, very much!

140
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Let me go, Mr. Zhou.

141
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,920
Let's go get some drink later.

142
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,870
I know a great milky tea shop,

143
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,750
and it's very cheap.

144
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,870
Okay, okay!

145
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,790
Jiang Chen?

146
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,670
Well, Keke, we'll go first.

147
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,990
Why are you here?

148
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,190
Waiting for you...

149
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,190
Me?

150
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,160
You wear so little.

151
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,160
Tie it on the waist.

152
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,600
No, it's naff.

153
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,750
I have to go to the art class later.

154
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,160
Just tie it on.

155
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,040
What are you doing?

156
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
It's cold.

157
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,430
Stickybeak.

158
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,430
Hop on, I'll take you there.

159
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,840
Come on.

160
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,990
Forget it.

161
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,990
Getting a ride

162
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,960
is not bad.

163
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,720
Hold on tight.

164
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,310
You've decided which college to go to, haven't you?

165
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,920
Of course,

166
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,110
the acting department of the Film Academy.

167
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,720
If I fail this year,

168
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,670
I'll try again next year,

169
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,280
until I make it.

170
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,480
I think we are similar

171
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,360
since we won't stop until we achieve the goal.

172
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,670
Who is similar to you?

173
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,750
I have a bright future.

174
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,840
I have one too, OK?

175
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,040
I'm going to be a soldier.

176
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm so bright.

177
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,360
Idiot, you are really going to be a soldier?

178
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,990
If we are strong, our country will be strong.

179
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,990
If we are intelligent, our county will be intelligent.

180
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,400
What?

181
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,870
I said,

182
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,920
If we are strong, the country will be strong.

183
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,040
If we are intelligent, the country will be intelligent.

184
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,310
The minimum passing score is so high.

185
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,400
You're going to the same university?

186
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,400
I wish I could.

187
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,630
But Huaqing University won't give me a chance.

188
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,960
I would be happy if we'll be in the same city.

189
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,190
You still have the chance

190
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,550
to go to the same city.

191
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,870
But me, not gonna happen.

192
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,630
You mean

193
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,160
we just break up, right?

194
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,430
This is great news for me.

195
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,750
Bye, I'm gonna be beautiful alone!

196
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,400
By the way,

197
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,310
this weekend,

198
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,230
let's go and see Jiang Chen off.

199
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,750
He's gonna leave.

200
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,750
So soon?

201
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,230
Thanks for watching a movie with me.

202
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,790
Never mind.

203
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,230
Suddenly I thought that

204
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,920
I won't see you again soon.

205
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,230
I feel as if something is missing.

206
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,360
You can call me

207
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,720
or write to me.

208
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,280
You're good at writing, aren't you?

209
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,920
Who said that?

210
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,360
I didn't write that.

211
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,790
Others helped me.

212
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,310
Besides,

213
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,920
why do I write to you?

214
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,480
What a friend!

215
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,720
We are friends?

216
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,520
Well, it's only my own wishful thinking.

217
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,750
It's yours from now on.

218
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
What's this?

219
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,550
A parting gift.

220
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
I have nothing

221
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,550
but this motorbike.

222
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,670
So sudden.

223
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,870
Take it.

224
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
I'll keep it for you.

225
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,190
Wait for your return.

226
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,600
And,

227
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,630
do your best in your test tomorrow.

228
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,400
You will definitely get into your dreamed university.

229
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,840
Of course, I will.

230
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,310
It's not fun for me to play with you.

231
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,960
You do it.

232
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,160
Are you sure?

233
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,360
Yeah.

234
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,160
I think she and I are well-matched.

235
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,080
No offense.

236
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
Just give you a break.

237
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,080
OK.

238
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,920
Come on.

239
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,310
Teach him a lesson.

240
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,080
You're so...

241
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,870
lucky.

242
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,870
It's just a coincidence.

243
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,040
Why did he do this?

244
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,550
He thought that Little Monster is a soft touch,

245
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,119
but

246
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,270
he got a hard one.

247
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,310
Aren't you leaving tonight?

248
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,030
You still have time to play billiards here?

249
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,240
I just want to have some fun

250
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,359
before I go.

251
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,550
Who knew I may lose so many times.

252
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,150
You guys, come and eat first,

253
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,430
or it'll be cold later.

254
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,360
OK, one more round.

255
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,000
Coming.

256
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,790
Come on, Song.

257
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,480
Come on.

258
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,670
Little Monster

259
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,240
You are so good at playing billiards.

260
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,430
The master taught me.

261
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,120
Well...

262
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,270
keep in touch with me later.

263
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,960
It's better to tell me something about Keke.

264
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,510
It turns out that you have other things in mind,

265
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,390
buddy.

266
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,840
If she goes out with other guys,

267
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,390
you must tell me.

268
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,480
How can that be?

269
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,270
That makes me betray my friend.

270
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,480
Let's cooperate.

271
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,120
I can betray my friend, too.

272
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,360
Just kidding, not gonna happen.

273
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,600
They're my buddies.

274
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,030
That's Keke.

275
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,390
Jiang Chen, why are you not in a hurry?

276
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,880
Aren't you afraid that your dad scolds you?

277
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,190
Wait,

278
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,430
why are you riding Jiang Chen's motorbike?

279
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,360
Don't you have a test?

280
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,480
I got there early and finished it early.

281
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,390
Did... did you do well?

282
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,150
Why do you talk so much?

283
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,390
I'm willing to give you a ride.

284
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,760
Hop on quickly.

285
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,190
Yeah, how can you let a pretty girl wait for you?

286
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,720
Hurry up.

287
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,600
OK, I...

288
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,600
Wait,

289
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,760
you forget your bag.

290
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,080
Well,

291
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,840
I'll go.

292
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,270
I'll drive.

293
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,480
Bye.

294
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,840
Hurry up.

295
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,880
Take care.

296
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
Go, go.

297
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,120
Stop looking. Let's go.

298
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,240
We'll meet again someday.

299
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,430
Let's go.

300
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,840
Handsome, huh?

301
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,120
Siyue

302
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,910
The national contest is coming.

303
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,190
Try your best.

304
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,670
I believe that

305
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,550
you definitely can get a place of Huaqing University.

306
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,120
Huaqing University...

307
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,640
OK.

308
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,790
I also think that he will make it.

309
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Siyue can do it.

310
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,120
He has such good grades.

311
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,910
All right.

312
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,480
Stop talking.

313
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,960
The time you pay attention to others

314
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,550
can be used in your study,

315
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,550
okay?

316
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,550
Do you know anything efficacious

317
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,030
that can get one lucky?

318
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,550
For Zhou Siyue?

319
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,080
Keep your voice down. Don't let him hear us.

320
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,720
I haven't seen you care so much

321
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,150
when you have a test.

322
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
That's different.

323
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,360
It is of great importance to him.

324
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,640
There are lucky pens being sold near our school.

325
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Why don't you buy him one?

326
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,510
Nothing new.

327
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,430
Lucky bookmark?

328
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,150
Not good enough...

329
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,550
Anything else?

330
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Well...

331
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
if you're heartfelt,

332
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,790
make him one by yourself.

333
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,080
Ding Xian

334
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,190
Wait... wait a second.

335
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,910
OK.

336
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,190
What are you doing?

337
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,000
Reading.

338
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,270
Didn't I teach you this one before?

339
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,270
Why is it wrong again?

340
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,030
Is it?

341
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,310
Let me teach you one more time.

342
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,240
That's OK. I'll figure it by myself.

343
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,120
Go to bed, and you have a test tomorrow.

344
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,760
Don't worry about me.

345
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,670
Well, I...

346
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,080
Good night.

347
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,430
You...

348
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,310
-Good luck on the test!  -I tell you...

349
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,550
Oh, God.

350
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,880
Zhou Siyue

351
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,910
Zhou Siyue

352
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,600
Why are you here?

353
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,270
I was supposed to see you off,

354
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,190
but I got up late.

355
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,720
It's just a test.

356
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,150
I'll be back after it.

357
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,790
How could you say that?

358
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,270
It's about your university.

359
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,960
Are you...

360
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,390
nervous?

361
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,480
A bit.

362
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,640
Give me your hand.

363
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,030
Good luck.

364
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,150
This is my first time doing this.

365
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,840
I hope you don't mind it's ugly.

366
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,310
So you didn't do your homework,

367
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,030
and this is what you were doing.

368
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,760
You almost caught me.

369
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,390
Stupid...

370
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,550
Come here.

371
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
My hair isn't clean.

372
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,640
That's fine. Absorb some anima.

373
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,390
The final exam is coming.

374
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,120
Go back and do your homework.

375
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,960
When the next semester begins,

376
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,720
I have a present for you.

377
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,550
Ding Xian also came here to cheer for Siyue.

378
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,720
Mr. Liu

379
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,120
It's time to get in.

380
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,670
Siyue

381
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,080
Don't be nervous about the test.

382
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,430
Just do what you usually do.

383
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,270
You'll be fine.

384
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,550
Don't worry.

385
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,550
I'm ready.

386
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,430
Go.

387
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,270
Mr. Liu

388
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,790
If I get admitted to Huaqing,

389
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,430
could you do me a favor?

390
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,000
Even ten is okay.

391
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,000
Zhou Siyue

392
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
You must pass the exam.

393
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,550
The road ahead is so long.

394
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,150
You're going to have a bright future.

395
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,510
Come on.

396
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,760
What are you doing?

397
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,640
The winter holiday makes you distract, right?

398
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,240
Mr. Zhou, I'm so tired.

399
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
You don't wanna study in Jiangling?

400
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,640
Yeah.

401
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,510
I'd better go to Hangzhou.

402
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,030
Okay,

403
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,430
it's none of my business anyway.

404
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,600
How nice Hangzhou is,

405
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,840
so is the scenery.

406
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,000
And there isn't some guy

407
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,310
tutoring me every day.

408
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,190
What's wrong?

409
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,720
I was kidding.

410
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,480
What are you doing?

411
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,360
Are you making fool of me?

412
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,030
I'm not.

413
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,670
Are you...

414
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,120
Why do you poke me? You always do this.

415
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,760
And you always hit me.

416
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,640
Just tell me if you don't want to do your homework.

417
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,910
I didn't.

418
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,960
This is interesting, huh?

419
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,550
I really didn't.

420
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:38,910
Stop...

421
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,310
Hello, mom.

422
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,190
OK, I get it.

423
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,270
What's wrong?

424
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,030
Something happened to my family and I have to go back.

425
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,760
Uncle Ding

426
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm sorry to hear that.

427
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,360
Thanks.

428
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,790
Xianxian

429
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,030
Su

430
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,030
I thought

431
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,760
you won't be back at the Spring Festival.

432
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,030
I will definitely come back to take a look

433
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,360
after something like this.

434
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,760
How are you?

435
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,760
When I was a kid,

436
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,720
I didn't know what parting is.

437
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,880
When I grew up,

438
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,910
I realized this is such a sad thing.

439
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,270
Yeah.

440
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,670
Growing up itself is a sad thing.

441
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,360
Even the best friends

442
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,430
will gradually become strangers.

443
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,150
There's nothing we can do.

444
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,670
Because everyone

445
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,550
will have a new life of their own.

446
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,880
Then I don't want to grow up.

447
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,270
I still remember in those years

448
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,120
the Keshan Brat

449
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,030
cried three times a day.

450
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,190
When I see you every day,

451
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,510
you cried like a little dirty cat.

452
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,600
Yeah.

453
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,550
In middle school,

454
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,150
those boys were always picking on me.

455
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Do you still remember?

456
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,600
You gave me a bag of toffee,

457
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,600
and they asked me for it.

458
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,390
I didn't want them to find out,

459
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,000
so I hid it under a tree.

460
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,840
Then it rained.

461
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,120
When I went back for it,

462
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,910
there were only the wrappers.

463
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,880
Tell me,

464
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,670
if it's the more you cherish something,

465
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,190
the more you can't keep it?

466
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,840
Xianxian

467
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:29,960
Here's something for you.

468
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,600
It was for kids during the Spring Festival.

469
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,360
Here.

470
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,390
For me,

471
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,840
you'll always be the same Xianxian.

472
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,670
But I'm not a kid anymore.

473
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,150
Zhou Zongtang

474
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,310
Do you know it's the Spring Festival today?

475
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,880
You still gonna go out?

476
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,360
Yun, I really have something to do.

477
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,030
It's still a school thing.

478
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,880
You haven't been in class for so long.

479
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,430
What things do you have?

480
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,880
Besides,

481
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,790
can it be more important
than the Spring Festival?

482
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,390
Can you trust me?

483
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,880
If you don't even believe me...

484
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,190
I can't explain it clearly

485
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,120
in several words.

486
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Zhou Zongtang

487
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,120
If you leave this house today,

488
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,150
we won't celebrate the Spring Festival!

489
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,120
Aren't you going out?

490
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,600
Take good care of you two.

491
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,270
Xianxian, why are you here?

492
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,400
Go back. It's cold outside.

493
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,310
Dinner is ready.

494
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,400
You eat first.

495
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,400
Daddy wanna stay outside for a while.

496
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,950
It's cold and cheerless this year.

497
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,840
Yeah.

498
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,550
During the Spring Festival before,

499
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
your grandma was doing all the shopping

500
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,270
and cooking.

501
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,230
And then she'll gather

502
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,510
the whole family together.

503
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,550
Dad

504
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,400
We can't change it,

505
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,030
but to accept it.

506
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,200
Let's go in.

507
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,510
Are you there?

508
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,990
Hello.

509
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,550
How are

510
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,360
your family members?

511
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,950
They're fine.

512
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,550
Happy new year, happy new year.

513
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Happy new year to you all.

514
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,160
We're singing and dancing.

515
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,200
Happy new year to you all.

516
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,400
Do you feel better?

517
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,230
What do you mean?

518
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,200
You know I'm in a bad mood?

519
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,880
Probably because we've been deskmates for a long time,

520
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,400
even if I didn't see you,

521
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,680
I can imagine your expression.

522
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,440
How are you in your hometown?

523
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,640
It's happy.

524
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,950
There's a big dinner at home,

525
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,360
and I was stuffed.

526
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:44,950
How about you?

527
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,600
I...

528
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,640
I'm watching fireworks at home.

529
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,840
We also had fireworks today.

530
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,840
Do you feel it?

531
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,550
How time flies.

532
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,990
After the festival,

533
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,200
we're gonna grow up.

534
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,200
Yeah.

535
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,640
But that's okay.

536
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,400
We can watch the fireworks together

537
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,310
next year.

538
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,640
Great.

539
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,470
We watch fireworks together next year.

540
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,400
Happy New Year,

541
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,440
Zhou Siyue

542
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,080
Happy New Year,

543
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,030
Ding Xian

544
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,080
Before the class is over,

545
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,840
I have a piece of news.

546
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,710
Let's congratulate Zhou Siyue

547
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,440
on passing the National Olympiads,

548
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,200
and he's gonna be a student of

549
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,880
Huaqing University!

550
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,310
Awesome!

551
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,120
Besides, those who didn't get recommended,

552
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,230
don't give up.

553
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,200
Where there is struggle, there is hope.

554
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,200
Keep working hard in the new term,

555
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,440
and make progress.

556
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,550
OK, class is over.

557
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,790
Siyue, you become a college student.

558
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,510
Siyue, please tutor us

559
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,030
if you're free.

560
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,230
Siyue, me too.

561
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,920
-OK.  -St... st...

562
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,990
stop it.

563
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,990
Everyone makes an appointment. Siyue is very busy now.

564
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,750
If you have the intention,

565
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,270
come to me to make an appointment first. Thank you.

566
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,080
Just ignore him.

567
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,550
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

568
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,950
You're really everywhere.

569
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,920
Ding Xian

570
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,200
Pack up and move back.

571
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,310
Move back.

572
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
You're too blatant.

573
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,470
I've got aunt's permission.

574
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,550
I don't believe it.

575
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Move quickly.

576
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,880
You'd better stop gossiping. With the time,

577
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,510
you can figure out two more questions.

578
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,080
Quickly.

579
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,400
This is the gift you said?

580
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,750
Why do you want me to move back?

581
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,360
To make tutoring convenient.

582
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,080
No more reasons.

583
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,310
For tutoring...

584
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,200
Are you stupid?

585
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,470
You even believed it.

586
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,470
Why do you always call me stupid?

587
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,510
My whole high school

588
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,840
started from being deskmate with you.

589
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,310
At the end, of course,

590
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,440
I have to be your deskmate.

591
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,310
Otherwise,

592
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,030
it'll be a pity.

593
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,510
Thinking that you have entered Huaqing,

594
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,120
but I was still wandering outside Jiangling.

595
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,880
Deskmate

596
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,950
You're so good at studying.

597
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,470
Do you have

598
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,200
any shortcuts to improve grades?

599
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,270
You wanna play petty tricks?

600
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,750
But I

601
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,550
do have a way.

602
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,790
I made this

603
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,440
college entrance examination countdown schedule for you.

604
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,680
So you had a plan long ago.

605
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,200
Because you make me worry so much.

606
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,360
Make you worry.

607
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,710
Come on!

608
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,470
I won't let you down!
