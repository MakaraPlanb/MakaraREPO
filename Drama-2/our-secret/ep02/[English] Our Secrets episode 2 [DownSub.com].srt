Our Secret
EP02

2
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,229
In this paragraph,

3
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,360
the only useful thing is this formula.

4
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,360
You only have to bear it in mind.

5
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,910
If you keep your habit of

6
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,190
memorizing everything,

7
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,360
you may be weeded out from the key class.

8
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,509
You were merely
above the admission score.

9
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,080
You're in the 45th place,
while I'm in the 38th place.

10
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,550
What makes you judge me?

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,830
It is your first time being despised for poor academic performance.

12
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,470
Siyue, your deskmate is funny.

13
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,190
Come on, stop mocking at Ding Xian.

14
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,600
Since you joined this class midway,
you may not know that

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,080
Siyue has always been the top student

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
in the main campus.

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,720
And he was a contestant of National Olympiad.

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,270
He prepared for the Robotics Contest
before the entrance examination.

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,670
So he didn't take the exam seriously.

20
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,190
Nonetheless, he got the full score in math.

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,160
Well.

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,960
Siyue

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,320
I don't quite understand teacher's explanation on this in the last class.

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,320
Can you help me with it? This one.

25
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,910
Could you please move away?

26
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,270
Xianxian

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,240
I've been looking for you all around.

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,390
You are here.

29
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,630
What's wrong?

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,910
Why pulled a long face?

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,270
Don't you take classes?
You are in the third year.

32
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,079
It's a free study class.

33
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,110
It's all right.

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,390
Come with me.

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,110
I'll take you to a great place.

36
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,079
This is my secret base.

37
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,910
I share it with you today.

38
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,670
Now you can tell me why.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
It's nothing serious.

40
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,200
I just feel the gap between me
and those classmates from the main campus

41
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,510
is huge.

42
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,200
I roughly got it.

43
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,950
That's nothing to be shocked about.

44
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,200
Don't forget that

45
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,670
I came to Shenhai two years
earlier than you.

46
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,950
The feel at the start of
the first semester of the first grade,

47
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,950
I know it so well.

48
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,159
Did you get the same feeling as me?

49
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,670
But I was not as depressed as you,

50
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,350
trying to find somewhere to cry.

51
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,159
I got your feeling.

52
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,830
When I just came to Shenhai.

53
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,510
I was in a similar situation as you.

54
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,790
I didn't know anyone.

55
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,230
I couldn't adapt
to the new environment.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,760
The school in my mind

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,160
was just a place to study.

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,230
But after I came to Shenhai,

59
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,480
my whole worldview has been overturned.

60
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,000
It also made me realize that

61
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,830
school was not just a place to study.

62
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,040
These were all brand new stuff to me.

63
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,230
But for the guys from the main campus

64
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,550
who live in the city,

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,920
they all have got used to it.

66
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,000
They had a broader vision than me.

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,760
Even the scores
that I have always been proud of

68
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,270
is nothing special here.

69
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
It turns out that

70
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,510
even you also have this feeling.

71
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,760
To be honest,
I envy those guys from the main campus.

72
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,230
They know much
and they are good at learning.

73
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,230
Maybe we are not

74
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,790
in the same world.

75
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,510
Don't think that way.

76
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,600
It's true that there is a gap between

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,390
us and them.

78
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,040
But you shouldn't immerse yourself

79
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,830
in the gap.

80
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,510
Knowledge and vision

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,320
can be acquired by learning.

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,070
But the most important thing is

83
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,880
we're already here.

84
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,110
Siyue, can you explain the question
to me again?

85
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,390
I'm still a little confused.

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,550
Wait for a minute, please.

87
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,920
Xianxian

88
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,600
Promise me.

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,790
Don't give up

90
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,880
in Shenhai.

91
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,200
That's okay.

92
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,920
I think we can change seats.

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,390
You can sit here.

94
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
What are you doing?

95
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm making room

96
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,000
for you to explain questions.

97
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
I'm almost done.

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,230
Don't come back if you change now.

99
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,790
I gotta go back to get my things.

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Thanks.

101
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,760
Let me tell you what Ding Juncong has done.

102
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,830
He deliberately made trouble for his sister.

103
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,550
He hid his sister's school ID card.

104
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,230
I spent all day looking for it.

105
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,790
This brat!

106
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,550
How about Ding Xian in school?

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
I don't know.

108
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,270
I haven't got the chance to talk with her the whole day.

109
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,710
Why are you sighing?

110
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,320
Don't you feel that Xianxian has been

111
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
drifting apart from us recently.

112
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,280
How fast she grows!

113
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,710
I remember when she was young,

114
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,710
she toddled

115
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,150
behind us.

116
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,280
Now she has grown up,
she doesn't like to be with us anymore.

117
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,790
Don't fuss.

118
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,280
She is almost sixteen years old now.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,350
It would be abnormal

120
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,520
if she likes to be with us.

121
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,470
After several years, everything will be better.

122
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,760
You'd better spend your time
on disciplining her and her younger brother

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,350
instead of sighing here.

124
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,350
It is enough to discipline them by you.

125
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
Ding Juncong

126
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,200
has been in her sister's room for quite a while.

127
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,080
What is he doing there?

128
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,080
Dad and mom. I'm home.

129
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,230
Xianxian, you're home.

130
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,030
-Have some fruit.  -No, pass me.

131
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,230
I knew it.

132
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,590
I was right.

133
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
Ding Juncong

134
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,760
What are you doing in my room?

135
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Did I allow you to come in?

136
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,080
You didn't lock your room,
so I entered.

137
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,760
Did you read my diary?

138
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,470
No, I didn't.

139
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,150
Then why are you holding my diary?

140
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,960
I didn't read it.

141
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,320
Are you sure?

142
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,030
Ding Juncong

143
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,670
Mom, my sister is going to hit me.

144
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,320
-Mom.  -What's up?

145
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,230
You wanna die?

146
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,110
What's the matter?

147
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,000
Mom, see.

148
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,670
Why don't you use your own notebook?

149
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,030
Mom

150
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,910
Why did you have to use mine?

151
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,710
Alright.

152
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,470
It's just a notebook.

153
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,320
Your brother is young and ignorant,

154
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,440
so are you?

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,880
Furthermore,

156
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,670
the time you spend on the diary

157
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
is enough for you to finish a set of exercising papers.

158
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,350
He didn't do it on purpose.

159
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,350
Why did you lose your temper?

160
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,880
The diary didn't affect my study.

161
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,000
It was him who got the bad grades, not me.

162
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,760
Why do you lecture me, instead of him?

163
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,110
Am I not your daughter?

164
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
How dare you talk to me like this?

165
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,110
How dare you?

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,640
Do you know how difficult I'm every day?

167
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,400
I take care of your food

168
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,640
and dressing.

169
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,230
You are a big girl.

170
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,670
Can't you just be nice to your brother?

171
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,350
Alright, alright.

172
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,320
Why did you argue with him?

173
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,000
Alight, alright.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,710
Stop arguing, both of you.

175
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,590
Xianxian, don't get angry.

176
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,880
You go to your room first.

177
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,760
By the way.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Your mother found it for you.

179
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,200
Next time if I find anyone who doesn't wear the school badge,

180
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,640
go home right away!

181
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,110
Such a naughty boy.

182
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,320
Don't cry.

183
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,550
You can't cry.

184
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,110
Come in.

185
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Siyue

186
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,710
I bought some Golden Cakes

187
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,280
from Deyue Shop this afternoon.

188
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,350
It's really delicious.

189
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,910
Don't forget to bring some to Xianxian.

190
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,350
Xianxian is fresh here,

191
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,880
and she is in the same class as you.

192
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,910
Take care of her in school.

193
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
She is a girl, don't make her sad.

194
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,960
Alright, I get it.

195
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Sleep early.

196
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,150
Ding Wencheng

197
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,230
Hurry up and stop siting
in front of your computer.

198
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,470
The previous school

199
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,670
is different from the school in our hometown.

200
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,110
They use multimedia in school.

201
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,550
I have to figure it out.

202
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,400
Well,

203
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
the class of the third grade is early.

204
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,790
I have to go first.

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Xianxian, I can't wait for you.

206
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,710
Sister, I'm sorry.

207
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,200
I was wrong yesterday.

208
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,440
I shouldn't take your diary

209
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,150
without your permission,

210
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,000
and broke it.

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
Sister, I have realized my fault.

212
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,520
Can you forgive me?

213
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,590
Sister, please.

214
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
Forgive me.

215
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,200
If you don't forgive me, mom will beat me.

216
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Did you say it?

217
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,760
Look.

218
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,550
Don't touch my stuff anymore.

219
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,790
Okay, you have my word.

220
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,320
Ding Xian, let me fill your bowl

221
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,080
with your favorite Egg Meat Porridge.

222
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,880
Can you stop looking?

223
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,080
Annoying.

224
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,840
Please don't mind.

225
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,110
He is just this kind of person.

226
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,350
My name is Liu Xiaofeng.

227
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,880
Nice to meet you.

228
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,910
Ding Xian

229
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,590
Are you familiar with Zhou Siyue?

230
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,030
No, I'm not.

231
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,110
You are not?

232
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,030
Then why did he put something into your drawer

233
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,550
before you came in.

234
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
Take it back.

235
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,110
My mother told me to bring it to you.

236
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,590
Anyway, I can't accept anything from you.

237
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,520
This is Golden Cake.

238
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,000
I have been thinking about it for a long time.

239
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,670
Well.

240
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,840
You can have it.

241
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,440
Siyue, your mother is so good at buying things.

242
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,960
Come on.

243
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,230
Are you really not familiar with him?

244
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,470
I admire him so much.

245
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,910
He is the legend at National Olympiads.

246
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,710
Looking at the way he solves problems is so enjoyable.

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,400
It's art!

248
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,880
I didn't expect that

249
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,030
I could be in the same class with my idol.

250
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,470
You are so noisy.

251
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,710
You only dare to pick up on a pushover.

252
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,960
When Deng Wanwan was here,

253
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,350
you weren't so bad-tempered.

254
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,440
Watch it!

255
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,230
It's dusty.

256
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,640
Can you do it in the back?

257
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
Sorry.

258
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,350
He Xingwen has gone too far.

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
He has always been this way.

260
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,470
A nerd only knows study.

261
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Little Monster will go through hard days

262
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,280
after sitting next to him.

263
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,960
Am I right?

264
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm not familiar with him.

265
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,320
How do I know?

266
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,030
You're not familiar with him,

267
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,350
but he is familiar with you.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,200
Remember, when we were in junior high school,

269
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,150
both of you were competing for the No.1 of the math exam.

270
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,350
You were sick then,

271
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,910
so you got second place.

272
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,440
He was happy for an entire week.

273
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,840
Really?

274
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,760
Really.

275
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,110
You were not in the same class with us

276
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,200
in junior high school.

277
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,440
Let me tell you, that day,

278
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,760
Siyue got a fever of more than 40â„ƒ.

279
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,590
He still insisted on taking the exam.

280
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Liu Xiaofeng

281
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,069
Did you give out all the math papers?

282
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,829
Yeah, but you were not there then.

283
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,400
He Xingwen must have kept it for you.

284
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,430
He Xingwen

285
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,880
Have you kept the exam paper for me?

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,069
I have no obligation to keep it for you.

287
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,190
You can ask the Subject Representative
for that.

288
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,800
Do you have extra paper

289
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,070
that the teacher left?

290
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,470
I gave back all the extra papers to the teacher.

291
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,280
What? Your deskmate didn't keep it for you?

292
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,520
That's okay.

293
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,280
I'll ask the teacher for it.

294
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
Poor Little Monster.

295
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,920
Having such a deskmate.

296
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,350
Isn't our Siyue nice enough?

297
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,310
What does it have to do with me?

298
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,430
Why doesn't it have something to do with you?

299
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,470
If she hadn't change seats,

300
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,350
she couldn't have reduced to such a condition.

301
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,280
If you had given out paper well,

302
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,190
she wouldn't have been bullied by He Xingwen.

303
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,560
Right.

304
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,070
You have done a bad job.

305
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,920
Don't make me the scapegoat.

306
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,000
He is right.

307
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,710
Both of you.

308
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,280
Alright, I'll be more careful next time.

309
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,400
Next time.

310
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,560
Mr. Liu

311
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,760
Do you have any extra exam papers?

312
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,520
If only you had been here earlier.

313
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,070
Just now, Class 6 was short of paper.

314
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,590
They took all that left.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,110
In the teacher's office of third grade,

316
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,680
there seems to be a separate printer.

317
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,470
You can use this to copy one.

318
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,400
Okay.

319
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,110
-Thanks, Mr. Liu.  -Go ahead.

320
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,110
We gave so many gifts on the Teacher's day.

321
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,590
This new teacher

322
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,800
seems haven't received any gift.

323
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,160
Never mind, let's go.

324
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,590
Go.

325
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,590
Hello, Mr. Ding.

326
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,350
Hello.

327
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,680
Xianxian

328
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,590
Dad

329
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Why are you here?

330
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,680
How about I wait for you after school?

331
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,920
Alright.

332
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,880
Xianxian

333
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,520
I know you are detail-oriented.

334
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,430
In the new environment, with new people around.

335
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,710
Let's adapt to it together.

336
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,710
This is called Father and Daughter Alliance.

337
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,920
Do you like it?

338
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,430
I'll buy you some chestnuts.

339
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,710
It was your favorite when you were young.

340
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,590
Wait for me here.

341
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,920
Dear Xianxian,

342
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,830
this diary book

343
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,040
is a gift of the new term for you.

344
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,190
Coming into a strange environment,

345
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
a girl sensitive as you must have got

346
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,110
a lot of new thoughts and secrets,

347
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,640
and some unspeakable feelings.

348
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,830
Although you never told us,

349
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,880
I understand you, and I will always stand by you.

350
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,040
Let's do our best together.

351
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,590
Go ahead, Xianxian.

352
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,760
It turns out that dad is just like me,

353
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,560
he also needs to adapt to the new environment.

354
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,680
Dad

355
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,400
I'll do my best with you.

356
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,560
Xianxian

357
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,560
Here you are.

358
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,000
Thanks, dad.

359
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,190
What is this?

360
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,470
Dad

361
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,350
Happy Teacher's Day!

362
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,590
I'm happy.

363
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,640
My girl is getting
more and more considerate.

364
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Let me hold this for you.

365
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,590
Let's go.

366
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,950
Let's go.

367
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,680
Ding, Xianxian

368
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,160
Are you going for a walk?

369
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,040
-Auntie.  -I'm picking up Siyue.

370
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,590
Look, he is just behind you.

371
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,680
Siyue

372
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,400
Uncle Ding

373
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,000
Why is Zhou Zongtang still not back?

374
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,920
I am waiting for him to drink with me.

375
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,560
You two should drink less.

376
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,830
You two are not in the twenties.

377
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,190
Mind your health.

378
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,710
Well, Xianxian.

379
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,640
The Golden Cake I gave you,

380
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
does it taste good?

381
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,470
It's tasty.

382
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,160
I ate it up.

383
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,000
Really? That's good.

384
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,800
I'll buy you more.

385
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,350
Thanks, auntie.

386
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,070
Thanks a lot.

387
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,950
No problem.

388
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,400
The two kids really get along well.

389
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,760
Just like when you and Zhou

390
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,280
were at school.

391
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,430
That's true.

392
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,830
Nonsense.

393
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,110
Ate them up? Wouldn't you be afraid of bursting your stomach?

394
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,110
I thought you were fooling me.

395
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,230
It was actually sent by your mother.

396
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,800
I think they can go to school

397
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,920
and go home together.

398
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,880
Right.

399
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,920
Go to school and go home together.

400
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,110
We can cook breakfast in turn.

401
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,110
That's even more convenient.

402
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,880
Okay.

403
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,800
Why didn't it occur to me earlier?

404
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,680
Good.

405
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,800
Siyue, don't ride your bike anymore.

406
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,830
You can walk to school

407
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,310
together with Xianxian.

408
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,950
Is that okay, Siyue?

409
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,000
If you go home and go to school together with Xianxian,

410
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,070
I'll rest assured.

411
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,760
Is it okay?

412
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,520
OK.

413
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,590
Absolutely okay.

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,280
That's great.

415
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,830
You two are

416
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
in the same class at school.

417
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,590
You should help each other.

418
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,560
Sure thing.

419
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,880
Ding Xian gets along with me

420
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,880
really well

421
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,520
in the class.

422
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,760
Great!

423
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,680
So great!

424
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,310
Yeah.

425
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,470
Let's make it a deal.

426
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,800
OK.

427
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,880
I'll cook tomorrow morning.

428
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,830
Alright.

429
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,560
You were quite good at acting.

430
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,400
You too.

431
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,430
I'll make the food the day after tomorrow.

432
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,070
Okay.

433
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,400
Bye.

434
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,110
Alright, bye-bye.

435
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
-Bye.  -Bye.

436
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,640
Give it to me.

437
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,190
Ding Xian

438
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,680
Mrs. Li brought you something,

439
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,920
why didn't you tell us?

440
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,070
Later, I'll prepare something for you.

441
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,000
Don't forget to return her kindness.

442
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,920
Alright, I got it.

443
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,110
Good morning, Siyue.

444
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,950
Morning.

445
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,000
What's up?

446
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,000
Zhou Siyue

447
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,710
Breakfast.

448
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,430
Marinated Eggs again?

449
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,110
Really?

450
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,590
Don't you like Marinated Eggs?

451
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,830
No, I don't like it.

452
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,710
If you don't like it, you can throw it away.

453
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,920
Are you going or not?

454
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,920
If you're in a hurry, you can go first.

455
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,590
If it wasn't our parents' request,

456
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,710
do you think I would wait for you?

457
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,950
Master Zhou

458
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,350
We can only pretend in front of them.

459
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,310
Do you really take it seriously?

460
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,640
Ding Xian, if you don't want to eat it,

461
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
I can help you.

462
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,560
Here you are.

463
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,110
I didn't think you are actually so generous.

464
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,880
Young master

465
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,640
You've been working hard so early in the morning?

466
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,040
Stop fussing.

467
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,230
Stand up.

468
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Good morning, sir.

469
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,310
Sit down, please.

470
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,950
This is a free study class.

471
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,230
I'll give out a piece of paper to you.

472
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,040
I have to go out for a meeting.

473
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,400
Come on, you three.

474
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,880
Distribute the paper, please.

475
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,040
Deng Wanwan

476
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:21,950
Yes.

477
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,680
You will be responsible for
the class discipline.

478
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,680
If someone talks,

479
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,590
take down their names.

480
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,680
I'll punish them when I come back.

481
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,350
Alright.

482
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,110
Behave yourself.

483
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,350
Now everybody, stop talking.

484
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,520
I'm ready to take down names.

485
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,070
Liu Xiaofeng

486
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,160
Can I use your math notes?

487
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,400
Notes, math notes.

488
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,040
Deng Wanwan

489
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,430
Ding Xian and Liu Xiaofeng are distracting me.

490
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,190
He Xingwen

491
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,680
Ding Xian was just borrowing notes
from me.

492
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,920
We were not chit-chatting.

493
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
How did we distract you?

494
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,560
Never mind.

495
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,560
Look.

496
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,070
Names were taken down.

497
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,640
Mr. Liu

498
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,000
Ding Xian was just borrowing notes from me.

499
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,680
We didn't chitchat.

500
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,040
Borrowing notes?

501
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,110
Why didn't do it when the class was off?

502
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,590
I think you just

503
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,000
don't take the study seriously.

504
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,310
Both borrowing notes,

505
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,400
and changing seats.

506
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,190
Don't you think I couldn't find it out?

507
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,160
Do you, Ding Xian?

508
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,230
Mr. Liu, I know I was wrong.

509
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,560
Ding Xian, I don't want to criticize you,

510
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,920
but you really have to

511
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,640
adjust yourself recently.

512
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,760
Auntie Liu has gone mad.

513
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,430
Look at you!

514
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:37,830
Mr. Liu

515
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,640
You have...

516
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,160
I want to report.

517
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,160
Song Ziqi also chatted in the class.

518
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,590
Song Ziqi, how could you be so bold?

519
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,920
Stand up.

520
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,830
Not only me,

521
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,710
Kong Disha and the guy behind me

522
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,520
also chatted.

523
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,230
And, so did He Xingwen.

524
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,950
Stand up, all of you guys.

525
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,000
You seem to be honest now.

526
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,160
You are good.

527
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,590
You are under great pressure,

528
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,470
but you still have time to chitchat.

529
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,520
If you have nothing to do,

530
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,880
don't leave after school.

531
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,280
Do the cleaning here.

532
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,190
Don't go home before it is finished.

533
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,880
It's all your fault.

534
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,760
What are you looking at?

535
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,590
Sorry.

536
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,160
Feel good?

537
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,680
Ding Xian, why are you being so obnoxious.

538
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,950
If it wasn't you,

539
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,430
I wouldn't have been here doing the cleaning.

540
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,400
Why haven't I got one peaceful day

541
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,190
since you moved beside me?

542
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,230
He Xingwen, don't go too far.

543
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,920
What did Ding Xian do to you?

544
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,710
Why did you aim at her anytime?

545
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,760
Why?

546
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,190
Why do you always speak for her?

547
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,590
Who are you to her?

548
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,350
He Xingwen, how can you talk in this way?

549
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,070
You are not gentlemanly at all.

550
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,160
If you go on like this, be careful that Siyue may beat you.

551
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,310
What does it have to do with me?

552
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,280
Just kidding, just kidding.

553
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,350
Wait and see, you all.

554
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,640
Mr. Ding

555
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,880
Mr. Liu, you are off the class?

556
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,070
Are you busy?

557
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,000
No, I'm not.

558
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,400
I want to have a word with you.

559
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,430
Alright, please.

560
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,000
Have you heard about that

561
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
there was a student in Class 8, Grade 3.

562
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,430
He had always been the top student,

563
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,110
but later he fell out with his classmate.

564
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,760
After that, his grades descended sharply.

565
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,310
Really?

566
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,310
In my view,

567
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,400
academic performance is indeed important,

568
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,920
but the relationship in school is also important.

569
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,800
It shouldn't be ignored.

570
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,950
Mr. Liu

571
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,350
Did Xianxian have some problems?

572
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,230
To speak frankly,

573
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,880
a student reported to me

574
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,920
that Ding Xian had some arguments with her classmate.

575
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,350
Let me help you.

576
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,520
Thanks.

577
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,950
Don't mention it.

578
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,350
You spoke for me before.

579
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,230
I haven't thanked you yet.

580
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,350
But I have never seen someone

581
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,470
so irrational.

582
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,400
He deserves it.

583
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,070
Ding Xian, He Xingwen is so annoying.

584
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,280
Why don't you change back?

585
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,310
Let's take a break.

586
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,470
No, the class supervisor just said that.

587
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,470
It's impossible to change back now.

588
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,560
It's all Deng Wanwan's fault.

589
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,560
If she hadn't taken your seat,

590
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,800
there wouldn't have been so many troubles.

591
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,070
Never mind, let it be.

592
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,350
Let's go.

593
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,520
Let me do it.

594
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,800
Can you not

595
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,760
walk around all-day

596
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,070
with a thermos flask in your hand.

597
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,920
It's so annoying.

598
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,280
Your daughter had conflicts with others in school,

599
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,590
aren't you worried?

600
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,070
She only has to do good in her lessons.

601
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,190
Such a young kid, what relationship do they need?

602
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,070
I'm telling you, this is bias.

603
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,350
Let's go to the arcade this weekend.

604
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,760
Okay.

605
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,880
We can call Deng Wanwan with us.

606
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,590
She asked me.

607
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,520
Actually, I think,

608
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,870
Deng Wanwan is not that obnoxious.

609
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,000
She is cordial.

610
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,949
She is not like Little Monster, who is like a piece of wood,

611
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,280
and easy to get angry.

612
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,710
Do you remember...

613
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,600
So noisy!

614
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,120
Did I get an auditory hallucination?

615
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,800
I seem to have heard the voice of Little Monster.

616
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,000
Couldn't you keep your voice down?

617
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,120
Do you hear that?

618
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,670
She is so sensitive.

619
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,120
Xianxian

620
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,800
Dad

621
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,710
Here you are.

622
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,190
This is...

623
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,910
This is some snacks for you, I'm worried about you being tired.

624
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,280
Enjoy it.

625
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,760
Thanks, dad.

626
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,600
Look at this year's Olympic Games,

627
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,280
our country

628
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,560
is so strong now.

629
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,870
Dad

630
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,870
Wasn't the Olympic Games held last year?

631
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,000
Last year?

632
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,280
I took the newspaper randomly.

633
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,760
It was one of last year's newspapers.

634
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,390
Xianxian

635
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,120
You have read

636
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,470
the current political news, right?

637
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
Yeah.

638
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,910
Our teachers told us to read the news more often.

639
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,910
It may appear on the exam paper.

640
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,670
Yeah, that's right.

641
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,840
Since I'm here,

642
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,040
let me talk with you more about that.

643
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,630
You know, our country is

644
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,760
getting more and more powerful

645
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,190
in the world.

646
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,520
We have launched the first

647
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,150
man-made moon orbiting satellite,

648
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,470
and we held the Olympic Games last year.

649
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,710
You know how many countries

650
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,430
gave us a thumb-up?

651
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,230
But

652
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,320
we have to maintain stable minds

653
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,840
and keep developing.

654
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,470
Diplomacy.

655
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,760
Especially the relationship with other countries.

656
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,080
We have to maintain it well.

657
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,600
Do you know why?

658
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,360
Let me be simple with you.

659
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,600
Let me give you a metaphor,

660
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,190
alright?

661
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,760
For example the earth

662
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,430
is your class.

663
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,280
You are China.

664
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,950
The countries of the world

665
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,230
are your classmates.

666
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,470
China.

667
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,760
You.

668
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,870
China.

669
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,630
If you want to

670
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,360
develop well in this class,

671
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,320
what do you have to do?

672
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,560
I have to

673
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,280
be self-independent and strong

674
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,120
so that you can earn the respect.

675
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,670
It's true for a country,

676
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,430
true for a nation,

677
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,150
also true for a person.

678
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,230
You have to seize the fate

679
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,670
in your hands at any time.

680
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,000
That's the style of a major country.

681
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,190
That's what our teacher said.

682
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,670
It makes sense.

683
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
But

684
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,950
I think that...

685
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,320
I think you should eat fewer snacks.

686
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,230
Let me tell you,

687
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,360
tomorrow, bring these snacks

688
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,430
to your class,

689
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,950
and share them with your classmates.

690
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,800
And also this box of chocolate,

691
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,120
bring it to Zhou Siyue.

692
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,190
No, I won't.

693
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,600
You...

694
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,710
That's a must.

695
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,000
Eat less.

696
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,230
It makes you fat.

697
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,950
Study hard.

698
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,430
Bring them to classmates.

699
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,120
Who should I give?

700
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,470
Mr. Ding

701
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,230
Siyue

702
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:19,670
Good morning!

703
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,430
Good morning!

704
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,710
Siyue, wait a moment.

705
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,910
Well...

706
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,560
Siyue

707
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,560
Let me ask you something.

708
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,630
Did something happen to

709
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,280
Xianxian in school

710
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,430
that made her unhappy?

711
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,560
What's wrong, Uncle Ding?

712
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,390
Recently, I feel that

713
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,760
Xianxian has been unhappy when she is at home.

714
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,430
I asked her,

715
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,870
but she didn't tell me.

716
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,470
I'm afraid that she has met

717
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,080
some troubles in school?

718
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,840
Alright, rest assured, Uncle Ding.

719
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,470
I'll pay more attention to her in class.

720
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,320
Okay, thank you, Siyue.

721
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,360
Come to my house for dinner when you're free.

722
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,190
Dad

723
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,840
Xianxian

724
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,710
You two go ahead to school, I gotta go.

725
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,360
Are you not going to the class?

726
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,190
It's gonna be late.

727
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,280
You walk inside.

728
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Thank you.

729
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,150
Little Monster, Siyue.

730
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,150
Why do you two

731
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,150
walk so close.

732
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,000
No, we don't.

733
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,190
Why are you running?

734
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,710
What's wrong?

735
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,150
Why do you bring so many snacks?

736
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,520
It's my father.

737
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,040
He insisted on letting me do the diplomacy,

738
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,120
and to promote relationships with
my classmates by sharing these snacks.

739
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,150
Then why don't you share with them?

740
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,800
I don't know who I should share with.

741
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,320
I racked my brains,

742
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,280
and I find that I'm familiar with you the most.

743
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,600
Xianxian, getting along with classmates

744
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,080
can be step by step.

745
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,080
As time goes by,

746
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,320
You'll find that everyone

747
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,600
can be nice.

748
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,520
I trust you.

749
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,040
You can make it.

750
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,630
I can make it.

751
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,390
Alright everyone, dismiss now.

752
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,280
Free activity.

753
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,120
Let me help you.

754
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,950
Thank you.

755
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,910
No biggie.

756
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,080
Do you think girls

757
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,360
have really simple minds?

758
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,040
Alright,

759
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,470
let me show you something.

760
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
I don't know others,

761
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,910
but that's true about her.

762
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,870
You know her so well.

763
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,630
Do you have a crush on her?

764
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,000
I have a crush on you.

765
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,280
Gross.

766
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,840
Then, are you breaking off the engagement with her?

767
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,670
Can you stop talking nonsense?

768
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,670
You're in the 45 place, while I'm in the 38 place,

769
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,120
what makes you judge me?

770
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,600
Song Ziqi, what are you saying?

771
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,520
You want to make trouble, don't you?

772
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,950
Make my deskmate happy.

773
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,630
I'll concede you three points if you make her happy.

774
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,040
Little Monster, you're a big man.

775
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,390
I was wrong.

776
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,950
Never mind, I spare you.

777
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,190
Siyue, let's play the basketball.
