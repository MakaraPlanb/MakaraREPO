Our Secret
EP01

2
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,479
Please take a look at our press.

3
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,600
Thank you.

4
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, you there.

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
This is the boy's dormitory.

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
You can't get in.

7
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,200
I know. I am a freshman.

8
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,079
I just need to go inside to look for someone.

9
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
That's not OK. You can't go against the rule.

10
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Just give me two minutes.

11
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,880
What's the matter with you, kid?

12
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,560
Just two minutes.

13
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,160
No.

14
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,680
If you keep doing this, I have to call the security office.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
Zhou Siyue.

16
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,880
Zhou Siyue, I am coming for you now!

17
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Zhou Siyue, come out now!

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,960
If you don't come out, I'll go in.

19
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,480
Zhou Siyue.

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,760
Zhou Siyue, I am coming to you now.

21
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,680
Zhou Siyue.

22
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
Ding Xian.

23
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,440
Zhou Siyue.

24
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
I am so glad to meet you.

25
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,520
You don't answer my phone calls or messages.

26
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,280
I thought you wouldn't come out to see me.

27
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
I am here to tell you something.

28
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,159
Say it.

29
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
I like you.

30
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,760
Did you ever like me?

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ding Xian.

32
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
I have no intention to have a relationship with anyone.

33
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,760
It's late. You should go back.

34
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,440
Focus on your classes.

35
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,160
Don't come for me again.

36
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,320
We promised to go to Huaqing University together.

37
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,760
Now I've fulfilled my promise.

38
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,000
I just want to know,

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,960
have you ever liked me?

40
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
Does it really matter,

41
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
yes or no?

42
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Ding Xian.

43
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,760
We both have our own lives.

44
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,280
So what?

45
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,920
Zhou Siyue.

46
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,040
Do you know my secret?

47
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,320
It is late. I should leave now.

48
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,360
Activate.

49
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
August, 2009.

50
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,560
The summer in the south was really hot.

51
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
We said goodbye to Keshan Town

52
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,880
and moved to Shenhai.

53
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,240
Everything outside the window was new to me.

54
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,840
It was a new beginning.

55
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,240
I hoped Shenhai, this city,

56
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
could be friendly to me.

57
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,440
I wanted to maintain my good grades in the coming term.

58
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,360
I wanted to make new friends.

59
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,960
I hoped everything could go well.

60
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,920
Please be careful.

61
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,080
You need to be careful with this cabinet.

62
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
Come, this way.

63
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,280
Xian.

64
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,920
Your books, here you are.

65
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,640
Siyue.

66
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,680
Siyue.

67
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,520
The keys.

68
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,160
Why are you always so lazy?

69
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,400
What's wrong?

70
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,280
I sprained my ankle.

71
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,560
What are you doing here, standing?

72
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,920
Hurry up and move your things. Don't dawdle.

73
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,720
Ding Juncong.

74
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,880
So spacious.

75
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Hurry up, guys.

76
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,200
We need to have a meal outside later.

77
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Yes, the fridge, put it against the wall.

78
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,560
The rest can be put in the secondary bedroom.

79
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,920
Cong, Xian.

80
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,040
You two share one room.

81
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
- I refuse. - I refuse.

82
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,520
I've grown up

83
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,800
I don't want to live in the same room with him.

84
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,560
Or, I can live in school.

85
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,520
Live in school?

86
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,640
With such a good apartment, you want to waste money on that?

87
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,320
Do you think that we have too much money?

88
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,800
Fine. Fine.

89
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,040
There is still one small room left.

90
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,440
It doesn't need to be used as my study.

91
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
Make it a bedroom for them.

92
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,880
Is that OK, Wanxian?

93
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
OK. You two can choose by yourselves.

94
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
OK.

95
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Slowly.

96
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,760
Then I want this room.

97
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
Me too.

98
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,240
Ding Juncong!

99
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,640
Why are you pushing me?

100
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
Mum!

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What are you doing?

102
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
You!

103
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,320
Apologize.

104
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
No way.

105
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,520
Fine, if you don't apologize,

106
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
this room is mine.

107
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,200
No.

108
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,200
You are just a kid.

109
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,520
What do you want such a big room for?

110
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,160
Whatever I want!

111
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,400
I want this room!

112
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,480
Xian, you are the elder sister.

113
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,680
Just behave like one and let your brother have it, OK?

114
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,360
Mum.

115
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,560
Wanxian, where is my medical case?

116
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,240
I don't know.

117
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
Look for it by yourself.

118
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,120
You...

119
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,360
How did the medical case disappear?

120
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
Xian, are you alright?

121
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
I am fine.

122
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,200
If you are fine, hurry up then.

123
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,800
The Zhou family is waiting.

124
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,640
I don't want to go.

125
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,160
Don't dawdle. Hurry up.

126
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,240
Coming!

127
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,560
- Zhou. - Wencheng.

128
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,280
I've looked forward to your visit.

129
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,040
Please, come in.

130
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,840
Say hello to Uncle Zhou.

131
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,960
You don't have to change your shoes.

132
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,680
- Hello, Uncle Zhou. - Hello, Uncle Zhou.

133
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,400
You don't have to change them.

134
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,040
Better change them.

135
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,960
We don't want to stain your floor.

136
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,960
What is this about?

137
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,080
I have caused troubles for you about the school thing.

138
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,560
Just take these as a token of my gratitude.

139
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,360
Why are you being so formal with me now.

140
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,560
I will put these here.

141
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
Don't need to change your shoes. Just come in.

142
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,080
Xiaoyun.

143
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,320
Wencheng is here.

144
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,560
Hello.

145
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,640
So busy here, huh?

146
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Hello.

147
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,120
Hello.

148
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,120
Ding, Wanxian, welcome.

149
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,280
This is

150
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,920
Auntie Li, whom I always mentioned to you guys.

151
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,240
Right?

152
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
Sorry, Auntie Li.

153
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,640
Actually my mum never mentioned you before.

154
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
I've always wanted to pay you a visit with Xian.

155
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,360
Right?

156
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,040
The first sign of the rebellious phase of adolescence,

157
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,120
lie without blinking.

158
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,560
Auntie Li, nice to meet you.

159
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,960
I have heard a lot about you from my mum.

160
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,320
Such a good girl.

161
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,080
Wencheng, have a seat.

162
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Right, come in.

163
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,040
Please sit down and get ready for the meal.

164
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
OK. Change your shoes.

165
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,360
Your dad and Uncle Zhou have been friends since they were kids.

166
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,680
It's all for your Uncle Zhou's help that your dad can work in Shenhai.

167
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
Don't mess around, you two.

168
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,160
Before you come,

169
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,760
I told Xiaoyun that

170
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,720
- it's been too long since last time we met Wencheng. - Please sit.

171
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,400
We must have a good drink tonight.

172
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,760
Right? A good drink.

173
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,120
Hurry up.

174
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,720
You don't object, right?

175
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,640
Not at all.

176
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,280
You should drink some too.

177
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,760
OK, thanks.

178
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
They are Siyue's classmates.

179
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,480
They come to play games today.

180
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,680
Uncle, Auntie.

181
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,920
-Hello. -Where is Siyue?

182
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
He falls asleep again.

183
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,080
Get him out.

184
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,600
Childe Zhou, stop sleeping.

185
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,720
Your mum is asking you to come for meal!

186
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,520
Coming.

187
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,400
Study makes Children these days too tired.

188
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,680
So many people here.

189
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,760
Siyue,

190
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,960
say hello to your Uncle Ding and Auntie Ye.

191
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,800
Hello, Uncle Ding, Auntie Ye.

192
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
You have grown so much.

193
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,400
Sorry about him being late.

194
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,640
What to be sorry about? Come on.

195
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,160
It has been years since we last met.

196
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,720
Let's toast and celebrate.

197
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,320
Right, welcome, guys!

198
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,600
Thank you. Sorry for the troubles.

199
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,000
Thank you so much.

200
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,360
Help yourselves.

201
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,120
Xian, do you still remember?

202
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,920
This is Siyue. You two met when you were still kids.

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,960
Siyue,

204
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,360
a really handsome boy.

205
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,520
You have grown so much so quickly.

206
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,240
I hugged you when you were still a kid.

207
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,600
How time flies!

208
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,200
That's right.

209
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,120
They are in high school now.

210
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,040
Right, Xian.

211
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,160
I heard your rank was high in the senior high school entrance examination.

212
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,640
695.

213
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
That's great.

214
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,200
It wasn't that good.

215
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
Our Xian,

216
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
she was studying until two o'clock midnight.

217
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,800
And she won't listen to my persuasion.

218
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
She loves studying so much.

219
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,240
Siyue, how's your grade?

220
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,720
Me?

221
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,160
680.

222
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,960
But that barely reaches the minimum passing score.

223
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,560
Siyue is very talented.

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,240
He passed the line even though he took the exam casually.

225
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,080
Before the exam, we played video games together.

226
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,520
You are also Siyue's classmate, right?

227
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,880
What's your score?

228
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,080
Auntie.

229
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,320
No matter how the grade is,

230
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
if you pass, then it is enough.

231
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,400
The same as what I told Xian.

232
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,840
Enough is good enough.

233
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
But our Xian,

234
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,920
she loves studying so much and doesn't want to lose to anyone.

235
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,640
OK. Talk less and eat your meal.

236
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,480
I can tell that Xian is a good girl.

237
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,120
She will definitely achieve something in the future.

238
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
That's because you taught her well, Ding.

239
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,640
That's not my credit. You are joking.

240
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,000
I need to learn from you.

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,960
Learn from me?

242
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,440
We learn from each other.

243
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,600
Indeed. Regarding her study,

244
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
Xian never worries me.

245
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,440
Siyue,

246
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,160
if you get any problems about study,

247
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,560
you two can discuss them together.

248
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,920
Xianxian knows them well.

249
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,720
No problem, Auntie.

250
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,520
I will.

251
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,680
That's great.

252
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,000
You guys

253
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
should contact more from now on.

254
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,720
After all, your grandfathers

255
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
had a betrothal planned for you when you were still kids.

256
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,880
Why did you mention that?

257
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
But the topic goes there naturally.

258
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,920
That is really the case.

259
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
But it is too early for them

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,720
to talk about this.

261
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,200
After all, they are just high school students now.

262
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,280
Right.

263
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
They need to put study in the first place.

264
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,480
Come on.

265
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,520
What should I do to break off the betrothal?

266
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,800
You are such a kid. Your Auntie Ye is just joking.

267
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,680
And you take it seriously?

268
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,320
That's right.

269
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,680
I am joking along with Auntie Ye.

270
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,400
Come on.

271
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,480
What an interesting kid.

272
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,040
Who wants you?

273
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,120
Uncle Ding, Auntie Ye, please excuse me.

274
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,560
I am full already.

275
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,200
You eat so little?

276
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,240
I ate too much this morning. Please continue.

277
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,040
Me too. I am full now.

278
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Me too.

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Come on, ignore them.

280
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,280
Sorry about them.

281
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
The boys of this age are

282
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,200
kinda rebellious.

283
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,880
Right.

284
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,840
Same here, too.

285
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,480
Right, they are quite the same.

286
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,880
Sis, I need to go to the bathroom.

287
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,520
OK. I'll take you there.

288
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,120
I scored 695.

289
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,360
Our Xianxian is such a nice girl.

290
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
She doesn't need me to worry.

291
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,640
Our Xianxian knows everything.

292
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,000
Her mother wants to claim kinship with Siyue.

293
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,480
Who still makes child betrothal nowadays?

294
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,080
Right. So funny.

295
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,120
Did you see the bump on her head?

296
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,040
Didn't it look like a horn?

297
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,080
She tried to hide it from us, but we still can see it.

298
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Like the monster Shrek.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,440
That green one, right?

300
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,640
Who's his wife anyway?

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Fiona.

302
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,040
Fiona.

303
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,840
Princess Fiona.

304
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,480
Princess Fiona.

305
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
Princess Fiona.

306
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,000
How do you feel?

307
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,640
Now that you have a fiancée,

308
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
how do you feel?

309
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,320
Can you cut the crap?

310
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,840
You dare to kick me again?

311
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,680
Sis, the toilet paper runs out.

312
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,240
No way. Do you think that she heard everything?

313
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:25,960
What should we do?

314
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,880
Open the door.

315
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,480
Fix the mistake you made. Hurry.

316
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,040
Monster...

317
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,960
Beauty, what can I help you with?

318
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,400
There is no toilet paper in the bathroom.

319
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,640
Do you have any?

320
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,760
Yes.

321
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,400
Toilet paper. Toilet paper.

322
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,120
You can't drink anymore.

323
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,600
No, can't drink anymore, Zhou.

324
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,360
Didn't you just hear everything?

325
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
You're good at drinking now.

326
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
If I break off the betrothal,

327
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,120
will you be happy?

328
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,280
Yes.

329
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,760
Then I won't.

330
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,680
The second sign of the rebellious phase of adolescence,

331
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,520
I won't let you satisfy.

332
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,640
Here is your paper.

333
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,160
This kid.

334
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Look at you.

335
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
You really don't know how to grasp a chance when it comes.

336
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,600
What a good chance today,

337
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,440
and why don't you

338
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,880
talk with Siyue more.

339
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,640
I don't know what to talk to him.

340
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,680
There is nothing for us to talk about.

341
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,600
You are just like your dad.

342
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
You guys don't know how to socialize.

343
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,280
When you enter the society in the future,

344
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,400
you will definitely be at a disadvantage.

345
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,040
But take a look at Zhou Siyue,

346
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,160
he must be very popular.

347
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,320
Didn't my social life all ruined by you?

348
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,640
How dare you talk to your mother like that?

349
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,520
What are you looking for?

350
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,360
Where is my hat?

351
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
It is not here. Stop that.

352
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
You make such a mess. I can't tidy it up.

353
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,520
Go.

354
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
Then do you know where the drugstore is?

355
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
How should I know?

356
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,080
When I tidy everything up, I will look for your medicine.

357
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Xianxian.

358
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
Maybe I can go with you?

359
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,760
No, dad. I can go myself.

360
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
I am going to the drugstore now.

361
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,480
Yes.

362
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,760
Trash.

363
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,880
Boring.

364
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,800
What are you going to do this afternoon?

365
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,320
Play basketball.

366
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,920
Dude, don't you see how my foot injured?

367
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,360
Can you show some mercy?

368
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,160
Ouch!

369
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,600
So now you know it hurts.

370
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
When you spoke ill about the girl just now,

371
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,120
didn't you feel happy?

372
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I am not joking. It really hurts.

373
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,840
And

374
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,320
it starts to feel

375
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
more and more painful.

376
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,480
Perhaps

377
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,320
you guys can take me to the doctor's.

378
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,000
I happen to know a place.

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Where is it?

380
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,680
Can you not grab me when you are hurting?

381
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,280
Young boy, you can't even take this pain?

382
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,160
Doctor, can you be more gentle?

383
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
It'll be finished right away.

384
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,800
I can't take it.

385
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,960
Miss,

386
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,360
are you from Shen Hai High School?

387
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
The new term is about to start.

388
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,880
I know what you are looking for.

389
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,680
This.

390
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,280
To help you boost your memory.

391
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,600
These.

392
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,720
Take them back.

393
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,800
Let your parents boil them up.

394
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,760
I am not here for these.

395
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,240
Then what do you want to buy?

396
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,520
I, here.

397
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,240
What did you bump into?

398
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,280
Some kind of ghost.

399
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,480
I don't care what you bumped into. I recommend

400
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
this to you.

401
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,000
I promise that if you apply it on today,

402
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
you are as good as new tomorrow.

403
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,360
Like you've never bumped into anything.

404
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,960
Come on, have a try.

405
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
You can do it!

406
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,200
I will pay the bill first.

407
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,880
Hang in there.

408
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Siyue, I'll go with you.

409
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,080
Boss, the bill.

410
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,600
Wait a second.

411
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,840
What a coincidence.

412
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,560
Not my intention.

413
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
Why is your bump getting even bigger?

414
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,920
I don't want to mess around with you.

415
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,400
Boss, I won't buy it.

416
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,960
Miss, you haven't paid.

417
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,560
I didn't use it.

418
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,480
It is opened. How can I sell it to others?

419
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,840
How much is it?

420
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,400
It should be 100. But since you are student,

421
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,480
I will give you a 20% off.

422
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
80, then.

423
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,160
80?

424
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,040
It is only around ten Yuan in my hometown.

425
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,200
This is a patent of our shop.

426
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
Its cost is high.

427
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,080
Can I buy half of it?

428
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,400
Half?

429
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,320
Are you kidding with me, Miss?

430
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,040
Boss, I'll take it.

431
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,520
This is for the foot massage?

432
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,240
Is that enough?

433
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,560
This is?

434
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,800
For the drug.

435
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,960
Thank you.

436
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,200
I'll wrap it up for you.

437
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
Thank you.

438
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,440
When I get my pocket money next week, I'll give you back.

439
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,400
How about

440
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,960
treating me a meal now?

441
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,280
Then we are even.

442
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,720
OK.

443
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,800
What do you want to eat?

444
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
A big meal, of course.

445
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,520
Let's go.

446
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,400
Miss,

447
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,760
your medicine

448
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,000
Thanks.

449
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,200
You are welcome.

450
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,240
Take care.

451
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,000
Boss.

452
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,320
Here you are.

453
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,400
Give me some fish balls.

454
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,080
OK.

455
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,360
Boss.

456
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,880
One more marinated egg.

457
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,840
Please wait a moment.

458
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,360
Have a seat.

459
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,600
This is the big meal you want to eat?

460
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,640
This shop has been here for over a dozen years.

461
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,800
Its food is delicious.

462
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,160
About that thing today,

463
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,280
you don't need to think too much.

464
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,320
They are just like that.

465
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,840
Big mouth, but they don't mean harm.

466
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
Here you are.

467
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,200
Thank you.

468
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,480
Have a taste.

469
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Have a taste.

470
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It is not poisonous.

471
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,200
It is actually tasty.

472
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
Why don't you eat?

473
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,360
I am not hungry. It's for you.

474
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,520
There are many delicious foods in Shenhai.

475
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,440
You can have a try if you get the chance.

476
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,400
Boss.

477
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,280
One more marinated egg.

478
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,120
Sure.

479
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,160
I don't need another one. One is enough.

480
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,600
This is for your bump.

481
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,400
Not for you to eat.

482
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,040
Look at your bump on your forehead.

483
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,080
It is becoming a horn now.

484
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,920
A horn? What horn?

485
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Here you are, the egg.

486
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,200
I'll pay now.

487
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,880
OK.

488
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,920
I'm home.

489
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,520
Why did you get another one of this?

490
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,600
I just bought one two days ago.

491
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,720
The shop assistant recommended me to buy it.

492
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,520
The quality looks good.

493
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,120
And they even gave me an apron for free.

494
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,480
Right.

495
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,560
The new term is about to start the day after tomorrow.

496
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,000
Have you prepared everything?

497
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,040
Actually, I am going to school tomorrow.

498
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,480
Tomorrow?

499
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,240
I got confused by so many things.

500
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,480
It doesn't matter. It is all the same.

501
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,560
The new term is about to start. Be careful not to catch a cold.

502
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,480
There is a big day-night temperature difference in this season.

503
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,720
I will fetch you a coat.

504
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,960
Don't bother.

505
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,480
I am fine.

506
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,920
Maybe it was just someone spoke ill of me.

507
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,600
Marinated egg.

508
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,960
Stupid marinated egg.

509
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,520
Tomorrow,

510
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,800
I'll finally become

511
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,000
a member of the Shen Hai High School.

512
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,240
But I hope

513
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,720
tomorrow, as the term begins,

514
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I won't encounter

515
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,840
that guy.

516
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,960
It's really gone.

517
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,040
Ding Xian.

518
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,080
Hurry up.

519
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,880
Or you won't catch up with your father.

520
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,000
Dad, you go first.

521
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,560
I'll go to school by myself.

522
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,320
I am late.

523
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,360
Fine, you go by yourself.

524
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,200
Hurry up.

525
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,000
Ding Wencheng.

526
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,040
Be more sensible on your first day at work.

527
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,840
OK. I'm leaving.

528
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,160
Take care.

529
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,440
Mum, did you see my school badge?

530
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,720
No, where did you put it?

531
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,760
I...

532
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,840
Why are you laughing? Did you take it?

533
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,200
No, I didn't touch anything.

534
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,120
It must be you.

535
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,640
Ding Juncong, did you take it?

536
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,200
Give it back to your sister now. See how anxious she is.

537
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
I didn't take it.

538
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,600
Ding Xian, did you get it?

539
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,360
No.

540
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,520
Where did you put it?

541
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,320
You put things around casually.

542
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
I just put it on the desk.

543
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,640
You're going to be late.

544
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,480
Hurry up, Ding Xian. Just go.

545
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,800
Then I'll go first.

546
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,880
How can a girl just sit on the floor?

547
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,440
Mum, goodbye.

548
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,560
Take it slow. Be careful.

549
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,040
Hey.

550
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,600
Jiang Chen.

551
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,240
I've lent you my bike for the whole summer vacation.

552
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
Give it back to me this noon.

553
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,440
I am late for school now.

554
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,120
Isn't the school this way?

555
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,680
Don't close the gate!

556
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,240
Dear teachers and students,

557
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,320
as the zephyr greets us

558
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,720
and flowers bloom, in this good season,

559
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,960
we've welcomed a bunch of new students to our school.

560
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,120
Here, let's express

561
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,840
our welcome to them.

562
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,680
In the National College Entrance Examination that just came to an end,

563
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,320
the senior high school department of Shen Hai High School,

564
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,040
has again acquired...

565
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,920
You,

566
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,120
why are you late on the first day of the new term?

567
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
I got lost.

568
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,240
Lost?

569
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,600
Why didn't you lose yourself then?

570
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,560
Go stand at the back!

571
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,360
Go!

572
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,320
Here,

573
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,800
I want to express my sincere congratulation to everyone.

574
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,000
I know that

575
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,640
many students are from the main campus of this school.

576
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,080
And I believe

577
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,600
that you are all familiar with the place.

578
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,000
But,

579
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,440
high school is a brand-new start for all of you.

580
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,080
You are quite early.

581
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,240
Such bad luck.

582
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,920
Together with the teachers,

583
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,960
I wish you could build

584
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,440
a good study environment.

585
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,360
I have known you for so many years.

586
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,680
What's the matter with my borrowing your mirror?

587
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,400
No way.

588
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,000
Stingy.

589
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,400
You are the one who is stingy.

590
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,240
Then lend me your mirror.

591
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
I don't want to.

592
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,000
Fine.

593
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,360
After knowing each other for so many years,

594
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,560
our friendship finally comes to an end.

595
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,560
Kong Shadi.

596
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
What, Song Ziqi?

597
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,920
How come I can never get out of your control?

598
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,160
Who wants to be your deskmate?

599
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,240
Good for you. You are late for school on the first day.

600
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,440
What to be scared of?

601
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,600
I am not the only one who is late anyway.

602
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,920
Why are you looking at me?

603
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,400
Is there another seat for me to sit?

604
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,600
Where is your school badge?

605
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,720
You guys are so done.

606
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,440
You guys will surely become

607
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,800
the VIPs of Auntie Liu.

608
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,320
Auntie Liu?

609
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,400
Who?

610
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,200
You don't know?

611
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,320
The teacher on the opening ceremony.

612
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,600
Talking non-stop.

613
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,840
Just like my auntie.

614
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,360
He meddles in everything.

615
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,680
From your grade to your hair length.

616
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,400
Anything he can meddle in.

617
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,360
I believe you two have experienced it just now.

618
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,240
Good morning, guys.

619
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,400
I am your new politics teacher.

620
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,120
My name is Ding Wencheng.

621
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,560
Mr. Ding.

622
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,600
Can we start the lesson with the exercises we did?

623
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
That's OK, too.

624
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,680
Then, everyone. Take out the paper of last year.

625
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,240
Let's take a look at the first question.

626
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,280
Stand up.

627
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,040
Good morning, teacher.

628
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,920
Sit down please.

629
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,840
Deng Wanwan, before we elect the class leaders officially,

630
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,760
you will be the acting class monitor.

631
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,440
Sure.

632
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,320
I want to add a few points.

633
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,280
You see how she is showing off?

634
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,760
-The National College Entrance Examination -After Yang Chunzi took a leave,

635
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,960
she has become so hyped up.

636
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,800
is like thousands of troops and horses crossing a single-log bridge.

637
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,120
From this moment on,

638
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,800
it's officially started.

639
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,680
There is no turning back.

640
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,840
Now that you have entered this gate,

641
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,920
you guys are members of Shen Hai High School already.

642
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,640
At least, you should live up to

643
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,440
the name of Shen Hai High School.

644
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,160
You need to prepare mentally for your study.

645
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,400
There is no need

646
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,920
to take notes about those meaningless pep talk, right?

647
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,440
You will learn a lot of difficult subjects.

648
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,520
Did anyone tell you not to peek around?

649
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,280
And

650
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,880
I have a name.

651
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,960
OK.

652
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,360
Got it.

653
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,760
And let me tell you,

654
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,960
don't try to talk to me so much from now on.

655
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,440
I try to talk to you?

656
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,600
You keep talking to me, don't you?

657
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,320
Don't try to cotton up.

658
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,560
We are about to change seats soon.

659
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,760
Which means, we're just temporary deskmates.

660
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,520
Fine.

661
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,160
Temporary deskmates.

662
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,320
About the arrangement of your seats,

663
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,840
it is not in a hurry yet.

664
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,360
The placement test is one month later.

665
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,520
I'll give you one month

666
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,760
to review

667
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,560
all the knowledge you've learned.

668
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,960
After a month, based your grade,

669
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,920
I will then rearrange your seats.

670
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,440
And,

671
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,200
from now on,

672
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,800
if I find anyone not wearing his or her school badge,

673
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,000
he or she can go home directly.

674
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,920
I will not call names.

675
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,320
But they know exactly whom I am talking about.

676
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,560
Uncle Ding.

677
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
Bocong.

678
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,800
I never thought you would teach our class.

679
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,040
Where do you sit?

680
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,360
There.

681
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,120
My poor eyesight. I didn't even see you just now.

682
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,159
The books are piled up.

683
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,520
It is natural that you couldn't to see me.

684
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,120
Look how much you have grown.

685
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,560
It feels like yesterday

686
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,840
that you and Xianxian running around together.

687
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Right, Uncle Ding.

688
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,880
Xianxian got in our school through the exam, right?

689
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,320
She is in Senior One Class Three.

690
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,560
Xianxian has always looked up to you.

691
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,800
That's why she studied so hard to get into Shenhai.

692
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Is that so? Senior One Class Three is a key class, right?

693
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,320
She is much better than I first entered the school.

694
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,840
Uncle Ding, now that you become a teacher of our school, I feel reassured.

695
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,360
In this case, you can

696
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,880
take care of Xian.

697
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,600
Right, like at noon,

698
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,360
I can have lunch with her.

699
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,560
I need to hurry now.

700
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,240
They want me to join a meeting.

701
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,040
OK, see you around.

702
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,680
Uncle Ding.

703
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,880
Uncle Ding.

704
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
Thank you.

705
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,320
Just take it slow.

706
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,760
Siyue, let's have lunch.

707
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,080
Let's go, Miss Temporary Deskmate.

708
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,280
Are you guys going or not?

709
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,360
I am starving.

710
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,240
Go.

711
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,320
Wait a second.

712
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
I have something to talk to you.

713
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,320
The Teachers' Day is coming, right?

714
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
I want to talk about the gifts for teachers.

715
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Right, Siyue.

716
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,320
Mr. Liu asked for you.

717
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,520
Something about joining the Olympic competition group.

718
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,120
Then, wait for me, guys.

719
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,880
Sure.

720
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,840
Why is Zhou Siyue not here yet?

721
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,000
If he doesn't come now, there will be nothing left in the canteen.

722
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Where is he now?

723
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,040
I don't know.

724
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,800
Ding Xian, let's go for lunch.

725
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,720
I heard that the canteen of the senior department is quite fancy.

726
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,960
It is not like that in main campus of our school.

727
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,320
That's it. We should stop waiting for him.

728
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,440
Go. Let's go to have lunch.

729
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,320
My dad still wants to eat with me at school.

730
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,720
That's embarrassing.

731
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
You guys go.

732
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,760
Why is she running away again?

733
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,280
You two are to blame.

734
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,760
You kept picking at her in the morning.

735
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
That's why she doesn't want to eat with us.

736
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,600
Why has it anything to do with me?

737
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,120
You should ask Childe Zhou here,

738
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,360
what he did do to upset her.

739
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,080
It's none of my business.

740
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,200
Then explain to me.

741
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,760
Why did she run as soon as she saw you?

742
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,120
It's her legs.

743
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,720
You should ask her.

744
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,600
You can't put it that way.

745
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,720
Didn't you guys have, like,

746
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,680
a child betrothal?

747
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,000
What?

748
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,080
Don't you know?

749
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,360
Come, let me tell you.

750
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,920
That was a dark night.

751
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,200
You couldn't even see your own fingers.

752
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,960
Our Childe Zhou here...

753
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,240
Are you going to keep talking and talking?

754
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,320
No, sorry.

755
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,600
I am just kidding. I'll shut my mouth.

756
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,640
Hold on.

757
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,240
Xianxian.

758
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,640
Hello, Bocong.

759
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,680
You don't try to find me when you are now in Shen Hai High School?

760
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,840
I was afraid that you might be too busy.

761
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,040
Senior three.

762
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,760
It terrifies me when I think of it.

763
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
It's not that terrible.

764
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,720
How about you? What do you feel in the school?

765
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,360
I didn't lie to you, right?

766
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,200
Shen Hai High School is a stressful place.

767
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,680
I am not kidding about it.

768
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,480
Students from the main campus and those from other schools

769
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,600
are really different.

770
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,280
I don't think they are so different.

771
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,440
You don't need to think too much.

772
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,720
Just make more friends.

773
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,040
Makes your high school life more meaningful here.

774
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,600
I will try my best.

775
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,240
Have a taste.

776
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,840
Famous dish of Shen Hai High School, stewed pork with brown sauce.

777
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,680
Special perk for Senior Three students.

778
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,080
Look.

779
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,680
Little Monster knows that guy?

780
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,280
Delicious.

781
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,760
Who's that?

782
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
I heard about him.

783
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,760
Su Bocong.

784
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,360
Arts class of Senior Three.

785
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,560
He is quite a gentleman.

786
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,280
His grade is very good too.

787
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,920
He is unlike you guys.

788
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,800
You say this because he is handsome?

789
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,600
I heard that he was also from Keshan.

790
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
That's why he knows Little Monster.

791
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,480
Eat your meal, would you?

792
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,480
Hear me out.

793
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,280
I heard that this guy is really awesome.

794
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,000
His grades are excellent.

795
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,240
More importantly, he studies very hard.

796
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,760
For three years, he has never been out of Top 10.

797
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,120
Badass.

798
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,600
How good-looking that is!

799
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,080
Siyue, have you decided what to buy?

800
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,760
What? Gift for Teachers' Day.

801
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,200
I told you this morning.

802
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Count me in.

803
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,960
Quit your nonsense.

804
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,800
Is she talking to you?

805
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,880
Maybe later.

806
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,440
Ding Xian, your textbooks are so new.

807
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,200
You don't need to go to tutor classes during vacation?

808
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,960
No.

809
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,360
You are so relaxed.

810
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,000
So many students in our class have already

811
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,600
finished learning the textbook of this term.

812
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,480
So what?

813
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,760
I forgot it all anyway.

814
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,120
I had no fun during the vacation.

815
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,720
I thought that

816
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,120
I could be more relaxed since I came from the main campus.

817
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,680
But we didn't have textbooks then, right?

818
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,040
You can borrow them from your seniors.

819
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,360
I almost forget.

820
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,640
You are not from the main campus, right?

821
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,440
You seem to be the first to come from Keshan.

822
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,880
It is not a surprise that you can't borrow the textbooks.

823
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,840
Stand up.

824
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,400
Good afternoon, teacher.

825
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,760
Sit down please.

826
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,120
We will talk about functions today.

827
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,520
Functions are actually quite simple.

828
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,520
It is not as complex as you think.

829
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,640
Let see the exercise

830
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,160
from the last college entrance exam.

831
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,720
Like this one here,

832
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,080
it is basically a point you must get.

833
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,200
Get the f(x).

834
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,200
How should we solve this question?

835
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,480
Use the method of undetermined coefficients.

836
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,560
How to solve it? Louder.

837
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,400
Use the method of undetermined coefficients.

838
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,640
This is a method you have been taught.

839
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,360
How come some of you still don't know it?

840
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,080
That girl at the back,

841
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,360
stop looking.

842
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,480
Don't look around. It is you.

843
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,800
Stand up.

844
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,760
How should we solve this question?

845
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,040
I don't know.

846
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,440
What?

847
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,080
I don't know.

848
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
Zhou Siyue.

849
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,000
You answer it.

850
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,080
Read extracurricular books?

851
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,560
I shall see how you work this out.

852
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,560
The method of undetermined coefficients means

853
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,360
f(x)=ax²+bx+c.

854
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,160
Put this formula into the known equation,

855
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,600
we can get that a=1/2.

856
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,240
b=-2.

857
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,440
And since we know that f(0)=2,

858
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
then c=2.

859
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,240
Very good.

860
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Zhou Siyue, please sit down.

861
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
You sit down too.

862
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,640
Did you all get it?

863
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,520
Yes, sir.

864
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,040
Interested?

865
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,080
No.

866
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,000
Stop being narcissistic.

867
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,880
I mean the book,

868
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,920
not me.

869
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,960
Is it not cottoning up with you, right?

870
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,040
Miss Temporary Deskmate?

871
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,760
Childish.

872
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,200
You've taken so many notes down.

873
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,160
Can you review them all?

874
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,360
None of your business.

875
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,960
This paragraph here,

876
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,880
the only useful part is this formula.

877
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,000
You just have to memorize this.

878
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,440
About your habit of taking every note down,

879
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,680
if you keep doing it,

880
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,960
you will be sifted out of the key class soon.

881
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,120
You are just above the minimum passing score.

882
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,680
You're ranked 45th and I am 38th.

883
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,880
Who are you to judge me?
