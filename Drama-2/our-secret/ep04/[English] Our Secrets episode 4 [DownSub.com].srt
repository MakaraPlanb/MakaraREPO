Our Secret
EP04

2
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
Jealous.

3
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:52,970
Jealous.

4
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,410
Good morning.

5
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,050
Good morning.

6
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,500
Good morning.

7
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,930
Xianxian

8
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,180
Dad

9
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,540
Your mom told me that

10
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,500
you want a phone?

11
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,100
How about this?

12
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,490
You use mine first,

13
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,980
and I'll use my old PHS.

14
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,980
No, dad, it's all right.

15
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,060
I have nothing urgent,

16
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,260
but just to keep contact with my classmates.

17
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,980
It's okay for them to call me on
our fixed-line telephone.

18
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,930
Alright.

19
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,340
Invite your classmates

20
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,490
to our home for a dinner

21
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,490
some other day,

22
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,980
to deepen your friendship.

23
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,730
Okay.

24
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,620
It's not your handwriting, right?

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,770
It's pretty good.

26
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,100
Yeah, it's Zhou Siyue's.

27
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,490
I nodded off during the English lesson,

28
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,490
and missed the key-points.

29
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,700
So he wrote up the notes for me.

30
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,700
Look at you, falling asleep in class again.

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,490
Anyway, it's really nice of Siyue to

32
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,210
exchange seats and write notes for you.

33
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,900
He helped you a lot, right?

34
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,290
Dad

35
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,650
How did you know about exchanging seats?

36
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,730
It can't be you who

37
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,930
let him do all these stuff, right?

38
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,700
No wonder I saw you two talking

39
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,260
downstairs the other day.

40
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,620
So that's why he's been so considerate.

41
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,210
Well, Xianxian

42
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,370
I asked Siyue

43
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,100
for help so that you won't get

44
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,540
-bullied.  -Dad

45
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,620
Stop doing this.

46
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,490
I don't need you to do these things.

47
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,180
I can take care of myself well.

48
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,930
Just leave me alone.

49
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,930
Moreover,

50
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,460
I don't want anyone to do

51
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,900
something they don't like for me.

52
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,980
It's not something

53
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,820
we don't like, Xianxian.

54
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,340
In fact, Siyue and I...

55
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,100
Good morning.

56
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,330
Morning.

57
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,930
Just yourself?

58
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,020
Where's your deskmate?

59
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,330
No idea.

60
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,540
Did you have a quarrel?

61
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
No.

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,170
We're not that close, anyway.

63
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,140
I'm going for the teacher to recite the text.

64
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,140
Well, look at you.

65
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,170
Did you annoy your deskmate?

66
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,260
She...

67
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,490
She stood me up this morning.

68
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,860
I almost got late for school.

69
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,820
I don't think I have annoyed her.

70
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,210
Truly old friends are like wine,

71
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,820
the older, the better.

72
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,210
Well done.

73
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,890
I can see your efforts.

74
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,890
Keep working.

75
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,420
Thank you.

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,580
I remember your deskmate is Zhou Siyue, right?

77
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,490
Go find some time to practice with him.

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,330
He's good at spoken English.

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,370
Don't be shy.

80
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,490
It's quite normal for classmates
to help each other.

81
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,740
He's already helped me a lot.

82
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,140
Alright, go back now.

83
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,650
Are you serious? I just had one sip of Coke.

84
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,260
I'm so sorry. I...

85
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,580
I didn't mean it. I'm so sorry.

86
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,770
-Just go back to class and wipe it.  -I'm sorry.

87
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,890
Do you have nothing to do?

88
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,260
Let's go, go.

89
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,050
I'm so sorry.

90
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,930
It's okay. I don't need it.

91
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,980
Keep it.

92
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm sure you don't want to go back to class like this.

93
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,140
Thank you.

94
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,650
Why didn't you wait for me this morning?

95
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,370
I have known everything already.

96
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,540
It was my dad who asked you to take care of me, right?

97
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,700
That's the reason?

98
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,820
Sorry to trouble you.

99
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,140
You don't have to do these if you don't want to.

100
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,020
What are you laughing at?

101
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,980
Never mind.

102
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,820
You probably don't remember.

103
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,170
What?

104
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,100
Tell me.

105
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,580
I own you something, in fact.

106
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,980
When I was five,

107
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,650
I went back to my grandpa's home.

108
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,580
I stayed at your home

109
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,980
during the flood, do you remember?

110
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,490
Hey, I wanna go to the toilet.

111
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,050
It's outside there. Go yourself.

112
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,610
You wetted the bed. Shame on you.

113
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,300
There's no toilet.

114
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,210
I couldn't hold it and I...

115
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,890
It's right outside.

116
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,610
I don't know how to use it.

117
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,020
You are old enough to use the toilet.

118
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,770
I'll tell my mom.

119
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,100
Don't do it.

120
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,890
I'll take you out

121
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,260
next time when you're in town.

122
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,539
I can't believe you had such an
embarrassing moment.

123
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,650
You...

124
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,650
Don't you dare say it to anyone.

125
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,980
So where are we going to play around?

126
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,180
What?

127
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,860
You promised.

128
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,770
You are fishing in troubled water.

129
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,540
How could you treat me like this?

130
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,500
At 1:00 pm on Saturday,

131
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,450
wait for me in front of your home.

132
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,420
What did you do last night?

133
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,890
I just couldn't fall asleep.

134
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,060
You seem to be in a good spirit.

135
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,250
Go coach Ding Juncong for math later.

136
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,010
I'm engaged this afternoon.

137
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,570
What things do you have on weekend?

138
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,380
I'm going to school for the blackboard newspaper.

139
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,650
It will be checked next week.

140
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,420
I remember you failed to be
elected as a class committee member.

141
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,690
Just for help.

142
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,570
Don't do it anymore.

143
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,810
It's a thankless job,

144
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,250
and may waste your study time.

145
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,500
Checkmate.

146
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:27,980
I'll take one move back.

147
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,100
No, no. Don't do this.

148
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,620
-Don't take it back.  -Brother Li.

149
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,570
-You are here, Zhou.  -You are playing chess.

150
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,380
Checkmate.

151
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,380
-Are you sure?  -Checkmate.

152
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,940
You can't take it back, understand?

153
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,420
Excuse me then.

154
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,380
It's my poor eyesight. I didn't see it.

155
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,130
It has been five times, Uncle.

156
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,420
One move, one move.

157
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,770
Only one move.

158
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,250
You're here.

159
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,980
I'm gonna leave now, Uncle.

160
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,060
Enjoy yourself.

161
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,130
Can't take the joke, right?

162
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,860
What's wrong today?

163
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,180
Uncle, I'll take his place.

164
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,300
What's the matter?

165
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,500
It's your fault. You come so late.

166
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,210
You little snail.

167
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,100
Well, I'm a girl.

168
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,570
What's the smell?

169
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,450
Nothing.

170
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,770
Fried chicken wings.

171
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,940
Thank you, Sir.

172
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,420
Okay.

173
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,380
My treat this time.

174
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,540
I'll never let a girl pay the bill.

175
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,330
It seems that you often go out with girls.

176
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,500
How could it be possible?

177
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,330
Just eat.

178
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,330
Are there any good spots in Shenhai?

179
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,500
Good spots?

180
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,690
Maybe the science and technology museum.

181
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,500
The sea theater is okay, too.

182
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,180
I know there's one bridge

183
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,100
from which we can see the beautiful night view.

184
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,060
Long years ago, it was a small fishing village.

185
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,130
As the economy has grown recently,

186
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,620
it gradually thrives.

187
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,010
Sometimes I think you are really excellent.

188
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,180
You know everything and can do everything.

189
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,210
Compared with you,

190
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,180
it's true.

191
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Can't you be a little humble?

192
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,620
Ding Xian

193
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,060
Actually,

194
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,250
when you stop being so one-track minded,

195
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,860
you are quite...

196
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,060
What?

197
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,770
Quite like a normal girl.

198
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,620
I think you are the abnormal one.

199
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,540
Okay.

200
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,570
Inform me in advance

201
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,210
when you wanna go somewhere.

202
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,300
I'll show you around.

203
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,450
Xianxian

204
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,300
Su

205
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,540
Why are you here?

206
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,010
I come to buy some stuff.

207
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,130
This is...

208
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,330
your deskmate?

209
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,380
You are quite close.

210
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,450
Nuh...

211
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,060
I think I have heard of him.

212
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,130
He's Zhou Siyue, right?

213
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
You know him?

214
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,500
I've heard of him a lot. He's popular.

215
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,690
By the way, have you listened to the

216
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,500
CD I gave you?

217
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,860
Yes, my teacher praised me for that.

218
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,620
Thanks a lot, Su.

219
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,940
It's all right.

220
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,180
I'll ask Uncle Ding to

221
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,690
bring you some more.

222
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,250
Okay.

223
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,420
Alright,

224
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,210
you can go back now.

225
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,980
Then see you later, bye.

226
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,890
Bye-bye.

227
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,770
Why have you eaten all my fish balls?

228
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,300
I thought you were

229
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,860
too happy to eat.

230
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,940
That does not mean that you can have all of them.

231
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,250
There's only one left.

232
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,650
I'm full.

233
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,210
Let's watch a movie this afternoon, okay?

234
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,250
My treat.

235
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,540
Okay.

236
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,130
What movie do you want to watch?

237
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,540
How about this?

238
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,860
A Hollywood film.

239
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,980
"2012"

240
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,770
Okay, wait a second.

241
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,890
I'll go get the tickets.

242
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Excuse me.

243
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,740
What are you doing?

244
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,330
Thank you.

245
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,380
Thank you.

246
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,500
What's this?

247
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,740
3D glasses.

248
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,860
Haven't you watched it before?

249
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,330
I have.

250
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,210
Of course I have.

251
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,570
Let's go.

252
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,570
Sorry.

253
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,890
Excuse me.

254
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,980
This row.

255
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,330
Siyue

256
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,980
Ding Xian

257
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,980
You

258
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,810
do feel a little upset, right?

259
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,500
Upset about what?

260
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,860
You should be upset.

261
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,410
Idiot.

262
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,930
Now I have returned your favor,

263
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,930
and we are quits then.

264
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,900
And I don't need your help then.

265
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,780
For real?

266
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,380
The final exam is coming.

267
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm wondering if there's anyone

268
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,020
coming to ask for my help.

269
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,170
Don't worry. It's not gonna be me.

270
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,810
Ding Xian

271
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,660
It's the class supervisor.

272
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,330
Ding Xian, why are you running?

273
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,570
Ding Xian, stop running.

274
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,210
Hello?

275
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,500
Hello, sir.

276
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,500
Are you interested in buying a house?

277
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,660
No, I'm not.

278
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,410
Maybe you can learn about it first.

279
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,930
It's a very good deal to buy it
with the housing loans.

280
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,450
I don't need the loan either.

281
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,810
Sir, it's okay to learn about the loans

282
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,140
even if you don't buy the house.

283
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,140
What's the point to know about the loans
if I don't buy the house?

284
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,260
Has he gone?

285
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,450
I got a house to live in.

286
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,170
I'm not short of...

287
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,980
Uh, I'm kind of short of money.

288
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,450
Listen, how did you

289
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,450
calculate the interest?

290
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,260
You call this a low rate of interest?

291
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,100
I'm telling you,

292
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,900
I can't be fooled by you.

293
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,900
You know who I am?

294
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,210
I'm a teacher.

295
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,330
I'm a math teacher.

296
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,660
Your numbers...

297
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,500
Keep saying.

298
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,980
It's not right.

299
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,810
Wait a second, hang in there.

300
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,140
Hang in there.

301
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,290
Hello?

302
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,570
Well, tell me about your

303
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,050
rate of interest.

304
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,930
What do you think

305
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,260
of the end of the world

306
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,020
in 2012?

307
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,260
I think there's gonna be an

308
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,170
earthquake, a tsunami,

309
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,500
a volcanic eruption.
Something like that.

310
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,530
Just like what the movie showed.

311
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,500
I don't think so.

312
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,530
Even if we human beings do

313
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,210
face extinction,

314
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,450
we'll face the death

315
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,330
with the last beauty,

316
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,260
with the fireworks

317
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,930
all over the sky.

318
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,660
Could you think of something nice?

319
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,930
Like what we will be

320
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,050
doing in 2012.

321
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,690
I may be enjoying the beauty of

322
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,810
the West Lake in Hangzhou.

323
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,330
It's Hangzhou again.

324
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,140
What about you?

325
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,860
Doing experiments

326
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,810
in Huaqing.

327
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,140
You wanna go to Huaqing University?

328
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,020
Sure.

329
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,810
You are good enough to

330
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,930
be admitted.

331
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,690
What about you?

332
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,260
Don't you wanna go to

333
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,380
see better scenery?

334
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,690
I...

335
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,020
I can't do it.

336
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,810
A bigger goal is more

337
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,930
worthy to challenge.

338
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,570
Moreover,

339
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,450
I have never seen anyone

340
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,570
who works harder than you.

341
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,930
Trust yourself, you can do it.

342
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,930
A word to you:

343
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,050
there's still a light of glory on the other side.

344
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,660
Good one. It's good.

345
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,330
I'll come back later.

346
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,780
You are here.

347
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,570
Good for you, Song.

348
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm so tired.

349
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,260
Siyue

350
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,050
How about coming to the countdown party

351
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,260
with Little Monster?

352
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,930
Little Monster.

353
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,020
I thought you don't like her.

354
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,210
Why do you invite her to the party?

355
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,290
It was just a misunderstanding
at the beginning.

356
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,810
It turned out that

357
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,930
she's quite interesting

358
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,100
when she holds her stubborn temper.

359
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,290
What about you, Jiang Chen?

360
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,780
Will you join us?

361
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,260
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

362
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,740
I already have plans.

363
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,380
You just forget us

364
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,410
once you got your new friends in high school.

365
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,690
Look at him, dressing like this

366
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,660
to play basketball here.

367
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,810
I'm so busy.

368
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,620
You are lucky to have me here.

369
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,260
Come on.

370
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,140
Don't fool us around.

371
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,290
Go, just go play yourselves.

372
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,050
Go, let's go.

373
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,100
Leave him alone.

374
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,140
Enjoy yourselves.

375
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,210
What's on the card

376
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:26,860
from Little Monster?

377
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,570
What card?

378
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,930
Her self-made card.

379
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,860
She sent cards to me and Shadi.

380
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,740
Haven't you received it yet?

381
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,290
I'm leaving now, mom.

382
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,740
Siyue, wait a second.

383
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,100
I heard from Wanxian that Xianxian

384
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,860
has been taking traditional Chinese

385
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,660
medicine to nourish her vitality lately.

386
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,100
Would you like to take some

387
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,330
since you have been working so hard?

388
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,500
I'm okay.

389
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,570
She said it's quite bitter

390
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,100
and quite effective.

391
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,500
Xianxian takes it every day.

392
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,500
Oh yeah?

393
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,330
Morning.

394
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,980
Morning.

395
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,100
Is it Chinese medicine again made by your mom?

396
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,810
Yes.

397
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,290
My mom said that I need to take it

398
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
to nourish my vitality since winter is coming.

399
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,980
You sure need it.

400
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,620
You are too weak,

401
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,740
nodding off in class every day.

402
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,810
I'm not weak, okay?

403
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,170
Just finish it.

404
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,260
Is it really this bitter?

405
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,690
It does taste very bitter.

406
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,860
A candy bar.

407
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,210
Still feel bitter now?

408
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,500
It's blueberry flavor.

409
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,980
I remember you don't like to eat candy.

410
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,620
Go to the class now.

411
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,450
Won't you go with me?

412
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,450
I'm waiting for Song Ziqi

413
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,140
to give him something.

414
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,260
You go first.

415
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,380
Spend the holiday with us tonight, okay?

416
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,260
You know I have no interest in

417
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,050
celebrating holidays.

418
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,210
Stop making an exception any more.

419
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,980
You leave early every year.

420
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,170
Can't we spend the

421
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,740
New Year's Eve together like a family?

422
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,260
Now let's begin the early exercises.

423
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,290
Turn to page six in book seven and read

424
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,530
the text we learned yesterday together.

425
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,930
Where's my card?

426
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,740
I knew it already.

427
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,050
Kong Shadi and Song Ziqi have

428
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,780
both received your cards in advance,

429
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,170
while your deskmate
still has not received your card

430
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,860
on New Year's Eve.

431
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,170
You said you are not a fan of
celebrating holidays, didn't you?

432
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,660
It's the holiday that I don't like,

433
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,740
not the present.

434
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,620
So everyone got it except me.

435
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,020
Zhou Siyue, Ding Xian

436
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,810
Go stand outside.

437
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,860
I never said I didn't prepare for you.

438
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,570
I draw it myself.

439
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,330
The former one was messed by my brother,

440
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,980
so I made a new one.

441
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,900
I know it's a little bit late now.

442
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,050
Don't open it now. Open it when you get back.

443
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Good for you.

444
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,330
So when you were not with us,

445
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,260
you didn't study either.

446
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,690
To use the card-making time, your math

447
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,620
grades can be improved at least 20 scores.

448
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,100
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

449
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,170
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

450
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,980
Give me that.

451
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,380
You two

452
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,620
come to my office now.

453
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,810
You are required to copy the text ten times?

454
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,050
It's scaring.

455
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,740
15 times.

456
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,500
You ran into auntie during the rebuking.

457
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
So there're five times more.

458
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,100
It's really unlucky of you two.

459
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,290
He is now in climacteric.

460
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,260
You should thank god since he

461
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,210
didn't let you do examination papers.

462
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,660
Xianxian, what do you do on the New Year's Day?

463
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,780
How about hanging out together?

464
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,290
We'll talk about it later.

465
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,570
I haven't received the results

466
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,330
of the math quiz last time.

467
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,780
Come on, you didn't join us last time.

468
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,260
I was so bored

469
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,170
to hang out

470
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,450
with them.

471
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,210
How about this?

472
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,740
I'll go with you if I do well

473
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,170
in the math exam

474
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,260
this afternoon.

475
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,170
Really?

476
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,260
Then it's a deal.

477
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,500
God bless you to get a high grade in the exam.

478
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,330
Come on, one more bite.

479
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,260
They provide you energy to copy.

480
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,290
It's already over

481
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,660
to trust her.

482
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,500
Shut up.

483
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,930
What?

484
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,930
You felt boring to go out with us?

485
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,210
We don't even wanna take you out.

486
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,140
Right, Siyue?

487
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,780
You can't blame Shadi.

488
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,290
You were sort of boring, in fact.

489
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,170
Come on, you're hurting my feelings.

490
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,290
You seem like really enjoy
eating my foods.

491
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,900
I can't see you're hurt.

492
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,410
Sorry, I'm

493
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,930
just sharing your burden

494
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,140
in case you get too tired.

495
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,860
That's sweet.

496
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,930
Why don't you help me with the copying
since you wanna share my burden?

497
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm just a little hungry right now.

498
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,690
Well,

499
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,690
our handwritings are quite different.

500
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,620
You've eaten all the meat.

501
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,050
Alright, I'll do it.

502
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,810
Don't laugh at my poor handwriting.

503
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,330
Come here, Deng Wanwan.

504
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,210
Help me to give the papers out.

505
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,530
Xianxian

506
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,980
How's your exam?

507
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,210
Stop asking.

508
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,210
I can't go out with you.

509
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,740
You've improved a lot.

510
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,810
Let me see it.

511
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,930
Your score is twice higher than hers.

512
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,450
Alright.

513
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,410
Stop talking now.

514
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,290
Look at your scores.

515
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,900
Do you still have the nerve to talk around?

516
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,900
Won't you be worried?

517
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,780
As the holiday is coming,

518
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,050
your hearts are already not

519
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,980
in school, right?

520
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,620
Being late for school,

521
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,260
sleeping during class,

522
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,380
and talking during lessons,

523
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,290
you really impress me a lot.

524
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,290
For this semester,

525
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,690
some of you learned nothing but the

526
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,290
talking skills with your
surrounding classmates.

527
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,690
Your mouths just never stop.

528
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,100
All I hear is your murmuring.

529
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,930
The seats will be rearranged

530
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,530
right after the final exam.

531
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,050
I'll see how you will chat in this way.

532
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,380
Sit back.

533
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,100
No one can leave

534
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,780
without my word.

535
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,020
Take out your papers now.

536
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,330
Sighing for what?

537
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,330
I owe you nothing.

538
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,050
Look at the last but one question on your paper.

539
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,780
The 17th.

540
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,140
It's worth ten points.

541
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,500
We're gonna change seats next semester.

542
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,570
Where are you gonna find
such a nice deskmate as me?

543
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,170
Stop flattering yourself.

544
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,980
Are you really gonna stay at home
for this whole holiday?

545
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,330
Didn't he say you have improved a lot?

546
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,260
It's far from a lot.

547
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,690
It's only two places above
my former one.

548
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,900
The score and the rank are different.

549
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,410
No one can make huge progress in such a short time.

550
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,530
You'd better relax yourself rather

551
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,140
than keep pushing yourself like this.

552
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,140
Moreover, I remember that you said

553
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,380
it's good enough to raise for one place.

554
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,810
Now you changed your mind.

555
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,330
The final exam is coming
right after the holiday.

556
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,620
I'm thinking that next semester...

557
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,170
What?

558
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,740
I wanna make it easier for the next semester.

559
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,530
I have already been left behind.

560
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,330
From Senior One to Senior Three,

561
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,980
it's a short period.

562
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,530
Easier?

563
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,530
Alright.

564
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,660
Listen, it's just Senior One now.

565
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,690
Let me remind you.

566
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,330
It can only get harder, not easier.

567
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,740
Listen to me,

568
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,410
the college entrance examination

569
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,210
is a narrow bridge for
millions of people to cross.

570
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,900
Okay.

571
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,570
You remember this line quite clear.

572
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,620
But

573
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,020
stop pretending to work hard,

574
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,690
all of you.

575
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,330
The results can't lie to you.

576
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,020
Alright.

577
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,900
This holiday only has three days,

578
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,050
which are not a period for you to relax.

579
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,500
If anyone makes the same mistakes

580
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,290
once again after the holiday,

581
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,980
copy it ten times.

582
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Do you understand?

583
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,980
Yes.

584
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,500
You are dismissed.

585
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,420
The class is over.

586
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,699
Come on, let's go.

587
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,050
Go. Let's go.

588
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,860
The seats will be rearranged

589
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,139
right after the final exam.

590
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:48,330
I'll see how you will chat in this way.

591
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,420
To work harder, if I don't want a new deskmate.

592
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,180
Look at the young couple,

593
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,490
they are perfect for each other.

594
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,620
Xianxian did not step out of her room
for the whole day.

595
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,860
Is there anything wrong?

596
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,900
I'll have a look.

597
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,380
All other parents are only too anxious

598
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,460
to see their kids working hard.

599
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,250
Look at you, all you do

600
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,900
is keeping bothering her.

601
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,530
She should alternate work with rest.

602
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,810
Besides, it's on holiday now.

603
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,050
Don't fuss.

604
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,010
She'll get out herself when she's tired.

605
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,050
Just leave her alone.

606
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,180
Here,

607
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,250
eat this.

608
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,730
Mom, I wanna go out to set off fireworks.

609
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,700
No.

610
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,460
I don't care. I'm going out.

611
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,100
Keep your voice down.

612
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,660
I'm going out.

613
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,220
I'm setting off fireworks.

614
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,770
Hush, stop shouting.

615
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,100
Alright, alright.

616
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
Just take him out

617
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,050
since he wants the fireworks.

618
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,220
It's quite lively out there.

619
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,180
Well, it's a good time for Xianxian

620
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,180
to relax herself.

621
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,730
Wait a second, I'll go get your sister.

622
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,660
Okay, okay.

623
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,660
All you know is playing.

624
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,420
Xianxian

625
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,220
Okay, take a picture now.

626
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,290
It goes out very soon.

627
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,330
Hurry up.

628
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,290
Do I look good with this posture?

629
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,330
Yeah.

630
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,140
Really?

631
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,250
You go down a little.

632
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,620
Like this?

633
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,770
No.

634
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,730
Just have a look to see if I look good.

635
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,250
Okay. I'm looking at it. You look great.

636
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,100
You didn't look.

637
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,730
I did.

638
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,970
Have you taken my legs?

639
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,700
Hurry up. It's going out.

640
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,730
Okay, look at it.

641
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,140
What's that?

642
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,900
You told me to squat down.

643
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,010
Where's my face?

644
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,700
So what now?

645
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,460
It's going off now.

646
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Buy me a new one.

647
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,570
Alright. I'll get you a new one.

648
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,290
All is yours.

649
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,010
Practice taking photos here.

650
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,140
Broke again.

651
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,730
You ask for it.

652
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,860
I have no choice.

653
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,420
You know, we grow up together.

654
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,660
Everyone would know when she throws a hissy fit,

655
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,860
and it's my job to amuse her.

656
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,620
You know about Pavlov's dog, right?

657
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,330
I'm the dog.

658
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,700
I'm not sure about the conditional reflex.

659
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,530
But you are indeed like a dog.

660
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,010
I'll bite you to death.

661
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,900
Hey, it's almost 12 o'clock.

662
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,010
Set off the fireworks now.

663
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
Not in the mood?

664
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,420
What's wrong?

665
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,620
Too few people.

666
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,970
I can't help feeling bored.

667
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,490
You want Little Monster to be here, right?

668
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,530
I get it now, Mr. Zhou.

669
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,250
You don't want her to feel lonely

670
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,100
at home, right?

671
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,330
It's not the thing.

672
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,250
So who do you wanna call?

673
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,530
Come on, tell me.

674
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,810
I'm trying to make you feel better
to invite Ding Xian.

675
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:06,940
What do you mean?

676
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,620
Think about this.

677
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,420
Kong Shadi will feel happy

678
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,620
once she comes, right?

679
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,100
They'll play together

680
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,810
and you'll be free.

681
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,660
Then we two...

682
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,250
Mr. Zhou, good for you.

683
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,490
Right, right.

684
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,620
Look, Song Ziqi,

685
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,220
I got two different one.

686
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,490
Great.

687
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,460
Other kids must envy you.

688
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,490
Let's go.

689
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,620
Let's go now.

690
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,770
Where to go?

691
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,100
Go find you a cameraman.

692
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,100
Xianxian

693
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,570
We go to watch the firework show with Congcong.

694
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,530
There are fruits on the table.

695
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,660
Suit yourself and don't get too tired.

696
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,810
Call us

697
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,620
if you wanna come.

698
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,530
I also want to watch it with everyone.

699
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,900
Little Monster

700
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,330
Ding Xian

701
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,770
Ding Xian

702
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,250
Little Monster

703
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,460
Come out!

704
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,900
What are you doing here?

705
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,420
They said they won't go to watch the fireworks

706
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,290
without you.

707
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,970
Don't pass the buck to me.

708
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,770
Right, get down now.

709
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
Well, it's almost 12 o'clock.

710
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,380
We'll catch a cold

711
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,730
if you don't get down right now.

712
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm coming.

713
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,940
We won't make it.

714
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,770
We may miss the fireworks show?

715
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,220
You would catch it if you didn't come to me.

716
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,330
It's all right.

717
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,730
Look at the traffic,

718
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,970
we can go somewhere else in fact.

719
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,460
Isn't it

720
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,380
too late now?

721
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,140
Get off the car now, and I have an idea.

722
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,970
Come on, keep the changes.

723
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,570
I know there's a place.

724
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,940
We can make it.

725
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,900
Let's go.

726
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,660
Go, go.

727
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,900
I'm so sorry.

728
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,290
It's okay.

729
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,290
It's okay.

730
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,490
The traffic is quite heavy anyway.

731
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,490
And we've seen it just now.

732
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,970
Look!

733
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,460
Oh my god, look. Fireworks.

734
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,460
Fireworks.

735
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,700
Awesome.

736
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,940
Happy New Year!

737
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,530
Happy New Year!

738
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,770
Happy New Year!

739
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,420
Happy New Year!

740
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,010
Happy New Year!

741
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,250
Happy New Year!
