Edward Yang De Chang once said,

150
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,750
movies have extended
human's life three times.

151
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,040
I think movies
are like a kind of program

152
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,990
that lets us experience
different kinds of life

153
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,750

The same can be applied to reading.

157

However, movies are more straightforward.

To me,

159
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,600

161
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,109
I usually cry when I watch movies.

162

I remember I fell asleep

215
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,800
on the couch last night.

216
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,680
When I woke up,

217
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,510
I was in the bedroom.

218
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,840
Thank you.

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,310
No wonder you keep aloe vera

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,510
Do you always injure yourself?

222
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,200
You had a bad sleep last night, is it?

223
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,350
Do you still want to eat?

224
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,320
Are you sure

225
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,510
it's safe to eat?

226
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm sorry.

but for the internship position,

231
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,760
we're looking for

232
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,920
someone with the basics
of financial analysis.

233
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,630

Anyway, thank you

What an unlucky year.

239
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,440
Not only our vocal left the band,
our rehearsal room was flooded.

240
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,040
I think all the instruments are ruined.

241
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,990
The vocal is back.

242
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,270
I apologise

243
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,750

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,080
can I rejoin the band?

to have something than nothing.

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,590
Goodness, is it really that serious?

I'll ask around.

I'll get back to you.

Hello, Ms Xi.

275
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,950
Sorry to disturb.

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,320
I need a favour from you.

277
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,990
My friend's rehearsal room was flooded.

278
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,040
Can you help?

279
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,230
We've formed the band since our first year

280
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,160
in the university.

281
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,230
We performed in all kinds of event.

282
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,470
I see.

283
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,230
Have you ever considered

284
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,270
to be a professional singer?

285
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,880
We...

286
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,280
Previously,

287
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,230
we sent demos to record companies.

288
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,390
However, to us,

289
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,760
sharing the same musical idea

290
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,520
with the company is very important.

291
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,590
To be frank,

292
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,320
we don't wish our works
to be affected by business factors.

293
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,160

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,440
It's okay. I get it.

Later,

297
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,830
can I take a sit in at your rehearsal?

298
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,710
Of course.

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,870

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,560
Forget it if you didn't hear it.

374
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,510
I heard it.

375
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,510
Why were you apologising?

376
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,680
Well...

377
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,680
I left without saying goodbye.

378
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,560
Forget it.

379
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,200
I forgive you.

380
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,760
It's really easy to coax me.

381
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,680
You should learn from me.

382
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm sorry...

383
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,750
Why didn't you use aloe vera this time?

384
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,160
Stop dwelling on it.

385
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,160
Aloe vera
doesn't work on injuries like this.

386
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
I'm not thinking about it.
No one is thinking about it.

387
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,390
Fine, stop moving.

388
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,950
I'm sorry, Ms Xiao Lu.

389
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,990
Sorry to have taken up your time.

390
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,470
It's okay. Don't mention it.

391
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,800
By the way,

392
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,110
during the rehearsal,

393
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,110
I recorded a video.

394
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,230
Would you mind?

395
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,470
Of course,

396
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,640
I promise

397
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,230
I'll only send it to some of my friends
in the music industry.

398
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,440
I won't spread it.

399
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,190
No problem for sure.

400
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,560
We've always wanted

401
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,350
to get some professional views.

402
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,110
Ms Xiao Lu.

403
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,720
Can I have your opinion?

404
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,630
It's getting late. Let's not hold her up.

405
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,230
You should call her Ms Yu.

406
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:48,950
I'm sorry.

407
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,950
He's just too young and naive.

408
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,350
He won't do that again.

409
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,560
It's okay, you can call me Ms Xiao Lu.

410
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,590
Come here often.

411
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,990
I'll allocate some time
to talk with all of you.

412
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,800
By the way, this is the key.

413
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
Take it.

414
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,960
Ms Xiao Lu.

415
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,800
Are you sure?

416
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,440
Or what?

417
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,590
Do I have to send someone
to watch you?

418
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,510
I have faith in my senior's friends.

419
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,630
She can't run away anyway.

420
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,159
Thank you.

421
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,590
Wait for us.

422
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,590
I'll pay you a visit in a few days.

423
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,590
Su Nian Qin.

424
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,790
Su Nian Qin.

425
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,720
Su Nian Qin.

426
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,310
Su Nian Qin, wake up.

427
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,030
Are you having a nightmare?

428
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,160
I'll not miss out on the chance

429
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,720
two times in a row.

430
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,070
Do you think I'll miss out on the chance?

431
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,760
You shouldn't do that.

432
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,520
I know.

433
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,350
My mum told me

434
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,310
girls shouldn't make the first move.

435
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,870
It will make men
feel that we're easy to get.

436
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,760
I think my mum is right

437
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,280
but I refuse to listen to her.

438
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,990
You...

439
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,520
Su Nian Qin!

440
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,240
I like Su Nian Qin.

441
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,590
Since the first time
I saw him by the lake,

442
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,680
I've fallen in love with him.

443
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
Why?

444
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,760
You're asking why again.

445
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,310
Love at first sight.

446
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,200
The blind doesn't understand English.

447
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,870
Why are you smiling
if you don't understand it?

448
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,440
Say it, why are you smiling?

449
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,000
You always bully me!

450
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Why are you so bad?

451
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,790
Stop moving.

452
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,390
I didn't touch you.

453
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,830
You can't reach me, can you?

454
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,790
Like I said,

455
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,200
with light or not doesn't matter to me.

456
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,070
Can you feel the difference?

457
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,920
Like this.

458
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,320
Open it.

459
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,910
Close it.

460
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,790
Open it.

461
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,060
♫ Nothing much to say ♫

462
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,830
♫ I've been waiting for something ♫

463
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,630
♫ It's written in the stars ♫

464
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,590
It's warmth.

465
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,590
♫ There's a voice in my ears ♫

466
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,790
Sunlight

467
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,570
♫ Which has been keeping me company ♫

468
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,920
is not all about brightness.

469
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,340
♫ Because of that,
I'm no longer afraid of sunset ♫

470
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,790
Warmth is very important too.

471
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,290
♫ The sun showers deliberately ♫

472
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,590
Don't you feel that

473
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,440
today's sunlight

474
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,460
♫ Drop on my shoulders ♫

475
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,500
♫ I suddenly recall something ♫

476
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,380
♫ I think I heard it somewhere ♫

477
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,390
is so warm?

478
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,060
♫ Subconsciously ♫

479
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,090
♫ I recognise you ♫

480
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,600
♫ By your astonishing voice ♫

481
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,280
What's warm is your palm.

482
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,170
♫ In the next second ♫

483
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,050
♫ You look up and smile at me ♫

484
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,360
♫ You say the lyric is a tongue twist ♫

485
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,050
♫ I quench the galaxy ♫

486
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,640
♫ In dark, naturally ♫

487
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,610
♫ We hug and hold hands ♫

488
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,590
What's wrong with the curtain?

489
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,760
Xiao Lu is my relative's sister.

490
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,790
She stays here to take care of me.

491
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Hello.

492
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,110
I'm Sang Wu Yan.

493
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,640
I have to stay away from you.

494
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,440
I have measles and it's contagious.

495
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,240
It's okay.

496
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,590
I had vaccines when I was young.

497
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,160
Have a great chat. I'm going home.

498
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,750
I came here unprepared.

499
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,390
I didn't bring anything.

500
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,200
I'll come back soon.

501
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,870
So, it's a success?

502
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,350
I'm here

503
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,720
to see if you need anything.

504
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,590
Since you need nothing, I'll leave now.

505
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,240
After all, someone is here with you.

506
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,360
By the way,

507
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,920
I'll clean the guest room

508
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,390
so that Wu Yan can come and stay.

509
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,000
Why did you choose this place?

510
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,440
I chose it because of Cheng Yin.

511
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,720
There is no lift in the building.

512
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,680
Furthermore, it's cheap.

513
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:22,910
Come in.

514
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,200
Remove your mask.

515
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,680
You won't pass it to me.

516
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,960
This is new to me.

517
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,440
All of us had vaccines when we were young.

518
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,200
Why are you still down with measles?

519
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,550
How do you know that I have measles?

520
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,030
Wei Hao told me.

521
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,790
You've transformed into
a career woman today.

522
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,270
I'm still attending interviews.

523
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,000
I came to your place

524
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,350
right after the interview.

525
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,240
You're still attending interviews?

526
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,830
Why did you leave before getting a job?

527
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,110
I thought...

528
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,920
Or what?

529
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,350
I can't take leave frequently
to attend interviews.

530
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,480
Since I've made up my mind,

531
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,480
I don't want to hold myself back.

532
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,520
How was the interview?

533
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,000
Don't ask.

534
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,310
It's the ninth interview.

535
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
I think they won't take me in.

536
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,510
Since I was given a chance,

537
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,870
I just gave it a try.

538
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,680
I must be out of my mind.

539
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,590
I told them the truth.

540
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,750
Wu Yan, I'm sorry.

541
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,240
I didn't tell you

542
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,480
before resigning.

543
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,790
I know that you
have high expectations for me.

544
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,510
But I...

545
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,550
Stop it.

546
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,760
You make me sound like a counsellor.

547
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,350
I get it.

548
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,350
I thought it through after I cooled down.

549
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,680
It's the same as me wanting to work
at a radio station

550
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,160
instead of taking the
postgraduate entrance examination.

551
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,520
It's just a matter of choice.

552
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,510
I'm sure

553
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,030
you have your own reasons.

554
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,350
No matter what,

555
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
you have my support.

556
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,030
However, you and Wei Hao...

557
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,720
Didn't I tell you...

558
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
Just forget it.

559
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,240
Don't mention it again.

560
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,320
Why?

561
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,070
You know my family well.

562
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,960
We can't choose our parents.

563
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,350
I hate it

564
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,630
but I know it clearly that

565
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,870
I have to
bear my responsibility nevertheless.

566
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,070
It's natural for me to be responsible
for taking care of my family.

567
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,160
However,

568
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,440
I don't want him to face the same thing.

569
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,000
If we become a couple,

570
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,390
and if we both
take the relationship seriously,

571
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,200
eventually, we will have to face it.

572
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,760
I don't want him to face it.
