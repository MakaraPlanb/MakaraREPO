[Episode 16]

4
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,050
Wu Yan, are you returning
to your hometown?

5
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,850
Ms Xiao Lu, I know why you're here.

6
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,329
But please don't waste
your energy any more.

7
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,840
Wu Yan.

8
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,130
Actually Nian Qin wanted to meet
you immediately the other day.

9
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,000
But his father suddenly
had an operation,

10
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,310
so he stayed over at the hospital.

11
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,230
But when the operation was over,

12
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,090
he immediately said
he wanted to meet you.

13
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,190
After that day,
he felt particularly sad.

14
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,180
He already made his decision...

15
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,310
That's his business.

16
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,860
It has nothing to do with me any more.

17
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,720
Ms Xiao Lu, everyone seeks benefits
and avoids the disadvantages.

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,870
So do I.

19
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,160
Before this, I've tried my best
to love him.

20
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,710
I really did my best.

21
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,380
So now, please let me go.

22
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,500
Hopefully...

23
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,110
Hopefully he'll find someone
braver than me.

24
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,680
My ride is here.

25
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,040
I'll be off now.

26
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,530
[The privet flowers
have fallen completely.]

27
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,510
I'm home.

28
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,340
What's the matter?

29
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,200
In the end, Wu Yan still went back
to Tongcheng.

30
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
She was adamant on leaving.

31
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,250
When she texted me, she said
she'd already boarded the train.

32
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,460
I don't know why all of the sudden

33
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,990
I just got everyone to go perform
at the night market.

34
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,100
It's because after the thing
with Wu Yan happened,

35
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,070
honestly I feel very sad.

36
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr Sang was the kindest person
I've ever met.

37
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,800
He just left us suddenly.

38
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,290
When I think about it, I'll...

39
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,330
I don't want myself to feel so sad.

40
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,920
But after they came,

41
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,710
I realized that I wasn't the only one

42
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,750
greatly impacted by Wu Yan's incident.

43
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,000
Surprisingly,
everyone decided to go home.

44
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,790
But I guess it makes sense.

45
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Ever since everyone graduated,

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,750
so many things happened.

47
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,970
It's as if there's a growing distance

48
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,810
between what we originally wanted

49
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,890
and things that we liked before.

50
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,620
It happens to everyone.

51
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,570
Wu Yan...

52
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,740
Take her for an example.

53
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,950
She may seem like a child who grew up

54
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,110
in a happy family,

55
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,960
but she faces hardships too.

56
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,940
She has to face reality as well,
doesn't she?

57
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,140
It must be the same
for Liu Lei and the rest.

58
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,420
They've got to make plans
for their future after all.

59
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,410
Future?

60
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
It's about that again.

61
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,650
Of course.

62
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,190
Try to think about it.

63
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,550
Have you every wondered

64
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,790
what everyone will be doing
at the age of 30?

65
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,500
Will everyone still be playing in band?

66
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,530
What else could it be?

67
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right.

68
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,620
I almost forgot.

69
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,330
You were the earliest to leave.

70
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,120
Right from the start,

71
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,960
you'd always felt that
this was unrealistic.

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,670
That's not how I feel.

73
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,360
It's just that I realised from the start

74
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
that I can't afford to be like you.

75
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,130
It's still the same for me.

76
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,670
Not everyone gets to
live a satisfactory life.

77
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,720
Everyone has just been making decisions

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,310
based on their respective circumstances.

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,640
You don't have to feel
uneasy simply because others

80
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,010
have chosen a different path.

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,280
What then?

82
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,960
Just go our separate ways like you said?

83
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,050
What about us then?

84
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,560
Our decisions are different too.

85
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,470
Let's calm down and try this another time.

86
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,360
There you go again.

87
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,600
Once we quarrel, you'll say that
we should cool off.

88
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,970
Then it never gets settled eventually.

89
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,770
What else can we do?

90
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,770
So I don't even have the rights
to keep calm now?

91
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,570
Please.

92
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,140
I'm not like you.

93
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,880
I face reality every day

94
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
by staying calm in order to
resolve the problems.

95
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,730
What about you?

96
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,960
Can't you be more realistic?

97
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,490
Just a little will do.

98
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,570
Can't you?

99
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,190
Alright, I understand now.

100
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,920
I have to remind you again.

101
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,070
According to the detailed test report,

102
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,530
although you're considered very lucky,

103
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,170
but

104
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,750

after coming of age

106
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,940
are really rare.

107
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,550
To be honest with you,

108
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,430
the operation success rate
is extremely low.

109
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,950
Furthermore,

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
there is no saying about
your recovery progress

111
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,440
of your post-operation sight.

112
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,530
It can even cause other
pathological changes

113
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,659
after the undergoing the operation.

114
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,590
Are you sure of taking these risks?

115
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,490
I'm sure.

[it would be nice if she had someone]

fend myself from everything else.]

I never thought

141
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,430
we'd be back here

142
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,230
just after a couple of days.

143
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,670
I, too, wasn't expecting

144

so swiftly.

[403 operation room]

146
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,480
That's because you didn't know
how hard we've been looking for it.

147
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,200
Not long after you signed up
for the waiting list,

148
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,890
your father got to know about it.

149
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,060
When he realized you haven't found a donor
while his days were short,

150
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,010
so he quickly signed the donation form.

151
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,970
Surprisingly, the hospital informed us
so soon that a match has been found.

152
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,460
Doctor, we'll go in now.

153
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,400

Once you've settled down, don't forget

157
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,560

Alright, you don't have to see me off.

I'll go to meet you.

you please.

I can't believe you actually
got yourself a job.

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,330
like him?

186
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,140
Like a computer repair guy.

187
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,280
I'll be repairing computers after all.

188
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,940
If that's the case,

189
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,320
let's forget all about it.

190
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,600
It's not a bad idea.

191
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,720
Cheers.

192
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,400
May everyone have a bright future.

193
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,590
He said that he'll send us back

194
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,030
but he ends up drunk instead.

195
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,760
We'll head home now.

196
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,580
Xu Qian, he did it all for you.

197
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,900
Should the day come when he can no longer
keep up with you,

198
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,020
talk it through.

199
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,120
Try not to hurt him too much.

200
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,530
You drank a lot. Head home quick.

201
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,510
We had to drink that much

202
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,610
in order to forget everything.

203
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,820
I'll get you a glass of water.

204
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,840
Xu Qian.

205
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,200
Come home with me, will you?

206
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,690
Wei Hao.

207
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
Why did you take up that job?

208
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,040
You don't even like going to work.

209
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,840
Isn't that what you want?

210
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,040
What I want?

211
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,870
I never wanted you to change yourself
for me.

212
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,560
Being yourself is enough.

213
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,710
There's no need for you to

214
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,670
unwillingly make a change for me.

215
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,080
Am I not doing it for you after all?

216
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,120
You want stability.

217
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,430
I work hard to become more stable.

218
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,560
The reason I want to go home

219
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,830
is also because your grandma

220
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,520
needs someone to look after her too,
doesn't she?

221
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,560
Stop making decisions on your own.

222
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,890
I've never asked you to

223
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,400
take care of my grandma.

224
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,290
Xu Qian.

225
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,840
Why won't you accept my heart?

226
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,590
Fine.

227
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,070
Tell me what you want.

228
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,250
It's not what I want.

229
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,450
I've never wanted anything to happen.

230
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,880
You did those things solely
based on your own decisions.

231
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,430
I should be the one asking you
what you want.

232
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,310
Let's get married.

233
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,970
I can't get married,

234
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,110
nor return home.

235
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,000
You should know very well that

236
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,960
I've always wanted to leave that place.

237
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,360
I spent so much effort

238
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,630
graduating out of that place.

239
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,870
I can't go back there.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,280
Wei Hao, stop being foolish.

241
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,810
Marriage or going back home

242
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,350
can't resolve the issues between us.

243
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,500
What issues do we have?

244
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,330
I don't think we have any.

245
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,650
You're always so naive.

246
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,300
You think that everything is simple.

247
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,960
But the world isn't like that.

248
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,470
Fine.

249
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,620
Do whatever you please.

250
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,350
I'll go home by myself.

251
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm leaving now.

252
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,020
Once you're up, remember to
have your breakfast.

253
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,530
♫ Dreams of a light year ♫

254
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,450
♫ Is as vast as the sadness ♫

255
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,440
♫ The earth is quiet  ♫

256
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,640
♫ Like the eyes of the stars ♫

257
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,760
♫ I want to see clearly ♫

258
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,660
♫ Every expression on your face ♫

259
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,270
♫ This way it won't shatter ♫

260
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,770
♫ The heart ♫

261
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,360
♫ From one star ♫

262
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,480
♫ To another ♫

263
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,700
♫ Tears are like crystals ♫

264
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,710
♫ Submerged in the sea of stars ♫

265
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,980
♫ Continuing its trajectory ♫

266
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,140
♫ By taking your surname ♫

267
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,340
♫ I won't be all alone ♫

268
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,840
♫ By myself ♫

269
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,130
♫ Would you then ♫

270
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,780
♫ Notice me ♫

271
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,920
Leave me alone.

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,680
Can't you let me sleep a bit more?

273
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,920
No way. Finish breakfast
before you sleep.

274
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,710
♫ There is a distant star like me ♫

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,839
It's bad for your stomach
if you always skip breakfast.

276
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,510
Hurry up.

277
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,960
Quick. Over here.

278
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,420
♫ Shining brightly ♫

279
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,230
Sit down.

280
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
♫ Because I don't know ♫

281
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,480
♫ How to express myself ♫

282
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,869
I'll do it.

283
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,190
♫ My past is full of ♫

284
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,760
♫ Ups and downs ♫

285
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,720
Where did you buy this? It's so salty.

286
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,880
♫ I won't hide from it ♫

287
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,240
I made it.

288
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,570
Didn't you say you're craving

289
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,710
thick omelette

290
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,010
your grandma used to make?

291
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,930
See? It is nice and thick.

292
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,240
I made it with five eggs.

293
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,260
♫ From one star ♫

294
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,480
♫ To another ♫

295
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,360
[Forget it.]

296
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,820
In the future, don't trouble yourself.
Just buy it.

297
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,370
♫ Tears are like crystals ♫

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,830
Is it that bad?

299
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,660

That's enough, stop eating.
You wait here.

♫ By myself ♫

305
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,270
I'll go get one from the
convenient store below.

306
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,600
It's... It's fine.

307
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,480
Seeing you run up and down
is giving me a headache.

308
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,730
♫ Would you then ♫

309
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,330
♫ Notice me ♫

310
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,340
Just wait and see.

311
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,240
[I'm going make it.]

312
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
[I'll definitely able to make
the kind that's sellable.]

313

♫ There is a distant star like me ♫

314
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,850
[Then I'll make it for you every morning.]

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,530
[Spare me, please.]

316
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,750
♫ Shining brightly ♫

317
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,810

It's so salty.

323
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,670
I'll go out and see

324
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,200
why Xiao Lu is taking so long
with the doctor.

325
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,920
You two catch up.

326
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,440
How does your eyes feel now?

327
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,910
They're fine.

328
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,150
Why did you suddenly decide
to have the operation?

329
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,280
It has such a high risk,

330
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,970
yet you never discussed it with me.

331
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,350
I'll bear the risks

332
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,340
as they're my own eyes.

333
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,430
How about you?

334
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,000
Are you feeling better?

335
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,030
It doesn't really matter.

336
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,680
The doctor said that

337
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,770
I might be bed-ridden after this.

338
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,880
But don't worry.

339
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm not going to force you
to inherit the family business.

340
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,290
You can continue the life
you're living now.

341
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,690
I'll come home.

342
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,150
I'll take charge of the company.

343
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,500
What makes you think that

344
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,680
you can return home
whenever you want?

345
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,910
Fine then. A dime a dozen.

346
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,750
Last time you said that

347
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,890
you're bringing home someone
you're marrying.

348
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,370
Where is she?

349
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,890
She doesn't want me anymore.

350
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,200
Nian Qin. I heard my sister say
you're going home?

351
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,840
How was the chat just now?

352
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,400
Why did you suddenly agree to it?

353
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,170
Nothing much.

354
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,010
I just decided to go home.

355
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,510
If that's the case,

356
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,890
will you and your father...

357
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,030
No.

358
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,550
With the state that we're both in now,

359
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,230
how can we possibly fight?

360
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,540
I've just confirmed with the doctor.

361
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,700
We can remove the bandage
in three days.

362
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,620
Are you excited?

363
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,120
It's sunset now, isn't it?

364
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,200
Do you know why I like to
listen to the broadcast?

365
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
It's because I hate sunsets.

366
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,000

00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,020
My surname is Qin.

550
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,320
It does look similar to letter Sang.

551
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,630
My apologies.

552
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,400
Formerly, I used Braille more often.

553
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,340
Why do you know Braille?

554
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,080
My father is a blind person.

555
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,840
By birth or...

556
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,600
Acquired.

557
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,670
My father was a foreman.

558
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,270
When I was two years old,

559
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,900
he had an accident at the workshop.

560
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,480
He went blind.

561
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,800
He's considered lucky then.

562
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,680
At least he has seen you
and your mother's face before.

563
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,420
No, Mr Su.

564
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,430
A completely healthy adult

565
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,910
who suddenly lost his sight

566
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,740
would receive a greater blow

567
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,250
than those who were born blind.

568
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,940
After that?

569
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,080
What happened to your father?

570
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,190
Later on,

571
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,890
they said the accident was
due to his own mishandling.

572
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,490
After coming out of the hospital,

573
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,040
he couldn't find a job for a long time.

574
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,960
He then started drinking.

575
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,190
When he was drunk, he would hit my mum.

576
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,540
After he sobered up,

577
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,590
only then he'd go down on his knees,
begging my mum not to leave.

578
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,120
He'd repent every time,

579
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,980
but continued to do it.

580
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,310
And later on?

581
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,710
When I was almost ten years old,

582
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,840
my mum divorced him.

583
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,880
She remarried, bringing me along.

584
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,800
You start work next Monday.

585
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,140
You may go now.

586
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,840
Okay.

587
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
How about this, grandma?

588
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,100
You take a bite and I'll take one too.

589
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,450
Let's see who's eaten the most.

590
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,740
Here.

591
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,250
Here.

592
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,900
I'll take a bite too.

593
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Look, grandma.

594
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,450
Xu Qian is back.

595
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,850
Didn't you complain that

596
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,230
nothing tasted nice the other day?

597
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,130
I bought you

598
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,170
your favourite canned
yellow peaches in syrup.

599
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,930
Wu Yan, thank you.

600
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,260
You must be very busy.

601
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,500
Yet you came all the way here.

602
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,510
It's fine.

603
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,230
The entrance exam is

604
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,320
something pretty manageable for me.

605
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,980
Plus, I'm here to replace Wei Hao.

606
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,430
He's working overtime so he couldn't come.

607
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,330
How could he simply
trouble others for this?

608
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,750
The both of us are close

609
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,420
so there's nothing troublesome at all.

610
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,110
I understand.

611
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,610
But it's none of his business

612
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,090
in the very first place.

613
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,020
The way things are now for you two
is uncalled for.

614
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,470
I really don't get it.

615
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,660
Things turned out this way

616
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,390
because he wanted to go home.

617
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,190
But from my perspective,

618
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,780
it isn't really a big deal.

619
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,830
Just think for a moment.

620
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,910
Back then he said he wanted to marry me.

621
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,620
[Wu Yan, let's get married.]

622
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,730
For someone like me,

623
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,330
how can I possibly get married?

624
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,530
What should I tell his parents then?

625
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,560
The truth?

626
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,780
That I don't have a father

627
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,500
and I have a mother
who's following men around?

628
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,980
Plus I have a grandma to take care of?

629
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
You can see it yourself.

630
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,870
What of kind of situation this is.

631
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,470
A young lady like me sounds terrifying.

632
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,530
Doesn't it?

633
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,660
There you go

634
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,670
saying stuff like this again.

635
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,660
Because that's the truth.

636
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,800
The truth that will follow me forever.

637
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,430
What's wrong?

638
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,360
Nothing.

639
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
I'm just a little unfamiliar with this.

640
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,680
If this happened back then,

641
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
you'd jumped at me and
start giving me a lecture

642
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,610
Back then...

643
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,640
Back then I was less matured.

644
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,850
Wu Yan.

645
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,880
Can I ask you a question?

646
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,240
Do you still

647
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,820
think of him sometimes?

648
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,070
It's so cold.

649
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,650
Brain freeze.

650
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,360
Wu Yan.

651
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,390
Recently, I've been thinking of
quitting and going back home.

652
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,590
Are you serious?

653
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,710
Yes.

654
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,550
Three years have passed.

655
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,900
I've worked hard.

656
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,800
As a human being,

657
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,560
there's no point in
giving yourself a hard time.

658
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,200
If you want, then just come back.

659
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,020
I'm always here after all.

660
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,760
So is Wei Hao.

661
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,070
I'm already inside.

662
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,600
My dear Lady Cheng.

663
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,750
Don't worry about me, okay?

664
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,430
Tongcheng is my hometown.

665
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,760
Just allow me to be a hospitable host

666
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,040
and look after you, please?

667
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,270
If I were to wait for you,

668
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,990
I'd probably be done
by the time you arrive.

669
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,520
So I'll talk to you later, alright?

670
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,560
I'm hanging up now, bye.

671
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,260
Mum, after moving in with Cheng Yin,

672
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,860
I probably won't be able to
always come and visit you.

673
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,680
Plus for this semester,

674
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,870
the research project needs to be finalized

675
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,810
and I'll have to start on my thesis paper.

676
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,330
But once I'm free,

677
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,130
I'll definitely come home to visit you.

678
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,250
You just do you.

679
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,100
Why are you rambling so much?

680
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,440
Wu Yan, I really don't need you
to look after me.

681
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,290
I feel free being on my own.

682
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,540
I don't need anyone to look after me.

683
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,740
Just go wherever you want to.

684
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,070
[But I can't go back now.]

685
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,040
This is my home.

686
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,040
If I don't come back here,
where else can I go?

687
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,630
Why is this small old lady keep

688
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,800
trying to kick her daughter
out of her house?

689
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,270
My dear daughter.

690
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,540
You think I will want you to pay rent

691
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
when you have a house to come back to?

692
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,020
I'm doing this to support
young people like you.

693
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,490
Isn't this the life concept

694
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,580
you wanted when you kept telling me that

695
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,550
you wanted freedom in your life?

696
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,460
[Abnormal Psychology]

697
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,560
Okay, you're the best, the best of all.
