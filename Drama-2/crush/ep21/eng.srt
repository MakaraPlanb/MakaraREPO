[Episode 21]

4
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,240
I...

5
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,400
Why am I here?

6
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,880
Why don't you get changed first?

7
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
I have something to ask you.

8
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,560
It's important.

9
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,240
Let me get changed first.

10
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,160
Su Nian Qin.

11
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
I...

12
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,270
I still love you.

13
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Do you love me?

14
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,600
Always.

15
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm relieved you are still

16
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,700
a crybaby.

17
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm not.

18
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,680
Your... your bathrobe is loosened.

19
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,880
It's not.

20
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,080
Serves you right.

21
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,960
You just mock me

22
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,000
instead of consoling me
when you see me like this.

23
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,760
How should I console you?

24
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,480
Should I say that

25
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,640
I'm just kidding?

26
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,630
That I actually don't like you?

27
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
You...

28
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,110
Why don't you put that effort
into lyric-writing

29
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,760
instead of teasing me all the time.

30
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,030
Let's go.

31
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
Oh no. It's really loosened.

32
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm just fooling with you.

33
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,790
I don't believe you.

34
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,960
I just want to verify

35
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,640
if you are braver now.

36
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,770
So?

37
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,170
It was just right.

38
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,800
You don't have to go to the office?

39
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,800
Work here is done.

40
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm going back to Xiamen tomorrow.

41
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,720
What?

42
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,380
[Nian Qin]

43
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,440
Hello?

44
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,159
You are home?

45
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
I am at the office.

46
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,760
Why did you go to the office immediately?

47
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,240
I have to make up for lost time.

48
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,080
To get my wife back,

49
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,500
[work had been delayed a few days.]

50
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
If you keep going on like this,
I am hanging up.

51
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Don't.

52
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,640
Call me at this hour every night.

53
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,840
You have been gone for three years.

54
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
You probably don't know that

55
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
I am now a routineer.

56
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,430
I am hanging up.

57
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,170
Let me share you a playlist.

58
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,080
Didn't you say that

59
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
listening to a song

60
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,320
makes one feel the presence
of the other person?

61
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,560
Once I send you the playlist,

62
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
you will understand.

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Okay.

64
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
[Open it after I hang up.]

65
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,590
Su Nian Qin. Are you embarrassed?

66
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,460
[You are Spring]

67
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,760
Nian Qin. What happened?

68
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,080
She is back.

69
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
I am sorry.

70
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
What's the matter?

71
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,120
You set up this dinner gathering
but you turn up late.

72
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
We have to hold back our hunger.

73
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,080
I got stalled at the pedestrian street.

74
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,000
I am really sorry.

75
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,000
There is no hurry.

76
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,400
Someone is not here yet.

77
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,560
Here he is.

78
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,640
Long time no see, Wu Yan.

79
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,800
Why do you look like
you are here for a blind date?

80
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,240
Are you not going to introduce him to us?

81
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,800
This... this is my boyfriend.

82
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,500
Hi.

83
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm Sang Wu Yan's fiance,

84
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,940
Su Nian Qin.

85
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,770
Nice to meet you, brother-in-law.

86
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,360
Why are you so tacky today?

87
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,990
Aren't you the classy Su?

88
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,400
Where's your classiness?

89
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
In that case,

90
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,120
I will make a toast to you, Su Nian Qin.

91
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,200
This is a toast to my brother-in-law.

92
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,560
Don't try to stop me.

93
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Okay.

94
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,120
But honey, you can't...

95
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,160
You drink, Wei Hao.

96
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,000
After I make a toast, you drink.

97
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,960
Then I will make a toast
to my brother-in-law too.

98
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,280
No problem.

99
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,890
I will drink for him.

100
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,480
We will leave now.

101
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,160
We will leave now.

102
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,960
Goodbye.

103
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,840
Goodbye.

104
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
He can't even drink

105
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,160
yet he still insisted.

106
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,920
What a great couple.

107
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,900
Wu Yan. Your ride is here.

108
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,400
Get in, Wu Yan.

109
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll call this ride for you
using my account.

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,080
I will go now.

111
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,200
You be good.

112
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,650
I am here. Where are you going?

113
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,760
Okay, okay.

114
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,800
Go back with me.

115
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,600
Wu Yan, you...

116
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,320
Let's leave this couple alone.

117
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,760
But...

118
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,500
Come in.

119
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,440
Here.

120
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,960
You...

121
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,840
Don't talk.

122
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,520
Hold on.

123
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Go.

124
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,280
Be quiet. Be quiet now.

125
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
Be quiet.

126
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,480
What are you looking at?

127
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,120
You hid the photos, didn't you?

128
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,200
Where are they?

129
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,560
Stop it.

130
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,280
You removed all the photos?

131
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,920
No.

132
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
There's nothing here.

133
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,840
Su Nian Qin.

134
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,870
All these years, you sent someone
to take photos of me.

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
Do you admit it?

136
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,800
What photos?

137
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,360
Those photos that Ms Xiao Lu obtained?

138
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,080
I never saw them.

139
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
I dare not do so.

140
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,480
I was afraid

141
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,680
I would rush to you if I saw them.

142
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,560
That is why you couldn't

143
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,080
recognised me back then.

144
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,030
I could.

145
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,680
Actually, I have practised it beforehand

146
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,760
about what I should do.

147
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,480
But...

148
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
But, I saw you

149
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,040
with my own eyes,

150
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,710
I chickened out.

151
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
You are lying.

152
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,880
You never saw my photos.

153
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,720
How could you recognise me?

154
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,800
I remember your voice.

155
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,000
And also your smell.

156
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Many times

157
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
throughout the years,

158
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,640
because I can clearly feel you are gone,

159
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
I actually didn't feel like doing anything

160
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,880
or wanting to live.

161
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,890
But I need to live on

162
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,920
because I have responsibilities
to fulfil.

163
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,600
Hence I could only tell myself

164
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,200
to pretend that you never left.

165
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,640
That you were by my side,
just in a different way.

166
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
I sound like a psycho,

167
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,320
don't I?

168
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
But this psycho loves me.

169
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,340
What can I do?

170
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,850
♫ Dreams of a light year ♫

171
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,660
♫ Is as vast as the sadness ♫

172
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,660
♫ The earth is quiet ♫

173
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,080
♫ Like the eyes of the stars ♫

174
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,220
♫ I want to see clearly ♫

175
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,900
♫ Every expression on your face ♫

176
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,580
♫ This way it won't shatter ♫

177
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,900
♫ The heart ♫

178
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,200
Wu Yan.

179
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,040
Wu Yan.

180
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,240
Wu Yan. What time is it? You had so much
fun until you forgot your time?

181
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,020
Quick!

182
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,440
Cover yourself.

183
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,000
No, go back in.
Cover yourself.

184
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Oh my goodness.

185
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,400
Why are you shouting at me

186
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,760
early in the morning?

187
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,410
I only came back after my gathering
ended at midnight.

188
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,920
I am so sleepy.

189
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
Let me sleep a little longer.

190
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,520
You're a grown-up now
yet you still party so hard.

191
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,480
How can I not worry?

192
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,680
You are unbelievable.

193
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,630
I must be blinded.

194
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,640
Get up quick.

195
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:42,960
I am still drunk.

196
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,200
My head hurts.

197
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,560
Don't you always drink excessively?

198
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,400
How come you still get drunk so easily?

199
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,230
I need some clothes.

200
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,710
I can't wear this anymore.

201
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,720
Okay.

202
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,670
Let's see.

203
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,470
It fits you well.

204
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,680
You bought this for me?

205
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,920
Stop asking and get changed first.

206
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,360
Why are you taking off your clothes?

207
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,640
How should I get changed
if I don't take off my clothes?

208
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,190
You've got a point.

209
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,380
I was too nervous.

210
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,850
Here you go. Quickly change into it.

211
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,640
Wu Yan.

212
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,280
Sang Wu Yan!

213
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,940
Wait. I...

214
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,320
You were fast
in reaching out for help.

215
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,640
I am sorry, aunt.

216
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,040
It was my fault.

217
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,080
I didn't look after Wu Yan properly

218
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,880
and allowed her drink so much last night.

219
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,800
That is not the main point.

220
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,200
I won't ask

221
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,440
why you brought a man home

222
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,640
for now.

223
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,560
Who is this man?

224
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,720
He is my boss.

225
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
How did it go? Did she get scolded?

226
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
You already got chased out from the house,

227
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,880
of course she will get scolded.

228
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,160
Pity me.

229
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,760
What did I do wrong?

230
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,800
If it's not for my future,

231
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
I would have quit my job.

232
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,480
I heard that.

233
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,920
No, no.

234
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,240
Buddy.

235
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,520
Don't worry too much.

236
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,400
Regarding this hurdle
of your mother-in-law,

237
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
steel yourself

238
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,160
and just brave it out.

239
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,520
Wait a minute.

240
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,880
I remembered that you were the one
who forced me to drink last night.

241
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,160
He is my ex-boyfriend.

242
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
You even came all the way

243
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
to argue with me at that time.

244
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,360
Don't you remember?

245
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,040
Didn't you say that he was blind?

246
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,480
And that he was an orphan?

247
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,480
I had told you at that time.

248
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,960
He is not an orphan.

249
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,120
He has a family.

250
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,080
Also, he got his sight back now.

251
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
So you lied to me?

252
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
I didn't lie to you, I...

253
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,240
This is a complicated matter.

254
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,480
It's also a long story to begin with.

255
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,160
But Mum,

256
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,880
three years have passed.

257
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
You know that

258
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,240
I still like him from the beginning
till the end.

259
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,240
Maybe he is not within your standards.

260
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,930
But I've already decided to spend my life

261
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,360
with him.

262
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,920
I am sorry, aunt.

263
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
It is my fault.

264
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,560
Mum, I'll see him off first.

265
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,160
I will talk to you later.

266
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,360
Go.

267
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,240
Quick.

268
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,400
Don't worry.

269
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,930
I will give you a call once I am done.

270
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,990
You should go back in.

271
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,800
They are taking forever
to see each other off.

272
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,320
Who is this person?

273
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,080
Who is he to make Wu Yan

274
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
lose her mind?

275
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,520
Aunt.

276
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,370
He's actually just a normal handsome guy.

277
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,890
And a little rich.

278
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,760
Handsome guy?

279
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,240
Both of you

280
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,560
only care about looks.

281
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,720
Aunt.

282
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,600
I feel wronged.

283
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,120
I am already married to Wei Hao.

284
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,000
How could you say that I only care looks?

285
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,010
What?

286
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,310
He is indeed

287
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,120
quite good looking.

288
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,680
Just like Wu Yan's father back then.

289
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,360
Don't hide and make calls in the room.

290
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,600
Don't think I don't know

291
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,880
what you are up to.

292
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,680
Got it. I won't call him.

293
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,880
Go to bed.

294
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,680
How did it go?

295
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,120
[What do you mean?]

296
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,320
It's nothing. She just nagged at me.

297
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,600
It's really nothing.

298
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,310
If she scolds me badly,

299
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,310
that means this matter
is not that serious.

300
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
Think about this question instead.

301
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,600
Do you want to treat me
to a movie tomorrow?

302
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,510
[I said,]

303
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,840
do you want to treat me
to a movie tomorrow?

304
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,780
What movie do you want to watch?

305
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,760
You were the one who wanted
to watch a movie last time.

306
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,080
You have not picked one yet?

307
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,720
In that case, start thinking about

308
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,130
which movie we will start with tomorrow.

309
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
I almost forgot.

310
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,200
This was in my pocket the whole time.

311
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,030
Here you go.

312
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,690
The photos are still at my rented house.

313
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,880
Take this first.

314
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,900
Since you insisted on getting them
from me last night

315
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
and wouldn't let me go
if I don't make a promise.

316
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,200
♫ Every time I thought I would cry ♫

317
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,040
♫ When the light fades away ♫

318
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,140
♫ I search everywhere
for the familiar voice ♫

319
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,350
♫ Slowly penetrating the tides
and raindrops ♫

320
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,650
♫ Even though I try to carry on ♫

321
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,960
♫ And I leave my past behind ♫

322
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,040
♫ I feel like I can hear your breathing ♫

323
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,760
♫ And the night turns translucent ♫

324
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,320
♫ Be it the city or forest ♫

325
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,720
♫ A gloomy tranquillity ♫

326
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,800
♫ Lost in the midst ♫

327
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,920
♫ I close my eyes ♫

328
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,710
♫ But I see your silhouette ♫

329
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,710
♫ Forever shine for me ♫

330
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,440
♫ Unafraid even when faced
with the unknown future ♫

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,260
♫ Because you're
the only thing I think about ♫

332
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,480
♫ I only think about you ♫

333
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,320
Have you been waiting for long?

334
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
It seems like the ice have already melted.

335
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,040
No.

336
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,240
Should I get you another one?

337
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,360
I don't feel like having
cold drinks anyway.

338
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,800
Let's go watch a movie now.

339
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,960
Why are there just the two of us here?

340
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,360
What movie did you pick?

341
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,320
Is the movie terrible?

342
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
That's why nobody came
to watch it?

343
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,360
I booked the entire hall.

344
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,600
Why are you looking at me?

345
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,600
Look at the screen.

346
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,450
Eyes on the screen.

347
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,080
Why did you fall asleep?

348
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,560
You didn't have enough sleep last night?

349
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,360
No.

350
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,520
It's too boring.

351
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,630
I actually prefer

352
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,680
having you tell me what's going on.

353
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,460
[Mum]

354
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,560
Hello, Mum?

355
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,480
Put him on the phone.

356
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,120
If not, you are not allowed
to go out next time.

357
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,800
I... Mum, please don't...

358
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,680
What are you doing?

359
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,410
Hello, aunt?

360
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,450
I am Nian Qin.

361
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,560
I will send her home on time.

362
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,520
Don't worry.

363
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,520
Okay, goodbye.

364
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,120
That's it?

365
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,920
That's it.

366
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,480
I...

367
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,640
Where are we going now?

368
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,980
It's time to go home.

369
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,480
Where did your guts go?

370
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,120
Are you going to give in
to my mother so quickly?

371
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,840
You should get going.

372
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
You still have a plane
to catch later, right?

373
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
I will watch you go upstairs.

374
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,550
You should get going first.

375
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,360
Okay then.

376
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Go on.

377
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,920
Nian Qin.

378
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,640
You were more attractive

379
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,080
last time.

380
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Right now,

381
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,820
you are a little clingy. That's boring.

382
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,880
I will get going now without turning back.

383
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,040
I don't have time to go over.

384
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,800
I am so busy now.

385
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,520
Okay then.

386
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,760
We are grown-ups now.

387
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,200
Let's not do celebrations

388
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,760
like those youngsters any more.

389
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,640
Okay?

390
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,120
Remember to take care of yourself.

391
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,440
Eat your meals on time.

392
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,080
[Call me on time too.]

393
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,400
Got it. I will hang up now.

394
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,720
Why are you here?

395
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,840
Why are you waiting out here?

396
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,480
It's cold. You should have
waited somewhere else.

397
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
What if you catch a cold?

398
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,600
I did that on purpose

399
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,520
to make your heart ache.

400
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
Madam,

401
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,800
my heart is already aching

402
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,400
when you've done nothing at all.

403
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
Didn't you say that you were busy?

404
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,920
You lied to me on purpose?

405
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,510
I wanted to give you a surprise.

406
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,880
You were freezing in this cold weather
just to give me a surprise?

407
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
If you'd told me earlier, I would have...

408
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,040
Su Nian Qin.

409
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,000
You are annoying sometimes.

410
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,840
You are dull and unromantic.

411
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,280
I don't even know why I fell for you.

412
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,680
You are right.

413
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,600
I still remember that someone
wrote a letter to scold me on air.

414
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,920
That person must have hated me a lot.

415
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
What's more annoying is

416
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,040
she can't help falling in love with me.

417
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,880
Do you really think that

418
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,760
the world can only

419
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,360
revolve around you?

420
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,680
Isn't that true?

421
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,280
You're so smug.

422
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,920
I am so hungry.

423
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,320
What are we eating later?

424
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,100
Anything that you like.

425
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,230
I think there is a short circuit.

426
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,740
Don't be afraid.

427
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,920
Which floor are we at?

428
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,550
The elevator just moved
for a while just now.

429
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,380
I bet we are at the third or fourth floor.

430
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,770
Nian Qin.

431
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,900
I am here.

432
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,010
I am afraid.

433
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Don't be afraid.

434
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,960
The lift is under
24-hour camera surveillance.

435
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,239
Someone will come shortly.

436
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,239
But what if they fell asleep?

437
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,679
That won't happen.

438
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,920
Don't think too much.

439
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Someone will be here anytime soon.

440
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,120
Previously,

441
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,159
I was in a similar situation like this
with Cheng Yin.

442
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,520
Did you get out immediately?

443
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,440
At that time,

444
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,000
we...

445
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,920
Later on, we...

446
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,360
Wu Yan.

447
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,040
Look at me. I am here.

448
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,760
Don't be afraid.

449
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,550
Let's talk about something else.

450
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
What do you want to eat later?

451
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,080
I am craving for something very spicy.

452
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,550
No.

453
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,680
It is bad for your stomach.

454
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
I want tomato noodles with egg then.

455
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,360
Why?

456
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,070
Because when the weather is cold,

457
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,400
my mother would make that for me.

458
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,600
Tomato noodles with egg.

459
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,880
When you take a few sips of the soup,

460
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,320
you'll feel warm.

461
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,320
Okay.

462
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,680
I can satisfy this craving of yours.

463
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,360
Do you still remember
the MP3 player that you gave me?

464
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,200
It contains a bunch of random stuff.

465
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,840
Yes.

466
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,030
Other than the recording
of you reading novels,

467
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,730
there are also

468
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,280
sounds of you shouting at me.

469
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,600
And also...

470
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,240
And also the song that you sang.

471
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,400
It was off pitch.

472
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,600
Do you have to look so entertained?

473
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,640
You are annoying.

474
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,960
If you were to sing the demos
for my songs previously,

475
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
no one would want them
even if I pay them to take it.

476
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,010
The way you speak is still so offensive.

477
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,090
Do you want me to

478
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,330
do a live concert now?

479
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,240
Sure.

480
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,720
I think the most appealing part

481
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,360
of your singing

482
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,400
is the true expression of emotions.

483
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,440
If the neighbours heard you sing,

484
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,720
they will be fighting over
your concert tickets.

485
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,820
Then,

486
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,920
I might have to move to another place.

487
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,840
Su Nian Qin, you...

488
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,320
We're sorry. Sorry to disturb.

489
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,960
Don't leave your shoes everywhere.

490
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,990
Do I look like a sloppy person?

491
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,600
Okay, Young Master Su.

492
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,560
How would I dare disobey you?

493
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,480
What are you doing?

494
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,600
I am making you tomato noodles with eggs.

495
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,240
You can cook?

496
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,080
It's impossible that you know how to cook.

497
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,840
Why is it impossible?

498
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,520
It smells so good.

499
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,460
It's hot.

500
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,720
Take your time.

501
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,580
You are still so impatient.

502
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,240
Why do you...

503
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,030
Of course.

504
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,600
You wouldn't remember it.

505
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,080
Help me tie up my hair.

506
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Quick.

507
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,080
Nian Qin.

508
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,390
What do you think if

509
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,120
I work as an anchor
for the radio station in Xiamen?

510
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,080
What do you think?

511
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,000
What do you mean?

512
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
Do it if you want to.

513
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,240
Can't you answer me seriously?

514
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,560
Previously, my friends

515
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,790
said that

516
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,620
I am not a professional anchor.

517
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,840
The show I did in that small radio station

518
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,840
didn't become a hit too.

519
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,560
Who told you that?

520
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,390
I think you should unfriend them.

521
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,280
I mean it.

522
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,200
They don't see the potential in you

523
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,520
and don't even support your dreams.

524
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,000
Friends aren't like that.

525
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,640
What are you laughing at? Turn around.

526
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,600
Your hair is messy.

527
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,940
[East Lake Music Broadcast]

528
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,400
After you left,

529
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,560
we continued to make
a few more episodes.

530
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,760
But it didn't last long.

531
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,960
Firstly, we weren't well prepared.

532
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Secondly,

533
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,800
we lack someone willing to put effort in.

534
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,600
It is quite a pity.

535
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,480
Actually, this is the show that I created.

536
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,080
I should be responsible for it.

537
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,440
That is why...

538
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Xi,

539
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,720
I want to come back.

540
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,240
I started to work as an anchor
at that radio station

541
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,200
after I graduated.

542
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,600
Why don't you look
happy and excited for me?

543
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,200
I only know that

544
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
someone is leaving again tomorrow.

545
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,320
This is for you.

546
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,920
The candy has melted
because your palm is hot.

547
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,280
How did you learn to read these?

548
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,720
By reading them slowly.

549
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,780
After you left,

550
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,480
I told myself that

551
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,720
I must achieve something impressive

552
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,120
so that I can prove myself to your mother.

553
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,080
But when I started

554
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,560
handling our family business,

555
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,880
I knew nothing about it.

556
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,490
I can't even understand
what's written on the contracts.

557
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,930
I didn't know what I was doing

558
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,200
and messed everything up.

559
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,000
Did your father give you an earful?

560
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,120
He is not afraid of losing money.

561
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
He was just worried that I'd quit.

562
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,760
He knows

563
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,030
how stressful it is

564
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,120
in this industry.

565
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,320
Later on, someone told me that

566
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,440
drinking can relief stress.

567
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,560
Who dare to fool you like that?

568
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,680
I will hunt him down.

569
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,270
You better not drink any more.

570
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,440
I can't do that.

571
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,520
I must be drunk tonight.

572
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,760
Why?

573
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,480
Why do you think so?

574
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,560
You...

575
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,870
Don't act like a spoiled child.

576
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,160
Focus on your work.

577
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,970
We will see each other and have fun
during Chinese New Year.

578
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,800
What fun can we have
during Chinese New Year?

579
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,720
You are on mute now.

580
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,560
Stop babbling. Go back to work.
