is the first listener of this show.

245
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,720
He really liked the show.

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,550

[I'll listen to the broadcast every day.]

249
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,550
Perhaps it's because

250
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,790
he never expected

251
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
his daughter,

252
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,510

00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,630
to dream of becoming

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,270
a music show host,

255
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,080
and that she would actually succeed.

256
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,240
But before this episode came out,

257
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,510
he had left us.

258

he could hear the show.

259
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,350
He could hear my first show

261

263

I was teased by my friends
because of that.

264
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,960
But my dad was not worried about it.

265
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,430
He got me music scores

266
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,720
and taught me bit by bit patiently.

267
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,390
He also brought me to karaoke.

Don't make me scold you,

369
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,200
Ignorant Wei.

370
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,150
Wu Yan.

371
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,000
Are you drunk?

372
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,430
She's not drunk.

373
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,310
She's just truly hurt.

374
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,790
Be safe on your way back.

375
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,910
-Wu Yan, please don't...
-All right.

376
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,120
Take care of Wei Hao. We're leaving.

377
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,200
Bye.

378
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,880
What is going on?

379
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,080
What is this?

380
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,270
What's wrong?

381
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,870
It's not here just now.

382
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,910
That's right.

383
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,840
Not everyone uses the lift.

384
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,720
My goodness.

385
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Hold on.

386
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,440
Forget it.

387
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,150
Let's take the lift.

388
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,310
You can't take the lift.

389
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,480
Hold on.

390
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,790
You're here.

391
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,030
What else can be done?
Do you plan to go somewhere else?

392
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,720
We're almost there.

393
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,080
Okay, it's okay. Relax.

394
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,270
We're almost there.

395
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,270
We're almost there.

396
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,630
All right, it's okay.

397
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,670
We're almost there.

398
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,560
We're almost there.

399
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,070
What's wrong?

400
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,239
Cheng Yin.

401
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,719
Wait for me.

402
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,670
What is going on?

403
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,000
Hold on.

404
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,280
It's okay.

405
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,000
It's okay, I'm here.

406
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,199
I'm here.

407
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,110
Look, there's light.

408
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,480
My goodness. What's going on?

409
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,760
Is there anyone?

410
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,679
Wait for me. Don't panic.

411
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,480
Don't panic.

412
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,000
Take a deep breath.

413
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,920
Take a deep breath. Don't panic.

414
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,719
Sit down.

415
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,480
Take a deep breath.

416
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,870
Don't be scared.

417
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,909
Is there anyone outside?

418
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,550
I'm here.

419
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,000
The management will be here soon.

420
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,389
Don't be scared.

421
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,030
Hello.

422
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,920
What?

423
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,720
Which hospital?

424
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,960
Wu Yan.

425
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,320
You're awake.

426
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,110
How do you feel?

427
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,830
What happened to me?

428
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,240
Why am I in the hospital?

429
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,390
Do you feel any discomfort?

430
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll get a doctor.

431
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,000
Where is Cheng Yin?

432
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,280
Wei Hao is taking care of her.

433
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,590
Don't worry.

434
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,520
Take care of yourself.

435
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
I'll get a doctor.

436
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,000
Stop it.

437
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,150
You've been playing the same song

438
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,110
for three hours.

439
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,240
What are you doing?

440
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,910
Wu Yan doesn't know that

441
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,560
her favourite song "Moonlight"

442
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,000
is actually "Pierrot lunaire" by Debussy.

443
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,070
It's about

444
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,800
a moonstruck clown
who was teased due to his depression.

445
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,560
Stop showing off your trivial knowledge.

446
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,390
If you're really upset,

447
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,590
you should look for her.

448
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,590
I'll send you there.

449
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,350
Once, Wu Yan told me

450
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,760
that when a close childhood friend of hers

451
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,240
passed away,

452
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,830
she felt

453
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,760
as if she was the only person

454
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,200
who understood what she had lost.

455
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,200
When I heard it,

456
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,320
I felt immediately that

457
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,200
she had described my feelings perfectly.

458
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,960
When my mum passed away,

459
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,110
I felt the same way.

460
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,830
She said

461
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,390
she felt comforted
after listening to my songs.

462
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,280
However,

463
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,070
she lost someone again.

464
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,240
Because of me,

465
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,070
she didn't manage
to see her dad for the one last time.

466
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,200
Stop talking, Nian Qin.

467
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,480
Xiao Lu.

468
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,910
Didn't you say that it's almost my turn?

469
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,430
Please make arrangements
for the eye surgery.

470
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,320
Is it painful?

471
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,760
Of course.

472
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,920
I injured myself

473
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,720
but you didn't offer to stay longer.

474
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,910
My mum is waiting for me at home.

475
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,910
You only have a few belongings.

476
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,590
That's so not you.

477
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,310
That's right.

478
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,200
I'm no longer the old me.

479
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,480
You? You always forget things.

480
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,040
You will come back
to pick up your things for sure.

481
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,110
I'll just forget about those things
that I leave behind.

482
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,670
Are you not coming back again?

483
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,110
No, I'll not come back again.

484
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,270
Wu Yan.

485
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,390
Will you regret it?

486
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,000
Leaving Xiamen just like that.

487
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,830
No.

488
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,560
You're the only person I'm going to miss.

489
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,310
Aren't you going

490
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,040
to continue your master's degree
at my dad's university?

491
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,200
Then, there's nothing for me to miss.

492
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,830
I'm not fooled.

493
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,390
You know what I'm trying to say.

494
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,390
Perhaps I will regret

495
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,110
but it doesn't matter anymore.

496
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,590
I told Xu Qian

497
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,670
to at least give it a try.

498
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,760
Now, when I think back,

499
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,720
that's indeed inconsiderate.

500
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,320
My mum didn't lie to me.

501
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,800
Some failures

502
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,670
are fatal.

503
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,430
Now I understand

504
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,200
how it feels to be helpless.

505
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm tired.

506
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,280
I can't move anymore.

507
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,720
I'll say the usual line.

508
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,040
Just pretend that he's dead.

509
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,360
No.

510
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,070
I hope I'm dead.

511
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,040
I don't want to have any feelings anymore.
