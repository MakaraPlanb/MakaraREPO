[Episode 3]

4
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,640
Good morning, guys.

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Morning.

6
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,520
Wu Yan, what is this?

7
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,440
My dad asked someone

8
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,720
to bring me these glutinous rice balls
from our hometown.

9
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm sharing these with all of you.

10
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,240
We can't keep them for too long.

11
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,520
It's better if you cook
and finish them tonight.

12
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,550
Thank you.

13
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,230
We're lucky.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,470
My dad made these himself.

15
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,640
It's full of the flavour of happiness.

16
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,590
You'll feel even happier
after eating these.

17
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,470
Please distribute these for me.

18
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,350
Thanks.

19
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,590
Mr Su, this box is for you.

20
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,390
I'll put it here then.

21
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,350
I don't want it.

22
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,800
It was my fault for
thinking like that previously.

23
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,080
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,440
You don't have to apologise.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,230
You didn't do me wrong.

26
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,230
Why is it so hard to cheer him up?

27
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,670
Teacher, sorry.

28
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm late.

29
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,720
Xiao Ling?

30
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,520
Teacher?

31
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,360
Where is Xiao Wei?

32
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,240
Mr Li, I can't find Xiao Wei.

33
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm afraid she has been left behind.

34
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,840
Wu Yan, go check the classroom now.

35
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,120
I told them before.

36
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,640
If they can't find
their classmates or teachers,

37
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,680
just go back to the classroom.

38
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,080
Okay, I'll go find her.

39
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,260
[Grade 3 Class 3
Department of Visual Impairment]

40
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,750
Xiao Wei?

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,360
Mr Su, Mr Su.

42
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,240
Mr Su, I thought you're all gone.

43
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,150
I thought you don't want me anymore.

44
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm right here.

45
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,710
Have you forgotten?

46
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,520
We're doing health examination now.

47
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,520
Now you remember, don't you?

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,990
Good job, Xiao Wei.

49
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,240
You came to the classroom when you
couldn't find your teacher and classmates.

50
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,920
You listen to what the teacher said.

51
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,920
Great job.

52
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,750
Good girl.

53
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,430
Don't cry.

54
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,920
It's me.

55
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,430
I'll take Xiao Wei
to the health examination.

56
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,840
I know you won't listen
to my explanation,

57
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,870
but trust me,

58
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,840
I'll take good care of Xiao Wei.

59
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,030
You should at least

60
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,310
give yourself a chance
to trust people.

61
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,960
Xiao Wei,

62
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,430
let Ms Sang take you
to the health examination, okay?

63
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,750
Okay.

64
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,310
Then we'll leave now.

65
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,430
Let's go, Xiao Wei.

66
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,220
[Su Nian Qin]

67
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,430
Oh, his attitude.

68
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,550
What a waste of that beautiful face.

69
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,870
Wu Yan,

70
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,960
you're still here.

71
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm just about to leave.

72
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,800
Mr Li,

73
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,470
I noticed that Mr Su
seems to favour Xiao Wei.

74
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,240
Xiao Wei's surname is also Su.

75
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,710
Are they relatives?

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
No.

77
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,870
How long has Mr Su been working here?

78
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,480
Over a month.

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,549
As a matter of fact,
he's not exactly our teacher.

80
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,559
The teacher who taught Braille,
Ms Zheng is delivering a baby.

81
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,720
She's on maternity leave.

82
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,720
There was another retired teacher,
Miss Xu.

83
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,230
The school wanted to hire her again.

84
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,630
However, she needs to take care
of her grandchildren out of town.

85
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,600
This is why we were in need of a teacher.

86
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,390
Principal Pei

87
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,030
happens to know Mr Su very well,

88
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,400
so he hired him as a substitute.

89
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,160
I guess he'll be here
for over half a year.

90
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,040
What was his previous job?

91
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,750
Did he teach somewhere else?

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,230
I've no idea.

93
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,520
He never joins our conversation.

94
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,110
Glutinous rice balls?

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,350
Where did you get these?

96
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,670
From a colleague.

97
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,520
This is the first time you received
a gift from a colleague.

98
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
I didn't expect your colleague to like you

99
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,990
with this attitude of yours.

100
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,830
Go home.

101
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,550
They're really good.

102
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,600
These are the best glutinous rice balls
I've ever had.

103
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,720
Are they really that good?

104
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,750
Try it and you'll know.

105
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,360
[My dad made these himself.]

106
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,800
[It's full of the flavour of happiness.]

107
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,990
[You'll feel even happier
after eating these.]

108
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,670
They're good, right?

109
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,920
They substituted sugar with osmanthus.

110
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,430
It's quite special.

111
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,280
Ask your colleague where she got this.

112
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,550
Her father made these.

113
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,760
I knew it.

114
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,150
People say that food always tastes better

115
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,840
if it's made with love.

116
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,310
Food made by a father is just different.

117
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,030
It's fine.

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
I don't mind.

120
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,870
Nian Qin,
there will be traffic jams on a rainy day.

121
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
You'll be late for school.

122
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,230
You only have one lesson today.

123
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,480
Why don't you make a call
and make adjustment with the school?

124
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
No.

125
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,870
The kids still go to school
on a rainy day.

126
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,830
Alright.

127
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,110
I'll pick you up after work.

128
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Be careful.

129
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,960
Don't worry. The rain has just stopped.

130
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,640
Mr Su, you're here.

131
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,750
That was a heavy rain, wasn't it?

132
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Come in.

133
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,350
Mr Su, I'll put it
in the umbrella stand for you.

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,640
[I'll give you three seconds.]

135
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,000
[Three.]

136
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,550
[Two.]

137
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,200
Appreciate it.

138
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,270
No problem.

139
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,080
[Appreciate it?]

140
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,110
[He looks well-mannered
but he actually has a thin skin.]

141
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,830
Mr Su, I'm sorry.

142
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,000
In your coming Braille lesson,

143
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,550
I need to use some of your time.

144
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,600
The school has just issued a notice.

145
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,880
We need to brief the students

146
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,520
about the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.

147
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,990
I'm taking a day off tomorrow,

148
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,750
so I have to inform them in advance.

149
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,160
Do you have any issues with that?

150
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,680
No problem.

151
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,110
Okay, thanks a lot.

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
Wu Yan, there's nothing much to do today.

153
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,680
If you're busy,

154
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,590
you can leave first.

155
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,470
Alright.

156
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,510
Take care.

157
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,040
Beside Zhuque Bridge,
rank grasses overgrow.

158
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,840
Over Wuyi Alley, the sun is setting slow.

159
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,830
Swallows that gathered
on Wang and Xie's eaves in bygone days,

160
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,960
Are now dipping among
the humble home's doorways.

161
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,080
Rank grasses overgrow.

162
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,990
The sun is setting slow.

163
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,200
It's low.

164
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,710
What?

165
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,870
Over Wuyi Alley, the sun is setting low.

166
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,480
No. It's obviously setting slow.

167
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,310
Slow.

168
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,960
I know.

169
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,040
But in this poem, it is setting low.

170
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,000
It's low.

171
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,910
Is that so?

172
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,440
When I was a second year student,

173
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,000
I even went to Wuyi Alley.

174
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,000
If the tourist hadn't mentioned it,

175
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,350
I wouldn't even know.

176
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,830
Wang Xian Zhi and Wang Xi Zhi

177
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,680
are one of the Wang and Xie

178
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,910
in Wuyi Alley.

179
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,640
I heard that Wang Xian Zhi
was quite a romantic guy.

180
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,790
He was the allusion
of a ferry or something.

181
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,670
It's Taoye Ferry.

182
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,680
It's 12 o'clock.

183
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,790
I should get going.

184
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,350
See you.

185
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,710
Mr Su, I'm worried that you can't find it.

186

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,200
Hi, Madam Zhang.

373
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,390
Why are you here all by yourself?

374
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,390
Where is Xiao Wei?

375
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,310
A girl came.

376
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,030
She asked Xiao Wei
to play stones with her.

377
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,240
Yes. The three of them
always hang out together.

378
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,310
It's been a while since I last met you.

379
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,790
How are you doing?

380
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,430
I'm good.

381
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,110
-Wait here. I need to go.
-Okay.

382
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,990
Let's go.

383
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,560
Su,

384
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,960
I got so caught up with work

385
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,790
that I forgot to ask about you.

386
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,960
It's fine.

387
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,990
Just do your work.

388
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,200
Don't mind me.

389
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,760
I've finished my work.

390
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,670
You must be boring sitting here alone.

391
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,680
Since we haven't met for a while,

392
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,150
we should catch up.

393
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,480
Su, are you seeing anyone recently?

394
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,880
You should let me meet her.

395
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,790
-You...
-Do you really want to know?

396
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,760
Ms Sang.

397
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,360
Sang, what's the matter?

398
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,390
Nothing, nothing.

399
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,560
By the way, have the children

400
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,390
been living here their whole lives?

401
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,720
No.

402
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,390
Some of them were lost.

403
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,220
The police couldn't find their parents,

404
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,830
so they were sent here.

405
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,150
Some of them were abandoned
by their parents.

406
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,720
Some were sent here
when they were a toddler.

407
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,150
Some were sent here after they were born.

408
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,910
Is that because they were sick?

409
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,760
They usually have birth defects.

410
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,120
How can there be such parents
in the world?

411
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,920
There are also parents

412
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,810
who gave birth to children
with birth defects,

413
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,770
but they still take care of them
for their entire lives.

414
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,480
Mr Su,

415
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,630
I didn't expect you
to visit Xiao Wei here.

416
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,760
You seem to really adore her.

417
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,360
Where are you going? I can send you there.

418
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,440
You don't have to.

419
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,240
[Are you done?]

420
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,510
I'm outside the welfare home.

421
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,600
Okay.

422
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,910
Mr Su,

423
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,630
I've been wanting to ask you something.

424
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,320
Are you

425
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
Yi Jin?

426
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,760
You should at least say something.

427
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,800
If you don't want to admit it,

428
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,840
you could've faked it.

429
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,960
Why are you acting like this?

430
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,840
You're acting like you'd catch a plague

431
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,310
if you talk to me.

432
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,550
Go wherever you want.

433
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,790
I'm not getting in your way sitting here.

434
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,360
But please don't stand in front of me,

435
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,480
and stop bothering me, will you?

436
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,750
Mr Su, what do you think

437
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,240
you're talking about?

438
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,720
Just now, you were walking in front of me.
I was behind you.

439
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Now, you're sitting, I'm standing here.

440
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,680
You sat on this bench first,

441
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,990
but you didn't construct this road,
did you?

442
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,350
I can stand wherever I want.

443
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,270
You... I can do whatever I want.

444
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,440
Listen.

445
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,630
When Yi Jin did the interview,

446
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,120
I met you in the lift.

447
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,080
Yi Jin's new song is based on
Wang Xian Zhi’s allusion.

448
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,270
And we happened to discuss this before.

449
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,030
It's certainly not a coincidence.

450
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,600
Who is Yi Jin?

451
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,200
Forget it. That's fine.

452
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,000
Why don't you let me take you home?

453
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,750
You can't just

454
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,480
keep sitting here, can you?

455
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,910
It's getting dark now.

456
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,390
You need to eat.

457
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,720
Are you waiting for someone
to pick you up?

458
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,560
Waiting alone is quite boring, isn't it?

459
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,670
I can talk to you.

460
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,630
Do you think

461
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,310
that you're quite cool?

462
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,270
Okay. You're really cool.

463
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,080
Really cool.

464
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,110
How did you know that I work here?

465
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,790
Zhao Ying saw you and told me that.

466
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,630
I've asked them out for dinner.

467
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,840
You should at least have dinner with us

468
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,870
and make things clear.

469
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,030
I've nothing to say.

470
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,030
I shouldn't quit in such short notice,

471
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,720
but I really don't have time for the band.

472
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Be honest with me.

473
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,390
Have you encountered any problem?

474
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,110
No.

475
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,510
What kind of problem would I have?

476
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,080
Stop following me.

477
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,760
This is my last warning.

478
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,270
Aren't you cold?

479
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,680
We've been sitting here for some time.

480
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,960
It's quite chilly.

481
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,080
You should go home first.

482
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,030
Aren't you hungry?

483
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,910
Wu Yan.

484
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,120
You...

485
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,630
He... He's my boyfriend.

486
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,430
We're on a date.

487
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Mr Su, the almighty Mr Su,

488
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,630
please have some mercy

489
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,350
and finish this play with me.

490
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,240
Thanks.

491
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,760
Finish this play with me.

492
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,030
Ms Sang,

493
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,360
please behave yourself.

494
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,840
He's hungry.

495
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,000
He couldn't think straight.

496
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,120
Su Nian Qin.

497
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,760
Su Nian Qin!

498
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,840
Su Nian Qin, stop!

499
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,200
I told you to stop. Didn't you hear me?

500
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,800
I told you to...

501
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,060
♫ I'm willing to imagine ♫

502
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,100
♫ All the possibilities ♫

503
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,340
♫ Make me believe ♫

504
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,699
♫ You're the only one ♫

505
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,860
♫ I'm willing to believe ♫

506
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,630
Please let go.

507
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:27,750
I won't.

508
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,590
♫ No matter how long the journey is ♫

509
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,070
I can let go.

510
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,150
But you have to go there

511
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,429
and explain to her.

512
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,440
Was I not telling her the truth?

513
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,320
You...

514
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,480
How could you do this?

515
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,630
Do what?

516
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,389
How... How could you do this?

517
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,030
Listen.

518
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,070
I fell out with my family

519
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,480
and moved to Xiamen with you.

520
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,110
You said you'd be nice to me.

521
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,200
You also said you'd be a good father.

522
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,590
How could you leave me

523
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,390
and go on a date with that woman?

524
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,170
I haven't eaten anything yet.

525
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,430
Our child and I are starving.

526
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,760
How could you be so cruel

527
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,560
and fool around with other woman?

528
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,070
His wife is pregnant,

529
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,800
but he's cheating on her.

530
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,580
Exactly. Why would anyone do this?

531
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,800
When we were young, you only like me.

532
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,440
Why would you

533
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
be with another woman now?

534
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,510
I could've let it slide
if it were someone else.

535
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,660
But she's my best friend.

536
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,240
How can both of you deceive me?

537
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
A good-looking man

538
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,320
will never be loyal.

539
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,310
He's a beast.

540
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,590
He's worse than a beast.

541
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,630
What the heck is this?

542
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,320
Sang Wu Yan.

543
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,630
Get up first.

544
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,510
No.

545
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,520
You can do whatever you want.

546
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,800
Get up first.

547
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,040
I'm hungry.

548
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,070
I want KFC.

549
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,240
Put this on.

550
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,010
I'm not cold.

551
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,770
You still have to wear it.

552
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,190
Do you want me to keep crying?

553
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,680
Put it on.

554
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,830
You keep holding this blazer.

555
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,480
I thought it'd be hideous.

556
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,640
