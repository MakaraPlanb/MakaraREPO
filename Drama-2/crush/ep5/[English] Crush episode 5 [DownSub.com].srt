I'm sorry.

14
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,110
I have a question.

15
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,640
Since you're a singer-songwriter,

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
why did you decide to work with

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,030

genius songwriter, Yi Jin?

18
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,670
I've been a lyricist
and composer all this while.

19
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,750

Why did you ask him that question?

39

It's a musical notation used

113

There will be a public event
at the Piano Museum over the weekend.

114
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,750
It's meant to popularise
the knowledge about piano

115

among the blind
who are interested in learning music.

116
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,750
Is it not available in the market?

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,430
It's rare. It's hard to get.

118
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,150
Many blind children have to
memorise the music note one by one

119
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,120
in order to learn music.

120
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,800

Didn't I tell you...

133
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,280
All right, got it.

134

is pleasant to the ears, right?

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,350
Please raise your hand
if you want to volunteer.

188
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,630
Okay, let's welcome the lady
who is standing at the side.

189
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,240
Here.

190
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,160
Please come to the stage.

191
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,600
Now, memorise the sequence of the note.

192
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,550
Try to follow my lead.

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,110
You may use one hand.

194
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,840
We'll do it together.

195
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,160
This is the Twelve Variations
on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman".

196
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,200
Ms Sang.

197
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,880
We hope that the blind

198
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,360
have the chance to learn music.

199
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,120
Coincidentally,

200
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,030
someone volunteers

201
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,600
to produce the Braille music notation.

202
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,990
It's just a small favour from me.

203
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,550
You don't look like one, Mr Su.

204
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,600
I didn't know that you
do good things without leaving a name.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
Or do you

206
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,870
always live incognito?

207
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,390
Mr Su.

208
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,440
I admit that

209
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,230
I'm not a know-it-all.

210
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,000
However,

211
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,590
you accuse that
when we claim we like something,

212
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,440
it's just our attempt
to put a label on ourselves.

213
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,870
I kind of think
it's a subjective speculation.

214
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,270
You can't conclude that

215
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm talking nonsense just because

216
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,550
I can't justify why I like something.

217
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,760
I like Yi Jin too.

218
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Is this considered
an act of labelling myself?

219
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,590
Enlighten me.

220
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,160
What kind of tag Yi Jin is?

221
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,110
Which of his songs do you like the most?

222
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,430
"Occupied".

223
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Why?

224
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,280
We're back to square one again.

225
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,120
I just like it.

226
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,280
There is no...

227
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,200
Watch out!

228
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,840
Watch out for the piano.

229
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,230
Every piano in the museum is precious.

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
I'm not done.

231
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,470
If I must explain,

232
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,630
I like "Occupied" because

233
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,910
I think it's really nice.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,950
Furthermore, I think that the song

235
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,910
is so beautiful
in terms of melody and lyrics.

236
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,160
I really like it.

237
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,310
♫ If ears and promises ♫

238
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,520
Using up all your might

239
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,880
♫ Hadn't met each other ♫

240
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,110
to bid goodbye

241
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,100
♫ If wishes and future ♫

242
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,280
and to forget,

243
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,390
♫ Hadn't come into contact ♫

244
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,330
♫ Perhaps ♫

245
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
only to realise how helpless you are.

246
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,770
♫ We could ♫

247
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,870
♫ Pretend that
nothing has happened ♫

248
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,550
Do you think

249
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,060
♫ And move on easily ♫

250
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,160
this feeling is beautiful?

251
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,490
♫ When forever is still ♫

252
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,190
♫ Not too far away ♫

253
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,110
♫ When a hug is still  ♫

254
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
♫ Connected to love ♫

255
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,800
What?

256
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,530
♫ Would you then ♫

257
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,770
♫ Notice me ♫

258
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,070
♫ There is a distant star like me ♫

259
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,890
♫ Shining brightly ♫

260
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,020
♫ Because I don't know ♫

261
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,900
♫ How to express myself ♫

262
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,120
What are you doing?

263
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,670
I listened to Yi Jin's songs again.

264
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,960
I still think that he's Yi Jin.

265
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,230
Whose phone number is that?

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,800
It's his number.

267
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,360
Not bad, you're still good at it.

268
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
He's so cold and distant

269
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,230
but you got his number anyway.

270
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,950
No.

271
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,240
I copied his number

272
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,160
from Mr Li's contact list.

273
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,960
The situation is different then.

274
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,360
Since you've got his number.

275
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,480
Why don't you give him a call?

276
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,200
Give him a call?

277
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,310
What should I say?

278
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,600
Ask for hush money.

279
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,240
If the gossip were sold to the media,

280
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,670
how much would it cost?

281
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,440
However,

282
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,680
you should contact him

283
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,400
for hush money.

284
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,910
We make money

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,030
while he can continue being mysterious.

286
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,760
Do you know what this is called?

287
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,550
Fishing in troubled water?

288
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,359
It's called a win-win situation.

289
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,600
[Firstly, we must lay out a plan.]

290
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,750
[It's too awkward
to give him a call out of random.]

291
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,720
[Moreover, the one who makes the first
move is always at a disadvantage.]

292
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,840
[However, it doesn't really matter.]

293
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,270
[It's impossible for him
to make the first move.]

294
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,110
[In that case,]

295
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,720
[I must get him when he's least prepared.]

296
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,110
[I'm going to overwhelm him]

297
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,920
[with my professional
psychological skills.]

298
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
[All right, I'm going to do it.]

299
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,560
[Hello.]

300
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,270
Hello, I'm Sang Wu Yan.

301
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,550
[Anything?]

302
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,880
You're Yi Jin.

303
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,310
If there is nothing else,

304
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,630
I've to go.

305
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,360
[You're really Yi Jin.]

306
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,270
Hold on.

307
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,150
Well...

308
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,560
The incident happened

309
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,960
due to my lack of understanding.

310
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,030
As such,

311
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,990
sorry for the offence.

312
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,120
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,510
Also,

314
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,360
I have always wanted to thank you.

315
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,120
When I listened to
Yi Jin's song in the past,

316
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,630
I had been wondering

317
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,120
what kind of person

318
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,960
could write a song about tough love.

319
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,630
It's as if he's used up all the energy

320
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,840
to remember

321
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,200
every fleeting detail in life.

322
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,030
When I was in freshman year,

323
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,920
a close friend

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,080
who I met
in elementary school passed away.

325
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,950
"Occupied" is the song

326
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,800
that kept me going through that period.

327
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,970
It taught me how to bid goodbye.

328
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,300
At that time, everyone told me

329
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,720
I was overreacted.

330
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,120
Even my dad told me

331
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,470
not to be childish.

332
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,000
It's as if

333
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,030
I was the only person who realised

334
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,880
a very nice person had left the world.

335
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,270
Only when I was listening to his song,

336
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,880
I was allowed to cry.

337
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,880
If I were given a chance to meet him,

338
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,720
I would make sure

339
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,880
he knows that I'm living well.

340
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,120
Then, I would smile

341
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,600
and thank him.

342
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,680
All right.

343
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,360
I'll keep the secret for you.

344
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,600
That's all.

345
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,800
Goodnight.

346
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
You're welcome.

347
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,920
♫ Nothing much to say ♫

348
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,520
♫ I've been waiting for something ♫

349
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,960
I have a secret
which I really want to share.

350
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,100
♫ It's written in the stars ♫

351
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,870
However, I decided

352
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,850
♫ There's a voice in my ears ♫

353
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,790
to lie that it's a daydream.

354
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,090
♫ Which has been keeping me company ♫

355
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,760
♫ Because of that,
I'm no longer afraid of sunset ♫

356
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,640
♫ The sun showers deliberately ♫

357
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,080
♫ Drop on my shoulders ♫

358
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,900
♫ I suddenly recall something ♫

359
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,660
♫ I think I heard it somewhere ♫

360
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,550
♫ Subconsciously ♫

361

♫ I recognise you ♫

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,100
♫ By your astonishing voice ♫

363
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,430
Who called?

♫ In the next second ♫

365
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,790
♫ You look up and smile at me ♫

366
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,480
No one.

367
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,360
You're lying.

368
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,730
♫ You say the lyric is a tongue twister ♫

369
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,580

He doesn't have a girlfriend.

555
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,840
He doesn't have...

556
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,200
Do you have to be so happy?

557
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,110
She may not be his girlfriend
at the moment

558
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,630
but what if she becomes one in the future?

559
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,760
Don't talk nonsense!

560
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
Furthermore,

561
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,910
that's not why I'm so happy.

562
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,910
What is it, then?

563
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,480
I asked him

564
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,880
if he had anything to ask me.

565
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,270
He should have said

566
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,360
"No"

567
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,200
but he replied,

568
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,790
"I'll save it for next time".

569
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,720
He's getting better at this.

570
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,360
What's wrong with you?

571
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,390
Am I right?

572
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,310
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

573
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,560
You'd better get up
and fill in your internship form.

574
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,270
We need to go back to school
and get it signed tomorrow.

575
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,600
You owe me a question, woman.

576
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,080
You owe me one.

577
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
You owe me one.

578
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,680
Even if you don't want to talk to me,

579
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,510
you should think for the band.

580
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,200
No matter how bad it is,
you should at least perform

581
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,840
on the convocation day.

582
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,350
Find someone else.

583
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,110
I can't do it.

584
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,320
I have a part-time job and an internship.

585
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,990
I don't have the time.

586
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,920
You should...

587
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,360
I have to go.

588
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,990
Why on earth did I think that

589
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,880
I like a dumb guy like you?

590
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,270
Fine.

591
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,910
Let me tell you the main point.

592
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,560
I'll only say it for once.

593
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,150
You'd better

594
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,790
listen to it with all your brain cells.

595
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,760
Firstly,

596
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,600
we grew up together.

597
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,510
Of course I'd think that

598
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,760
we're meant to be with each other.

599
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,880
However, now I realise,

600
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,320
I have never fallen in love with you.

601
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,390
I'm merely too used
to being together with you.

602
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,960
Secondly,

603
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,920
I'm sure that you had feelings for me.

604
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,270
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have been so nice to me.

605
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,230
Don't even argue with me.

606
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,560
In analysing human behaviour,

607
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,030
I'm so much more professional than you.

608
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,720
Thirdly,

609
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,630
I don't know

610
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,990
when you fell in love with Xu Qian

611
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,480
but I'm sure you're
in love with her now, not me.

612
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,880
The same theory applies.

613
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,200
Lastly,

614
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,240
what confuses me the most is

615
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,480
how come I didn't notice that

616
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,120
you've fallen in love with each other?

617
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm usually quite observant.

618
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,350
Unless both of you
deliberately hid it from me.

619
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,990
That makes me really angry.

620
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,840
Both of you are the worst kind of friends.

621
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,030
Actually,

622
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,360
she's been distancing herself from me.

623
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,080
No wonder.

624
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,910
What are you doing?

625
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,270
If she backs off, you should move forward.

626
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,040
I think

627
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,110
my feelings for Xu Qian were wrong.

628
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,590
After all,

629
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,630
I had feelings for you before.

630
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,239
I think I haven't thought it through.

631
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,070
Let me ask you a question.

632
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,110
Think about it.

633
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,110
Who is more important to you?
Me or Xu Qian?

634
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,389
Both of you are equally important.

635
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,040
That's the wrong answer!

636
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,830
Of course she is more important.

637
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,389
I have become the past tense.

638
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,520
She's your present and future.

639
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,280
My friend,

640
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,590
will you

641
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,909
stop being indecisive?

642
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,040
Wu Yan, why did
you suddenly cool down?

643
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,719
That's because I've figured out

644
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,590
how silly both of you are.

645
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,389
I've thought it through.

646
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,150
I was under the impression that

647
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,000
I was mad because you betrayed me.

648
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,110
However, soon I realised that

649
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,760
I was mad because

650
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,720
both of you didn't see me as a friend.

651
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,310
You've become a couple

652
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,070
but you decided to hide it from me.

653
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,590
Now, have you cooled down?

654
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,240
Yes, so you'd better hurry up.

655
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,390
Go and get her back.

656
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,320
Will you be persistent?

657
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,760
Enjoy the food.

658
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,310
Welcome.

659
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,390
How many of you?

660
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm sorry.

661
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,200
Is Xu Qian on duty today?

662
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,480
Xu Qian?

663
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,590
She's resigned.

664
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,960
Okay, thank you.

665
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,880
Sure, no problem.

666
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,430
If you ask me,

667
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,870
we should stop dawdling
and find a new vocalist.

668
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,760
I think that's a good idea.

669
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,280
I don't deny that it's a little difficult

670
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,590
to find someone like Xu Qian

671
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,960
who is pretty and has a good voice.

672
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,070
However, it's better than
having no vocalist.

673
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
Hello, where are you?

674
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,870
I'm not looking for her.
I'm looking for you.

675
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,240
Let's go for lunch.

676
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,430
Welfare home?

677
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,200
Sure, send me the location.

678
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,350
I'll go now.

679
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,200
A family intends to adopt her.

680
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,760
It's a good thing.

681
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,000
However, I'm not sure about Xiao Wei.

682
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,550
During this period,

683
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,960
I can tell that

684
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,480
she trusts you guys a lot.

685
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,320
Though it's not confirmed,

686
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,200
I still would like to discuss it with you

687
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,590
at the first instance.

688
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,350
Thank you for believing in us.

689
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,200
We'll get going.

690
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,590
If there are any updates,

691
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,350
please contact us again.

692
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,790
Sure, no problem.

693
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,630
You don't have to send us off.

694
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,070
Have a safe journey.

695
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,110
Goodbye.

696
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,990
Goodbye.

697
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,790
Mr Su.

698
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,630
What do you think?

699
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,200
I think it's not a good idea.

700
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,640
[Wei Hao]

701
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,030
Hello?

702
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm almost done.

703
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,910
I'm talking with a friend.

704
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,800
I see.

705
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,310
You don't have to come.

706
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,590
We can meet up at the restaurant.

707
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,680
It doesn't matter.

708
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,320
We can talk at the restaurant.

709
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,110
You should respect my decision
since you invited me.

710
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,280
Just send me the location.

711
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,240
I have to go.

712
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,760
Where were we?

713
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,110
Do you want me to tag along?

714
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,950
Are you serious?

715
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,630
Aren't you...

716
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,350
Aren't you going to meet

717
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,040
the old friend you told me before?

718
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,200
It's him.

719
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm asking

720
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,480
why are you volunteering yourself
to come along?

721
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,000
You still remember

722
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,350
what I told you before.

723
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,200
Do I look like I have bad memory?

724
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,920
Yes.

725
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,760
You look like

726
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,000
you don't bother to remember things.

727
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,720
Let's go.

728
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,600
Let's go.

729
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,310
Are you

730
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,550
going to repeat the same
procedure every time?

731
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,110
So, are you going
to argue with me as usual?

732
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,040
How do you know

733
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,350
that call was from my old friend?

734
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,240
I could tell.

735
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,070
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

736
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,910
Actually, we have
resolved the misunderstanding.

737
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,390
We need to eat, right?

738
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,680
After this meal,

739
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
all of us will become friends.

740
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
Let's go.

741
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,150
Let's go.

742
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,110
Let's go.

743
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,200
Have you ordered?

744
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,590
Forget it.

745
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,320
[I bet he hates
having someone by his side.]

746
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,040
Here is the lemon juice.

747
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,430
Thank you.

748
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,870
It's so cold.

749
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,150
Stop eating.

750
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,430
Aren't you allergic to it?

751
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,350
Please bring a glass

752
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,830
of warm lemon juice for the lady.

753
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,790
Thank you.

754
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,960
It's pork. Can't you see it?

755
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,910
Are you blind?

756
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,590
So, both of you see each other every day

757
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,870
but you have not made peace with her.

758
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,790
The friendship
between girls is complicated.

759
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,670
You know nothing.

760
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,480
Fine, I don't want to know.

761
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,790
I just want to know

762
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,590
what's wrong with her.

763
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,520
She's resigned from the restaurant.

764
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,800
What does she want?

765
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,200
It's not about her.

766
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,240
It's about you.

767
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,430
Have you ever tried
to understand her life?

768
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,790
Unlike you,
she's eager to do well in everything.

769
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,830
All you care about is
managing a band for fun.

770
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,000
Yes, you have a fair share of fun

771
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,000
but look at her.

772
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,150
Ever since
she enrolled into the university,

773
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,480
has she ever taken a break?

774
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,480
Let's just talk about this incident.

775
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,790
Our supervisor assigned to both of us

776
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,200
an assignment to report
about an exhibition at the museum.

777
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,960
Do you know how far it is?

778
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,800
The journey takes more than three hours.

779
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,390
Internship alone has taken a toll on her.

780
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,590
She also has to make money.

781
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,320
Isn’t it normal that she
doesn't have the time to entertain you?

782
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,920
Mr Su.

783
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,480
Do you like lemon juice too?

784
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,040
Mr Su.

785
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,840
Mr Su.

786
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,240
Have some lemon juice.

787
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,960
I have something to tell you.

788
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,680
Madam Zhang called me just now.

789
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,720
She said that the couple

790
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,110
have decided to adopt Xiao Wei.

791
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,910
They have initiated
the adoption procedure.

792
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,870
Isn't it

793
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,630
exciting news?

794
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,830
What is so exciting about it?

795
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,000
Do you know the couple?

796
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,870
Have you considered Xiao Wei's feelings?

797
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,430
What if they send her back later?

798
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,870
Do you know

799
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,520
how much damage
it would cause to Xiao Wei?

800
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,280
But...

801
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,040
But she deserves a chance

802
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,960
to embrace a different future.

803
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,110
Is staying in the welfare home forever

804
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,870
the best option she has?

805
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,790
If she refuses to give it a try

806
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,000
just because
she's worried about the outcome,

807
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,630
that makes her a coward.

808
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,230
Fine.

809
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,910
If my prediction comes true,

810
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,430
will you take on the responsibility?

811
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,800
I...

812
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,280
I...

813
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,000
You're too naive.

814
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,430
I...

815
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,240
He's never happy with anything.
