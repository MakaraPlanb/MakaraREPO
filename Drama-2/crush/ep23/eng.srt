I'm exhausted.

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,760
Okay, bye bye.

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,000
Who were you talking to on the phone?

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,400
Cheng Yin.

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,880
Is she still alone in Tongcheng County?

9
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,280
I asked her to come over to write
her paper, but she won't come.

10
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,560
Are you feeling a little lonely

11
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,040
without Cheng Yin here?

12
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,400
I am.

13
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,600
But she still doesn't seem

14
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
to want to see you now.

15
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
What's the matter?

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,360
She sees me as a love rival?

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr Su,

19
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,640
it means

20
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
she doesn't actually want to avoid you.

21
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,960
It's just that this Cheng Yin

22
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,240
is paranoid of you.

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,880
I've only noticed this recently.

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,120
I wonder if it's a coincidence.

25
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
I don't think it is.

26
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,000
Judging by the current situation,

27
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,240
I hope you can make more time for her.

28
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,240
The best situation for her is if you're
with her, Cheng Yin won't be there.

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,280
The less Cheng Yin appears,

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
indicates that her condition is improving.

31
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
But

32
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,120
would it really be alright

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,320
if I don't bring her in for treatment?

34
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Treatment is a double-edged blade.

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
Although the current treatment

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,079
will delay the healing process,

37
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,480
it will minimize the mental impact

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,560
and damage

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,680

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,720
which approach should I take?

42
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,400
Actually, you've already
made a decision deep down,

Sometimes, I can't turn
down these invitations.

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,280

you when you get home.

on lately is a little weird.

you can come closer and
examine me thoroughly.

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,280
Sure.

What's more, I made them myself.

70
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
This is certainly not made by Aunt, right?

00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
Is it bad?

72

What else did you make?

73
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,720
I only made the meatballs.

74
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,000

didn't you hear me calling you?

80
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,440
I'm not your pet.

81
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,160
Why should I rush over to you

82
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,720
whenever you call?

83
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't treat you like a pet.

84
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
You do.

85
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,480
Be reasonable, okay?

86
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,640

Good girl.

Come here.

90
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,960
I called you because I really
wanted to apologize to you.

91
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,320
Your tone was really mean, okay?

92
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Let's make some ground rules.

93
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,560
Don't be mean to me, don't drink

94
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,520
and don't smoke.

95
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,640
Okay.

96
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,400
I'll punish you if you break the rules.

97
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
What's the punishment?

98
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,280
You tell me.

99
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
What's the punishment?

100
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,120
No talking for three days.

101
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,480
Okay.

102
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,320
Su Nian Qin, not talking is
exactly what you want, isn't it?

103
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,600
Su Nian Qin, you don't even
have the courtesy to repent.

104
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,880
Wu Yan,

105
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,800
I think there's something
you forgot to do.

106
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,680
What is it?

107
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Think about it.

108
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,920
Something that you must do

109
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,920
after you finish the meal.

110
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,680
Gargling?

111
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Wash the dishes.

112
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,400
Hello,

113
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,600
is this Ms Sang?

114
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,480
I am Yu Wei Lan.

115
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,520
Hello.

116
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,200
If you're looking for Nian Qin,

117
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
he is...

118
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,960
No.

119
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm actually looking for you.

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Me?

121
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,120
Ms Sang, you don't
seem to want to talk to me?

122
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,240
No, I'm not.

123
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,040
That's okay.

124
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,480
As a stepmother who was
once hated by Nian Qin,

125
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,840
I've become very thick-skinned now.

126
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,520
Wu Yan,

127
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,400
can I address you

128
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,640
the same way Nian Qin and Xiao Lu do?

129
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,680
In the past,

130
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,960
Nian Qin and I had
a difficult relationship.

131
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,200
For a long time,

132
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
he didn't talk nicely to me even once.

133
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,120
But that has changed.

134
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
You know, Wu Yan,

135
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,320
it's all because of you.

136
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,360
You changed him.

137
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,440
I didn't really do anything.

138
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,760
You made him fall in
love with you, didn't you?

139
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,120
I think,

140
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,680
for a while,

141
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,960
Nian Qin had lost the ability to love.

142
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,760
Then he met you.

143
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,320
You brought light to his eyes.

144
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
You made him understand that

145
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,400
if we work together,

146
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,600
every family will find happiness

147
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,720
in their own way.

148
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,240
That's all we need.

149
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,200
Thank you.

150
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,040
There is nothing to thank me for.

151
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
This is just me, as a mother, trying

152
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,480
to convince my son's lover for him.

153
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,600
I hope that you can marry him in peace.

154
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,920
You can say I'm doing
it for selfish reasons.

155
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
Where is Nian Qin?

156
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,120
He's sleeping.

157
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
That's what I thought.

158
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,200
I was wondering

159
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,440
why he didn't come to stop me

160
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,920
after we're talking on
the phone for so long.

161
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Do you also feel that

162
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,240
he was a little overprotective of you?

163
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
I mocked him over this too.

164
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Actually, there's a lot of
things he doesn't like about me.

165
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,920
He doesn't like me misplacing stuff.

166
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,240
And I don't know how to cook.

167
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,840
And he doesn't like
me singing out of tune.

168
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,560
Looks like I failed to teach him well.

169
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,960
Don't worry, Wu Yan.

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,520
I'll correct his prejudice.

171
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
When you have time,

172
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,480
come home with Nian Qin.

173
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I'll have to see when he's free.

174
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,080
Okay.

175
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
It's a deal then.

176
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Bye bye.

177
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,600
I was just being polite with her.

178
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,280
And you really took time out.

179
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,280
What?

180
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,480
I mean

181
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
when I see Xiao Lu's sister later,

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
what should I call her?

183
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,080
You've asked this three question
times on our way here.

184
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,480
Madam Yu.

185
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,200
Yu Wei Lan.

186
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,440
Madam Su, Mrs Su.

187
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,640
Sister of Xiao Lu. Anything you want.

188
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,200
What do you call her then?

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
Yu Wei Lan.

190
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,040
What about your dad?

191
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,960
Is he nice?

192
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
Is he scary?

193
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,800
He's getting old now,

194
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
so he has become a lot nicer.

195
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,120
As for his temper, it's as good as mine.

196
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,520
Let's go.

197
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,680
Hold on, hold on.

198
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,280
Let me check if my makeup is running.

199
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,400
I mean I just feel that

200
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,200
your glasses look nice.

201
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,400
You look nice too.

202
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,560
Don't worry.

203
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's go.

204
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
This is Nian Qin's mother's piano.

205
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,040
I've always thought that
this piano's soundboard

206
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,360
produced the best sound I've ever heard.

207
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,640
You can sit down and try it.

208
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,120
Can I?

209
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,200
I've asked my brother-in-law.
He's fine with it.

210
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,680
Okay.

211
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
You've met her now.

212
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,800
Don't walk over there.

213
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,040
She's timid. You will scare her.

214
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
I plan to get married with her
after she gets her master's degree.

215
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,800
That's great. It's happening soon.

216
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,040
I'd better start preparing.

217
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,040
Preparing what?

218
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,040
What does she think about it?

219
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,560
From what I see,

220
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,520
it's nice enough that
she wants to marry you.

221
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,280
What... What are you doing here?

222
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
Your dad...

223
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,800
We'll just go there
when it's time for dinner.

224
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,920
Okay.

225
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,000
What song did you just play?

226
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,520
How come I've never heard it before?

227
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
I think it's nice.

228
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,960
I was just noodling.

229
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,920
So

230
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
you're feeling like composing
a song, aren't you?

231
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I just played a few random melodies.

232
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,720
If I really want to compose a song,

233
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,600
melody is just the beginning.

234
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,920
The hardest part is the arrangement.

235
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,200
What mode should it be,

236
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,720
what chords should I use,

237
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,240
everything has to be
structured and precise.

238
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,640
Song composition is not that easy.

239
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,560
Is it that complicated?

240
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,320
I thought you could just compose
one when you're in the mood.

241
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,560
It isn't complicated.

242
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
It's called logical.

243
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
What are the scale and chords you used

244
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
in the song you wrote for me?

245
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,359
C major.

246
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
The simplest chord and the simplest scale.

247
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,520
The simplest?

248
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,119
So you're just not
doing it from your heart.

249
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,760
Here's the thing.

250
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Major keys sound brighter.

251
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,520
Minor keys sound more sombre.

252
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,120
So that means

253
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,080
major chords are how you sound like

254
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,040
when you are usually happy,

255
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,080
minor chords are how you sound
like when you usually talk.

256
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,800
That's easy then.

257
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,760
Just use C major

258
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,360
to compose one more song.

259
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,200
It's so simple.

260
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,880
Isn't it easy to compose one?

261
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,440
It's been so long since I wrote a song.

262
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,520
You said it yourself just now.

263
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,880
Every new melody is a new beginning.

264
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,200
Your interpretation is always so...

265
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,000
Did I interpret it wrongly?

266
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,200
You know,

267
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,160
I think a lot of times,

268
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,800
we insist on doing something

269
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
not because we really want to do it,

270
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,080
but because we have to do it.

271
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,480
Because we can't resist it.

272
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,560
That's why I've been

273
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
working in the radio station.

274
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,240
Reason is telling me that

275
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,200
I have to keep trying to leave,

276
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,600
yet I'm still hosting shows.

277
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,480
You're doing the same
thing too, aren't you?

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,480
It's like you never stop playing piano.

279
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,400
Dinner time.

280
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,240
Coming.

281
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,480
I'll take it as a yes then.

282
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,720
What's next?

283
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,880
Nian Qin, why did we
have to leave so early?

284
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,000
I didn't even get a
chance to talk to your dad.

285
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,960
He's a bad conversationalist.

286
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,080
There's nothing to talk about.

287
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,480
That's not true.

288
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,320
I think he's just like how you said he is.

289
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,080
I think he's quite friendly.

290
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,400
What are you watching?

291
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,120
Just some film.

292
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,880
Nian Qin,

293
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,200
close your eyes.

294
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,400
I'll tell you what the movie is about.

295
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,120
The movie is now at the part where

296
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
the protagonist is searching high and low

297
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
for his best friend, William.

298
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,640
However,

299
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,640
no one knows who his friend is.

300
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,600
His name is not
even on the student list.

301
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,520
The doctor

302
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,600
tells him that

303
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,920
everything that happened
between him and William...

304
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Boss,

305
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,200
here's the information of the film.

306
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
This film is based on

307
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,360
the real-life experiences of
mathematician John Nash.

308
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
John Nash was awarded

309
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,600
the Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Sciences in 1994

310
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,920
for his game theory.

311
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,160
But

312
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Nash and his wife

313
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,000
had a lifelong battle with his paranoia.

314
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,400
He saw the world in a way

315
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,680
that no one can ever imagine.

316
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,560
This sentence is special.

317
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
Look at the camera.

318
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,120
Three, two, one.

319
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,840
Not bad.

320
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,600
One more, one more.

321
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,400
Here we go.

322
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,320
Those who are in 422 come here.

323
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,440
Come.

324
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,320
Let's get a picture.

325
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,680
Nice. Let's take one more.

326
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,600
Take a few more.

327
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,680
Three, two, one.

328
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,800
Look, he's so handsome.

329
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Yes.

330
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,080
Wu Yan, congratulations
on your graduation.

331
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,800
-Thank you.
-Wu Yan,

332
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,560
is this your mum?

333
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,520
She looks so elegant.

334
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,880
Hi.

335
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,920
Excuse me,

336
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,400
I have to take my wife and mother-in-law

337
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,680
to other places to take pictures.

338
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,080
You're calling me mother-in-law already?

339
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Mrs Sang,

340
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,680
I've been planning to
get married with Wu Yan

341
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,240
after she graduates.

342
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,800
Since I'm marrying my daughter,

343
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,040
I should accept nothing less.

344
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,640
What other family's daughter has,

345
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,600
my Wu Yan deserves nothing less.

346
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,520
You hear me?

347
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,400
Of course.

348
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,520
I'll give her the best of everything.

349
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,720
How do you want to get
your makeup done tomorrow?

350
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,400
I want a natural look.

351
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
What about the groom?

352
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,320
He just needs to do his hair.

353
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,000
Can you make me look pretty

354
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,520
and make him look ugly?

355
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,680
Why?

356
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,560
Because this way,

357
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
others won't think I'm
not good enough for him.

358
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:09,840
Bye bye.

359
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,160
See you tomorrow, bye bye.

360
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,720
Wu Yan,

361
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,680
it's been a long time.

362
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,680
What are you doing here?

363
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,600
I've received Su Nian Qin's
wedding invitation.

364
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,160
So I came here as soon as I could.

365
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,840
I asked Qin just now,

366
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,120
and found out that you're here.

367
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,560
Wu Yan,

368
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,400
you still have a chance
to change your mind.

369
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,000
Change my mind about what?

370
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,280
Marrying him.

371
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
I can be a backup.

372
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,840
Whose backup are you planning to be?

373
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,960

376
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
That's even impossible.

377
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,200
Nian Qin,

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,840
let's go.

379
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,560
What's the matter?

380
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,360
I need to take you to buy something.

381
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,520
Buy what?

382
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
It is a very, very simple

384
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,640
I have to prove that you look better than

385
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,000
Peng Rui Xing in pink.

386
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,160
Otherwise, I'm not comfortable
with simply marrying you.

387
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,880
I have one.

388
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,880
You're so forgetful.

389
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,040
You do?

390
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,080
The colour that only a truly handsome man

391
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,200
can look good in.

392
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,560
That's true.

393
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,480
Only a truly handsome

Are you happy now, my wife?

395

I am.

396

Can you sign this now, my wife?

397
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,320
Two families are brought
together due to a marriage.

398

Our matrimony is a match made in heaven.

411
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,040
It's for you to keep it, of course.

412
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,080
You can use it to
denounce me in the future.

413
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,360
Alright.

414
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,200
I have to go now.

I hear the notification of your message.

422
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,560
I was wondering if you couldn't
sleep and wanted to talk to me.

423
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,800
You couldn't sleep too?

424
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,160
I was sleeping.

425
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,960
I put my phone under the pillow.

426
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,240
I woke up when it vibrated.

427
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,280
What's wrong? Why aren't you sleeping?

428
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,920
I couldn't sleep.

Why are you able to sleep?

430
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,040
Wu Yan, rise and shine.

It's 6:30 a.m.

432

Time to get up and get ready.

433

it's your wedding day

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,320
Do you want the wedding to be cancelled?

Get out of your bed now.

438
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,640

You found out.

Now the surprise is gone.

Don't forget.

Blind people

447

generally rely on sound or sunlight

448
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,080
to tell direction.

452
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,880
Nothing.

Do you think my bow tie is too big?

454
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
Should I change to a different knot?

455
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,120
Are you getting nervous?

456
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,280
Of course not.

457
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,000

00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,160
He has to make me stand at the

556
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
front door and say welcome back,

557
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,400
you've had a hard day.

558
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Is he happy now?

559
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,920
Stop laughing, okay?

560
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,280
I'm really upset now.

561
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,600
What did he say?

562
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,520
He didn't say a word.

563
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,840
What about other times?

564
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,440
Except for this,

565
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,880
he's usually normal.

566
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,120
No matter what,

567
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,680
even if I stood at the door

568
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,720
and the door was wide open,

569
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,400
he wouldn't give in.

570
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,960
He had to make me go over the process.

571
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,680
He's too unreasonable.

572
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,120
Just leave him at the door

573
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,120
and let him wait for the whole night.

574
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,680
If I really ignored him,

575
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,640
he might have stood
there until the next day.

576
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,680
Serves him right.

577
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,240
But

578
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
it would make me feel bad.

579
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,400
I just don't get him.

580
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,360
I mean, before we got married,

581
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,680
we lived together for a while too, right?

582
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,920
How come this has never happened before?

583
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,360
Because women aren't the
only ones who are ritualistic.

584
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,880
For him, this is like a ritual of a man.

585
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,920
Before marriage,

586
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,680
you two were boyfriend and girlfriend.

587
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,720
After marriage,

588
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,760
he wants a ritual

589
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,040
to show that you're his wife

590
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
and that you're part of his life.

591
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,440
But why did he have to choose this way?

592
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,480
Maybe

593
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,000
he doesn't want you to neglect him.

594
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,880
And me welcoming him
home intimately every day

595
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,560
means I'm not neglecting him?

596
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,800
Is he that lovey-dovey?

597
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,960
Yes.

598
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,720
He just likes to express himself

599
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,200
in very specific ways.

600
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,360
Such as

601
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,600
putting the ring on your finger

602
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,200
to affirm your status.

603
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,400
Writing the marriage vow for you

604
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,920
to make a commitment.

605
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,320
He hopes to express that

606
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,120
you're his number one priority.

607
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,840
Maybe he also hopes that

608
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,480
you can use the same way

609
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,760
to express that he's your
number one priority too.

610
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,240
This is his ritual.

611
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,320
Can I interpret this as
he loves me too much?

612
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,600
Of course.

613
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,480
So that means

614
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,600
unless we divorce,

615
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,600
I have to put up with him
like this for the rest of our lives.
