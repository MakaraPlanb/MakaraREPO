has ﻿agree unanimously that

15
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,560
Proposal SK-1 is both innovative

16
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,040
and refreshing.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,760
However, aerospace belongs to
systems engineering.

18
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,360
The prerequisite

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,480
of your proposal is

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,040

so quiet today?

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Feeling down?

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,160
Is it that bad?

28
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm not someone chatty to begin with.

29

But during the defense just now,

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
you were so eloquent.

31
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,040
And now, you look moody.

32
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,040
Why? Discouraged?

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,239
Didn't we

34

You're right.

40

112
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,320

to your defense.

(please also tell everyone that)

122
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,079
(Jingjing was in the elite class)

123
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,320
(and she graduated
from a university of Project 211.)

124
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,079
(She did poorly in school?)

125
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,920
(Impossible!)

126
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,320
And now I'd like to ask

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
the victim in question:

128
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:06,880
are they real or fake?

129
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,679
Some are real, some are fake.

130
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,000
That one about me being ugly was fake.

131
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
I've always looked this good, okay?

132
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,119
Also,

133
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,119
he rejected me, yes,

134
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,239
but it wasn't ugly.

135
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,320
He was really polite.

136
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,359
So you admit that

137
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,679
you confessed to him

138
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,519
but got rejected?

139
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,160
Yes.

140
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,720
That guy...

141
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,079
(Yu Tu)

142
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
was really handsome

143
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
and really smart.

144
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,559
So did he really

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
think that you were dumb

146
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,959
and so he chose the other girl over you?

147
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm not dumb. You are.

148
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,320
I graduated
from a university of Project 211.

149

152
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,519
(You have always been pretty.)

153
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,640
(You were just a bit unpolished.)

154
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,640
(By the way,)

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,279
(I heard from Li Ming that)

156
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,080
(Yu Tu and Xia Qing broke up)

157
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,359
(when they were in
the fourth year of university.)

158
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,719
(They were together for around a year.)

159
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,440
(You still remember Li Ming,)

160
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,000
(our high school friend?)

161
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,880
(He lived in the same area as Yu Tu.)

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
(Their parents know each other.)

163
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,159
(I heard Yu Tu is now in Shanghai.)

164
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,080
(Yu Tu)

165
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,679
(Speaking of which, Jingjing,)

166
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,520
(do you think Yu Tu
regrets rejecting you?)

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,119
(Don't be this childish.)

168
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,760
Yu Tu.

169
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,359
Do you have a moment?

170
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,479
I have a question.

171
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,200
Sure, go ahead.

172
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,479
Do you want a girlfriend now?

173
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,679
If so,

174
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,760
what do you think of me?

175
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,599
(Sorry.)

176
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
(I want someone)

177
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,479
(who can work together with me.)

178
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,919
(But who you found)

179
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
(didn't stick with you till the end.)

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,520
It's already 10 PM.

181
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,280
Should we

182
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
return to Shanghai?

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
We'll leave tomorrow morning

184
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
and arrive at Hengdian in the afternoon.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,760
I'll ask them

186
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,039
to postpone your scenes.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,520
No.

188
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,679
I have ten scenes tomorrow.

189
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go to Hengdian now.

190
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,320
Ask the driver to drive slowly.

191
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,039
Look how tired you are.

192
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,159
Mr. Wang

193
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Hengdian it is.

194
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,039
No problem.

195
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,760
Thank you.

196
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,740
(Class 5 Senior 3)

197
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,719
(An exam?)

198
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,039
(How many calories
does a strawberry have?)

199
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,039
That's tough.

200
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,440
Even a brainiac won't know the answer.

201
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,820
(Math)

202
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,820
(Math Exam)

203
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,479
Jingjing.

204
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,919
Jingjing.

205
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,080
Wake up!

206
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,719
Did you play Honor of Kings?

207
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,520
(Xiao Qiao,)

208
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,159
(you can become stronger.)

209
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,080
(Enemy Legendary)

210
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,080
(Enemy Unstopable)

211
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,360
(You've been slain)

212
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,140
(This level? Pro gamer?
Honor of Kings Endorser?)

213
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,479
This Xiao Qiao was you?

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,080
Congratulations.

215
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,880
You're famous on Weibo now.

216
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,840
Look.

217
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,559
First in trending:

218
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,440
Qiao Jingjing, a fake gamer,

219
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,000
sending ripples through
the entertainment

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and the esports industry.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,559
When did you start playing this game?

222
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,799
When I was filming earlier this year.

223
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,960
I played it on and off.

224
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,479
I didn't play it for long.

225
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,440
In Honor of Kings,

226
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,039
you can be a spectator

227
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,760
and watch people fight,

228
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,719
even record it.

229
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,719
Didn't you know?

230
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,320
Such a function exists?

231
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,640
You didn't know?

232
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,760
Why did you even play the game?

233
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,359
I have endorsed the game.

234
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,919
You guys said I was a pro gamer.

235
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,960
Fake it

236
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,280
till you make it, right?

237
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,119
I knew you're like this.

238
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,000
Just one or two compliments

239
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,440
are enough to make you think
you're good at something.

240
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,200
It's serious, you know.

241
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,479
Do you have any idea
how popular this game is?

242
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,960
How many people are lining up

243
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,479
to endorse it?

244
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,719
Some will even do it for free!

245
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:56,840
Honor of Kings

246
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,359
was supposed to renew
the contract with us.

247
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,080
But with the current drama,

248
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,239
I guess it's gone.

249
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,119
Of course, this is not the worst.

250
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,159
You're an actress.

251
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,280
Endorsement is just a side job.

252
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,719
What's more important

253
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,679
is the leading actress role
for Mr. Li's latest movie.

254
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:12,760
Do you know

255
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,679
what this new movie

256
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,640
will be called?

257
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,359
Authenticity.

258
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,479
You're saying that

259
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,000
someone stirred this up

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
to get the role in Mr. Li's movie.

261
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,360
(Alex-Honor of Kings)

262
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,799
Call from Honor of Kings.

263
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,359
Hi,

264
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,080
Ms. Qiu, I'm Alex.

265
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,359
Hi.

266
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,640
What's with the trending topic today?

267
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,359
Does that alt belong to Jingjing?

268
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,119
Was she practicing some heroes?

269
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes.

270
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
She was using her alt

271
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,039
to practice heroes
she was not familiar with.

272
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,239
That's why it was like this.

273
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,599
In this case,

274
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,159
you should clarify

275
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,599
(Honor of Kings World Champion Cup)
on Weibo.

276
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,520
Or else,

277
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,840
you'll put us in a weird position.

278
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,000
You're right.

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,559
We'll do it right away.

280
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:56,799
By the way, Ms. Qiu.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,359
We have discussed internally
and we believe that

282
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,000
a clarification on Weibo

283
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,799
might not be able to cut it.

284
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,599
We will have an event soon

285
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,359
and we might be able to turn this crisis

286
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,400
into opportunity.

287
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,320
What event?

288
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,559
So,

289
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,080
the World Champion Cup

290
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,599
will end in a month.

291
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,280
And then,

292
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,919
we'll hold

293
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,640
an award ceremony.

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,520
In this ceremony,

295
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,599
we would love to invite Jingjing

296
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,840
to play a casual match.

297
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,840
We will select randomly

298
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,599
five lucky players from Weibo.

299
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,119
Together with Jingjing, the six of them

300
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,280
will be divided into two teams.

301
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,159
Each team can select

302
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,039
two professional players
as their teammates.

303
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,559
But this is not stipulated

304
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,880
on our contract.

305
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,960
The contract also doesn't say that

306
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,599
a video like this

307
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,679
would be leaked.

308
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,039
It's just a casual match.

309
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,400
Don't worry.

310
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,880
Unless Jingjing is...

311
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not about her player skill.

312
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,479
It's that in our...

313
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,799
It's okay. I'll do it.

314
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Ms. Qiu.

315
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,640
Hello.

316
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,280
That voice just now was...

317
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,559
It was Jingjing.

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,880
As you know,

319
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,640
she's an avid fan

320
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,880
of your game.

321
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Since

322
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,960
Jingjing already said yes,

323
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
I see no point in refusing you.

324
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,760
Let's discuss more in detail.

325
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,280
Qiao Jingjing updated her Weibo.

326
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,559
(That was the best I could do.)

327
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,039
(We both have Qiao in our name)

328
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,799
(so why can't I use you well?)

329
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,280
The comments and the reactions

330
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,159
from the netizens seem good.

331
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,159
Many have bought

332
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:23,880
her explanation.

333
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,799
However, some still remain skeptical.

334
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,640
Post the message we said just now.

335
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,719
(In this year's award ceremony,)

336
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,039
(the endorser of Honor of Kings,)

337
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,000
(Qiao Jingjing will have a casual match)

338
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,159
(with some lucky winners.)

339
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,840
(Are you excited about)

340
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,239
(Qiao Jingjing's Xiao Qiao?)

341
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,400
(Apply now.)

342
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,080
(Jingjing's so cute! Go!)
(Jingjing, you're the best! Go!)

343
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,719
After announcing that

344
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,000
Qiao Jingjing will play
in a casual match,

345
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,280
the tide has turned.

346
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,479
Everyone is looking forward to it now.

347
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,527
(Qiao Jingjing:
I'm done with Xiao Qiao!)

348
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,599
In fact, everyone thinks that

349
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,280
it's normal

350
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,919
to be unable to perform well
on certain heroes.

351
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,000
Look.

352
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,159
Some players came to her defense too.

353
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,679
However,

354
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,760
how good is she?

355
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,000
If she's as bad as she was

356
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
in the video,

357
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,080
then that would be disastrous.

358
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,200
We will look bad.

359
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,200
When that happens,

360
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,960
we'll remove her as our endorser.

361
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
The dissenting voice

362
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,520
has gone down temporarily,

363
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,799
but the casual match

364
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,000
will begin in around a month.

365
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,320
Your level

366
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,520
is not good enough for a match.

367
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,640
I have already found

368
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,039
an excuse for you.

369
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,799
You really don't have to

370
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,280
take part in this match.

371
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,200
Jingjing,

372
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,239
you're too reckless this time.

373
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,599
Jingjing.

374
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,559
Ling,

375
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,200
I don't usually accept a stranger's

376
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
friend request on WeChat.

377
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,760
Don't worry.

378
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,280
I'll find out

379
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,479
who's behind

380
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,479
all this.

381
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,799
No need for that.

382
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
It's my fault.

383
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,599
Don't be mad.

384
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,479
I'm not mad.

385
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,719
The culprit will suffer my wrath soon.

386
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,280
Try to get me the role

387
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,439
from Mr. Li.

388
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:12,920
Okay.

389
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,680
As for the game,

390
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,719
find someone reliable

391
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,680
to coach me.

392
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,479
This show

393
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,959
will finish shooting in a few days.

394
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,400
Keep the current schedule.

395
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,599
Don't add other things.

396
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,160
I was planning

397
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,599
to give you a 2-week break.

398
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,680
But now that the casual match

399
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,199
is in a month,

400
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:27,760
you plan to

401
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,199
spend this period to practice hard?

402
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,520
Look.

403
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,760
In the comments,

404
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,400
(Jingjing, go!)
my fans voiced their support.

405
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,920
(Looking forward to Jingjing's performance)
If I lose in the match which will take place

406
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
in a month,

407
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,079
not only will I be mocked,

408
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:39,920
my fans too.

409
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,599
I see.

410
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,560
I'll arrange for it then.

411
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,479
It's my fault this time.

412
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,640
Thank you.

413
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, please.

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,199
No need to

415
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,079
to thank me.

416
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,479
I still have one month.

417
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,560
I can do this.

418
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,280
In no way is this

419
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,359
harder than abs training.

420
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,239
Of course.

421
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,160
You can do this.

422
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,199
All right. It's 2 AM now.

423
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,359
You still have shooting tomorrow.

424
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,040
Sleep early.

425
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:06,560
All right.

426
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,239
Jingjing.

427
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,599
Even though I agree that

428
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,520
abs training is harder than gaming,

429
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,599
but your abs are nowhere to be seen

430
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,599
despite the weight loss.

431
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,400
Good night.

432
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,880
Really? You can't see them?

433
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,800
Congratulations, Ms. Qiao

434
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,239
(End of shooting celebration)
for completing the shooting.

435
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,359
Yay!

436
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,380
(Fushan Production Team,
End of shooting celebration)

437
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,400
Come, let's take a group photo.

438
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,640
Look at this camera.

439
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,680
Three, two, one. Good.

440
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,839
Thank you.

441
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,160
Thanks, everyone. Goodbye.

442
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,119
Take care.

443
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,640
Good job.

444
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,160
Goodbye.

445
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,959
Since you've decided

446
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,199
to play in this casual match,

447
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,880
then we have to prepare thoroughly.

448
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Only one goal in mind:

449
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,160
don't let anyone know that

450
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,119
you're a novice.

451
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,640
Once you're back in Shanghai,

452
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,199
you'll need to start training.

453
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,880
Got it.

454
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:26,959
Take this.

455
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,920
You'll use this phone
for the casual match.

456
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,119
Use it

457
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,959
for your practice

458
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,199
so that you can get used to it.

459
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,520
Your account has been created.

460
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,000
No one will know it's you.

461
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
I've also found you

462
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
a professional coach for you.

463
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,920
Who?

464
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,920
A professional player?

465
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,920
I can't wait.

466
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,719
Here.

467
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,880
My husband.

468
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,119
Are you sure he's good at it?

469
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,800
Guo

470
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,319
is a King player, okay?

471
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,500
(Guo, King Player x0
Best Heroes: Cheng Yaojin, Xiahou Dun...)

472
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:42,880
I decided to ask you to

473
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,280
endorse Honor of Kings

474
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,880
because

475
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
I was inspired by

476
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,800
how engrossed he was in the game.

477
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,920
He's a veteran,

478
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,160
more than qualified to be your coach.

479
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,439
Also,

480
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,599
with our current situation,

481
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,400
I don't dare to find
an outsider to coach you.

482
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,000
What if he or she
shares this with everyone?

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,599
Fine then.

484
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,880
Train hard.

485
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,160
If you have half of

486
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
what Guo has,

487
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,800
then your performance
should be satisfactory.

488
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,520
I still have work.

489
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
This meeting room

490
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:08,920
will be your classroom

491
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,880
from now onwards.

492
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,760
Start whenever.

493
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,359
Train hard too, Xiao Zhu

494
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,400
so that you can be her partner.

495
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,040
All right.

496
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,119
I'll leave her to you, darling.

497
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,359
Go finish your things.

498
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,400
Go.

499
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,599
I'll be in your care then.

500
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,920
No need to be so formal.

501
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
We're almost like a family now.

502
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
Ling has told me

503
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,199
about the general situation.

504
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,359
Don't worry.

505
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,239
This game is simple.

506
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,280
You can be good at

507
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,520
several heroes

508
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,359
in a month.

509
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,560
Calm yourself down.

510
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,160
Okay.

511
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,280
So let's start

512
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,439
from the basics.

513
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:47,839
Okay.

514
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
Let's go to the tutorial.

515
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,920
(Welcome to the Honor of Kings.)

516
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,040
From the blue side's perspective,

517
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,000
this is mid,

518
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,479
this is top,

519
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,400
and this is bottom.

520
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,119
Since

521
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,239
you're new,

522
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,520
let's start with Support.

523
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,199
Just follow the Marksman.

524
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,199
Okay.

525
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,359
By the way,

526
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,239
Ling told me

527
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,359
about the match rules.

528
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,760
You'll have

529
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,880
two random players

530
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,199
and two pro players

531
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,239
as your teammates.

532
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,319
Honestly,

533
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,680
you can never outperform

534
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,479
a professional player anyway.

535
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,359
Professional players

536
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,959
will want to be the carries.

537
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,119
There are carries in this game?

538
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,280
Yes.

539
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,439
There are five positions

540
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,359
in total.

541
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,520
Mid, Jungler, Marksman,
Tank, and Support.

542
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,599
The first three

543
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
are the carries.

544
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,520
Can I be a carry then?

545
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,239
Do you want to win?

546
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,880
Yes.

547
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,959
Then play Support.

548
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,280
Do you know why?

549
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:26,719
First,

550
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,680
Support is easier to pick up.

551
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,520
Secondly,
it's not the most pivotal role.

552
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,359
You can definitely be Support.

553
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,199
Let me teach you

554
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,880
some common supportive

555
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,920
skills.

556
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,640
Look.

557
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,760
Let's start with Zhang Fei.

558
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,359
His abilities

559
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,520
are quite simple.

560
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,119
Five Tiger Generals,

561
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,319
at your service.

562
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,740
(Victory)

563
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,319
Just like that.

564
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,160
Now, let's matchmake and practice.

565
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,000
(Welcome to the Honor of Kings.)

566
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,000
Just follow me, Hou Yi.

567
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
Use your Skill 1 once you're out.

568
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,340
(Get Ready. Prepare to engage)

569
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:33,520
Okay.

570
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,839
Your Skill 2 is a shield.

571
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,479
Use it on me.

572
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,359
Good.

573
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,359
If you can use it at the right time,
it will be even better.

574
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,560
Okay.

575
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,479
You're level 4 now.

576
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,520
You can use your ultimate skill.

577
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,520
Use it to blow him away.

578
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,319
Follow my march!

579
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,387
(Yikes!)

580
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,479
(Thank you.)

581
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,680
He was about to die.

582
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
Why did you blow him away?

583
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,520
I just wanted to see how it looks like.

584
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,319
It's okay.

585
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,079
Let's continue.

586
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Gao Jianli is after me now.

587
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,400
Hurry

588
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,599
and blow him away
with your ultimate skill.

589
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,300
(First Blood)

590
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:10,160
Jesus!

591
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't have much HP left.

592
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,760
Why did you

593
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,839
blow him towards me?

594
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,439
It's okay.

595
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:17,079
Let's continue.

596
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:17,760
Don't sweat it.

597
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,040
You can do this.

598
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,040
Come.

599
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,220
(You've been slain.)

600
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,220
(You've been slain.)

601
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,220
(Enemy unstoppable)

602
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,980
(Defeat)

603
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,199
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

604
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,000
This hero is not meant for you.

605
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:39,800
So,

606
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,400
let's use another hero.

607
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Let's use Sun Bin.

608
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,400
He's quite good.

609
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,220
(Defeat)

610
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,760
Try Niumo.

611
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,700
(Defeat)

612
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,319
Zhuang Zhou.

613
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,620
(Defeat)

614
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,839
Today

615
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,560
is still a fruitful day.

616
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,839
We have found several heroes

617
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,079
that don't suit your play style.

618
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,119
Let's not give up

619
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,479
and do this again tomorrow.

620
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
We'll definitely find

621
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
your true calling.

622
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,680
Okay.

623
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,160
Yes.

624
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,079
How's the training?

625
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:46,520
Well,

626
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:50,000
full of surprises.

627
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,040
Oh, my.

628
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,959
You worked hard.

629
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,199
Your arms must be tired.

630
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
How's the practice?

631
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:09,839
Not bad.

632
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,520
We've tried out

633
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,400
all Supports.

634
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,439
Really?

635
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,280
Did she find a hero

636
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,319
that she's good at then?

637
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,439
Cai Wenji.

638
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,880
Zhuang Zhou and Yao
are not bad too, right?

639
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,040
Wait,

640
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,640
even though

641
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,959
you're not at your best form yet,

642
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,479
but the random players

643
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,719
selected

644
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,760
won't necessarily be King players either,

645
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,640
right?

646
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,160
So let's call off tomorrow.

647
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Have a break.

648
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,359
I will revise

649
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,079
a new coaching plan

650
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,479
based on

651
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,880
Jingjing's capability.

652
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,079
Okay.

653
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,839
She has to shoot
an ad tomorrow anyway.

654
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,719
She won't be able to practice.

655
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:51,520
Jingjing,

656
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,719
go back now

657
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:53,560
and sleep early.

658
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,359
I'll practice

659
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,520
on my phone tomorrow.

660
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,439
I'm not used to this phone.

661
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,800
Don't. Don't.

662
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,160
If people record your game again,

663
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,280
we'll be in deep trouble.

664

665
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,239

667
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,680
I can use my alt.

668
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,959

669
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,040

(None shall resist)

758
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,479
(my bullet and my good looks.)

759
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,540
(Tripple Kill)

760
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,679
Is

761
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
Yu Tu good at this game?

762
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,420
(Double Kill)

763
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,280
Another victory?

764
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,040
It's barely ten minutes!

765
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,260
(Carry me please!)

766
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,600
(Will it be too)

767
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,080
(shameless of me)

768
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,280
(to join their lobby back?)

769
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,040
(They invited me by mistake.)

770
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,000
(School's About to Start So Panicky
invites you to a game of 5v5 Valley of Kings.)

771
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,080
School's About to Start So Panicky.

772
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,479
He's a nice guy.

773
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,360
(Marksman is good in this patch.)

774
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,600
(I will play Marksman this round.)

775
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,620
(Welcome come to Honor of Kings)

776
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,780
(Prepare to engage)

777
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,060
(First Blood)

778
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,959
(Cai Wenji?)

779
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,399
(Sorry, I'm still new.)

780
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,159
(I'm a noob.)

781
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,800
(Use voice chat. Let me guide you.)

782
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,239
Voice chat?

783
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,180
(Whole Team)

784
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,000
(I finally knew why)

785
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,399
(Yu Tu, Marksman main,)

786
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,239
(was willing)

787
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,600
(to give up the position of Marksman.)

788
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,320
(This Cai Wenji is a troll!)

789
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,320
(You're overthinking.)

790
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
(I just want to show you)

791
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,919
(how to play Zhuge Liang properly.)

792
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,980
(You've been slain.)

793
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,280
(Oh no.)

794
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,399
(They won't invite me)

795
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,840
(for the next round.)

796
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,300
(Double Kill)

797
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,239
Eat this.

798
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,639
You've walked into my trap.

799
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,980
(Tripple Kill)

800
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,820
(Quadra Kill)

801
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,360
(Unbelievable.)

802
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,360
(Yu Tu, you kill stealer!)

803
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,159
(Your Zhuge Liang is not bad, Yu Tu.)

804
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,439
(I have never seen you pick him.)

805
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,560
(Zhai Liang always picked Mage)

806
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,000
(so he couldn't pick it.)

807
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
