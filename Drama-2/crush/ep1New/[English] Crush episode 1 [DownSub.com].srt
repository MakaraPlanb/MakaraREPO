00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,800
Welcome to a new day
in Golden Hits Studio.

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,800
Today is Thursday.

7
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,480
[Today is a little cloudy.]

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,680
[You’re like the most delicate flower,]

9
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,030
[floating outside the blue window.]

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,320
[It’s like you might fall
into my heart anytime.]

11
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,829
You switched the channel?

12
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,079
No. Why?

13
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,440
Nothing.

14
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,910
The first song for today

15
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,160
is a classic song that
matches the sky today.

16
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,280
It's best to wind down your car window,

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,910
feel the wind in your face
as you listen to this song.

18
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,470
Fall by Xu Guan Chun,

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,670
composed and written by Yi Jin,

20
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,110
a very mysterious songwriter and lyricist.

21
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,110
This doesn't sound like Miss Xi.

22
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,740
♫ If wishes and future hadn't
come into contact ♫

23
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
♫ Perhaps ♫

24
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Although Xu Guan Chun
has released a new song,

25
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,960
everyone still prefers
the song you wrote.

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,000
Switch it off. It's too noisy.

27
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,240
When Lin Yang's Dream Under
The Night Sky is available online,

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
I wonder if Xu Guan Chun's new song

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,110
will still be in the charts.

30
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,310
Lin Yang was surprised that

31
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,190
you're willing to write a song
for a rookie like him.

32
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,830
Netizens are curious of who Yi Jin is.

33
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,030
It's a super topic now.

34
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,270
Miss Xi has always wanted to
invite you for an interview.

35
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,800
Do you want to consider it?

36
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,960
No.

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,110
I understand.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,630
You don't want Yi Jin's identity exposed.

39
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,320
But Miss Xi knows us well.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,030
We'll maintain confidentiality

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,440
and make sure nobody knows.

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,110
Many listeners are now asking why

43
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,470
we change the channel host.

44
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,160
What should we do?

45
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,950
Can we just straightaway tell listeners

46
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,160
I'm the substitute host?

47
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,079
Fang Fang.

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,880
Keep calling her.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,440
Alright.

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,030
Wu Yan.
Can you keep to the script?

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,190
Just start the second segment later.

52
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,030
Listen to my instruction.

53
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,670
Alright.

54
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,440
Sorry, I'm late.

55
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,390
Miss Xi.
Why can't your phone be reached?

56
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,160
I dropped my phone because I was in hurry.

57
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,240
Wu Yan.

58
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,640
The song will end soon.

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,750
Think of something to wind it up smoothly.

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,000
Alright.

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Welcome back to Golden Hits Studio,

62
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,360
brought to you live on 27.1 FM.

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,160
Many listeners asked why

64
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,269
the host sounded different today.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,149
Actually, this is a little game

66
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,560
our programme team has planned

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,390
for our listeners during the opening

68
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
to test the auditory skills
of our listeners.

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
Alright then. Next up is...

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,000
Hello, everyone.
I'm Nie Xi.

71
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,270
The ability to differentiate a voice

72
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,670
will allow one to enjoy music better.

73
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,710
It seems that our listeners

74
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,440
have very sharp ears.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,040
There's always someone in your heart.

76
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,320
There's always something in your mind

77
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,440
that you can't shake it off.

78
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,720
Hello? It's been a while
since I hear from you.

79
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,640
I have time today.

80
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,510
See you later.

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,350
I knew it.

82
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,790
The manager of Xu Guan Chun called.

83
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
They heard your Dream Under The Night Sky.

84
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
Now they want to meet up.

85
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,390
I think they'll ask us

86
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,230
why we didn't give them the song.

87
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,950
What should we say?

88
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,550
The truth.

89
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,550
His voice doesn't suit the song.

90
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm afraid they won't accept it so easily.

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
I'll send you home first.

92
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,550
Drop me at the nearby park.

93
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,070
I want to sit there for a while.

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,200
Pick me up after you're done.

95
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,310
[27.1 FM]

96
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,920
Miss Xi.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
Are you okay?

98
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm fine.

99
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,159
Everyone in the team just needs to
write a reflective report.

100
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,950
How did it feel to be at the anchor desk
for the first time?

101
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,880
It's hard to tell

102
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,510
because I was too anxious just now.

103
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,480
Let me ask you then.

104
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,670
If I couldn't make it today,

105
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,600
what will you do?

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,070
Do you plan to keep reading the script

107
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,960
and make today a non-interactive show

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,670
without taking calls from listeners?

109
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,830
I...

110
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,510
You're very brave today

111
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,040
but don't be carried away.

112
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
This is not campus broadcast.

113
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,240
You're still not prepared for

114
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,720
the position of a radio host.

115
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,480
You should know it yourself.

116
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,680
I understand.

117
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,830
I'll continue to work hard, Miss Xi.

118
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,200
Alright then. You can clock off now.

119
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,640
Quickly go back for class.

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll get going then, Miss Xi.

121
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,670
Someone is here for you.

122
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,720
No, I have no idea. I don't know him.

123
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,160
I'll leave now, Miss Xi.
Goodbye.

124

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,270
I don't want to.

126

♫ Continuing its trajectory ♫

186
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,000
What a good song.

187
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I have to check it out.

188
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,390
You really have an occupational disease.

189
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,640
Why don't you just text Xu Qian directly?

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,110
I won't.

191
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,060
I've drawn the line with them.

192
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,500
[Dream Under The Night Sky, Yi Jin]

193
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,000
It's Yi Jin.

194
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,840
I knew it.

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,760
He didn't post it

196
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,680
in his page again

197
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,880
to give fans a preview.

198
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,760
[Billboard Chart]

199
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,790
It's in second place in the charts now.

200
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,910
It's going to make this Lin Yang famous.

201
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,230
Your Yi Jin again.

202
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,030
What kind of person is Yi Jin?

203
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,840
With a song, he made Xu Guan Chun
famous overnight.

204
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,710
But no one knows

205
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,080
who he is.

206
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,670
This time, he worked with a newcomer.

207
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,400
That's just too mysterious.

208
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,790
Do you think he's a writer?

209
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,790
Or a language teacher?

210
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,470
Or, he's a pervert.

211
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,150
You're the pervert.

212
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,670
Don't insult my idol.

213
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,630
I'm praising him.

214
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,710
He's a low-profile to a perverted degree.

215
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,790
Have you come across anyone
who says that to praise others?

216
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,390
Do you want a beating? Do you?

217
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,120
Alright. Stop hitting me.

218
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,550
Stop running.

219
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,440
Come here.

220
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,030
Milk is on the first level.

221
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,470
Fruits on the second level.

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,110
Drinking water is by the side.

223
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,000
Thank you.

224
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,280
If you really want to thank me,

225
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,070
then write another song for Xu Guan Chun

226
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,110
as a compensation.

227
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,510
You gave your Dream Under The Night Sky

228
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,680
to newcomer Lin Yang.

229
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,280
Xu Guan Chun's side is not happy about it.

230
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,520
Whether he's happy or not,
it has nothing to do with me.

231
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,440
Dream Under The Night Sky

232
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,760
is now catching up on
Xu Guan Chun's new song.

233
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,230
They're having a tough time on publicity.

234
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,000
They think we're attacking them.

235
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,800
I tried to explain to them

236
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,280
that his voice doesn't suit the song.

237
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,030
But they just can't understand.

238
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,640
They think we're giving an excuse.

239
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,760
This is a problem that
the company needs to resolve.

240
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,950
Nian Qin.

241
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,350
Aren't you being unreasonable?

242
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,590
You're lucky I know your temper.

243
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,550
Anyone else is going to be mad at you.

244
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,350
I still have work. I'm leaving now.

245
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,950
Wu Yan.
Let's have dinner together tonight.

246
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,960
I'll invite Wei Hao.

247
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,000
I have something to attend to.
You two go ahead.

248
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,000
Wu Yan. I want to talk to you.

249
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,400
You don't have to.

250
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,400
I treated you as my closest friend.

251
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,670
Way better than I treated Wei Hao.

252
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,390
But since you never wanted to talk to me

253
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,910
before you two want to be together,

254
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,070
there's nothing to talk about
now or in the future.

255
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,150
Wu Yan. We're not...

256
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,520
So, did Wei Hao ever like you?

257
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,350
Why do you ask me that too?

258
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,150
I'll change the question.

259
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,350
Did he ever say he likes you?

260
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,590
We grew up together.

261
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,200
We've been together for ages.

262
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,120
We're like an old couple.

263
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,470
Have you ever seen an old couple

264
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,880
say they love each other everyday?

265
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
So, Wei Hao has never actually

266
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,550
uttered explicitly that he likes you.

267
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,840
It's not compulsory to utter it.

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,280
Look.

269
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,200
In the past, he'd always buy me breakfast

270
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,790
or go shopping with me.

271
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,710
When the hostel gate is shut,

272
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,230
he'd come pick me up on his bike.

273
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,630
Aren't these expressions of
liking someone?

274
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,840
Then, have you ever said you like him?

275
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,590
You may think that confession

276
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,320
is a meaningless ritual.

277
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,760
But a clear relationship is based on that.

278
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,150
If both of you don't say it,

279
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,390
you'll be guessing it

280
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,280
until it dies out.

281
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,910
I...

282
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,120
If you need words to convince

283
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,760
even after being with each other

284
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,230
for so long,

285
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,080
isn't it a waste of
all those times together?

286
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,000
Now it's really all a waste.

287
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,000
In that case, I can let go everything

288
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,280
and marry Yi Jin.

289
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm so happy.

290
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,910
Just cry if you want to.

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Why should I cry

292
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,280
if my new life has just begun?

293
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,589
Group message from the radio station.

294
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,200
I'm now walking towards

295
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,589
the path of realising my dream.

296
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,680
I have to focus. No time for romance now.

297
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,349
A pretty girl claims she's the
composer and lyricist Yi Jin.

298
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,640
She revealed her relationship
with music star Xu Guan Chun.

299
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,080
Oh heavens.

300
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,590
This...

301
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,520
Yi Jin is a girl?

302
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,830
Why did the fake news suddenly surface?

303
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm sorry you had to
work overtime on this.

304
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,310
Thank you.

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
The record company will release
an official notice later tonight

306
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,640
to clarify that she faked the identity.

307
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,710
But Xu Guan Chun is
too popular these days.

308
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,710
I'm afraid we can't stop this fake news
from snowballing.

309
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,920
Everyone will only be interested
in the gossips.

310
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,070
The fake Yi Jin will make a mark.

311
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm really curious.

312
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,920
A girl is claiming that she is Yi Jin.

313
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,430
Aren't you anxious at all?

314
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
Close your eyes.

315
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,000
This is my world.

316
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,470
It doesn't have a hint of chaos.

317
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,920
I only write songs I want to write.

318
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,190
It's not important

319
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,110
who Yi Jin is.

320
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,800
Is it really not important?

321
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,590
At that time,

322
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,510
did you also close your eyes like this

323
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,230
and tell yourself that it's not important?

324
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,880
It's too late.

325
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,680
[Why did I call myself Yi Jin?]

326
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,760
[Yixiyijin, a night and a day.
It represents my ambiguous]

327
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,760
[but heartwarming love stories.]

328
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,150
[Yiguyijin, the old and the new]

329
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,430
[It represents the impact and
interaction of thinkings]

330
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,960
[between my upbringing
in Chinese tradtional studies]

331
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,430
[and my higher education abroad.]

332
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,950
[This two ideas are merged
by the word Yi Jin.]

333
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,590
That's gross.

334
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,760
It's definitely fake.

335
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Why are you so worked up?

336
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,000
How did you reflective report go?

337
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,280
You told me before

338
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,880
that you want to invite Yi Jin
for an interview

339
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,190
but it never happen.

340
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,560
Why did she suddenly want to come?

341
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,110
She is fake.

342
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,840
Fake? How can it be?

343
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,200
She's really a fake. I can warrant that.

344
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,230
The real Yi Jin...

345
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,600
I'll get the real Yi Jin

346
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,710
to come to our show.

347
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,040
Alright. I'll wait for it.

348
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,640
If you can't do it,

349
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,600
I'll have to take it that

350
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,190
you're just giving excuses.

351
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,110
[The reason I didn't go public
with my real identity]

352
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,520
[is not about staying low-key.]

353
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,710
[It's because I love my life.]

354
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,480
[Life as a public figure]

355
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,000
[is too much a burden.]

356
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,880
[But,]

357
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,510
[I did write my first song, Fall]

358
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,160
[as a token of our love]

359
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,280
[It's from the male perspective.]

360
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,680
[Nie Xi]

361
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,830
[He told me his feeling]

362
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,600
[when he first saw me.]

363
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,350
[That first time we met on the beach.]

364
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,400
[I was touched]

365
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,230
[so I wrote this song for him.]

366
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,830
[But he's now denying everything.]

367
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,070
[He even denied that I'm Yi Jin.]

368
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,160
Miss Xi said her director has ordered

369
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,340
to invite the fake Yi Jin
for an interview.

370
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,750
She's in an awkward situation now.

371
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,710
I know you don't care.

372
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,710
But Nian Qin,

373
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,590
can you at least visit the station once?

374
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,030
At least let them know Yi Jin is a fake

375
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,320
and cannot be interviewed.

376
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,490
Nie Xi is my best friend.

377
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,040
Can you do this for me?

378
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,870
[Tomorrow's music guest
is a mysterious big shot]

379
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,710
What are you so focused on?

380
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,640
I'm checking if there's any celebrity
coming to our station.

381
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,600
Usually when a celebrity is coming,

382
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,760
they're announce it in Weibo.

383
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,680
But it's so weird this time.

384
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,230
I asked Miss Fang Fang and others

385
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,760
about the guest in this coming show

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,350
but they have no idea too.

387
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,640
We don't have a class tomorrow.

388
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,920
You can go have a look.

389
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,560
How's your Yi Jin doing?

390
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,760
I don't know who to trust.

391
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,560
If the record company says she's a fake,

392
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,110
then where is the real Yi Jin?

393
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,400
That's why

394
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,350
I believe the girl.

395
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,350
Who would want to
create rumours like that?

396
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,430
Notice.

397
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,110
Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock,

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,560
please gather at the lecture hall
of the main building.

Counselors will announce arrangements
on internship matters.

400
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,110
It's about internship again.

401
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,760
Please sign the attendance for me then.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,040
You've really put your whole heart
into that radio station career.

403
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,680
I love you.

[Yu Xiao Lu is calling.]

406
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,750
I'll go up on my own.

407
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,680

I got it.

411

[It's him.]

412
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,920
[He's blind?]

413
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,520
[His eyes are pretty.]

414
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,920
Do you need help?

415
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,640
No, thanks.

Come back quick,

421
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,320
Mr Zhao said if you don’t
come back before the session ends,

422
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,220
you’ll flunk the subject, hurry up.

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,560
[I really don't want to go.]

425
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,870
Hello? Miss Fang Fang.

426
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,350
I need to go back to campus.

427
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,190
[Tenth floor.]

428
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,350

430
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,190
I'll follow Xiao Lu.

431
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,190
Alright. This way please.

432
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,840
Work interview, postgraduate interview

433
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,710
and civil servant interview

434
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,950
are the three major categories.

435
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,110
Some students

436
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,560
have contacted the organisation
for internship.

437
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,110
As for the rest,

438
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,680
the university has arranged

439
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,190
two organisations for internship.

440
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,430
One group will be going to the
high security prison.

441
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,800
The other

442
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,640
will go to a special education school.

443
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,390
I heard you're going to
the high security prison.

444
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,800
...to proactively apply to go
to a high security prison.

445
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,830
-What is high security?
-Cheng Yin.

446
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,760
The inmates are all felons who
are convicted for over 50 years.

447
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,310
You mean murderers?

448
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,280
Not just that.

449
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,110
Drug dealers, smugglers or kidnappers too.

450
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,800
Do you want to join me?

451
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,200
No, thanks.

452
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,190
You pampered girl. I'll let you in
on the horror stories later.

453
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,400
Sang Wu Yan.

454
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,520
Where do you plan to go?

455
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
Special education school.

456
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,160
For the rest of you, give your names
to the class monitor.

457
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,110
Sang Wu Yan. Come with me.

458
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,230
I...

459
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,710
Alright.

460
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,150
[Good morning, everyone.]

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,390
[This is Golden Hits Studio]

462
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,230
[on 27.1 FM.]

463
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,030
[Yesterday,]

464
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,110
we have given a preview that

465
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,760
a mysterious guest will
come on the show today.

466
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,990
In our studio now is

467
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,950
famous songwriter and lyricist Yi Jin.

468
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,520
Hello, everyone. I'm Yi Jin.

469
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,630
Yi Jin. I have a question for you.

470
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,080
Two days ago, someone claimed
to be you on the internet.

471
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,800
There was a huge uproar about this.

472
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,710
Why didn't you come forward to clarify it?

473
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,830
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

474
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,560
I don't care

475
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,950
how they think.

476
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,750
Why did you decide to

477
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,760
embark on songwriting?

478
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,590
Did you dream to be a songwriter
when you're young?

479
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,560
I just like music.

480
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,470
I never thought about it at that time.

481
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,160
Facing such a large number of music fans,

482
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,230
why did you intentionally choose to

483
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,070
avoid the public?

484
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,000
To keep my life private.

485
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,470
Is this the only reason?

486
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,110
This is the only reason.

487
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,590
In that case,

488
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,950
I'm really curious about

489
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,880
why you choose to

490
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,560
accept this interview invitation?

491
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,830
I feel I have wronged my song.

492
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,590
For the song to be heard in the way,

493
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,190
it's a failure on my part.

494
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,470
What were you thinking?

495
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,640
Are you planning to go for
postgraduate studies?

496
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,110
No, I don't want to.

497
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,710
I also don't plan to
become a psychotherapist.

498
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,080
I prefer working in a radio station.

499
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,400
I'm very sure of this.

500
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,320
But if you go for postgraduate studies,

501
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,110
you don't have to make it your career.

502
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,590
You can choose the academic path
like your father.

503
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,110
[Can you make this quick?]

504
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,990
[Hopefully I still get to hear
a little part of it.]

505
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,190
Even if you go for postgraduate studies,

506
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,080
you can still

507
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,830
work part-time at the radio station.

508
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,630
Mr and Mrs Sang

509
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,830
really hope you can go back
to pursue your postgraduate studies.

510
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,350
I know you have your ideals.

511
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,710
I totally understand

512
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,920
and support you.

513
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,960
But you should at least

514
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,560
think of your parent's hopes.

515
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,680
Mr Zhao. I have decided

516
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,950
to become a professional radio host

517
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,070
and I plan to achieve success in this.

518
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,880
I've made up my mind.

519
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,470
Wu Yan. Are you really going to
bet on your future?

520
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,520
I want to bet on a path that is mine.

521
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,440
If you don't have any other matters,

522
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,110
I'll go back now.

523
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,640
I'm not done.

524
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,760
The internship is very important.

525
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,680
It'll directly affect your graduation.

526
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,230
I'll work hard on the internship.
Goodbye, Mr Zhao.

527
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,350
Oh right, Mr Zhao.

528
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,590
About my plan,

529
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
I'd like to personally tell my father.

530
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,230
Can you...

531
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,160
Don't worry.

532
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,190
Thank you, Mr Zhao.
Goodbye, Mr Zhao.

533
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,150
[For the last question,]

534
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,400
[it's my personal question as a host.]

535
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,070
Do you have any preference

536
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,400
when you listen to the radio?

537
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,110
I don't like it

538
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,560
when someone request a song I don't like.

539
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,720
[We'd like to thank Mr Yi Jin]

540
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,040
[for coming on the show today.]

541
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,830
[Thank you.]

542
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,400
[You're welcome.]

543
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,400
It's...

544
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,680
It's Yi Jin?

545
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,070
What did Mr Zhao say?

546
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,470
It was Yi Jin.

547
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,350
What are you talking about?

548
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,160
Did you know who is the guest

549
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,430
of our radio show today?

550
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,310
It was Yi Jin.

551
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,320
If I was in the station,

552
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,950
I could meet Yi Jin.

553
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,430
I missed my chance to meet Yi Jin.

554
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,680
This is a curse of your destiny.

555
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,590
My condolence to you.

556
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,800
My condolence...

557
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,710
You don't have to apologize.

558
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,560
We all have our own difficulty

559
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,430
in this line.

560
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,350
Scandals are like swamps.

561
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,830
It's not easy to get your name cleared.

562
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,110
I will let him know.

563
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,070
Don't worry.

564
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,710
He gave us a call on this.

565
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,470
He sounded genuine.

566
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,630
Next time...

567
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,000
We'll talk about it when it comes.

568
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,520
Alright. I'll send you to the school.

569
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,780
[Xiamen Special Education School]

570
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,800
Children, we know that

571
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,270
Chinese Braille is made up of
vowel and consonant sounds.

572
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,710
The two combines to
become a Chinese character.

573
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,710
Two to three Chinese characters
make a phrase.

574
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,110
Phrases are arranged into
a complete sentence.

575
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,190
Moreover, in between some phrases,

576
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,470
we need to do word segment continuation.

577
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Today, we're going to practise

578
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,920
word segment continuation for numerals.

579
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,920
Mr Su.

580
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,680
Xiao Wei.

581
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,000
Twelve is a numeral.

582
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,400
Remember to do a continuation.

583
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,590
I got it.

584
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,640
Good girl.

585
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,830
Alright. Class dismissed.

586
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,830
On your feet.

587
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,880
Goodbye, Mr Su.

588
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,310
Goodbye.

589
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,680
Mr Su.

590
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,280
Do I know you?

591
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,070
I think you don't.

592
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,120
Do you need help?

593
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,870
Do... do you need help?

594
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,040
We've met

595
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,120
at the radio station.

596
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,360
Yes, in the elevator.

597
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,360
I'm the new teacher intern.

598
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,710
I'm Sang Wu Yan.

599
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,520
How about you, Mr Su?

600
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,710
Su Nian Qin.

601
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,710
Nian Qing?

602
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,239
Nian Qing?

603
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,000
Nian Qin.

604
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,320
Q, I, N.

605
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,110
Su Nian Qin.

606
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,679
Mr Su,

607
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,040
do you know where is
the school director's office?

608
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,280
I'll take you there.

609
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,120
Okay.

610
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,860
-Slow down.
-Wait for me.

611
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,920
Slow down, slow down.

612
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,070
Slow down.
