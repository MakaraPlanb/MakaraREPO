00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,380
that is the cost of silence.

371
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,770
Staying hopeful is the
most important capital.

372
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,410
Why not you guys perform on my program?

373
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,900
Your program?

374
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,560
In fact, it is not yet officially mine.

375
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,750
but it will be soon.

376
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,590
If you're willing to come over.

377
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,390
Our boss

378
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,640
is planning a new segment

379
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,340
specializing in promoting indie musicians.

380
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,360
Her requirement is

381
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,810
guests who appear on the program
have to be young and fresh.

382
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,010
So, she is basically looking for novices

383
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,620
with sufficient experience.

384
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,020
Isn't that your band?

385
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,430
It seems possible.

386
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,800
What? It certainly is!

387
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,890
Pack up quick.

388
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,380
After that, we'll discuss about it.

389
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,420
Okay.

390
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,410
What a tiring day.

391
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,190
If you are tired, just stop reading.

392
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,930
It’s not good for your eyes.

393
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,220
I'm not reading a book.

394
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,340
It's a comic.

395
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,690
It's relaxing.

396
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,070
What comics?

397
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,410
A suspense.

398
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,860
I'll tell you the story, okay?

399
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,630
In a village

400
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,110
built in a hexagram pattern,

401
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,340
there are mummies hidden inside

402
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,900
each and every cellars.

403
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,770
All mummies

404
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,620
are bizarrely deformed.

405
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,340
Are there cellars

406
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,650
in this house?

407
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,380
I don’t know.

408
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,220
What do you know then?

409
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,050
I only know

410
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,450
there's only two of us in the house,

411
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,650
and there seems to be
noise coming from next door.

412
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,250
Do you know

413
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,170
there's a shadowy figure flashing
outside the window?

414
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,900
Is it doing it on
purpose so you'll notice it?

415
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,450
Did you turn off the light?

416
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,440
I didn't move at all.

417
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,020
Furthermore,

418
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,510
lights are without remote control.

419
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,740
What?

420
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,130
I...

421
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,370
I think my eardrums will ring.

422
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,260
Why not you shout after I go out?

423
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,310
What? No, no ,no.

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,010
Don't go.

425
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,860
You can't leave me here alone.

426
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,380
It's a power outage.

427
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
How do you know?

428
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,810
There's no sound from the fridge.

429
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,870
The air conditioner is not working.

430
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,340
Every normal person can tell.

431
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,990
Are you suggesting I'm abnormal?

432
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,850
You're just timid.

433
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,250
I'm just trying to switch the topic,

434
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,560
to divert your attention.

435
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,790
In psychology, this is known as

436
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,220
transference.

437
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,980
You're really not qualified to be

438
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,620
a professional psychologist.

439
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,880
We won't mention the method

440
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,330
before the treatment, okay?

441
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,380
What time is it now?

442
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,900
9:11 p.m.

443
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,740
You treasure this watch a lot.

444
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,370
What about my gift?

445
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,250
How was it?

446
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,140
Not bad.

447
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,260
You have great patience.

448
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,770
Finally you noticed my strength.

449
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,740
You still have many strengths.

450
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,810
For example?

451
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,140
For instance,

452
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,990
this is an exceptional spot for kissing.

453
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,650
What are you doing?

454
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,140
♫ Nothing much to say ♫

455
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,120
♫ I've been waiting for something ♫

456
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,770
♫ It's written in the stars ♫

457
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,500
♫ There's a voice in my ears ♫

458
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,480
♫ That has been keeping me company ♫

459
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,280
♫ Because of that,
I'm no longer afraid of sunset ♫

460
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,200
♫ The sun shower deliberately falls ♫

461
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,500
Wu Yan.

462
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,290
Let’s get married.

463
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,670
♫ On my shoulders ♫

464
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,480
♫ I suddenly recall something ♫

465
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,290
♫ I think I heard it somewhere before ♫

466
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,020
You don’t need to make up your mind now.

467
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,070
♫ Subconsciously ♫

468
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,260
Take your time and think about it.

469
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,270
♫ I recognise you ♫

470
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,550
♫ By your astonishing voice ♫

471
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,170
♫ In the next second ♫

472
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,970
♫ You look up and smile at me ♫

473
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,330
♫ You say the lyric is a tongue twister ♫

474
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,980
♫ I quench the galaxy ♫

475
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,810
Hey.

476
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,690
Tell Nian Qin about it.

477
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,470
No matter what,

478
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,650
this concerns him.

479
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,350
At least,

480
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,100
tell him courteously.

481
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,530
Okay.

482
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:01,810
Nian Qin.

483
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,440
Xiao Lu, you are here.

484
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,200
I'm just here to deliver a message.

485
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,040
Liver transplant is a must for your dad.

486
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,920
But he still can't find
a matching donor so far.

487
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,650
You have to be ready.

488
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,700
He has signed the consent
form for corneal donation.

489
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,770
You should understand by now
that it's for you.

490
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,090
It's okay if you don't want to go back,

491
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,490
but please don't reject it.

492
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,500
What are you saying?

493
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,930
What has he done?

494
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,650
You told him about my medical check-up?

495
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,590
I didn't say anything.

496
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,030
This is his own decision.

497
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,620
You decide for yourself. I'm off.

498
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,770
Actually there are many bands

499
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,170
who are active in the underground scene.

500
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,370
These people

501
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,930
are not from the professional background.

502
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,360
They have experience in other fields.

503
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm thinking that these people

504
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,080
would have more appealing stories
behind their music.

505
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,250
Their music not only has

506
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,220
a very unique, personal style,

507
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,800
what's more important is that

508
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,280
they have something
to tell behind their music.

509
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,290
Please have a look.

510
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,170
Actually, my point is

511
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,980
their concept of music
is very interesting.

512
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,650
The show I want to do

513
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,000
is to invite this band

514
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,860
I'm familiar with.

515
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,760
I believe if I further explore,

516
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,960
there will be great stories from it.

517
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,100
Okay.

518
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,840
In fact, I've came across this band
at Xiao Lu's place.

519
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,260
It's quite interesting.

520
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,410
Give it a try.

521
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,930
Submit the program proposal
as soon as possible.

522
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,290
Sure!

523
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,340
Thank you, Xi.

524
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,660
Nian Qin,

525
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,310
why didn't you turn on the lights?

526
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,100
Wu Yan.

527
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:11,770
My...

528
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,410
My dad is sick.

529
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,770
You know it, right?

530
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,860
What's wrong?

531
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,900
His seems to be in a critical condition.

532
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,620
Xiao Lu informed me earlier today

533
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,810
he has signed the consent
form for corneal donation.

534
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,930
I really don't why he would sign it.

535
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,920
So,

536
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,050
your eyes are not incurable?

537
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,110
Although I've missed
the best timing for treatment,

538
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,250
but there is a hope to be healed.

539
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,290
Missed it?

540
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,650
Why did you...

541
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,490
Why didn't he bring me for
treatment in the first place,

542
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,810
but disowned me instead?

543
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,430
When I was born,

544
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,310
my family was very poor.

545
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,160
They couldn't afford my treatment.

546
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,480
But after my dad disowned me,

547
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,520
he gradually became richer.

548
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,540
Then why didn't you

549
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,830
get your treatment
after you returned home?

550
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,080
Because I have the grudge.

551
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,610
I still hold onto the deep grudge.

552
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,700
I must use my disability as an excuse,

553
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,110
to remind him on what he has done.

554
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,370
He decided to help me get better later

555
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,200
for the sake of his dignity and prestige.

556
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,560
Or perhaps it was atonement for my mother.

557
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,120
How can I fulfil his wishes?

558
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,630
But what I don't get now

559
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,940
is his intention.

560
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,800
Even if he does this,

561
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,460
I won't let it go.

562
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,390
It has been so many years.

563
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,550
There's no way I can let it go.

564
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,960
It’s okay.

565
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,950
If you can’t let it go, just let it be.

566
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,080
You don't have to let everything go.

567
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,920
Just forgive.

568
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,250
Why hold a grudge against yourself?

569
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,070
Your mum won't blame you for this.

570
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,770
Surely, she would hope that
you could see the beauty of this world.

571
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,420
So there is nothing to be afraid of.

572
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,380
If you want to go back,

573
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,500
I'll go with you and visit him.

574
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,970
There's someone I wish to marry.

575
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,640
She wants to meet you.

576
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,760
I'll bring her home tomorrow.

577
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,130
Okay.

578
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,510
That's all for now.

579
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,900
Nian Qin said

580
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,430
he is bringing his
girlfriend home tomorrow.

581
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,360
Get prepared.

582
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,900
Nothing much.

583
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,180
I promised to

584
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,980
accompany him home tomorrow.

585
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,720
To meet parents means to speed things up.

586
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,140
That's fast.

587
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,470
Wu Yan.

588
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,210
What a coincidence, Uncle Yu.

589
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,420
I am here to meet someone.

590
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,760
Wu Yan.

591
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,020
How's your dad? Is he getting better?

592
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,440
My dad? What happened to him?

593
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,130
I heard he had a cerebral haemorrhage
and was admitted to the hospital.

594
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,180
Didn't you know?

595
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,010
What?

596
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,739
Why is she not picking up the call?

597
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,500
Fang Fang,

598
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,850
can you apply a day off for me?

599
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,580
I have to rush off.

600
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,090
Where are you going?

601
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,330
I have to go back to my hometown.

602
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,940
But I thought you're going...

603
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,460
My dad is more important.

604
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,570
Thank you. I need to go now.

605
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,449
Okay.

606
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,050
Did you forget your keys again?

607
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,630
Nian Qin.

608
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:47,940
It's me.

609
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,110
Long time no see.

610
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,250
Xiao Lu is not here.

611
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm not looking for her.

612
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,460
Are you not inviting me to go in?

613
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,470
Hello.

614
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,830
[Wu Yan.]

615
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,070
[We got the photo.]

616
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,660
[Well done.]

617
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,790
Where's my dad?

618
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
[He is on a business trip.]

619
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,070
[He has not returned yet.]

620
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,180
Can you stop fooling me?

621
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,140
How is Dad now?

622
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,740
Wu Yan.

623
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,800
How did you find out?

624
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,720
Why didn't you tell me?

625
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,960
You're busy too.

626
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,950
Dad wants it that way.

627
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,450
[He did not want this matter]

628
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,940
[to mess up your graduation.]

629
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,960
Anyway,

630
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,350
he survived the most critical period.

631
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,910
I wasn't able to inform you

632
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,450
at the time.

633
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,750
Mum.

634
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,230
Are you punishing me

635
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,030
because I'm being capricious?

636
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,790
You let me be and
don’t even care to keep me in the loop?

637
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,440
We don't want to be your burden.

638
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,320
[You've grown up.]

639
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,400
You'll lead your own life sooner or later.

640
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,650
Mum.

641
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,040
That's all for now.

642
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,550
I will go home right away. I'm hanging up.

643
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,870
I heard you are bringing your
girlfriend home tomorrow.

644
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,030
When your dad heard,

645
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,870
he managed to sit and eat on his own.

646
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,900
You've no idea how happy he is.

647
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,270
You are still so stubborn.

648
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,060
No.

649
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,830
I'm not stubborn about certain things.

650
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,110
Nian Qin.

651
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,680
If Mrs Su is still around,

652
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,220
she will definitely be pleased.

653
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,550
You are now Mrs Su.

654
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,050
I'm also happy for you.

655
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,230
Really, I am.

656
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,920
Of course you are happy.

657
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,600
Because you have nothing to worry about.

658
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,180
You don't have to deal with
a complicated family.

659
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,300
I know you've been trying very hard,

660
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,980
pretending to be part of the family.

661
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,590
But you can stop being
a hypocrite in front of me.

662
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,150
Out of my respect for her,
I'll bring her along.

663
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,580
After such a long time,

664
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,190
you finally expressed your thoughts.

665
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,350
It seems that you really love that girl.

666
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,030
That's none of your business.

667
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,670
What I want to say is,

668
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,550
you should go for your eye surgery.

669
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,390
At least you must consider this
for the sake of her happiness.

670
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,390
Isn't it so?

671
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,310
Have a harmonious dinner tomorrow.

672
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,420
Don’t become a laughing stock to others.

673
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,790
I've got to go.

674
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,470
Let's go.

675
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,800
That's enough, Yu Wei Lan!

676
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,990
It's me.

677
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,700
I just met someone at the door.

678
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,870
Who is she?

679
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,460
She is no one.

680
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,350
What are you doing?

681
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,240
Nian Qin.

682
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,240
Please apologize to
your family on my behalf.

683
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,160
I can't make it tomorrow.

684
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,230
Where are you going?

685
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,860
I'm going home.

686
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,660
My dad...

687
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,590
I know.

688
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,870
I'm just a blind man who
will become your burden.

689
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,830
They look down on me.

690
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,660
They think I'm good for nothing
and will hurt you eventually.

691
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,660
That's why you were told to go back.

692
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,460
Su Nian Qin, stop being unreasonable.

693
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,470
Unless you stay.

694
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,840
I must go back.

695
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,270
You've have to stay.

696
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,590
I can't fulfil your request.
