[Episode 7]

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,560
As for Xiao Wei,

5
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,509
based on my judgment,

6
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,670
she has the tendency of

7
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,440
avoidant personality disorder.

8
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
In that case,

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,950
when she loses her parents

10
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,560
or people around her

11
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,079
who are close to her,

12
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,079
she won't react aggressively.

13
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,390
However,

14
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,079
children who seem to be
obedient and sensible

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,310
usually don't express

16
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,230
their true feelings.

17
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,670
Therefore,

18
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,840
when they go to a new environment,

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,480
building mental resilience is important.

20
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,560
Are you rest assured now?

21
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,079
I didn't know that

22
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,360
you're quite serious in studying.

23
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,030
That's because I have a good brain.

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,310
Actually,

25
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,440
I have been holding back
from saying something.

At the Ferris wheel...

27
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,360
You're still owing me a question,
aren't you?

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
Finally you have something to ask.

29
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,110
Ask away.

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,510
What is that question?

31
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,870
Do you like me?

32
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,680
Yes.

33
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,030
Why do you like me?

34
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,829

I'm such a fool!

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Nian Qin, you...

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Go now.

41
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,910
We've been together
for almost four years now.

42
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,280
You've been witnessing

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,320
my development in psychology.

44
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
Look.

45
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,320
No doubt I lack hands-on experience,

46
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,320
but I have a good memory.

47
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,040
However, I don't remember

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
any theory

49
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,909
that can explain Su Nian Qin

50
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,159
and his unstable emotions.

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,760

It's your turn.

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,880
If you ask me,

54
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,600
you can't blame him.

55
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,950
You failed to answer his question.

56
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,910
"Love at first sight".
It's such a short answer

57
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,910
but you couldn't even say it.

58
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,120
No.

At that moment,

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,790
I knew that
it's not just love at first sight.

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,760
It's also because...

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Why am I not an art student?

I can't leave the job
just because I'm dejected.

I think disliking the job is one thing,

123

disliking working is another thing.

I think

128
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,880
it's impressive

129
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,760
to devote myself to something I hate.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,070
All right.

It's so funny.

One time, I ran into someone in the lift.

The same thing happened.

136
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,120
I think there's a power outage.

Hello.

138
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,670
We're trapped in the lift.

The management is getting it fixed.

143
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,590
They told us to be patient.

144
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,750
Fortunately I'm trapped here with you.

If I were with Cheng Yin now,

146
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,670
I would be freaked out.

147
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,790
She has claustrophobia.

148
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,960
I've never seen her use a lift.

149
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
Goodness.

150
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,350
You have a one-track mind,
just like Wei Hao.

151
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,680
Do I really have to

152
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,920
make everything clear

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,350
so that you can be normal?

154
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,550
I thought things

155
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,080
would go back to normal
after we spent two days together.

156
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,640
Fine, I admit.

157
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,430
Things were brought to a deadlock

158
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,750
due to my fault.

159
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,920
However, as a human being,

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
it's normal to be block-headed.

161
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,480
Wei Hao was my childhood friend.

162
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,040
He's been following me around since young.

163
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,830
He fell in love with you all of a sudden.

164
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,520
I need some time to get used to it.

165
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,920
Worse, both of you

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,550
didn't tell me the truth.

167
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,710
You especially.

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm so mad at you.

169
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,080
I got so much madder at you than him.

170
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,560
I don't mind losing
that useless childhood friend.

171
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,830
However,

172
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,910
you're my best friend.

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,910
How could you do that to me?

174
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,320
Wu Yan, Wei Hao and I...

175
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,800
Enough.

176
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,760
We've resolved the misunderstanding.

177
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,830
He told me

178
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,310
you left the band.

179
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,680
You also had a row with him.

180
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,680
If it's because of me,

181
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,320
it's not necessary at all.

182
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,560
What happened later
was not because of you.

183
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,990
My mum is back.

184
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,200
She came to see me.

185
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,080
She...

186
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,400
I bet she's dumped by her boyfriend again.

187
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,590
Don't worry.

188
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,360
I won't tell anyone

189
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,200
about it.

190
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,270
Anyway,

191
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,550
I have so much to worry about.

192
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,150
I don't have that time for her.

193
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,790
How about Wei Hao?
What do you plan to do?

194
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm going to do nothing.

195
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,030
Just let it be.

196
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,200
We'll listen to the song next time.

197
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,600
Good morning, Mr Qiu. Hello, Mr Wu.

198
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,480
Morning.

199
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,920
Mr Li.

200
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,950
Wu Yan.

201
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,880
Have you done
dealing with your school affair?

202
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,440
I've submitted the draft of my thesis.

203
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,070
Mr Li.

204
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,270
What happened to Mr Su's desk?

205
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,040
Ms Zheng is back.

206
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
It's natural that Mr Su has to leave.

207
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,840
When did that happen?

208
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,830
It happened over the past two days
when you were on leave.

209
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,080
You've missed your chance.

210
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,950
You didn't get to

211
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,150
bid him goodbye before he left.

212
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,560
[Sorry.]

213
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,030
[The number you've
dialled is unavailable.]

214
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,880
[Please try again later.]

215
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,400
Ms Sang.

216
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,880
Is Mr Su not coming?

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,960
Xiao Wei.

218
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,720
Maybe Mr Su is not good at

219
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,030
saying goodbye.

220
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
That's why he decided not to come.

221
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,880
Please understand his feelings, okay?

222
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,910
I'm here for you.

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
I'll pay you a visit

224
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,510
with Mr Su in the future, okay?

225
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,470
Sure.

226
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,230
He promised to pay me a visit too.

227
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,910
Don't forget it.

228
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,680
Sure.

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
Here, let's make a pinky promise.

230
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,750
Let's go.

231
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,600
Please take care of her.

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,480
Thank you.

233
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,470
Thank you, Ms Sang.

234
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,400
Don't mention it.

235
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,070
Xiao Wei.

236
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,320
Nian Qin, what's wrong?

237
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,430
Why didn't you answer the phone call?

238
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,880
My sister said that she called you.

239
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,200
That's why I switched off the phone.

240
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,710
Nian Qin, you should go home.

241
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,640
Sure.

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,470
Do whatever you want.

243
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,680
I've made arrangements

244
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,390
for meals and laundry services.

245
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,390
During this period,

246
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,230
there's no need for you
to leave the house.

247
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,230
I'm leaving. Take care.

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,800
Where are you going?

249
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm going on a break.

250
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,320
Have a good one.

251
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,470
To be honest,

252
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,870
it's very wise for you
to ignore that lady.

253
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,070
Don't ruin the girl

254
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,520
with your odd temperament.

255
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,920
If you ask me,

256
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,990
I would suggest you
seek help from your former boss

257
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,910
to look for him.

258
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,590
Don't you forget that he's Yi Jin.

259
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,040
I've asked him.

260
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,590
I didn't get any feedback.

261
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,250
[Mum]

262
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,390
What's wrong?

263
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,520
What's wrong?

264
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,760
How dare you ask me that question?

265
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,150
It's been so many days
since you last answered my phone call.

266
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,350
You only sent me
a few brief text messages on WeChat.

267
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
You're busy?

268
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
I don't get it.

269
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Why are you so occupied?

270
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,950
Mr Zhao told me that

271
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,560
you haven't even submitted your thesis.

272
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,390
Goodness, Zhao is calling me out again.

273
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,470
You have the cheeks to blame him.

274
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Listen.

275
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,030
You'd better come home right away
when the semester break starts.

276
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,790
We'll get someone

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,320
to guide you
on the postgraduate entrance examination.

278
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,150
If you're unable to register this year,
you'll sit for the examination next year.

279
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,870
I can't let you

280
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,960
fool around.

281
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,599
Did I hear it correctly?

282
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,339
Sit for the examination next year?

283
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Didn't I say that

284
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,950
I want to work?

285
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,910
I've started working at the radio station.

286
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,430
Furthermore,
I plan to continue working there.

287
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,950
Don't tell me about the radio station.

288
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,800
No one listens to radio stations nowadays.

289
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,920
Not even your dad listens to the radio.

290
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,800
Working at a radio station

291
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,950
is not as good as being a professor
in a university.

292
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,070
Not only are the benefits better,

293
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,280
you'll be respected too.

294
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,350
Everyone wants the position so badly.

295
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm the exception.

296
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,150
You're talking about success in life

297
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,120
based on conventional belief.

298
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,400
I don't feel like talking with you.

299
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,190
I'll have to work

300
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,240
during the semester break
before I can go home.

301
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,470
We'll talk about it when I'm home.

302
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,450
[Mum]

303
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,950
Hello?

304
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,270
You don't have to worry about money.

305
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,520
Just take care of her.

306
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,070
Got it.

307
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,230
I'll go home early.

308
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,280
If there's nothing else, I have to go.

309
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,880
Thank you.

310
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,790
I just passed by

311
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,070
and saw you by chance.

312
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,070
Are you here for an interview?

313
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,400
I've missed out on
the peak recruiting season.

314
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,430
It's difficult to secure a good job.

315
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,640
Aren't you working
at the radio station with Wu Yan?

316
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,920
You don't want to work there?

317
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,000
Radio station...

318
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,760
It's not up to me.

319
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,310
I need to have a spare plan.

320
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,120
By the way,

321
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,000
don't tell Wu Yan

322
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,550
that I came for an interview.

323
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,880

379

380
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,910

So,

412
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,310
she naively brandished the four thorns

413
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,400
and said,

414
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,160
"Stop dilly-dallying."

415
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,590
"You're so annoying."

416
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,120
"Since you've decided
to leave this place,"

417
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,640
"you should leave now."

418
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,830
She didn't want
the Little Prince to see her crying.

419
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,520
She is such a proud flower.

420
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,230
Why did she do that?

421
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,230
That's very odd.

422
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,550
Yes.

423
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,760
She can't be weirder.

424
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,930
[The Little Prince]

425
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,310
He refused to answer my calls again.

426
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:47,950
Fine.

427
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm not going to entertain you anymore.

428
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,360
When I become sober,

429
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,950
I will be my old strong self again.

430
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,640
Am I right?

431
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,550
My dear.

432
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,310
Can we go home after a drink?

433
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,160
I need to catch a train tomorrow.

434
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,520
What did you see?

435
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,950
Xu Qian is at the entrance.

436
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,150
Didn't you see her?

437
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,550
Your eyesight is terrible.

438
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,400
What are you doing?

439
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,550
I'm inviting people to come over.

440
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,210
[Me: Wei Hao, come over now!]

441
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,610
[Me: At the bar street]

442
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,590
What drinks would you like?

443
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,150
Give me the strongest drink.

444
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,640
Okay, orange juice it is. How about you?

445
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,640
What do you want?

446
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,480
It's been a while since we drank together.

447
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,760
I'll get you anything that is available.

448
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,280
I started the one-sided love.

449
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,710
I started it alone.

450
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,400
I made up the story alone.

451
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,760
I experienced happiness and sorrow alone.

452
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,920
Now, I'm going to end it alone.

453
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,550
You won't even sing me a song.

454
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,830
It's a long story.

455
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,150
Pretty lady, please do her a favour.

456
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,880
Please sing for her.

457
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,950

I mean it.

479
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,550
It's really okay.

480
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,070
After all,

481
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,800
you always say "No" to everything.

482
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,190
However, I can't find you anywhere.

483
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,640
I can't find you anywhere.

484
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,000
It's as if you've completely vanished

485
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,710
from the world.

486
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,310
Sometimes, I wonder

487
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,920
if that period

488
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,710
is merely my own imagination.

489
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,160
You're a nutcase.

490
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,000
You turned me into a nutcase too.

491
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,310
Just pretend that he's dead.

492
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Finally you're awake.

493
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,670
I need to leave for the train now.

494
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,040
Clean up the place before you leave.

495
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,310
Where is Wu Yan?

496
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,400
She went out early in the morning.

497
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,950
Fan girls are always the craziest.

498
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,840
Did anyone else

499
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,230
come to visit you?

500
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,150
This one time,

501
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,590
Aunt's mum came here.

502
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
She brought lots of snacks.

503
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,160
You're such a foodie.

504
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,520
It seems that everyone loves you.

505
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,830
Ms Sang.

506
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,670
Why didn't you come together

507
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,310
with Mr Su?

508
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,760
He paid me a visit yesterday.

509
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,840
He also bought me

510
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,520
the same kind of candy you gave me.

511
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,640
Hold on.

512
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,070
Did you just say Mr Su paid you a visit?

513
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,070
Did he say anything?

514
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,230
He asked about how I've been.

515
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,950
He also asked about my studies.

516
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,310
He also reminded me
not to tell you that he came to see me.

517
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,590
Then, why did you tell me?

518
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,710
Just pretend that I didn't say anything.

519
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,830
Xiao Wei!

520
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,350
You're becoming more and more like him.

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,360
♫ I want to hug you from the back
and never let go of you ♫

554
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,210
[Broadcast: Literature and Art in Donghu]

555
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,460
♫ Why do beautiful things
always make people sad? ♫

556
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,170
♫ I'm afraid of you leaving ♫

557
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,040
♫ Hai yeah ♫

558
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,440
I've copied these documents
and sent them to you.

559
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,960
Mr Jiang.

560
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,310
Sang, come here.

561
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,679
Xu Qian is leaving.

562
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,350
These tasks will be passed to you.

563
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,360
After you're done,

564
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480
just send a copy to me.

565
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,310
I'm sorry.

566
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,750
I didn't inform you earlier.

567
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,440
It's okay.

568
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,159
It's not the first time anyway.

569
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,880
Wu Yan.

570
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,199
I have to think for my own future.

571
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,350
Future?

572
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,440
Are you saying you won't have
a future in the radio station?

573
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,790
Isn't this your dream?

574
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,790
Open your eyes and look around.

575
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,790
We put in so much effort

576
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,120
to produce a news story.

577
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,790
But we get less listeners

578
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,270
than we would followers
on a public WeChat account.

579
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,600
We're going to graduate soon.

580
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,240
It's time to face reality.

581
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,350
Wu Yan, you need to be realistic.

582
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,720
Because of you,

583
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,920
I fell in love with broadcasting.

584
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,710
When you said that
you wanted to be an anchorwoman

585
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,270
to anchor a news program,

586
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,750
I thought that you're really cool.

587
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,470
To be honest,

588
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,750
I'm really envious of you.

589
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,310
As you know,

590
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,160
my parents have mapped out
a plan for me since I was young.

591
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,160
I thought it was fine.

592
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,440
That's because

593
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,470
I didn't have

594
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,750
any ambition back then.

595
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
However, now,

596
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,510
I want to be an anchorwoman
and it's no longer because of you.

597
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,880
It's for myself.

598
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,470
Why do I have a feeling that

599
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,720
I was betrayed by my own comrade?

600
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,310
Anyway, thank you.

601
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,070
I found my ambition because of you.

602
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,510
Wu Yan.

603
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,720
Enough, stop talking.

604
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
[I received a letter today.]

605
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,080
[Someone threatened me
to read her letter.]

606
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,550
[This lady claims that she needs to]

607
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,920
[answer an important question.]

608
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,400
[The first line of the letter is]

609
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,210
["Let me tell you why I like you."]

610
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,070
[She's so impulsive, isn't she?]

611
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,540
[No doubt
there's nothing special about you.]

612
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,250
-[Besides good looking...]
-[Besides good looking and talented,]

613
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,990
[you're completely different
from my dream guy.]

614
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,640
[However, whenever I think of you,]

615
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,720
[I can't help imagining]

616
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,160
[what I look for]

617
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,510
[in a guy.]

618
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,400
[You're always gentle to children]

619
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,440
[but you're very fierce to me.]

620
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,310
[You never fail]

621
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,350
[to perceive the feelings that
no one else could perceive.]

622
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,400
[You deliberately ignored my feelings]

623
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,510
[but you're actually
very gentle and sensitive.]

624
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,920
[However, when you're in pain,]

625
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,550
[you just silently put up with it.]

626
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,350
[I think because of that]

627
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,400
[you think that]

628
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,470
[I would have the same tolerance]

629
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,070
[when you left me.]

630
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,360
[Just because
I couldn't answer the question,]

631
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
[you just disappeared suddenly.]

632
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,240
[You're just a jerk!]

633
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,670
[I still can't answer the question]

634
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,990
[but I want you to scold me
when you hear this.]

635
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,520
[Searching contacts.]

636
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,890
[All contacts.]

637
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,970
[Sang Wu Yan.]

638
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,200
[Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.]

639
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,440
[Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.]

640
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,120
[Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.]

641
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,880
[Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.]

642
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,870
Hello.

643
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,830
Say something.

644
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,160
Sang Wu Yan, say something!

645
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,310
How do you know it's me?

646
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,880
Where do you live?

647
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
You don't have to come.

648
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,790
I just want to talk.

649
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,400
Give me your address. Now.

650
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,530

651
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,440
Sang Wu Yan!

652
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,510
Open the door, Sang Wu Yan!

653
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,920
Sang Wu Yan! Wake up!

654
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,480
Wake up! Sang Wu Yan!

655
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,160
Sang Wu Yan!

656
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,890
Open the door, Sang Wu Yan!

657

Sang Wu Yan!

658
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm coming.

659
