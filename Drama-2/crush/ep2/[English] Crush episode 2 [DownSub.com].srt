I...

11
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,030
I'm just wondering

12
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,720
if you need me to hold you?

13
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,800
No.

14
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,440
Ms Sang, aren't you coming?

15
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,829
Yes.

16
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,240
Mr Su, just call me Sang.

17
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,030
I'm not a teacher yet.

18
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,270

is on the right.

19
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,550
Thank you.

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,520
Mr Su.

21
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,390
See you later.

22
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,960
Mr Su.

23
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,240
Mrs Zheng posted on
her social media yesterday.

24
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,030
She's already in the labor room.

25
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,880
I bet she's going to give birth today.

26
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,550
So soon?

27
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,520
It's not.

28
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,670
You've taken over her classes
for more than a month.

29
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,079
Mr Li.

30
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Mr Wang.

31
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,829
Let me introduce to you.

32
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,320
This is Mr Li.

33
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,440
This is Sang Wu Yan.

34
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,160
Our new teacher intern.

35
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,550
You'll be assisting Mr Li in the future.

36
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,800
Help out on the class affairs.

37
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,750
Hello, Mr Li.

38
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,270
Please guide me in the future.

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,270
Of course I will.

40
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,830
I look forward the most
to new interns every year.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,440
It makes my work easier.

42
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,830
Well.

43
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,080

Your desk is beside Mr Su.

47
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,920
Sure.

Mr Su.

49
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,550
She's Sang Wu Yan.

50
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,550
I've arranged her to sit beside you.

51
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,110
This is Su Nian Qin.
You can call him Mr Su.

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,760
Hello, Mr Su.

53
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,270
Hello.

54
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,000
Mr Su is a Braille teacher.

55
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,600
Since you're sitting beside him,

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
do look after each other.

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,320

I'll be here every Thursday and Friday.

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,200
Please provide me guidance.

60
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,480
Please don't say that.

61
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,230
I'm busy. I'll get going.

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,230

64
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,200
Do you want to move out with me?

65
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,440
I've found a house.

66
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,830
I always come back late.

67
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,760
The dormitory curfew is annoying.

68
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,159
I'd better move out.

69
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,480
Do you want to come with me?

70
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,070
Okay.

71
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,070
Tell Lu Lu about it then.

72
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,200
You know what?

73
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,950
Do you remember

74
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,480
that blind guy I told you before?

75
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,760
I met him at the
special education school today.

76
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,070
That prince charming at first sight?

77
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,159
He works as a Braille teacher there.

78
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,440
I even got to know his name today.

79
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,880
It's Su Nian Qin.

80
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,600
Nian Qin?

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,040
I've researched about it.

82
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,320
Let me show you.

83
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,510
Qin means Blanket?

84
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,950
He must be from a poor family

85
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,760
that can't afford blankets.

86
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,040
What if his name was given before birth?

87
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,550
Then his parents must be poor
before they got married.

88
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,670
Chinese parents

89

in their children's name.

90
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,670

You know what?

99
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,390
He remembered my voice.

100
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,270
He knew it right away

101
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,320
that we met before in the radio station.

102
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,880
Do you think it's because

103
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,550
my voice is recognisable?

104
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,670
But after meeting him for two days,

105
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,510
I think he has a bad temper.

106
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,790
He seems cold.

107
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,000
He always has that unfriendly vibe.

108
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,950
But he is gentle to the students.

109
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,920
Do you think

110
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,160
he misunderstood me as a stalker?

111
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,790
We always meet unexpectedly.

112
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,040
How should I explain our fate to him?

113
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,950
Tell him that it's
an ill-fated relationship.

114
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,840
He can't run from it.

115
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,000
You're annoying.

116
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,549
Ill-fated relationship?

117
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,669
That's also a kind of fate.

I'll be back soon.

The scenery in Jiangnan is
as beautiful as before.

turns azure blue.

Nothing.

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,640
I heard the piano
from the opposite office.

You must trust me on this.

158
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,200
But why so sudden, Miss Xi?

159
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,110
At first I thought

160
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,960
you should learn more about
the music market

161
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,520

with record companies.

165
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,760
you'll grow faster.

166
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,710

Thank you Miss Xi.

168
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,440

170

and more precise too.

171

It'll be a good opportunity

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,880
receive emails everyday.

184
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,840
Notices are extremely important
to reporters.

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,790
Yes, everyday.

193
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,470
You can discuss and take turns doing it.

194
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,030
Okay.

195
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,840
Xiao Xu is here.

196
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,350
Xiao Xu.

197
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,150
This is our newcomer, Sang Wu Yan.

198
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,080
Get to know each other.

199
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,320
Tell her about the writing format.

200
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,960
I have to attend a meeting now.

201
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,710
I'm leaving now.

202
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,320
I didn't know you're the newcomer.

203
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
That's your seat.

204
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,590
Can you send me the format
for statistics report?

205
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,110
Tonight is my roommate's birthday.

206
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,440
I need to finish up earlier

207
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,350
and get off work on time.
Thank you.

208
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,960
Okay, I'll send you an email.

209
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,060
[Radio Station]

210
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,470
[You're so successful in this field]

211
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,400
[but I heard you have side jobs.]

212
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,840
[Or could it be that songwriting
is your side job?]

213
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,400
[Yes.]

214
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,200
[Mr Yi Jin.]

215
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,790
[Is there any meaning
behind your stage name?]

216
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,230
[Does Yi Jin symbolise a night and a day?]

217
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,000
[Or is it to commemorate
someone or something?]

218
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,080
[It's easier to write.]

219
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,710
[Many songs you wrote]

220
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,670
[touched the hearts of many female fans.]

221
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,280
[For example, Fall and
Dream Under The Night Sky.]

222
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,440
[Were they your personal stories?]

223
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,760
[No.]

224
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,760
[They are...]

225
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,470
Why did my battery die now?

226
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,030
You know know? That place is great.

227
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,470
We should go and see next time.

228
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes.

229
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,470
Do you still want this?

230
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,670
No, it'll be too much.

231
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:40,960
Wu Yan.

232
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,440
-Over here.
-There's she is. Wu Yan.

233
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,910
Are you ready to place order?

234
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,150
I heard the signature dish is good.

235
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,760
What dish is that?

236
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,710
Let's try it later.

237
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,280
What was it again?

238
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,910
I'll check the menu again.

239
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,350
Okay.

240
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,280
Why didn't you answer my call?

241
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,200
My phone is out of battery.

242
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,840
I've already texted you immediately.

243
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,790
Don't blame me if you didn't see it.

244
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,560
We're from the same hometown. That's all.

245
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,920
Waiter, please take our order.

246
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,470
Any add ons?

247
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,190
Add on beef. Wu Yan likes it.

248
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,710
We'll have this.

249
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,760
This as well.

250
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,520
Okay.

251
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,190
Please hold on.

Wu Yan.

280
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,710
-I'm going out for some fresh air.
-Why are you avoiding me?

281
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,830
I'm not.

282
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,640
You didn't answer my calls
and even moved out.

283
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,310
When you saw me at school,
you took another route.

284
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,070
Don't deny it.

285
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,430
If you can transfer to another university,

286
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,920
I bet you would.

287
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,920
I didn't move out because of you.

288
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,310
I didn't answer your calls

289
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,680
because

290
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,190
I'm unpredictable.

291
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,680
I took another route because...

292
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,760
Because your're Wei Hao,

293
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,920
the star bass player in our campus band.

294
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,680
I fear that the path is too narrow
and I might be get in your way.

295
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,800
I've told you.

296
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm not with Xu Qian.

297
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
We were drunk.

298
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
It was just an accident.

299
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,950
We're grown ups now.

300
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,430
Can you stop being so stubborn?

301
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,280
Yes.

302
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,190
We're graduating soon.

303
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,000
We're no longer kids

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,470
who play house anymore.

305
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,830
That's why we shouldn't
always stick together.

306
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,680
Let's live our own lives.

307
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,430
Xu Qian is the one who likes beef, not me.

308
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,430
I'm allergic to beef.

309
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,880
Just like what you said,

310
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,560
we're no longer kids.

311
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,710
You said it was an accident.

312
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,000
Isn't that irresponsible to say?

313
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,040
After you said he was irresponsible,

314
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
how did he respond?

315
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,110
He said nothing.

316
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I left right after.

317
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,000
You're brutal.

318
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,640
Not bad.

319
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,110
But you know what?

320
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,230
You have to think further down the path.

321
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,110
You seem like you want to
end your friendship.

322
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,110
What's then?

323
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,230
You can't just

324
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,640
cut ties with them forever, can you?

325
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,230
After all, you're from the same hometown.

326
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,640
Speaking of it.

327
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,400
I was transferred to the News Department.

328
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,280
I didn't get to tell you that yet.

329
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,230
Now, the person sitting behind me

330
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,110
is Xu Qian.

331
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,470
Didn't you tell your superior to

332
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,190
get you transferred back?

333
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,230
You didn't want to join
that department too, right?

334
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,950
I agree with your thoughts.

335
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,010
But come to think of it,
I'll be a coward if I do that.

336
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,400
You don't want to be a coward?

337
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,590
Then what's your plan

338
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,160
for dealing with Xu Qian?

339
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,160
Are you going to act like a stranger?

340
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,000
What's the time now?

341
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,950
Ten o'clock I guess.

342
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,710
Oh no.

343
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,560
I forgot the family weekly update.

344
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,710
Our daughter called.

345
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,520
Father, I'm craving glutinous rice balls.

346
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,430
[Is your pocket money enough?]

347
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,760
[Should I give you more pocket money]

348
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
to buy yourself some glutinous rice balls?

349
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,920
Her monthly pocket money

350
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
is a few times more than
our neighbour's daughter, Xiao Qiong.

351
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,000
[You still worry that she has no money
to buy glutinous rice balls?]

352
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm just craving father's
sesame glutinous rice ball.

353
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,590
[Okay, okay.]

354
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,920
[I'll make them for you tomorrow.]

355
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,760
[Coincidently,]

356
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,800
[your Uncle Yu is going to
Xiamen for a meeting.]

357
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,880
I'll get him to pass the fillings to you.

358
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,070
You'll have to make them yourself.

359
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,190
No, I want the rice balls you make.

360
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,920
I miss you and miss home.

361
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,590
[How about this?]

362
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,830
[Come home next week.]

363
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,800
What about my classes?

364
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,280
Forget about your classes.

365
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,920
Apply leave.

366
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,310
Nonsense.

367
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,110
Wu Yan.

368
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,070
[Stop fooling around with your father.]

369
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,520
[He has spoiled you.]

370
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,430
You're a teacher

371
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
yet you don't discipline your child.

372
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,040
Listen here.

373
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,350
You'll have to register for postgraduate
entrance examination next month.

374
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,280
You need to focus on revision.

375
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,040
Stop going to the radio station

376
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,190
for no good reason.

377
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
[You're wasting your time.]

378
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,710
Do you hear me?

379
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,160
Yes.

380
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,280
[Also,]

381
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,640
[Wei Hao called us]

382
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,430
[two days ago]

383
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,950
[and asked where you move to.]

384
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,520
[He seemed worried. It breaks my heart.]

385
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,310
If you don't want to be with him,

386
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,640
make it clear.

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,190
[If not, how is your father going to]

388
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,760
[face Uncle Wei in the future?]

389
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,400
How is it related to facing Uncle Wei?

390
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,680
I can't believe you said that.

391
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,560
It's impossible between me and Wei Hao.

392
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Class is over!

393
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,950
Let's go and play in the field!

394
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,820
Come on. Let's play tag.

395
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,020
You start.

396
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,110
Hurry up. Follow us.

397
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,310
Okay. Slow down.

398
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,760
Come on. Hurry up.

399
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,920
Thank you. I'll pick it up myself.

400
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,800
[Is he really blind?]

401
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,560
Mr Su, it's me.

402
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,590
Mr Su.

403
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,680
I just want to tell you that

404
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,110
I parked my bicycle

405
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,190
at the left side of the gate.

406
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,950
Be careful. Don't walk into it.

407
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,350
Don't you have classes?
You're leaving already?

408
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,640
No.

409
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,230
[Mr Yi Jin.]

410
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,000
[Are they your personal stories?]

411
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,760
[No.]

412
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,350
Okay.

413
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,590
I'll get going then. Goodbye.

414
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,310
Wu Yan.

415
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm looking for you.

416
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,230
I have a sudden meeting to attend
at the City Hall.

417
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,520
Can you take over Class Three for me?

418
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,070
You can do some singing activities

419
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,710
or let them talk about themselves.

420
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,800
Sure.

421
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,350
But they've already done self-introduction

422
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,280
when I first came.

423
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,950
Let me think up something.

424
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,280
Okay. Thank you.

425
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,230
Give me a call if anything comes up.

426
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,710
Sure.

427
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,470
No problem.

428
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,470
Have a safe trip.

429
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,070
What should I plan for them?

430
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,880
Mr Su, why did you come back?

431
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
I left my music score behind.

432
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,000
How is everything?
Are you comfortable in our school?

433
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,560
Yes.

434
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,640
Everything is good here.

435
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,190
That's great.

436
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,040
To be honest,

437
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,430
at times like this,

438
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,040
teachers who are willing to teach
at special education schools

439
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,880
are getting lesser.

440
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,430
It's difficult to find talents like you.

441
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,710
If you intend to
become a full-time teacher,

442
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,430
I can help you.

443
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,230
You know my situation too.

444
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Don't bother about it.

445
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,920
To be honest, I really want you to stay.

446
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,400
Moreover, we are in need of manpower.

447
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,280
Don't we already have interns?

448
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,560
They're just students
who majored in related fields.

449
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,680
It's their university's requirement

450
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,560
to do their internships
at different organisations.

451
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,430
They can only graduate
if they score marks for it.

452
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,560
Usually, they won't come back anymore

453
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,760
after a few months.

454
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,040
So their universities
appointed them to come?

455
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,590
That's not completely it.

456
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,190
It's also up to the students' willingness.

457
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,830
Take Ms Sang for example.

458
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,470
She's studying psychology.

459
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,040
Her academic results are good too.

460
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,000
If she puts us as her first choice

461
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,430
for internship,

462
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,760
she'll definitely get it.

463
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,040
It's rare to find someone

464
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,280
who puts special education schools

465
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
as their first choice.

466
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,380
[Lu Lu]

467
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,760
Hello?

468
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,830
I'm doing my internship
at a special education school.

469
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,520
I can't make it.

470
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,560
I'll have to meet the requirements
of my credit hours.

471
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,160
If not, I won't be given marks.

472
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,280
It's annoying.

473
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,760
You go ahead. Have fun.

474
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,000
Goodbye.

475
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,430
Mr Su, why did you come back?

476
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,880
What's the matter?

477
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,190
Mr Su,

478
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,430
I actually have a favour to ask from you.

479
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,830
Mr Li went out for a meeting.

480
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,000
I plan to teach singing

481
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,710
during my lesson later.

482
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,760
Can you help me to play the piano?

483
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,110
They can learn singing in music classes.

484
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,520
I know.

485
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,640
But you see,

486
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,560
a teacher intern like me

487
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,950
can't teach them

488
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,400
using Braille.

489
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,230
So I need your help.

490
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
Mr Su.

491
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,680
Mr Su.

492
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,350
Excuse me, Mr Su?

493
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,560
He's so rude.

494
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,230
Ms Sang.

495
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,830
Hello kids.

496
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,000
Today, let's learn how to sing.

497
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,280
The student who can sing the best

498
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,560
will be rewarded later.

499
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,280
So, you must try your best to learn. Okay?

500
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,920
Okay.

501
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,310
What should we sing?

502
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Let's sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars.

503
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,640
I'll sing once to Mr Su

504
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
so that he can prepare.

505
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,880
After that, you'll sing along with me
line by line.

506
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,560
Okay?

507
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,830
Okay.

508
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,070
I'll start singing now, Mr Su.

509
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,560
♫ Twinkle twinkle little star ♫

510
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,830
♫ How I wonder what you are ♫

511
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,230
♫ Up above the world so high ♫

512
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,800
♫ Like a diamond in the sky ♫

513
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Mr Su, are we good?

514
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,040
Okay.

515
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,350
Let's get started.

516
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,230
Ready and go!

517
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,000

518
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,760
How I wonder...

519
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,040
Hold on, Mr Su.

520
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,640
It sounds funny.

521
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,110
It's how you sing it.

522
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,880
Did I...

523
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,430
Maybe I went a key higher.

524
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,470
It's okay, you can stick to this.

525
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,920
Let's go again.

526
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,230
Ready and go!

527
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,230

Mr Su.

534
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,520
What is wrong with you?

535
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,430
It's okay. Let's try again.

536
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,190
We'll go again.

537
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,560
Mr Su.

538
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,280

542
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,230
Class is dismissed.

543

Mr Su.

544
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,560
Mr Su.

545
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,830
Thank you for helping me.

546
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,880
I didn't do it to help you.

547
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,000
I was just worried about the kids.

548
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,280
After all,

549
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,830
you're just forcing yourself

550
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,040
to do this internship.

551
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,760
I'm not forcing myself.

552
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,230
I admit I came here for the marks.

553
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,800
But...

554
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,110
That's none of my business.

555
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,640
You don't have to explain to me.

556
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,800
Children are not your tools to gain marks.

557
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
You might not know this

558
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,760
but most of them are abandoned orphans.

559
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,590
