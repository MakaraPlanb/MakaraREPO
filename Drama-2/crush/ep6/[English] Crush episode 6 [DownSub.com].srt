[A warm welcome to Caring Enterprise]

191
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,700
When she was six years old,

192
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,410
she lost her parents

193
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,270
in a road accident.

194
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,870
She injured

195
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,000
her eyes in the accident.

196
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,950
Later,

197
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,530
she was sent to the welfare home.

198
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,850
Though she's lost her parents,

199
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,390
the warmth from the society

200
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,880
has made her happy again.

201
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,050
Xiao Wei is currently in Year Three.

202
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,730
She's received lots of attention
and love from her teachers.

203
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,590
Look,

204
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,590
her class teachers are over there.

205
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,850
Well...

206
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,140
Why do they aim their cameras at us?

207
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,650
Just ignore them.

208
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,060
How do I ignore them?

209
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,710
Just look to the front.

210
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
Keep your eyes straight.

211
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,650
Think about the time you torture me.

212
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,340
When did I torture you?

[A warm welcome to Caring Enterprise]

214
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,170
Xiao Wei, you must be exhausted.

215
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,300
You did a great job.

216
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,380
You performed
sign language and singing at once.

217

Do you know?

218
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,760
Mr Su was clapping for you all the time.

219

Where is Mr Su?

221
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,510
Has he left?

222

Xiao Wei, we need to go now.

223

Wu Yan, you may leave now.

224
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,230
It's been a long day.

225
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,660
Go some rest.

226
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,080
Sure.

227

Xiao Wei, see you tomorrow.

228
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,680
See you tomorrow, Ms Sang.

229
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,650

You're right.

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,020

I...

243
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,140
I can't take on the responsibility  for
the consequences that Xiao Wei may face.

244
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,120
Just like today.

245
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
I thought

246
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,090
it would be a cheerful event.

247
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,540
However,

248
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,700
it turned out this way.

249
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,490
Yet, I had no idea

250
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,920
what to do about it.

251
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,260
When I was young,

252
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,540
I had to perform like this too.

253
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,900
Those people

254
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,020
sincerely think that
they're doing charity.

255
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,950
Of course,

256
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,020
I don't deny that.

257
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,390
But they

258
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,700
have no idea what the kids really need.

259
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,750
It's not that they have no idea.

260
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,050
It's more like
they didn't bother to find out.

261
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,810
In front of the kids,
they repeatedly mention

262
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,460
defects,

263
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,930
abandonment and orphans.

264
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,900
They keep reminding the kids

265
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,460
and make them think that
they're inferior to others.

266
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,580
However,

267
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,220
the disabled
are merely those with physical defects.

268
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,930
They're different from other people.

269
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,099
We don't want to be sympathised.

270
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,560
We ask for equality.

You told me to investigate that family

and I did.

325
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,730
It's just an ordinary family.

I should be the one who attends to it.

However, with your company,

342
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,620
I think she'll be more at ease.

343
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,640
Don't worry, Madam Zhang.

344
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,390
We'll keep her company.

00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,550
Xiao Wei, were you cold on your way here?

353
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,430
How do you like warm milk?

354
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,620
She's afraid of strangers.

355
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,370
Let's order some food.

356
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,580
Sure.

357

Excuse me.

Xiao Wei.

359
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,740
Is there anything you want?

360
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,250
How do you like strawberry juice?

361
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,530
Or

362
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,080
do you want some bread?

363
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,960
How about cakes?

364
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,650
Do you want to listen to the radio?

Can you please switch on FM82.4 for me?

366
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,360
I think they're playing

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,440
What's wrong?

369
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,610
I'm surprised that
you listen to the radio too.

370
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,860
Moreover, it's a mainstream channel.

371
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,410
Or what?

372
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,100
Is it better to listen to your show?

373
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,860
How do you...

374
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,460
You remember my voice?

375
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,580
That's the only time I hosted
a radio show.

376
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,130
I didn't know that my voice is so special.

377
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,030
♫ The warm sunlight idly crawls into
the window ♫

378
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,910
♫ A faint and tipsy scent of
coffee aroma ♫

379
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,610
Why do you enjoy listening to the radio?

380
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,750
♫ Suddenly you're by my side again ♫

381
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,490
I don't have to watch it.

382
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,140
♫ Smiling as bright as the stars ♫

383
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,180
♫ Turning to the next page
of the storybook ♫

384
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,770
Do you know
why I love listening to the radio?

385
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,460
It's because I hate the sunset.

386
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,500
♫ You said the wind
will dry the tears shed by the clouds ♫

387
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,680
I hate seeing the sun

388
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,890
go down bit by bit.

389
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,100
♫ I asked you
how to console the sighing wind then ♫

390
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,230
Then, one day is gone.

391
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,980
Worse, I haven't completed my tasks.

392
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,410
I choose to close my eyes, put on
headphones and listen to the radio.

393
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,810
♫ You smiled without replying ♫

394
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,890
When I open my eyes again,

395
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,460
the sky has turned dark.

396
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,930
♫ Telling me not to be silly  ♫

397
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,720
It's yet another endless night

398
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,130
for me to waste my time.

399
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,060
♫ Oh clear skies outside the window ♫

400
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,270
♫ Oh yeah ♫

401
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,060
What a fool.

402
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,110
♫ I want to hug you from the back
and never let go of you ♫

403
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,370
Did you just smile?

404
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,020
♫ Why do beautiful things
always make people sad? ♫

405
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,940
No, I didn't.

406
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,700
♫ I'm afraid of you leaving ♫

407
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,510
I swear I saw your smile.

408
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,340
My eyesight is perfect.

409
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,830
♫ Hai yeah ♫

410
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,040
♫ I thought I would see tomorrow's sun ♫

411
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,170
♫ Oh ♫

412
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,440
♫ The warm sunlight idly crawls into
the window ♫

413
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:17,960
Therefore,

414
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,990
do you want to ride on the Ferris wheel

415
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,650
with me and Xiao Wei two days later?

416
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,040
♫ A faint and tipsy scent of
coffee aroma ♫

417
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,820
No.

418
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,860
I bet you'll come.

419
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,670
♫ Suddenly you're by my side again ♫

420
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,370
♫ Smiling as bright as the stars ♫

421
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,460
-You...
-Be careful.

422
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,740
We're very close to each other now.

423
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,280
♫ Turning to the next page
of the storybook ♫

424
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,660
♫ You said the wind will dry
the tears shed by the clouds ♫

425
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,580
♫ I asked you
how to console the sighing wind then ♫

426
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,080
♫ You smiled without replying ♫

427

♫ Oh yeah ♫

430
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,720
♫ Perhaps the wind will blow dry
the cloud's tear when she cries ♫

431
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,340
I'm back.

432
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,370
You're back.

433
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,220
It seems that you've thought it through

434
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,890
and decided
to get a master's degree with me.

435
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,990
How is that possible?

436
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,960
Didn't I tell you before?
I'm not getting a master's degree.

437
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,250
What are you doing then?

438
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm using science to attract a guy.

439
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,370
I aspire to be
a technical heart stealing thief.

440
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,650
What are you doing?
You're smiling like an idiot.

441
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,230
Su Nian Qin said

442
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,180
"No".

443
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,370
What does that mean?

444
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,230
You've studied psychology
for so many years now

445
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,890
and you use the knowledge on this?

446
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,740
Yes, I've studied psychology
for so many years now.

447
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,080
After a careful analysis,

448
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,440
I obtained the mighty victory

449
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,750
as my bravery overcame my self-knowledge.

450
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,720
He has personality disorder

451
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,460
but I have the knowledge.

452
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,770
You're really something.

453
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,860
However, I have a question.

454
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,650
Why are you referring to

455
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,530
abnormal psychology?

456
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,180
Well...

457
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,220
What's on your mind?

458
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,630
Nothing.

459
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,230
Are you not joining them tomorrow?

460
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,290
Aren't you fond of the young girl?

461
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,970
I'm not.

462
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,680
You told me to investigate

463
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,580
the background of the adoptive family.

464
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,460
I guess you like her.

465
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,080
That's why you're concerned about her.

466
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,820
Did I understand it wrongly?

467
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,900
No, I'm not going.

468
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,650
That place is surely crowded.

469
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,770
Moreover, it's not fun.

470
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,630
You've never ridden on a Ferris wheel.

471
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,060
How do you know that it's not fun?

472
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,290
Just join them.

473
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
You've never gone on a date.

474
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,010
It's quite rare.

475
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,740
I said, I don't want to go.

476
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,630
Fine.

477
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:36,140
[Ticket booth]

478
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,720
Xiao Wei.

479
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,960
When we're in the park,

480
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,370
you have to

481
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,390
hold on to me all the time.

482
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,220
If we get separated,

483
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,720
just stand still

484
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,600
and shout my name, okay?

485
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,600
Got it.

486
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,580
Good girl.

487
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,680
You're always careless.

488
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,490
You might not be able
to take care of her. That's why...

489
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,440
Sure.

490
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,180
I'm always careless.

491
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,990
Do you want to go inside?

492
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,800
If you go inside,

493
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,910
I can be your guide.

494
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,580
The park is crowded.

495
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,290
Let's go.

496
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,820
Let's go!

497
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,460
Let's get the pink one.

498
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,100
Show me.

499
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,290
You look super adorable.

500
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,940
Su Nian Qin.

501
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,840
Lower your head.

502
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,770
What did you call me?

503
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,460
What is this?

504
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,890
It's just Mickey's ears.

505
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,530
What is Mickey?

506
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,650
Su Nian Qin,
you really have no childhood.

507
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,010
You...

508
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,480
Xiao Wei.

509
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,360
Look, do you think

510
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,890
Mr Su looks extra handsome now?

511
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,150
What's so handsome about me?

512
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,340
Xiao Wei, aren't you...

513
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,480
Let's take a ride on the Ferris wheel.

514
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,510
We will have to queue up for a long time.

515
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,770
Let's go.

516
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,010
This is so foolish.

517
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,250
The rain falls on the eaves
and the swallows return.

518
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,370
Ms Sang, what are you saying?

519
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,510
Me?

520
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,580
I'm reciting

521
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,370
the lyrics written by my idol.

522
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,290
Idol?

523
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,980
Who is your idol?

524
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,820
My idol is...

525
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,740
He's a talented songwriter.

00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,130
usually initiated by men?

543
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,530
What's wrong, Ms Sang?

544
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,160
Nothing.

545
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,010
I think it's gone too high.

546
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,860
How did you know?

547
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,160
Ms Sang.

548
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,010
Did I ever say that I'm blind?

549
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,700
I'm not completely blind.

550
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,010
I can detect movements within three feet.

551
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,740
Now I know that

552
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,610
you're a fan who goes overboard
when you see your idol.

553
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,150
I'm not.

554
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,610
I don't see you as Yi Jin.

555
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,100
To you...

556
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,300
Don't talk too much
in front of the young kid.

557
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,090
Did anything good happen?

558
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,219
Nothing.

559
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,460
Did you have fun with the girl?

560
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,090
What could be so fun about it?

561
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,260
How come you made a mistake?

562
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,090
Did I?

563
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,230
You made a mistake.

564
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,850
Didn't you notice that?

565
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,890
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

566
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,050
Music is meant to express one's feelings.

567
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,370
There is no right or wrong.

568
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,370
It's fine as long as one gets
to express his feelings, isn't it?

569
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,610
Hello, it's me.

570
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,890
Listen.

571
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,370
I think we need to get Nian Qin a doctor.

572
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,360
Go to hell!

573
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,740
Why are you so irritated?

574
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,710
You look as if

575
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,370
you have the early warning signs of mania.

576
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,840
Do you need a check up at the hospital?

577
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,400
Why should I go to the hospital?

578
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,090
He's the one who needs treatment.

579
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,080
I'm so angry!

580
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,710
He did it on purpose.

581
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,360
Otherwise,

582
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,710
why did he voice it out

583
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,710
only when I got so close to him?

584
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,710
It's to make you think that
you've succeeded

585
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,160
and to see you embarrassed yourself.

586
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,710
He's so cunning!

587
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,360
Cunning!

588
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,090
How cunning.

589
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,670
That's not right.

590
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,610
In that case...

591
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,640
Thank you. I can do it.

592
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,850
Is he really blind?

593
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,540
Excuse me, are you Yi Jin?

594
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,840
-You...
-Be careful.

595
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,880
We're so close to each other.

596
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,570
So, he could see all this while.

597
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
You've been
embarrassing yourself all this while.

598
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,300
It doesn't matter now.

599
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,230
Why did you say that?

600
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,560
What is so embarrassing about
flirting with him?

601
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,020
I have the courage to own up to it.

602
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,430
The main point is...

603
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,090
What happened?

604
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,270
As you didn't lose your first kiss...

605
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,260
-So...
-Says who?

606
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,370
When did that happen?

607
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,890
Why didn't I know?

608
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,260
She's odd.

609
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,880
Mr Su.

610
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,500
It's like this.

611
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,870
Next week,

612
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,660
Ms Zheng will be back to school.

613
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,220
For some reasons,

614
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,710
she decided to end
her maternity leave early.

615
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,610
Therefore...

616
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,050
Therefore, thank you for your hard work.

617
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,090
Okay, I got it.

618
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,570
Thank you so much

619
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,910
for replacing her.

620
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,810
All the students really like you.

621
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,370
Don't mention it.

622
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,850
Mr Li.

623
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,660
Ms Sang...

624
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,990
Is she here yet?

625
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,840
Wu Yan?

626
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,840
She's on leave today.

627
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,090
She said something happened
at the radio station.

628
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,850
What's wrong? Were you looking for her?

629
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,780
Nothing.

630
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,740
I'll get going then.

631
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,480
I'm curious.

632
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,660
[Engineering Office]

633
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,080
Both of you are in charge of the news.

634
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,500
Sang Wu Yan.

635
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,680
Why weren't you involved in it?

636
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,200
Xu Qian interviewed pedestrians,

637
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,280
-do you know that?
-I...

638
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,630
It's not something serious.

639
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,020
I think it's fine

640
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,260
without that paragraph.

641
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,190
Even though you put in a lot of effort

642
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,950
to prepare for it,

643
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,560
the audience will forget it
as soon as it's over.

644
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,460
-Can you hear yourself?
-How could you say that?

645
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,650
I...

646
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,960
Conduct the interview again.

647
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,910
Before Friday,

648
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,950
make sure you get the material ready.

649
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,850
This is the last chance.

650
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,540
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

651
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,950
Let's go.
We'll conduct the interview again.

652
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,320
Don't you have something to do at 4 p.m.?

653
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,840
It's almost time.

654
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,130
That's right.

655
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,710
Go ahead.

656
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,290
I'll visit the site today.

657
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,560
We'll go there together
when the plan is ready.

658
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,700
In that case, I'll get going for real.

659
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,640
If you need my help,

660
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,050
don't hesitate to call me.

661
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,280
All of a sudden,

662
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,710
I have a feeling that
you're back to the old you.

663
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,230
You're crazy.

664
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,320
I'm leaving.

665
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,220
That's not right. Why am I panicking?

666
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,710
He's the one who fooled me.

667
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,300
Su, you're here.

668
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,050
Where is Ms Sang?

669
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,460
She's behind me.

670
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,460
Hello, Madam Zhang.

671
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,370
Hello.

672
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,850
Do you have eyes on your back?
