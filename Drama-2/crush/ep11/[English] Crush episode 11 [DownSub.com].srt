[Episode 11]

4
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,060
You know very well that

5
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,260
certain things and people

6
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,490
annoy me the most.

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,800
Yet you blatantly

8
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,690
leave them right in front me.

9
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,020
To you, I'm blind?

10
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,300
Is that why you're picking on me?

11
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,740
Su Nian Qin.

12
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,130
Must you be so bitter?

13
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,020
You're acting like a hedgehog all day.

14
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,930
Resenting everything, everyone
 and yourself.

15
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,020
You're happy being like that?

16
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,540
I'm wrong for lying to you.

17
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,210
But this is uncalled for.

18
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,130
Everyone in the family has been
apologetic to you.

19
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,970
But what about you?

20
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,410
You've been acting so heartless.

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,690
Never once did you return home to visit.

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,030
What do you want me to do?

23
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,570
What else can I do?

24
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,210
Leave it.

25
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,740
It's alright.

26
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,410
I'm still here, right?

27
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,620
I need some time alone.

28
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,870
There hasn't been news

29
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,810
about Yi Jin for some time now.

30
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,680
Have you heard anything

31
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,370
from the news department?

32
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,680
Nope.

33
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Wu Yan.

34
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,300
Why are you so quiet today?

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,650
Aren't you a fan of Yi Jin?

36
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,250
I'm... listening to your conversation.

37
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,750
Hello.

38
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Have you eaten?

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,020
I'm eating now

40
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,300
while having a chat.

41
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,630
Chatting?

42
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,130
I'm chatting with my colleagues
about Yi Jin.

43
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,340
They said Yi Jin is otherworldly.

44
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,460
You're having meat?

45
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,650
How did you know?

46
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,080
It sounds like

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,130
you're really enjoying the meal.

48
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,300
What kind of meat?

49
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,940
I'm having...

50
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,030
[What is it?]

51
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,960
It's.... nothing.

52
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,640
I've got work.

53
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,340
Got to go. Bye.

54
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,720
Wu Yan.

55
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,970
You're burning up.

56
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,300
Is it an allergy to beef?

57
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,500
Let's go to the hospital.

58
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,620
[Outpatient]

59
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,620
Her allergy

60
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,990
is due to the lack of

61
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,500
a specific protein-digesting enzyme
for beef.

62
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,150
I'll give her a box of astemizole.

63
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,500
After taking it, the measles will go away.

64
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,710
Be sure

65
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,180
to be more careful next time.

66
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,250
Alright.
Thanks, doctor.

67
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,300
You're welcome.

68
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,690
You had beef for lunch, right?

69
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,750
You know you're allergic to beef
and yet...

70
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,060
I just had it by mistake.

71
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,970
You're even careless about what you eat.

72
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,740
Bring your own lunch to work
after this.

73
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,020
That's such a hassle.

74
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,300
I'll pick you up at lunchtime
so you can eat at home then.

75
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,970
That won't be necessary.

76
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,950
He's a tyrant.

77
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,530
He's always uncompromising.

78
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,510
Aren't you still

79
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,150
buying him new clothes after all?

80
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,919
I dirtied his clothes back then.

81
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,650
I feel guilty over it.

82
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,530
Is that really why?

83
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
You just want him to wear the clothes

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,380
that you picked out for him.

85
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,090
Am I right?

86
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,470
This seems to be

87
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,940
the brand of clothes he wore
the other day.

88
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,120
Come on.

89
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,300
This one.

90
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,500
This is it.

91
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,940
Let's just go.

92
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,920
Forget about it.

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,590
His family isn't the kind that's
short of money.

94
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,530
You don't have to burn a hole
in your pocket for him.

95
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,030
They do seem pretty well off.

96
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,940
What is it?

97
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,850
It's nothing.

98
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,300
Ms Xiao Lu.

99
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,010
You're home.

100
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
Why are you...

101
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,240
Nian Qin said you'll be
bringing lunch from home.

102
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,330
I'm preparing it now.

103
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,770
I shouldn't trouble you over this.

104
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,500
It's fine. I enjoy cooking anyway.

105
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,880
Weren't you two quarrelling the other day?

106
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,180
Why are you...

107
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,830
We're always like that.

108
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,090
Things just got way more
heated up than usual that day.

109
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,560
Did that frighten you?
I'm really sorry.

110
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,680
No, no, no.

111
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,680
Let me help you.

112
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,240
You don't have to.

113
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,210
It's fine, it's fine.

114
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,140
Oops.

115
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,580
I poured too much soy sauce in it.

116
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,200
Don't worry.

117
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,090
I'll fix it up in a jiffy.

118
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,210
May I ask you a question, Ms Xiao Lu?

119
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,200
Nian Qin's clothings

120
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,360
are bought by you, right?

121
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,590
They seem pretty expensive.

122
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,140
He earns that much
just by writing songs?

123
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,000
The money isn't a lot.

124
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,380
But it's enough for him to spend.

125
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,010
Then again,

126
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,710
he still has a home after all.

127
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,260
So don't worry about money.

128
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,620
Home?

129
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,010
He... He has a home?

130
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,150
The one in those pictures?

131
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,820
Yes. Otherwise, we...

132
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,140
He didn't mention it to you before?

133
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,440
He must have his own reasons then.

134
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,450
You can ask him once he's back.

135
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,330
It's not my place to talk about it.

136
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,240
Would you mind me

137
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,380
asking questions about you then?

138
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,700
That depends on what questions
you're asking.

139
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,270
Nian Qin said you're
a sister of his relative's.

140
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,140
That makes you two related?

141
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,940
I guess so.

142
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,320
But then he said that

143
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,380
he grew up in a welfare home.

144
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,270
If he has a family,

145
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,500
why is he sent to the welfare home?

146
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,760
It's quite complicated

147
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,000
to explain everything.

148
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,890
Can you try asking something simpler?

149
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,380
He said his mum passed away.

150
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,770
Is his father still alive?

151
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,010
Of course.

152
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,630
But Wu Yan...

153
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,150
I only agreed to answering questions
about myself.

154
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,380
That's against the rules.

155
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,330
Fine, I'll give you that one for free.

156
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,150
So,

157
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,010
what's the actual nature
of your relationship with him?

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,450
Like his aunt, I guess.

159
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,140
An aunt without blood ties.

160
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,940
My sister is

161
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,740
his stepmother.

162
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,970
[Incoming call from Yu Wei Lan.]

163
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,410
[Incoming call from Yu Wei Lan.]

164
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,650
[Incoming call from Yu Wei Lan.]

165
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,820
[Incoming call from Yu...]

166
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,500
[Happy birthday, Nian Qin.]

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,260
What's the matter?

168
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,530
Nothing.

169
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,140
My nails are too long.
I can't play the piano well.

170
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,970
Let me help you trim them.

171
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,320
Done.

172
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,560
Nian Qin, what did you play just now?

173
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,630
It was very nice.

174
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,820
Could you play it again for me?

175
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,010
I just made it up.

176
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,450
Choose something else.

177
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,620
I want to listen to "Moonlight."

178
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,410
I did my homework.

179
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,390
Sister.

180
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,150
It's alright now.

181
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,450
The condition has stabilized.

182
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,800
You don't have to wait here.

183
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,380
Get Nian Qin over instead.

184
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,450
Sister, stop forcing me.

185
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,210
I really can't do it.

186
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,890
What if...

187
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,330
What if you go get him?

188
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,620
Why would he ever want to see me?

189

make up to him, haven't we?

But for him,

227
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,700
it's just whitewashing.

229
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,730
Has anyone really tried listening to him?

230
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,410
Back then

231
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,600
when we got separated in the subway,

232
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,700
I was anxiously trying to find him.

233
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,940
But he instead

234
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,250
remained very calm.

235
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,700
He told me that

236
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,250
no matter where I lost him,

237
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,870
as long as I return to where we separated,

238
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,220
I'd be able to find him.

239
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,350
He's really a kid who's extremely stubborn

240
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,220
and good at patiently waiting.

241
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,300
I think

242
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,750
Nian Qin is really just

243
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,480
a little boy who was abandoned
since the day

244
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,180
his mother passed away.

245
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,300
He got abandoned from that very day

246
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,130
and has never walked out of it since then.

247
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,890
He was the one who abandoned himself.

248
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,870
Since everyone has been

249
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,180
trying hard to create
this facade of happiness...

250
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,680
Since everyone has been
fervently moving forward

251
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,460
while denying the reality of his loss,

252
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,890
thus he could only lose himself.

253
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,180
Although I can see where
you're coming from,

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,990

I only wish to see
the person I love happy.

257
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,920
If he's really unwilling to,

258
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,010
why not just go on separate ways?

259
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,220

by his ill fate.

282

all of this from you?

supposedly a good thing.

[Picked Up a Fragment of a Star]

374
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,980
[The reason she likes this song so much]

375
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,350
is possibly that

376
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,220
she's similar to that lady

377
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,490
who's been imprisoned in the cage.

378
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,290
♫ The warm sunlight idly crawls into
the window ♫

379
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,820
The disabled kid

380
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,770
♫ A faint and tipsy scent of
coffee aroma ♫

381
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,300
was the beginning of her suffering.

382
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,940
Su Nian Qin.

383
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,730
I've picked up some
fragments of the stars.

384
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,620
♫ Suddenly you're by my side again ♫

385
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,020
♫ Smiling as bright as the stars ♫

386
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,630
From this second onwards,

387
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,560
your time

388
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,490
is renewed.

389
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,880
♫ Turning to the next page
of the storybook ♫

390
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,370
♫ You said the wind will dry
the tears shed by the clouds ♫

391
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,010
♫ I asked you how to console
the sighing wind then ♫

392
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,920
♫ You smiled without replying ♫

393
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,160
♫ Telling me not to be silly  ♫

394
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,510
♫ Oh clear skies outside the window ♫

395
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,820
Su Nian Qin.

396
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,100
Why didn't you switch on the lights?

397
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,100
Where did you go?

398
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,980
I went to work.

399
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,490
Why did you ask Ms Xiao Lu
about my background?

400
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,010
I have my reasons for hiding it from you.

401
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,300
If you really wanted to know,

402
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,410
why didn't you ask me directly?

403
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,300
Wu Yan.

404
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,100
[I'm sorry. I'm being too selfish.]

405
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,980
Next time, don't be home so late.

406
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,980
I'll bring you to see my family tomorrow.

407
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,300
I don't want to.

408
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,580
Then why did you lie to me?

409
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,350
Why didn't you tell me

410
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,370
the truth of your family background?

411
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,860
Does it matter that much?

412
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,610
The point here is that you hid it from me.

413
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,510
I've asked you

414
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,340
about your life after you turned six.

415
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,230
Which is why I'm bringing you
to see them tomorrow.

416
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,890
Su Nian Qin.

417
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,680
You can't always be so tyrannical.

418
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,340
Always demanding this and that.

419
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,340
You asked about it from someone else.

420
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,490
But now you refuse to see them

421
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,940
and I'm still the one being tyrannical?

422
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,870
Wu Yan.

423
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,410
The point here is that you hid it from me.

424
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,150
I've asked you before

425
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,100
about your life after you turned six.

426
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,230
[You can't always be so tyrannical.]

427
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,010
[Always demanding this and that.]

428
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,010
[To be honest,]

429
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,340
[it isn't a big deal even if she knew.]

430
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,410
[Why not tell her the truth yourself?]

431
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,770
[Tell her about what?]

432
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,960
That because of my disability,

433
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,890
my biological father abandoned me?

434
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,180
That after my mum died,

435
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,270
he remarried three times

436
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,530
and now his current wife

437
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,060
was once a friend of mine?

438
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,720
This is such a nuisance
in the middle of the night.

439
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,440
Exactly. It's been going on
for more than an hour.

440
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,320
How can we possibly sleep?

441
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,630
Everyone, settle down.

442
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,230
I've notified the relative of the owner.

443
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,720
She'll be arriving any minute now.

444
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm so sorry for the disturbance.

445
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,750
My apologies for disrupting everyone.

446
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,250
I'll head in now to tell him...

447
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,490
I'm really sorry.

448
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,270
It's fine.

449
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,410
Just go inside and see what's going on.

450
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,150
Everyone, you may disperse now.

451
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,040
Please return home now.

452
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,410
Actually,

453
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,490
I'm quite impressed by Wu Yan.

454
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,860
You, me

455
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,530
and my sister

456
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,180
have known each other for over ten years.

457
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,680
You've always been

458
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,940
cold and arrogant to everyone.

459
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,650
I thought this was your nature,

460
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,460
and that's how you'll be forever.

461
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,600
But it wasn't until

462
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,650
I saw you with Wu Yan,

463
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,770
that I realise

464
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,410
that wasn't the case.

465
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,940
You know how to be happy,

466
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,890
feel sadness

467
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,890
or get mad.

468
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,750
It's as if her slightest facial expression

469
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,060
could upturn all your emotions.

470
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,820
The fact that she caused you to blow up

471
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,530
is actually making me feel

472
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,700
quite happy.

473
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,010
I'm tired.

474
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,530
You're not going to look for her?

475
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,250
No.

476
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,960
Xiao Lu, please start the car
and take me out.

477
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,340
What... What is it?

478
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,820
I must find her.

479
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,940
Nian Qin, are you sure she'll walk
such a long distance

480

to Cheng Yin's place by foot?

483
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,340
She probably took a taxi.

484
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,610
She won't.

485
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,390

486
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,580

Public security in this area
is quite good.

490
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,650
She'll probably be fine.

Stop thinking like that.

495
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,940
You said before that

496
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,350
♫ This way it won't shatter ♫

497
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,610
it's not compulsory for one to be

nasty jerk.

538
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,580
You could've asked me why I refuse to go.

539
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,150
I remember you told me this before.

540
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,920
Lovers shouldn't hold back

542

He hurt me first.

543
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,620
What did he do to you?

544
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,000
I haven't spoken a word

545
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,140
but he started interrogating me instead.

546
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,860
And he's tone was so bad.

547
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,590
Why must he say it like that?

548
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,310
Would it kill him to actually
say it nicely?

549
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,070
As far I know,

550
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,970
he's always been that way.

551
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,760
It never bothered you before.

552
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,640
I...

553
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,040
Before this,

554
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,630
you saw the situation from
the perspective of the superior.

555
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,420
Subconsciously, you felt that

556
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,960
in comparison to this disabled orphan,

557
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,680
you'd always have the upper hand.

558
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,970
That's why you weren't bothered by it.

559
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,870
Simply put, it's the superior feeling of

560
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,210
being generous because you can.

561
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,200
However,

562
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,790
with Su Nian Qin turning out to be

563
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,730
a wealthy family's son,

564
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
you feel inferior now.

565
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,900
It's making you become more sensitive.

566
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,620
This is what you'd always say.

567
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,490

568
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,730

569

Of course.

for a married couple to quarrel?

572
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,550
Just talk it out nicely.

573
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,480
Maybe he'll call you soon.

574
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,450
Who said anything
about being a married couple?

575
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,200
I left my handbag and phone at his place.

576
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,680
No one would pick up even if he called.

some peace and quiet.

580

at our dear Lady Sang.

581
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,530
Why don't the both of us
pray to our ancestors for him

582
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,010
to have nightmares every night?

583
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,990
We can't do that.

584
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,620
He'll really be worried then.

585
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,100
Why don't you contact him instead?

586
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,990
I don't want to.

587

Yes.

Hello, Mrs Sang.

My apologies for disturbing you.

Where's Wu Yan?

597
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,860
She left her phone at my place yesterday.

598
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,660
She's probably at work now.

599
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,900
Mr Su, is it convenient
to have a word with you now?

600
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,490
Yes, Mrs Sang.

601
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,060
I reckon Wu Yan has told you about this.

602
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,420
Due to some reasons related to you,

603
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,590
her father and I

604
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,620
are against your relationship.

605
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,620
[I hope you understand
our concerns as parents.]

606
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,340
I've spoken to Wu Yan about it.

607
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,380
We ended up quarrelling.

608
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,760
[Wu Yan has been spoiled by me.]

609
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,300
[But she never once spoke
to me in that way.]

610
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,450
But no matter how,

611
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,860
she's still our daughter.

612
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,100
Since she's adamant on being with you,

613
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,770
we have no other way but to yield

614
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,170
to her decision for now.

615
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,660
[Her father and I spent
most of our lives working so hard]

616
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,340
[so that she won't have to
suffer in future.]

617
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,870
[So she can then find a suitable man]

618
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,620
[to have a smooth life together.]

619
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,530
But because of you,

620
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,100
she gave up all our arrangements
made for her.

621
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,170
[I really hope]

622
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,300
[you understand what this means]

623
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,620
[and treat her well.]

624
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,170
I understand.

You're home, Wu Yan?

626

Even if you're yearning for her,
you ought to eat something too.

627
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,340
I bought beef noodles.

628

634
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,820
pass Wu Yan's stuff back to her?

Ms Xiao Lu, I don't mean to be rude.

But have you guys considered that

641
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,310
maybe his awful temperament

642
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,420
was actually shaped by being
too lenient to him?

643
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,300
Yes, we did think about that.

644
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,060
