00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,720
You're forcing me to marry you.

188
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,880
That won't do. Do it again.

189
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,800
Do it again?

190
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,680
Then I'll do it again.

Won't your finger feel tired
if it's too heavy?

207
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,800
No, it won't.

You might have gotten a fake diamond.

225
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
All right.

226
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,040
Why didn't you switch on the lights?

227
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,480
Look at you.

228
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,880
I told you to watch the soup.

229
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,880
I forgot it.

230
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,600
This is...

231
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,240
Mum.

232
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,640
I've agreed to marry Nian Qin.

233
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,520
That's great.

234
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,520
That's really great.

235
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,520
Tomorrow is
the first day of Chinese New Year.

236
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,720
We'll pay your dad a visit together.

237
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,240
Here, here come the dishes.

238
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,080
Let's eat up.

239
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,960
Eat up.

240
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,840
Let's dig in.

241
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,000
Here, let's eat.

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
It's cured meat made by my mum.

243
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,600
It's delicious.

244
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,400
Let me get some rice for you.

245
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,080
Su, I made these fish balls.

246
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,240
Try it.

247
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,160
Thank you.

248
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,880
Su, have some fish.

249
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
It's a local speciality.

250
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,120
You can't find it anywhere else.

251
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,200
-Thank you.
-Here.

252
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Su, let's cheers.

253
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,120
Enough, stop bullying my husband.

254
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,320
When did that happen?

255
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,680
That's right.

256
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,640
You didn't even inform us.

257
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,480
Su, when do you plan to get married?

258
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,760
Nian Qin, can we play together?

259
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,040
I want to play with Nian Qin too.

260
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,640
Sure.

261
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,440
Nian Qin, why didn't you
celebrate New Year at home?

262
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,640
Wu Yan invited me over.

263
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,680
That's why I'm here.

264
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,000
Nian Qin,

265
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
Grandaunt says that
you couldn't see before.

266
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,760
Is that true?

267
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,840
I wasn't completely blind.

268
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,400
Nuo Nuo,

269
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,840
when you're moving in front of me,

270
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,520
I could sense your movements before this.

271
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,440
However,

272
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,640
I couldn't tell colours apart back then.

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,160
I relied on the descriptions by others

274
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,840
to relate colours and objects.

275
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,359
Therefore,

276
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,040
when I gained back my eyesight,

277
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,040
many colours appeared before me at once.

278
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,400
I spent quite a long time
getting used to it.

279
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,440
So, you didn't know

280
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,640
which things are which colours?

281
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,960
I could relate something to its colour.

282
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,359
For example, the sea is blue in colour.

283
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
So is the sky.

284
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,800
So is my favourite shirt.

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
What about white?

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,760
It's the colour of clouds and your teeth.

287
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,520
What about pink?

288
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,600
It's the colour of Wu Yan's lips.

289
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,680
That's my favourite colour.

290
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,160
You...

291
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,320
Don't talk nonsense
in front of the children.

292
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,280
All right, go have fun outside.

293
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,240
Go.

294
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,880
Wu Yan.

295
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,520
Check out the management office.

296
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,960
I think I've forgotten
to pay for the management fees.

297
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,520
I paid.

298
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,800
It's paid.

299
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,680
Furthermore, it's Chinese New Year.

300
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Apparently everyone is on leave.

301
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,640
Just do what I said.

302
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,920
All right.

303
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
Su.

304
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
About the things I said to you before,

305
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,440
I've always wanted you to know

306
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,680
that I'm sorry.

307
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,280
It's okay.

308
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,320
Mrs Sang, I got it.

309
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,080
Some subject matters

310
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,120
should be brought up
to your attention by her dad.

311
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,300
[Grave of beloved father, Sang Jin De
and mother, Cheng Jia Ying]

312
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,160
Too bad

313
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,560
he's no longer here.

314
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,380
[Grave of beloved father, Sang Jin De
and mother, Cheng Jia Ying]

315
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,440
Mrs Sang.

316
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,760
It's all my fault.

318
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,080
Everything happens for a reason.

319
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
No one should be blamed.

320
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
You should stop blaming yourself.

321
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,680
Before his demise, Wu Yan's dad

322
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,080
spoiled Wu Yan.

323
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,440
Back then, I always blamed him

324
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,920
for spoiling her rotten.

325
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,120
Before he passed away,
he reminded me about something.

326
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,920
Then, I realized,

327
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,000
before that, Wu Yan

328
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,000
was something
I showed off to everyone.

329
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,640
She's known as "other people's child".

330
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,160
It's very tiring to be her.

331
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,920
I always stopped her

332
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,080
from pursuing her own dream.

333
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,920
When I think back,

334
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,800
I'm really grateful
that she didn't listen to me

335
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,680
and she didn't exploit herself.

336
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,320
Su, bear it in mind.

337
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,760
Wu Yan was raised with love

338
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,880
by her dad and I.

339
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,640
You must treat her well.

340
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,400
You have to respect her
and support her dream.

341
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,440
Su.

342
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,600

343

You...

349
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,360
What are you talking about?

350
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,520
Mum, are you putting the fear
of god into my husband?

351
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,360
You haven't even married him

352
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,440
but you already take on his side.

353
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm not.

354
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,720

356

Of course he's coming along.

how beautiful his voice is.

♫ This way it won't shatter the heart ♫

371
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,160
Awesome!

372
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,560
I think it's not good enough.

373
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,280
This is my dad's go to song.

374
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,160
Sing it!

375
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,040
♫ The warm sunlight idly crawls into
the window ♫

376
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,400
♫ A faint and tipsy scent of
coffee aroma ♫

377
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,240
♫ Suddenly you're by my side again ♫

378
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,440
♫ Smiling as bright as the stars ♫

379
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,080
♫ Turning to the next page
of the storybook ♫

380
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
♫ You smiled without replying ♫

381
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
♫ Telling me not to be silly ♫

382
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,120
♫ Oh clear skies outside the window ♫

383
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,640
♫ I want to hug you from the back
and never let go of you ♫

384
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,200
♫ Why do beautiful things
always make people sad? ♫

385
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,040
♫ I'm afraid of you leaving ♫

386
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,280
You must have gotten drunk last night.

387
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,760
I listened to Mrs Sang's
and Wu Yan's singing for the whole night.

388
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,960
Their singing was definitely
more powerful than alcohol.

389
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,120
My mum made dumplings.

390
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,160
The filling is sea cucumber.

391
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,440
She told me to send some dumplings here.

392
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,000
Why don't you have some dumplings?

393
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,160
It's okay.

394
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Are you alone?

395
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,400
Where is everyone?

396
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,160
Mrs Sang is paying New Year's call.

397
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,720
Wu Yan went to see Cheng Yin.

398
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,760
I wanted to tag along

399
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,960
but she refused to let me go.

400
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,200
Cheng Yin?

401
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,240
Are you kidding?

402
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,480
Cheng Yin passed away three years ago.

403
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,000
What did you say?

404
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,520
You didn't know that?

405
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,800
Three years ago, Wu Yan and Cheng Yin

406
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,280
were trapped in the lift

407
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,600
at our apartment.

408
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,640
Xu Qian and I
received a phone call from the hospital

409
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,120
and we only learned about it
when we reached there.

410
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,240
Cheng Yin has claustrophobia.

411
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,680
She was trapped in the lift
for a long time.

412
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,160
Moreover, none of us knew that

413
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,240
she had severe heart disease.

414
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,800
What does that mean?

415
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,600
I guess Wu Yan made up all this
in her mind

416
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,400
in order to resolve her nervousness

417
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,840
or loneliness

418
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,080
or depression.

419
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,360
Whenever she feels lost,

420
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,560
she would make up a person

421
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,520
with Cheng Yin's personality
and mannerisms

422
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,960
to converse with herself.

423
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,200
I think it's a positive way

424
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,600
of self-adjustment.

425
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,760
The best way

426
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,760
is not reminding her
to seek help from a psychologist

427
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,480
but pretending not to know

428
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
and care for her.

429
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,080
Reduce her alone time.

430
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,800
Try not to let her negative emotions

431
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,920
affect her.

432
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,800
I think we should do the same to Wu Yan.

433
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,000
Keep an eye on her

434
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,720
lest there be any emergencies.

435
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,720
I got it now.

436
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,360
Thank you.

438
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120
Are you waiting for me?

439
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,120
You went to see Cheng Yin?

440
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,560
Didn't I tell you?

441
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,600
Cheng Yin said

442
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,000
it's such a valuable ring.

443
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,880
If we get a divorce one day,

444
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,720
I must not give it back to you.

445
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
Boss, I've looked into the address.

446
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
I went there.

447
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,080
The landlord said that

448
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,440
the person who entered into
the rental agreement is Ms Sang.

449
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,840
He is unsure of other details.

450
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,400
What's wrong?

451
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,840
Nothing.

452
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,240
Wu Yan.

453
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,240
Stop going to university.

454
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,280
After the new year break, will you
come to Xiamen to keep me company?

455
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,120
I didn't know that you're a conservative.

456
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
How is that conservative?

457
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,400
It's no different than stopping women
from going out

458
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
and getting educated.

459
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,520
Are you jealous of me
because I'm more cultured?

460
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,480
What?

461
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,320
I found out that

from elementary school.

463
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,960
Ms Xiao Lu has betrayed
your secret a long time ago.

464
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,880
Didn't you say that
you don't have any classes anymore?

465
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,480
You only have the thesis left.

466
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,240
You can work on your thesis in Xiamen.

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,960
Su Nian Qin, what's wrong with you?

468
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,680
You're getting more and more clingy.

469
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,280
You were not like this before.

470
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,240
I worry that someone else
might steal you away.

That jealousy of yours...

475
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,480
is too much.

476
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
So, will you come with me?

477
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,480
Give me some time.

478
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,160

479
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,840

480

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,680
the time you're walking alone

555
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,280
with a blind man's stick.

556
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Wu Yan.

557
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,200
Even if my eyesight

558
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,120
goes back to square one,

559
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,400
I don't mind.

560
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,680
But I mind.

561
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,440
Are you worried that I might go blind

562
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,400
and become your burden?

563
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,400
How could you think like that?

564
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,280
What should I think?

565
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,280
I just don't wish to see you

566
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,760
struggling in darkness
with very limited light.

567
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,680
I just want to see

568
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,000
how beautiful the world is.

569
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,040
You have no idea

570
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,680
how beautiful your eyes are.

571
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,040
It would be a shame

572
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,320
if they're merely decorations.

573
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,040
Sang Wu Yan.

574
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,240
You're still judging a book by its cover.

575
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,440
What is so bad about it?

576
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,400
Of course it's bad.

577
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,000
I fell in love with your appearance first.

578
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,320
Could that be a wrong judgment?

579
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,640
That's the only
correct decision you've made.

580
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,280
After all,

581
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,400
it's really difficult to find
someone as flawless as me.

582
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,720
My goodness.

583
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,560
Since when did you become so slick?

584
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,240
I learn from my wife.

585
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,280
If I lose my eyesight,

586
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,040
will your promise still count?

587
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,480
Cheng Yin once said,

588
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,720
Love is eternal blindness.

589
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,600
I'm not sure if you've fallen in love

590
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,480
because you couldn't see back then

591
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,240
but the moment I saw you,

592
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,760
I've lost my mind.

593
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,560
It's still the same until now.

594
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,160
I've decided

595
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,880
it'll be the same forever.

596
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,720
Let's go for a check-up tomorrow.

597
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,760
Can I say no?

598
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,680
No way.

599
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,400
Do you want me to run away from home?

600
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,760
I don't want to go.

601
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,380
[Outpatient Building]

602
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,880
Have you reminded the doctor?

603
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,200
Su Nian Qin, now, you're in a tight spot.

604
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,160
You...

605
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,240
Isn't the doctor here yet?

606
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,680
He's here.

607
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,280
He's getting changed after a surgery.

608
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,520
Hello, Dr Li. Long time no see.

609
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,600
Hello.

610
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,640
Last year,

611
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,760
I was abroad.

612
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,120
I was unable to attend your wedding.

613
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,360
So sorry for that.

614
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,360
It's okay.

615
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,280
As for Nian Qin,

616
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,840
what's wrong with him?

617
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,160
How could you let him take alcohol?

618
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,280
The pain

619
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,000
is mainly caused by

620
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,520
excessive drinking in the past.

621
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,480
Also,

622
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,080
he must not overwork.

623
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,520
It's best

624
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,200
if someone can take care of him.

625
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,560
As for the rest,

626
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,200
we'll discuss further
after the examination.

627
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,160
You may leave now.

628
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm going to conduct
an examination on him.

629
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,280
Sure. Thank you for the help.

630
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Don't mention it.

631
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,560
I didn't pay enough attention
to his health.

632
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,360
In short,

633
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,800
it's because of my bad temper.

634
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,880
Don't say that, Wu Yan.

635
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,440
You've done your best.

636
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,560
Take it slowly.

637
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,200
When two people live together,

638
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,000
they have to go through
an adjustment period.

639
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Furthermore,

640
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,960
everyone knows that he's bad tempered.

641
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,200
Not many people can put up with it.

642
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,200
But...

643
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,040
But Qin and you
get along so well with him.

644
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
He's Qin's boss,

645
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,720
his livelihood.

646
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
I'm his aunt.

647
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,600
As his elder,

648
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,720
I can't lower myself
to his level, can I?

649
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,320
What's wrong?

650
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm going to say thank you to Dr Li.

651
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,640
What's wrong?

652
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,120
What's wrong?

653
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,760
I'm thinking

654
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,160
I can stay in Xiamen.

655
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,480
I have all the raw data
from the field research.

656
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,080
As for the thesis,

657
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,560
I can finish it in Xiamen.

658
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,320
You want to take care of me?

659
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm more than happy to accept it.

660
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,400
If it weren't for the doctor.

661
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,080
I wouldn't be bothered.

662
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,680
I really have to thank

663
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,400
my faulty eyes.

664
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,680
If I become blind,

665
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,080
perhaps the treatment...

666
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,440
Don't talk nonsense.

667
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,320
Let's stay at our old house.

668
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,600
Why?

669
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,760
It's quite comfortable.

670
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,040
I like the living hall.

671
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,920
However,

672
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,080
it's on one condition.

673
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,040
No matter what it is, I'll agree to it.

674
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,840
Just don't ask me
to catch a star for you.

675
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,160
I won't be so unreasonable.

676
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,880
Furthermore,

677
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,040
if I really want a star,

678
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,520
you'll have to figure it out.

679
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,520
I watched a movie before.

680
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,480
The male lead

681
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,880
promised to give his lover a star.

682
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,920
In the end, he bought a piece
of meteorite

683
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,520
to fulfil his promise.

684
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Wu Yan.

685
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,040
How about watching
movies of other genres?

686
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,600
Why?

687
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,600
Nian Qin.

688
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,440
When do you plan to bring Wu Yan home?

689
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,480
My sister and your dad want to see her.

690
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
We'll talk about it.

691
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,360
Nian Qin.

692
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,400
Check out if the arrangement is right.

693
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,200
Let's put it this way.

694
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,480
It's not here.

695
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,320
Something is not right.

696
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,160
Everything is not right.

697
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,160
What is not right?

698
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,120
Why don't you do it on your own?

699
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,480
What are you doing?

700
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,680
What are you doing?

701
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,860
[Kettle]

702
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,080
Step forward for five steps.

703
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,760
Put it down.

704
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,320
Turn right.

705
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,920
Move forward.

706

Five steps.

707
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,920
Two, three, four, five. Okay.

708
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,400
Stop.

709
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,560
Turn right.

710
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,360
Okay, bend down.

711
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,120
Okay.
