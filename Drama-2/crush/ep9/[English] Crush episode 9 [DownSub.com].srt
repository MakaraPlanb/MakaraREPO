[Crush]

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,180
[Episode 9]

4
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,870
It's my duty to carry
the family's burdens.

5
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,440
But I don't want him to face
these problems.

6
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,830
If we get into a relationship,

7
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,240
and it becomes serious,

8
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,110
he'll have to face this one day.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,640
I don't want him to deal with this.

10
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,200
I think you should at least give it a try.

11
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,030
Give him and yourself a chance.

12
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,360
Although I understand what you mean,

13
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,829
I feel that

14
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,160
avoiding starting something

15
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,750
because it might end one day

16
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,470
means you're not being
true to yourself.

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,160
OK, I'll stop talking.

18
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,280
You should decide how it goes
between the two of you.

19
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,440
Where are you going?

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,950
To my boyfriend's place.

21
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,200
Boyfriend?

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,829
The one I met before this?

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,310
The school is going
on a break soon.

24
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,390
Where are you going to stay?

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,310
I can still stay
at the hostel for a few days.

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,470
After that I'll go for a short
term rental.

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,200
Why go through so much trouble?

28
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,030
Just stay at my place.

29
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,310
I'll just inform Cheng Yin about it.

30
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,190
Hold on.

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,280
Thank you.

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,280
Don't need to be so polite with me.

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Look at the environment here.

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,800
There should be everything you need.

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
You don't need to move anything in.

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Just give me a call if you need anything.

37
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm leaving.

38
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,079
I'm taking this with me.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,550
You can have the rest.

40
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,640
Thanks for your fruits.

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,440
Six lemons.

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
That's enough.

43
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,030
Su Nian Qin,

44
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,670
you look like you're part of the sofa.

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,030
Here, have some lemon juice.

46
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,280
You're not drinking it?

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Don't you like this?

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,360
I made it with fresh lemons.

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I'll drink it later.

50
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,550
OK.

51
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,310
What are you doing?

52
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,360
Are you going to listen to some radio?

53
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,720
Xiao Lu sent an audio file to me.

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,870
She wants me to listen to it.

55
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,360
Audio file?

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,940
♫ The overlapping wishes ♫

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,589
Isn't this Xu Qian's voice?

58
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,860
♫ Plays up the colour and fragrance ♫

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
♫ The so called stubbornness ♫

60
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,150
Why did she send Momo's voice recording

61
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,960
♫ Never worries about time ♫

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,120
over to you?

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Momo?

64
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,840
♫ The raindrops evaporate right away ♫

65
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,520
It's my best friend's band.

66
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,880
♫ The elders speak with feelings ♫

67
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,800
They're also my university coursemates.

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,800
♫ A flower is incomplete
without its leaves ♫

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,110
♫ Finally I found my way ♫

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,030
You've met them.

71
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,190
Wei Hao and Xu Qian.

72
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,200
♫ The long awaited summer ♫

73
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,120
Do you remember?

74
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,240
Your childhood friends with
a complicated relationship?

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,960
♫ Is burning with heat ♫

76
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,940
♫ It's as if the heat is waving ♫

77
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,130
♫ The fluctuation is just a pretence ♫

78
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,150
Indeed,

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,840
even though they haven't
practised for a long while,

80
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,980
♫ The day is quiet ♫

81
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,800
it still feels good when you listen to it.

82
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,110
♫ And the sunset is bustling ♫

83
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,750
I really feel like watching
Momo's jamming session.

84
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,640
♫ Now I'm putting on the badge
of transformation ♫

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,840
Drink your lemon juice, quick.

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,040
♫ We long for fire ♫

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,190
♫ Longing for boastfulness
as it speaks my mind ♫

88
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,150
♫ We long for fire ♫

89
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,870
♫ The expansion in our hearts ♫

90
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,130
♫ Kickstart my journey ♫

91
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,670
♫ The expansion in our hearts
speaks my mind ♫

92
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,870
[The expansion in the heart
acts out my thoughts]

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,960
We played well today.

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,310
Yes.

95
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,800
When did we not play well?

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,240
The bass seems to have been
submerged in water.

97
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,470
-Hello?
-I think something's wrong with it.

98
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:21,870
Look.

99
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,150
Let me see.

100
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,030
It's rusted.

101
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,560
Is it time to get a new one?

102
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,960
It's alright. I'll make do.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,550
Do you mean

104
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,920
that I got in?

105
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Are you sure?

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Of course.

107
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,120
Thank you.

108
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,960
See you then!

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,750
By the way, the band that you
brought over the last time,

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,360
I let Nian Qin listen to
the recording of their practice session.

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,870
Nian Qin says it's quite good.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,870
Really?

113
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,640
I plan to produce a show

114
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,030
that focuses on young, indie artists.

115
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,870
I think getting people who
are extremely new like them,

116
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,640
basically amateurs,

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,960
is very interesting.

118
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,910
By the way,

119
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,470
how has Nian Qin been recently?

120
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,270
Haven't heard about him in a while.

121
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm going to tell you secretly.

122
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,960
Nian Qin has been busy dating recently.

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,920
I've known that he is interested
in that girl since the beginning.

124
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,240
I'm so curious.

125
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,360
What kind of girl is she?

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,150
She's quite an adorable girl.

127
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,470
Has a unique name too.

128
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,240
She's called

129
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,270
Wu Yan.

130
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,150
Senior, you need to keep it a secret.

131
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,150
Or else, you know what's going to happen.

132
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,710
I know, don't worry.

133
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,840
What are you busy with
so early in the morning?

134
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,590
I'm bringing my boyfriend on a date.

135
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,710
We're going to an early movie.
There's fewer people.

136
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,150
Are you trying to choke your boyfriend?

137
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,360
Nonsense.

138
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,190
I'm trying to awaken all
the senses in the body.

139
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,400
So that even in a crowd,

140
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,470
he'll be able to find me. Do I smell good?

141
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,750
What is this?

142
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,680
I came back at 3 a.m. last night.

143
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,590
Didn't even have the energy to change.

144
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,680
Poor you.

145
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,200
Rest well then.

146
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,680
I'm leaving.

147
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
Bye bye.

148
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,350
He's going into the Egyptian centre.

149
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,960
He's hiding in the corner

150
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,480
and waiting for the mummy to appear.

151
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,909
The shadow appeared.

152
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,280
The mummy...

153
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,640
Stop watching.

154
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,040
The scarier I get,
the more I want to watch it.

155
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,480
[The scarier it gets,
the more she wants to watch it.

156
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,990
It really is like being poisoned.]

157
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,480
-Make way, make way.
-Excuse me.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,920
Make way, make way.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Excuse me. Excuse me.

160
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Move inside.

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,910
I'm sorry, please make way.

162
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,400
Go that way.

164
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,750
Don't push.

165
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,440
Oh no, his phone is in my bag.

166
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,270
He's so stubborn,

167
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,600
he's not going to ask for help.

168
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,300
Oh dear.

169
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,750
Su Nian Qin!

170
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
That was fast.

171
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
I was so worried.

172
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,870
What is there to worry about?

173
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,790
No matter where we split up,

174
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,790
I'll be waiting for you at the same spot.

175
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,110
But what if I'm the one who got lost?

176
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,200
The scent of your perfume is so strong

177
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,350
it's going to be easy to find you.

178
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,750
Su Nian Qin!

179
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,960
Where's Wu Yan?

180
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,870
I've downloaded all
the movies she spoke about.

181
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,230
She went to the grocery store
right outside to get some Hawthorn sticks.

182
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,830
On the way back,

183
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,230
she saw some candied haws,

184
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,430
but we didn't get the ones that she loved.

185
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,990
She kept thinking about it
since we got home.

186
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,200
She couldn't stand it anymore,

187
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,350
so she went to get some food
to curb the craving.

188
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,110
Nian Qin, why are you
suddenly talking so much now?

189
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,870
It's nothing. That's quite nice.

190
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,310
I'm leaving. You go on.

191
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,230
Sir, I didn't hear you wrongly, did I?

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,590
Correct. After you hand over your tasks,

193
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,670
you can go over to the
crew to see Nie Xi.

194
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,000
Thank... thank you sir.

195
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,750
Thank you for the care
you've given during this time.

196
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,800
I'll come back and visit often.

197
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,270
So, I... I'm leaving now.

198
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,520
Thanks, thanks, thanks!

199
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,520
Mr Zhong, I'm back.

200
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,390
What took you so long?

201
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,480
I've been waiting for you for half a day.

202
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,430
How did you know that I'm coming back?

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,630
During the meeting,

204
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,200
Nie Xi went to see
the people Mr Jiang wants

205
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,520
and insisted on getting you back.

206
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,470
Why?

207
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,350
It could be any reason,

208
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,910
but it's definitely not because of
your work performance.

209
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,200
Don't assume that all young people like me

210
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
have a mild temper.

211
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,680
You have a mild temper?

212
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,240
The entire station knows

213
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,590
that you could explode at any moment, OK?

214
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:48,920
How dare you say that.

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,800
Sang Wu Yan.

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,680
I requested you back

217
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,270
not so that you can play around

218
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,520
or flirt around.

219
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,000
Arrange these materials.

220
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,230
We'll need it for the live show tomorrow.

221
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,160
Xi... Xi.

222
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,520
Flirting?

223
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,550
Where did you get this from?

224
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,600
Xiao Lu bought it. I'm not sure.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,960
That's too troublesome for Xiao Lu.

226
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,200
Just eat it.

227
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,990
I'll pay back any favours to her.

228
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,720
Do you want to try it? I can feed you.

229
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,510
No.

230
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,280
You've touched it. Eat it.

231
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,030
You're exaggerating.

232
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,670
It's not that sour.

233
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,910
Don't you love to drink lemon juice?

234
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,350
Since when did I love lemon juice?

235
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,870
No way, Su Nian Qin.

236
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
[Mum]

237
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,440
Hello?

238
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,870
Not going home yet?

239
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,310
Because I have to work over-time today.

240
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,230
Why are you working until so late?

241
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,550
It's very dangerous for a girl
to walk alone at night.

242
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,600
I've already told you

243
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,520
this really isn't a good job.

244
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,070
On top of that, we're not there with you.

245
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,480
There's no one to take care of you.

246
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,350
Mum, I'm working quite well here.

247
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,160
What do you mean well?

248
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,200
You're alone in an unfamiliar place.

249
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,670
Wouldn't you be bullied?

250
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,960
Tell me honestly,

251
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,350
all this while until today,

252
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,230
you're always been so busy,

253
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,520
what have you been busy with?

254
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,880
Is it because...

255
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Mum, don't speculate.

256
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,000
My colleagues are quite nice to me here.

257
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,110
There really is no problem.

258
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,270
Then finish work soon.

259
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,800
Don't loiter outside.

260
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,640
Be aware of your safety when you're alone.

261
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,040
I know.

262
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,480
Xi.

263
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
You haven't been improving recently.

264
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,400
Your focus and angles in
the writing are both wrong.

265
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,430
I'll change it.

266
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,640
You don't need to.

267
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,960
Just leave it be.

268
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,840
But, Xi...

269
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,080
What... this?

270
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,520
What's wrong with this?

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,430
Nothing is wrong.

272
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,510
I've arranged

273
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,150
these materials long ago.

274
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,990
There definitely won't be a problem
for the live show.

275
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,550
So she...

276
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,110
I have no idea either.

277
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,520
Maybe Xi just wants to break you in.

278
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,020
[Nian Qin]

279
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,560
Hello?

280
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,000
Hold on.

281
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,390
Here's your coffee. Enjoy.

282
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,270
Thank you!

283
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,310
See, he came all the way just
to see me and left.

284
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,390
Maybe he can tell

285
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,550
that I'm having trouble at work.

286
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,230
Our Su

287
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,870
can see quite clearly

288
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,880
when he needs to.

289
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,270
Wake up. You're so love sick.

290
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,150
Your boyfriend just needs to come over

291
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,030
and you'll forget any problem
that you're having.

292
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,120
I can't just keep thinking about it.

293
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,550
I just don't understand.

294
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,110
This Xi

295
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,270
has always been quite nice.

296
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,110
She's usually quite friendly to me.

297
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,200
Although sometimes she's
a little too strict,

298
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,480
she gives out

299
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,880
the vibes of a teacher.

300
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Why did it suddenly change?

301
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,510
Why is this...

302
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,920
Are you being pranked?

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,960
You're so carefree,

304
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,550
you might not even realise when
you've offended someone.

305
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,030
I don't think anyone would do that.

306
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,630
Wu Yan is just an intern.

307
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,120
Would someone waste time to prank her?

308
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,630
Wu Yan,

309
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,390
I think it's best not to overthink.

310
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,680
In the workplace,

311
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,120
the most important thing is

312
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,120
to not take yourself too seriously.

313
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,630
We lose our worth once

314
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,550
we've left our parents and school.

315
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,550
How someone would react
depends solely on their mood.

316
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,150
We can't change anything, anyway.

317
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,030
It's important to just do your best.

318
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

319
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,990
Hello?

320
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,360
Why are you not back yet?

321
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,670
It's only past nine o'clock now.

322
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,870
Yes, you have the routine
of an old person.

323
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,310
My goodness.

324
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,270
You...

325
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,320
People who drink with you so late

326
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,670
are definitely not good people.

327
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,870
Not at all! They're my best friends.

328
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,840
And I asked them out.

329
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,840
The car is here.

330
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,150
I...

331
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,720
We're leaving.

332
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,120
I'm going to hang up. Bye bye.

333
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,240
Was that your mum?

334
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,960
No.

335
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm staying at my friend's place.

336
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,080
You should bring Xu Qian with you. Go.

337
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,840
Then you should leave first.

338
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,630
I'm worried if you're waiting
for a cab by yourself.

339
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,440
Good bye.

340
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,320
You take good care of Xu Qian for me.

341
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,080
Go.

342
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,600
Bye bye.

343
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,480
Bye bye.

344
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,630
Thank you, sir.

345
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,270
Su Nian Qin, you are absolutely...

346
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,390
My classmates asked

347
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,390
if it was my mum that called just now.

348
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,670
My goodness.

349
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,910
Don't move. I'm acting drunk.

350
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,240
Give it back.

351
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,510
No.

352
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,670
This is mine.

353
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,550
Is it?

354
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,910
Su Nian Qin, were the
glutinous rice balls nice?

355
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,600
I don't know.

356
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
I gave it to Xiao Wei.

357
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,600
I was wrong.

358
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,390
I shouldn't get such a
sweet candy for Xiao Wei.

359
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
She'll get cavities.

360
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
[Oh my god. How long has he
been missing?]

361
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:29,740
[Topic: Yi Jin]

362
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,920
[I'm about to post
a missing person notice.]

363
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,420
[What if the great god Yi Jin]

364
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,000
[is frustrated with the music scene's
present standards]

365
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,720
[and decides to devote himself
to other things?]

366
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,320
[Are you telling me he isn't]

367
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,080
[coming back after
the New Year celebration?]

368
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,030
I'm so jealous of you young girls.

369
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,840
You don't gain weight even
when you're eating two sets of meat.

370
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,430
Tell me.

371
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,390
Why would she suddenly

372
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,600
come and speak to me?

373
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,270
It's just...

374
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,910
But Xi was really nice to me before this.

375
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,600
Is this Xi that you're talking about
Nie Xi?

376
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,390
I know her.

377
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,840
Of course you know her.

378
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,630
She did your interview before this.

379
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,430
No, she's Xiao Lu's senior.

380
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,510
She's quite close to Xiao Lu.

381
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,670
Xiao Lu gave you Momo's
recording before this.

382
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,270
I asked Xi to help find a studio too.

383
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,840
Everything makes sense then.

384
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,720
That means even before the live show,

385
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,320
you and Xi were quite
 close already.

386
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,760
Not really close.

387
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,030
We're just friends.

388
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,360
That was unexpected, Su Nian Qin.

389
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,990
You always look so distant,

390
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,550
but you're actually quite popular.

391
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,550
What do you mean?

392
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,030
I don't mean anything.

393
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,310
It's a psychological analysis.
You wouldn't understand.

394
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,320
Wu Yan,

395
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,120
can you eat less when you're home
for New Year?

396
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,910
Your belly is getting kind of soft.

397
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,120
Who says you can touch me?

398
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,390
You're

399
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,270
still touching?

400
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,670
Stop it.

401
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,030
You're not allowed to touch. No touching.

402
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,200
Are you sure you
don't want me to send you?

403
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,600
It's alright.

404
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,390
I'm not bringing a lot of luggage.

405
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,550
There's no need for you to travel.

406
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,880
The car is here.

407
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,600
I'm leaving.

408
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,200
I'll come back earlier
to spend time with you.

409
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,080
Be good.

410
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,270
I'm leaving.

411
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,550
Be good. I'm leaving.

412
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,630
Bye.

413
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,960
Be good when you're alone.

414
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm leaving.

415
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,240
Bye bye.

416
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,760
Where's our daughter?

417
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,880
Still sleeping?

418
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,480
She's studying.

419
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,630
Studying?

420
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,120
Don't bother her.

421
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,910
Rain is hitting the eaves,

422
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,390
the swallow has returned home.

423
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,840
Next to Zhuque Bridge,

424
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,430
the boat has long sailed.

425
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,960
After we part this year,

426
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,430
when will we meet again?

427
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,270
Read that again.

428
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,390
Rain is hitting the eaves,

429
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,120
the swallow has returned home.

430
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,550
Next to Zhuque Bridge,

431
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,750
the boat has long sailed.

432
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,630
After we part this year,

433
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,120
when will we meet again?

434
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
I wonder under the umbrella,

435
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,080
in Wuyi Alley,

436
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,670
the light colours of twilight.

437
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,200
What's wrong?

438
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,790
I suddenly realised

439
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,760
that your voice sounds nice.

440
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,880
What are you doing?

441
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,030
Why are you suddenly studying old poems?

442
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,030
Nothing.

443
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,880
I'm doing lesson preparations.

444
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,110
When I'm back

445
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,110
I need to teach the children at the
special eds school.

446
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,120
I'm doing lesson preparations.

447
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,760
Then why are you wearing your earphones?

448
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,630
This...

449
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,600
Well...

450
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,840
There's a kid who is
very slow at learning.

451
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,510
He can't finish the winter holiday
assignments and called me.

452
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm just giving him some guidance.

453
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,990
OK, Mum.

454
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,390
Go cook.

455
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,990
The student is asking me what's happening.

456
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,440
I'm already a teacher,

457
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,480
but my mum is still asking
about everything.

458
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,910
Isn't that shameful?

459
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,480
Now that we're out,
it wouldn't be as stuffy right?

460
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,320
We're wasting so much effort for this.

461
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,390
Why can't we just sit her
next to the window to get some air?

462
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,030
Do you know him?

463
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,270
Bring grandma to the park.

464
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,550
I'll be over in a second.

465
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,030
That's my mum.

466
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,670
She doesn't come home for
New Year often before this.

467
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,080
Wu Yan saw her by chance.

468
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,150
So why did you...

469
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,150
I prepared some gifts for house visiting.

470
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,510
Bring it back and tell Aunty I said hi.

471
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,110
That's funny.

472
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,880
You want to say hi to her.

473
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,550
No, but...

474
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,720
If you see her in the future, ignore her.

475
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,920
If she asks to borrow
some money or for your help,

476
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,430
pretend you don't know me,

477
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,910
and just refuse.

478
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,150
Why would you say that about your mum?

479
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,430
Because I'm tired.

480
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,320
I keep seeing her getting hurt by another

481
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,670
prick the same way.

482
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,630
Then coming back and leaving
over and over again.

483
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,120
It's always been like this.

484
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,960
I'm tired.

485
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,790
So,

486
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,720
don't care and don't ask.

487
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,030
Just pretend that you didn't know.

488
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,630
You're helping me by not doing anything.

489
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,760
I've told you.

490
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,670
You're helping me

491
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,150
by not doing anything.

492
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,030
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

493
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,960
Incoming call from Sang Wu Yan.

494
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,360
What are you doing?

495
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,440
Not doing anything.

496
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,270
What about you?

497
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,600
What are you doing?

498
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,550
Not doing anything.

499
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,270
The New Year celebration
is just like that.

500
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,910
Like what?

501
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,750
We have a reunion dinner,
watch performances.

502
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,600
give some red packets,
play with some firecrackers,

503
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,200
watch the fireworks and stuff.

504
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,430
It's boring.

505
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,240
So you're calling me because you're bored?

506
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,720
No.

507
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,870
I'll share a playlist in NetEase with you.

508
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,270
Let's listen to some music together, OK?

509
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,360
Playlist?

510
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,200
You've never seen a playlist?

511
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,720
My goodness.

512
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,390
Let me show you the world.

513
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,260
[Picked Up a Fragment of a Star]

514
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,390
Wu Yan. "Picked Up a Fragment of a Star."

515
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,080
Did you know,

516
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,000
Although I'm a science student,

517
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,480
when I was chatting online

518
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,680
about Yi Jin before this,

519
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,430
I was really creative
with blowing his trumpet.

520
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,720
It means using very extravagant words

521
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,080
and poems and other things
to compliment Yi Jin.

522
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,790
But ever since I've fallen for you,

523
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,790
I feel that a lot of times,

524
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,480
I would think of you
when I hear a certain song.

525
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,510
The feeling the song gives me

526
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,430
is the same one I have for you.

527
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,990
After a while,

528
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,600
I've collected a lot of songs
without realising it.

529
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,790
I want to describe my feelings,

530
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,630
but I can't find the words for it,

531
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,360
or when I miss you a lot,

532
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,270
I'll listen to those songs.

533
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,880
And soon after that,

534
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,080
I stopped

535
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,630
blowing his trumpet.

536
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,390
I feel that

537
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,510
if I share this playlist with you,

538
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,000
you will definitely understand.

539
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,120
You'll clearly know my feelings for you.

540
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,880
So why is it called
"Picked Up a Fragment of a Star"?

541
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,150
Because

542
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,390
there's a secret you've forgotten,

543
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,670
but I know of.

544
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,200
Su Nian Qin,

545
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,630
the universe in your heart isn't all dark.

546
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,200
I've picked up a fragment of a star.

547
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,080
So no matter where

548
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
I lose you,

549
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,390
I'll definitely be able to find you.

550
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,800
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

551
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,600
five, four, three, two, one!

552
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,910
Happy New Year, Nian Qin!

553
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,240
Happy New Year.

554
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840
OK. I'm going to listen to some songs.

555
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,050
♫ ♫The warm sunlight idly crawls into
the window♫ ♫

556
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,690
♫ A faint and tipsy scent of
coffee aroma ♫

557
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,580
♫ Suddenly you're by my side again ♫

558
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,870
♫ Smiling as bright as the stars ♫

559
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,820
♫ Turning to the next page
of the storybook ♫

560
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,179
♫ You said the wind will dry
the tears shed by the clouds ♫

561
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,679
Why are you so quiet?

562
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,040
after coming back from the
New Year holidays?

563
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,239
Did I tell you that I need
to give an open lecture?

564
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm anxious about it.

565
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,590
Nian Qin,

566
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,960
what do you think students
like to listen to?

567
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,350
Like when you were in
special education school

568
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,670
as a student,

569
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,760
is there anything that
you would like to learn in particular

570
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,630
but wasn't taught by the teachers?

571
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:51,590
I was only in the welfare home
until I was six.

572
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,590
So the time I spent in the
special education school

573
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,240
is just around one year.

574
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,720
I don't remember very well anymore.

575
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,390
Just there until you were six.

576
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,670
Were they good to you?

577
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,960
I mean the aunties taking care of you.

578
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,960
There's really no good or bad.

579
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,520
Taking care of abandoned kids

580
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,830
is just a job to them,

581
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,350
it's not because of love from their hearts

582
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,240
or any other feelings.

583
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,040
Of course, just like
how we treat Xiao Wei,

584
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,670
they would have their favourite child.

585
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,960
But for me,

586
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,000
I liked to be alone when I was a child.

587
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,960
I always feel that the
world is really noisy.

588
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,800
Everyone is talking,

589
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,150
but it's none of my business.

590
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,200
I only feel calm

591
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,150
when music starts playing.

592
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,910
There's the safe feeling
of being wrapped up.

593
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,520
What happened after you turned six?

594
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,350
I don't want to continue with this topic.

595
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,200
OK.

596
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,520
Since you've already gotten a boyfriend,

597
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,000
why are you still bringing me
clothes shopping?

598
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,240
You know why.

599
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,390
I see you cooped up at home
studying every day.

600
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,960
So I brought you out for some fresh air.

601
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,480
That's not it.

602
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,000
I think you just don't want to
tire out that person at home.

603
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,430
By the way,

604
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
when you're back home for the New Year,

605
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,480
did you tell your parents

606
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,870
that you're in a relationship?

607
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,800
You should do it soon.

608
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,390
See,

609
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,200
our mum has all my messages.

610
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,200
Shouldn't you leave a copy
of all his messages

611
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,000
with our parents?

612
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,240
Since you're not going home,

613
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,000
if anything happens,

614
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,520
he would be a bigger suspect than I am.

615
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,000
Suspect number one.

616
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,720
Why can't you hope for
something good for me?

617
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,520
Aren't I hoping for
something good for you now?

618
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,120
Let's shop,

619
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,080
buy clothes.

620
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,000
What do you think, do I look good?

621
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,870
No.

622
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,830
You can't even see,
but you're saying it doesn't look good.

623
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,720
Nian Qin,

624
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,000
are there no treatments for your eyes?

625
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,870
No.

626
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,240
It's congenital.

627
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,830
Do you want my eyes to be cured so badly?

628
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,000
Not really.

629
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,680
But if you see what I look like,

630
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,630
you might not dote on me anymore.

631
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,000
I know that you're a beautiful girl.

632
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,000
How would you know?

633
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,430
I can hear it.

634
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,000
No.

635
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,320
My beauty is incomparable.

636
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,760
Think of it this way.

637
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,830
If I'm not the prettiest,

638
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,240
then I would be the cutest.

639
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,910
If I'm not the cutest,

640
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,670
then I would be the person
who loves you the most.

641
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,830
Since you put it that way,

642
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,480
now I really want to know.

643
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,350
What the person
who loves me the most looks like.

644
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,950
Come here.

645
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,000
These are my eyebrows. They're messy.

646
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't really like to groom them.

647
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,320
These are my eyes.

648
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't have a lot of lashes,

649
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,800
and my eyes love to tear up,

650
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,870
but my eyesight is perfect.

651
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,910
This is my nose.

652
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,150
It's small.

653
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,760
I have to check

654
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,870
to see if there's flaws, to return you.

655
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,150
You want to return me?

656
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,670
No way.

657
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,950
What's up?

658
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,680
Everyone

659
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,720
including us that are "normal"

660
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,440
would feel the anxiety that I mentioned

661
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,720
when interacting with people.

662
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,240
The level of anxiety differs for everyone,

663
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,670
and it's different based on
experience too.

664
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,560
It's unavoidable.

665
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,480
It's not something only you have,

666
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,150
and it doesn't happen
because you're not good enough.

667
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,240
The important thing is that you should
bravely open up your heart,

668
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,150
bravely speak up,

669
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,200
so that people know your thoughts.

670
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,390
That way, you will find

671
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,590
that the possibilities in our future

672
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,000
are a lot more than we can imagine.

673
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,760
OK. That's the end of the lesson.

674
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,640
Dismiss.

675
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,430
All rise.

676
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Goodbye, Miss.

677
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,720
Ms Sang.

678
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,720
Xiao Wei.

679
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,440
Xiao Ling told me

680
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,960
that she saw Mr Su before the class began.

681
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,910
Did you invite him to listen in?

682
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,520
I didn't know that.

683
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,670
But thank you for letting me know.

684
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,350
Go back to your seat.

685
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,460
Let's see.

686
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,220
[Xiao Lu, did Nian Qin come
to the school?]

687
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,240
Yes.

688
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,620
[Sister]

689
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,080
Hello?

690
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,200
OK.

691
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,430
Please send the flight number to me.

692
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,910
I'm going to start driving. Bye.

693
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,630
Xiao Wei and Xiao Lu were
double witnesses.

694
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,150
Don't deny it.

695
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,630
You slipped away.

696
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,000
You have to help me take a picture.

697
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,520
How are these two things related?

698
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,910
Of course they're related.

699
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,720
You're my boyfriend,

700
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,280
so you need to help me take pictures.

701
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,870
Why do you need a photo?

702
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,910
Because I dressed up differently today.

703
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,590
Just push here later.

704
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,280
Just push when I tell you to.

705
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,710
Push.

706
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,830
Push twice more.

707
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,760
Don't you know the secret of
taking pictures

708
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,000
is to take two more?

709
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,870
Push three more times.

710
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,280
Then?

711
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,630
Then,

712
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,150
have we never taken a picture together?

713
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,520
Let's take a picture together.

714
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,920
Come here.

715
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,800
Don't block, don't block.

716
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,230
Here.

717
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,760
You need to smile.

718
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,320
You look good when you smile.

719
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,200
Look at the camera.

720
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,910
Let me see.

721
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,520
It looks quite good.

722
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:33,960
Wait a moment.

723
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,920
Hello?

724
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,840
Wu Yan,

725
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,800
why are you not home again?

726
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,200
I...

727
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,520
I have something on in school.

728
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,390
Come back at the end of the month.

729
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,830
Your dad and I have
contacted a high school.

730
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,070
They're looking for a psychology teacher.

731
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,990
Mum...

732
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,520
Bring your resume

733
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,520
and those certificates back.

734
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,240
You need to prepare for it.

735
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,430
There's an interview.

736
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,440
It's inconvenient for me to discuss this
with you now.

737
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,000
I can't talk now. Talk later.

738
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,910
What do you mean inconvenient?

739
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,390
Why have you been sneaking around lately?

740
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,670
OK, I'm hanging up. Bye bye.

741
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,870
What's wrong?

742
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,760
My mum called.

743
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,200
She told me something about work.
