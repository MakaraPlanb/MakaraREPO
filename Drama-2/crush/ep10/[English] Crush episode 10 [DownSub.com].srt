00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,400
[Episode 10]

4
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,960
Anyway, if I don't say,

5
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,160
he would never ask anything.

6
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,030
He acts like he doesn't care.

7
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,440
Does he even know

8
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,420
what school I am in?

9
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,829
You should've asked him this directly.

10
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,920
I say,

11
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,000
you'd better think about

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,540
how you are going to
explain to your family first.

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,720
Your mum called me again yesterday,

14
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,520
saying that you have to go back.

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,200
She called you again.

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Why did she keep bothering you?

17
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,950
I'm sorry, honey.

18
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,470
It's fine.

19
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,190
But I really think that

20
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,340
you should talk to your parents.

21
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,560
They just want the
best for you, after all.

22
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,230
But they don't have the
rights to decide on my future.

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,550
What am I going to to do,

24
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,030
who I am going to date,

25
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,650
whether I would continue to learn,

26
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,870
isn't that something that I
should decide for myself?

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,520
[Mum]

28
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,080
Well, I think

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,590
you should just give in to her.

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,590
Otherwise I'm going crazy.

31
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,390
Mum, listen,

32
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,079
I'll definitely stay here.

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,880
I've been staying here for four years.

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,750
I like this place.

35
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,310
I'm not going back in the future either.

36
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,950
Why won't you listen to me?

37
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,829
As your parents, we are
not going to ruin your life.

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,920
We are doing this for your own good.

39
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,560
There are a lot of people who really want

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,870
to enroll in your dad's
school, and they couldn't get in.

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,910
You've studied away
from home for just four years,

42
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,079
and now you don't want
to come back anymore.

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,030
I shouldn't have let you apply for

44
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,470
the university away from
home in the first place.

45
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,110
I'm still not going back.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,680
Wu Yan,

47
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,390
are you hiding something from me?

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Mum,

49
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,470
I...

50
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,320
I have a boyfriend now.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,470
Boyfriend?

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
When did you meet? How old is he?

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,160
Where does he live?

54
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,950
Is he from the same school?

55
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,399
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,959
Introduce him to me.

57
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,550
Mum, he...

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,160
I met him at the special education school

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,750
where I'm doing my internship.

60
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,840
He works there as a Braille teacher.

61
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,200
He...

62
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,200
He has a little problem with his eyesight,

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,550
but he is not totally blind.

64
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,990
What about his family?

65
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,360
What do his parents do?

66
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,270
He was raised in an orphanage.

67
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,830
But...

68
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,710
Stop.

69
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,710
I'll fly there tomorrow.

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm dead.

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,150
What are you doing here?

72
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,110
I heard it was fixed.

73
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,360
I happened to leave work early,
so I dropped by to take a look.

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Time flies.

75
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,470
I remember you were the one
who cleaned up the studio

76
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,430
with me in the middle
of the night back then.

77
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,960
Hello, Mrs. Sang.

78
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,520
Wu Yan's mum.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,470
Her current address?

80
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
If I hadn't asked Wei Hao,

81
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,480
did you still think

82
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,920
you could muddle through this time?

83
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,950
Mum, that's enough.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
Just get in the car.

85
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,710
Xiao Lu, why aren't you getting in?

86
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,310
Nothing, I just saw a friend.

87
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,060
What's wrong?

88
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,150
Look at that smile on your face.

89
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,200
Nian Qin is dating someone.

90
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,080
Good for him.

91
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,840
Sang Wu Yan.

92
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,710
Have you eaten?

93
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,640
Haven't.

94
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,310
Wu Yan, is everything okay?

95
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,670
You sound nervous.

96
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,350
I have to go, I'm hanging up now.

97
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,550
Talk later, bye bye.

98
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,970
Nian Qin,

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,310
I might bring someone to see you later.

100
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,240
Which one is your room?

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,080
This one.

102
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,909
This one?

103
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,590
Mum?

104
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,310
Mum, what are you doing?

105
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,680
You're coming home with me tomorrow.

106
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,260
Mum.

107
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,710
You only want to stay here

108
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,400
because of that guy, isn't it?

109
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,870
I'm not letting you stay
here for another minute.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,430
Your father will apply for
leave for you at the school.

111
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,750
You're leaving with me tomorrow.

112
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,789
Wait, Mum, at least meet him for once

113
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,299
before you jump into conclusion.

114
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,280
I'll show you his photo.

115
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
That's enough.

116
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,640
We don't approve of
your relationship at all.

117
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
So there is no need for me to meet him.

118
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,760
Mother.

119
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,550
Before you young people do something that

120
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,280
you will regret in the future,

121
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,870
I'd better break you guys up now.

122
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,670
We have already done it.

123
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,110
But I don't regret it.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,800
You...

125
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,990
Stop being mad.

126
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,600
Mum, I've fallen in love with him.

127
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,200
And that's the most painful thing for me

128
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
if we are separated
in the future, isn't it?

129
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,640
Mum, I don't get it.

130
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,250
Why do you have to oppose us?

131
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,550
Is it just because of his eyesight?

132
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
Just because?

133
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,160
Do you think it's just that simple?

134
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,990
Yan Yan,

135
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,230
you are acting like

136
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,990
an insensible child now.

137
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,470
You haven't experienced
the daily grind of marriage.

138
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,710
You have no idea of

139
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,840
the struggles and sufferings in it.

140
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,040
You're not thinking straight because
your feelings have gotten to your head.

141
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,870
You think you're doing fine, don't you?

142
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
-You think you can do anything, don't you?
-I...

143
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,970
-No...
-Stop, stop.

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,600
I don't deny the love you believe in,

145
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,230
but the reality of life

146
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,080
is not how you expect it to be.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,880
You grew up being pampered.

148
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,520
You are the apple of your dad's eyes,

149
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,400
he pampered you so much that

150
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,230
he treated you like a princess.

151
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,030
What can you experience?

152
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,160
But I can learn.

153
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,470
I can learn to cook.

154
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,550
I can learn to make money. I can
learn to take care of myself and him.

155
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,350
Besides,

156
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,080
he doesn't need me to
take care of him at all, okay?

157
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,910
I didn't raise you up,

158
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,790
so that you could spend

159
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,150
most of your life

160
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,040
taking care of people like that.

161
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Not to mention that he's an orphan.

162
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,430
He's not.

163
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,790
He really is not, he has family.

164
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,760
Mum, I think you really should meet him.

165
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,440
He is an outstanding man.

166
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,350
And he loves me very, very much.

167
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,870
Yan Yan, I told you before

168
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,040
love shouldn't be 
about the spur of the moment.

169
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,280
Love comes with sense of
security and responsibility.

170
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,680
What good family could a person

171
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,840
with mysterious background have?

172
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,050
He won't even tell you.

173
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,790
And you call that love?

174
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,550
It's not that he wouldn't tell me.

175
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,520
It's because I didn't ask him.

176
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,200
I can call him and ask him now.

177
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,520
If that's all you're worried about,

178
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,550
I will call him now.

179
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,840
I don't need it.

180
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,400
Wu Yan, I don't care
about what family he has.

181
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,870
If his family is rich,

182
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,910
then I can tell you that

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,720
our family doesn't need to marry
our daughter above our station.

184
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,640
If he is poor,

185
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,000
then I can tell you that

186
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,280
that would make me dislike him even more.

187
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,640
Fine.

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,910
You're just going to disapprove 
of us no matter what.

189
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,280
But Mum, you need to understand that

190
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,230
the one who wants to be with him is me,

191
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,430
not you guys.

192
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,950
Wu Yan,

193
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,480
how could you talk to me like that?

194
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,910
Nian Qin, what's wrong with you?

195
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,400
I thought it was Wu Yan.

196
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,370
What's going on?

197
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,480
You seem nervous.

198
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,720
Wu Yan said she's going
to bring someone here.

199
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,910
If I'm not mistaken, it should be her mum.

200
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,040
You should prepare for it indeed.

201
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,840
How did you know?

202
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,400
I was in the airport.

203
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,430
I saw her when I was picking up a friend.

204
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,480
Oh right, I'd better go
buy some ingredients.

205
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,280
It's almost time for dinner.

206
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,000
When they come later,

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
we can eat together.

208
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,520
Nian Qin,

209
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,910
it's 9 p.m..

210
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,550
Why don't you...

211
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,880
I'll call you later.

212
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,680
Gotta go.

213
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,640
The food's cold.

214
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,990
Let me reheat it.

215
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,600
No matter what,

216
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,960
let's eat first.

217
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,840
Mum,

218
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,080
I've grown up.

219
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,200
Can you let me choose my own path?

220
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,650
I know there will be setbacks.

221
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,560
But

222
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,720
I'll be strong too.

223
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,960
Even if I'm beaten down,

224
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,640
I still have a mother and a father

225
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,670
who love me very much, don't I?

226
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,560
Right?

227
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,230
I'm going back to Tongcheng County.

228
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,400
Wu Yan,

229
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
you're on your own now.

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,550
You can have it your way.

231
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,640
I understand now.

232
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,200
No matter what I say,
you're not going to listen.

233
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,200
But mark my words,

234
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,990
you walk the path
you're chosen for yourself.

235
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,840
There are no do-overs in life.

236
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,750
If you encounters problems in future,

237
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,480
you can't blame others but yourself.

238
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,160
I want to take a nap.

239
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,829
Nian Qin, listen to me.

240
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,790
-I mean it...
-It's none of my business.

241
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,200
Nian Qin, don't be so
harsh to your father.

242
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,080
Father?

243
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,040
I never think

244
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,960
he fulfilled his fatherly duty.

245
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,110
I have to leave.

246
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,510
Xiao Lu, I'll walk you out.

247
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,430
Xiao Lu,

248
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,030
what's going on with you guys?

249
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,360
Nothing.

250
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,920
By the way, Wu Yan,

251
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,110
didn't you say you were going
to bring someone to meet him?

252
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,270
Why didn't you come?

253
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,200
Something came up yesterday.

254
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,630
We couldn't make it.

255
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,120
Actually, yesterday
was Nian Qin's birthday.

256
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,670
It's fine.

257
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,880
He never celebrates his birthday anyway.

258
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
He couldn't.

259
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Keep him company, Wu Yan.

260
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,280
I'm going now.

261
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,310
Call me if you need anything.

262
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,640
Okay.

263
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,760
Bye, Xiao Lu.

264
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,600
Birthday...

265
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,720
Thank you, Doctor.

266
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,400
You're welcome.

267
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,200
Madam Wang, please walk him out.

268
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,840
Okay.

269
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
-Please.
-Okay.

270
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,600
As soon as you landed yesterday,

271
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,840
you went straight to see that brat.

272
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,840
After all, it was a special day.

273
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
I have to see if he's doing well.

274
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,840
Is it necessary?

275
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,790
It was him who chose to leave back then.

276
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,840
Why bother to see him?

277
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,400
If you hadn't been too proud

278
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,840
and wouldn't give in to a kid,

279
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,960
would things turn out like this today?

280
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,840
He didn't come back, did he?

281
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,960
Let's just pretend nothing happened.

282
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,550
Goodbye.

283
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,910
Hello, please come in.

284
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,430
Is it crowded?

285
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,600
A little bit.

286
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,710
If there were so many people on a weekday,

287
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,080
we would just go.

288
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,470
Then why don't we go now?

289
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,000
No, we have to wait today.

290
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,550
Because I'm craving for it.

291
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Okay.

292
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,510
Thank you for coming.

293
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,150
Please come in.

294
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,760
Okay, thank you.

295
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
Let's go.

296
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,270
Sit here.

297
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,840
Thank you.

298
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:07,400
[Please make us a bowl
of longevity noodles.]

299
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,760
Waitress.

300
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,670
Thank you.

301
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,000
Thank you.

302
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,670
You haven't told me

303
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,310
who you were going to
bring to see me yesterday?

304
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,670
Cheng Yin.

305
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,560
Among my best friends,

306
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,760
you've met Xu Qian and Wei Hao, right?

307
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,390
So I wanted you to meet her too.

308
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,910
So why all the secrecy?

309
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,270
No.

310
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,550
Because I want to move in with you.

311
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,150
So I thought I should let my current
roommate get to know you too.

312
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,510
Why do you suddenly
want to move in with me?

313
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,390
Well, I found my meal ticket.

314
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
So why not move in earlier
so that I can have free meals

315
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,480
and save money?

316
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,640
Hi.

317
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,520
-Thank you.
-Here's your noodles.

318
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,840
Please enjoy.

319
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,160
I'm allergic to beef, I can't eat it.

320
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,610
Eat it for me.

321
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,910
Let me smell it.

322
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,790
Eat up.

323
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,280
Is it good?

324
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,670
Husband.

325
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,670
You're home.

326
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,790
Let me tell you,

327
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,030
you daughter defied us completely now.

328
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,270
Do you know what she told me?

329
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,720
She actually fell in love with that guy.

330
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,910
And this is her most
painful thing in future.

331
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,800
Listen to her.

332
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,310
Listen to the mawkish things she said.

333
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,710
Ever since she was little,

334
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,970
I strictly forbid her

335
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,790
to read those romance novels.

336
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,390
But I didn't expect that

337
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,490
I had raised a lovesick fool.

338
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,880
I know that

339
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,310
at her age,

340
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,640
she is going to yell and beg me

341
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,550
to give her freedom and love.

342
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,000
But I did not expect that

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,720
she would go that far.

344
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,960
She actually fell in
love with a blind orphan.

345
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,310
I mean, why did she...

346
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,080
Jing De!

347
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,840
Jing De!

348
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,760
What's wrong with you, Jing De?

349
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,000
Jia Ying.

350
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,310
Jia Ying, how are you doing?

351
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,200
How is he? What did the doctor say?

352
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,480
The doctor said he had brain hemorrhage.

353
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,030
He just got out of surgery

354
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,760
and has been admitted to ICU.

355
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,600
He will be put under
observation for 24 hours

356
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,910
to see how he recovers.

357
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,240
How did he...

358
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,880
Jia Ying, don't panic.

359
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,320
He'll be fine.

360
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,970
He'll be fine.

361
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,120
Thank you for coming.

362
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,240
This is nothing.

363
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,760
What about Wu Yan? Have you told her?

364
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Nian Qin.

365
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,840
Did I wake you?

366
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,600
No.

367
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,910
Were you having nightmare again?

368
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,590
Nian Qin, when did you

369
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,030
start learning to play the piano?

370
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,030
When I was about to celebrate
my six years old birthday.

371
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,200
Was it easy to learn?

372
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,630
No.

373
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,310
Then why did you choose

374
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,840
to learn piano in the first place?

375
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,840
My mum wanted me to.

376
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,390
She believed that if a
disabled child like me

377
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,510
could be proficient in
a musical instrument,

378
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,630
at least I would have
valuable skill in life,

379
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,840
I could make a living from it.

380
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,880
Your mother...

381
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,720
She passed away.

382
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,720
On my birthday,

383
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,270
my mum taught me this song.

384
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,720
She said

385
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,350
this song was written for

386
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,670
a woman who was in confinement.

387
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,390
People could only
tell if she was still alive

388
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,960
by the sound of the piano at night.

389
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
When the piano was no longer heard,

390
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
that meant she was gone.

391
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,500
I guess

392
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,480
perhaps she liked this song that much

393
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,880
because she too,

394
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,480
was confined in a cage

395
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,080
like that woman.

396
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
Having a child with disability

397
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,960
was the beginning of her ordeal.

398
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,800
Nian Qin,

399
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,510
teach me how to play piano.

400
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,430
So that I can keep you company.

401
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,590
Do you really need to
bring so much stuff there?

402
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,310
It's not like you're marrying him.

403
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,310
Don't worry, honey.

404
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,880
I will come back to see you

405
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,280
at least once a week, okay?

406
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm really worried that when I'm not here,

407
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,390
a homebody like you

408
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,270
will tear down the house.

409
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,880
That's not what I meant.

410
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,670
You should worry about yourself.

411
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,360
Don't turn his mansion into a pigsty.

412
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,910
This time is different, okay?

413
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,200
I'm going there

414
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,790
to take care of him.

415
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,670
I'm done packing.

416
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,790
Come, give me a hug.

417
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,310
Okay, bye.

418
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,000
Look at you,

419
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,880
why didn't you walk me out?

420
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,480
You can do like the
characters do in the movies,

421
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,120
telling me to come back often
to visit you or something like that.

422
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,310
Would you like to order a takeout with
me so that I can get a discount then?

423
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,910
Nian Qin, are you sure
you want to do this?

424
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,160
You haven't...

425
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,120
Say no more.

426
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,390
I'm aware of the chaos
she is capable of making.

427
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,910
Oh gosh.

428
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,630
Are you alright?

429
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,830
Are you hurt?

430
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,670
No, I'm fine.

431
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,200
Let me.

432
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,430
Don't, don't.

433
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,080
You might burn yourself, hold on.

434
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,720
Have you forgotten?

435
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,430
I made you some fried eggs last time.

436
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,120
Oh right.

437
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,120
This is so embarrassing.

438
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,360
I told you that I'm
here to take care of you.

439
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,670
I ended up making a mess.

440
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,310
Keep in mind that

441
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,710
I didn't date you just because

442
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,030
I'm looking for someone
to take care of me.

443
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:26,960
[The scenario is for story purposes.
Please don't try this at home.]

444
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,840
Let me take care of you in future.

445
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,600
Let's go grab something to eat.

446
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,910
Come on.

447
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,760
Let's go.

448
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,910
Sorry, sorry.

449
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,430
Sorry.

450
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,200
He's so handsome.

451
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,370
Such a small face.

452
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,590
-Such a pity.
-Yeah.

453
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,570
-Wonder what happened.
-Wu Yan.

454
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,200
Hurry up and let me kiss you.

455
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,140
I'm going to put a label on you,

456
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,990
you're Sang Wu Yan's personal belongings.

457
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,970
What was with those people just now?

458
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,910
Nothing.

459
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,720
[Right,]

460
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,170
[you've never seen your own face.]

461
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,910
Let's go.

462
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,800
Aren't you going to teach
me how to play the piano?

463
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,880
Let's start now.

464
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,360
You can't even sing in tune

465
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,880
or read music,

466
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,030
and you want to learn
how to play the piano?

467
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
As long as you have perseverance,

468
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,160
I'm sure I can learn it.

469
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,530
It's you who want to learn the piano, 
why do I need perseverance?

470
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,500
Because I certainly
won't have persistence,

471
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,310
so I'll need to count
on a tyrant like you.

472
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,060
You're calling me a tyrant,

473
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,220
despite you need my help.

474
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,560
Let's go.

475
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,320
My hair.

476
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,040
What time is it?

477
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,480
Is Xiao Man's After Work Music 
going on air soon?

478
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,670
What's the matter?

479
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,239
I think my watch stopped.

480
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,000
Let me see.

481
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,070
It's 6:30p.m..

482
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,530
We missed it.

483
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,110
We'll listen next time.

484
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,040
Su Nian Qin,

485
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,280
how do you feel when you hear the song

486
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,200
♫ Rain falls on the eaves ♫

487
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,360
you composed being aired?

488
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,240
♫ The swallows return to the house ♫

489
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,720
I feel nothing.

490
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,120
What a ruthless guy.

491
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,840
♫ By the Zhuque Bridge ♫

492
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,000
You're so cold to yourself.

493
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,920
♫ The boat has gone far away ♫

494
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,830
What'd you expect?

495
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,390
What feelings do you think I should have?

496
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,000
♫ Years of parting ♫

497
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,080
The fulfillment of your song

498
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,920
♫ When will we see each other again ♫

499
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,920
♫ I wonder under the umbrella ♫

500
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,520
being heard by one more person.

501
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,710
For me,

502
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,560
♫ In the Wuyi Lane ♫

503
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,190
after writing the song I want to write

504
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,640
♫ The dusk is light ♫

505
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,760
and sent it out,

506
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,560
what I want to say has already
been expressed in the song.

507
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,120
♫ Tea smoke floating
in the small pavilion ♫

508
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,040
Whether they can hear or understand it,

509
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,140
♫ Strumming the strings ♫

510
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,910
that's not my concern.

511
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,000
♫ Looking back ♫

512
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,390
Stop lying to yourself.

513
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,680
♫ The butterfly dances ♫

514
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,190
If that's the case,

515
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,280
why did give your
song to others to sing it?

516
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,120
♫ Dreams emerge ♫

517
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,600
You could've just written it like diary

518
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,720
♫ Old images ♫

519
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,240
and kept it to yourself.

520
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,680
♫ I wake up at a loss of words ♫

521
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,040
You let others sing it

522
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,800
because you want someone
else to hear it, isn't it?

523
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,080
♫ Morning breeze and the lingering moon  ♫

524
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
It's just to make ends meet.

525
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,000
♫ Flower petals fall ♫

526
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,910
Xiao Lu is the one who sold it.

527
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,280
In this case,

528
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,280
♫ Drawing the face of someone ♫

529
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
you'd better compose more songs.

530
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,480
♫ Linger on my fingertips ♫

531
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,800
Because I can eat a lot.

532
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,720
♫ Hearing the cuckoo on the stream ♫

533
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,000
♫ The story is poignant ♫

534
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,080
♫ Summer cicadas and winter snow ♫

535
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,770
♫ Engraved in the past ♫

536
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,520
♫ Countless fates ♫

537
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,080
♫ Letters have turned yellow ♫

538
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,320
Copy that.

539
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,760
♫ Another year goes by ♫

540
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,040
♫ The willow leaves wait for the wind ♫

541
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
Why are you being so serious?

542
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,520
What?

543
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,430
Xi.

544
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,040
You want to buy a watch as a gift?

545
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,000
It's not that easy to
find that watch of his.

546
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,280
Have you asked Xiao Lu about it?

547
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,800
I don't want to let them know.

548
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,720
Xi, can you...

549
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,040
I'll keep it to myself.

550
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,910
Thank you, Xi.

551
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,430
Mr. Su,

552
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,480
I'm here to learn the piano with you.

553
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,520
And this is my tuition fee.

554
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,760
Su Nian Qin, from this second on,

555
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,520
your time begins anew.

556
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,320
You have to be good-tempered,

557
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,520
try your best to live well,

558
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,040
and be nice to yourself.

559
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,520
Because this is the only way

560
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,520
you can love me everlastingly.

561
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,920
So corny.

562
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,480
The word like everlastingly,

563
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,000
no one uses it in lyrics anymore.

564
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,670
I don't care, that's how I want it.

565
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,480
[Are you still at work?]

566
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,000
[We're still in the studio.]

567
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,320
[Yes.]

568
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,480
Aren't you guys going off work?

569
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,520
If you want to leave, you can leave first.

570
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
Our leaders are still here.

571
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,720
If they are still here,

572
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,630
subordinates like us
wouldn't dare to leave.

573
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,520
That's like showing them
we're not working hard.

574
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
What are you doing here?

575
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,670
I thought I've texted you that

576
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,150
our practice ended?

577
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,040
My battery died.

578
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,800
Sorry.

579
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,320
I've wasted everyone's time.

580
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,240
It's fine.

581
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,720
You must be really busy today.

582
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,280
I don't know

583
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,150
what I'm doing all day today.

584
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,470
It's like I have entered

585
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,240
into a totally different world.

586
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,320
But it's also like

587
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,630
that world is the real world.

588
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,040
I'm sorry.

589
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,040
I've messed them up.

590
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,760
It's fine, but it'd be nice

591
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,120
if you could remember to

592
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,040
put them back in their places.

593
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,200
I got it.

594
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,710
I just thought that this photo frame

595
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,250
would look better on this side,

596
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,520
that's why I put it here.

597
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,280
I've been meaning to ask you,

598
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
who are the people in this photo?

599
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,150
Are they your relatives?

600
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
What do you mean?

601
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,520
What people?

602
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,830
I'm talking about the
photo frame you're holding.

603
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,000
How do the people in the photo look like?

604
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,760
It's just an old photo.

605
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,520
There are four people.

606
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,040
It looks like a family photo.

607
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,960
This girl here looks like Xiao Lu.

608
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,320
Standing next to her
is a girl with long hair,

609
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,630
they were holding hands.

610
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,280
Is the background a glass wall?

611
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,800
Yes.

612
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,350
Did I say something wrong?

613
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,510
No.

614
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,760
It's nothing. Thank you.

615
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,000
Did you guys have a fight?

616
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
The photo frame.

617
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,430
Miss me?

618
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,630
Stop signaling to each other.

619
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,070
What is this?

620
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,950
This...

621
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,320
A decorative painting?

622
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,800
You actually told me
it's a decorative painting?

623
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,870
Nian Qin, please listen to me.

624
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,320
How long has it been here?

625
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,630
Tell me.

626
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,280
You actually told me that

627
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,280
it's just a simple decorative painting.

628
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,910
What do you mean by this?

629
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,520
Are you trying to tell people
that I have a lovely family?

630
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,630
You are well aware of

631
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,830
the things I hate

632
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,070
and certain people I hate.

633
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,840
And you just blatantly put it

634
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,320
right under my nose.

635
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,280
You think because I'm blind,

636
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,390
I can easily be fooled?
