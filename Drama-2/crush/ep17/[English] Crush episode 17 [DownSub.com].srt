Thank you.

It's only been a few months.

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,000
Why do I feel that you've grown taller?

8

It's been more than just a few months.

9
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,030
The last time we met each other
was more than six months ago.

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,640
Mr Su, you almost forgot about me,
haven't you?

11
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,470
I was a little occupied at work.

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,720
What about Ms Sang?

13
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,829
You told me she's busy with work.

14
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,920
She's never visited me since then.

15
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,030
Is she never free?

16
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,920
Ms Sang is also very busy.

17
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,030
Please don't blame her.

18
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,390
I miss Ms Sang so much.

19
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,720
I really miss her too.

20
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,079
Mr Su, when you told me the story,

21
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,590
you said that
Ms Sang recorded the story for you.

22
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,800
Will you let me listen to it?

23
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,710
No.

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,829
It's only for me.

25
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,950

Excuse me.

will be held in an hour.

regarding Toro's case,

44
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,240
did our boss tell you anything?

45
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,560
Does he plan to name you

Do you want me to go out

While she's confused, I have to act fast.

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Otherwise, she might run away again.

Do you know that Wei Hao
plans to propose to Xu Qian?

144
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,240
It's not confirmed at the moment

145

but it'll eventually become true.

146
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Why are you standing here?

147
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,350
Are you going to propose to me?

148
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,590
I haven't come out with the plan.

149
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,700
You're a typical science student.
Don't bother.

150
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,640
Since my grandma is here,

151
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,400
just admit that you want to marry me.

152
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,430
Yes.

153
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,430
Okay, I'll marry you.

See?

155
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,040
I told you I could make it happen.

How disgusting.

159
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,400
No couple on earth is innocent.

00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,520
Eat more.

Look at you, your chin is so sharp.

166

She never puts on weight in the face.
Her chin has always been that sharp.

167

Xu Qian, how do you like the dishes?

168
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,430
All the dishes that you ordered
are delicious.

169
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,910
You'll have to address us
as mum and dad soon, right?

170
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,280
Mr and Mrs Wei,

171
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,560
I think there is something

172
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,080
I need to explain to you.

173
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,080
Although it's a little soon

174
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,710
for Wei Hao and I to get married,

175
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,400
and it appears to be a hasty decision,

176
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,750
I've thought it through.

177
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,830
I know full well that

178
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,520
marriage binds two families.

179
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Therefore,

180
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,990
I think I need to be honest
about my family background.

181
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Wei Hao has told us about it.

182
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,230
We understand the whole situation.

183
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,910
You must've endured a lot

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,040
since your childhood,

185
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,720
haven't you?

186
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,400
After listening to Wei Hao,

187
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,600
I admire you more.

188
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
If I were you,

189
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,870
I wouldn't achieve
what you have achieved for sure.

190
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,000
It's okay.

191
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,270
Thank you, Mrs Wei.

192
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,040
There's no need for thanks.
Family takes care of family.

193
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,950
I think your husband is almost ready.

194
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,880
I'll go get him.

195
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,760
Sure.

196
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,470
What did I say?

197
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,760
I knew that
you could handle Mr and Mrs Wei well.

198
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,670
It's because they're really nice to me.

199
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,080
Were you looking for this?

200
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,920
You left it behind
when you're getting changed.

201
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Hence, I kept it for you.

202
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,950
I can't believe that

203
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,030
I'm looking at Sang Wu Yan

204
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,960
who used to leave things behind.

205
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,590
Why do you look so beautiful

206
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,550
in a wedding gown?

207
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,120
You're so beautiful.

208
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,150
Wu Yan, I always think that

209
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,840
you're so much luckier than me.

210
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,640
You know about my family.

211
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,150
Since I was young,

212
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,240
I always had to work so hard.

213
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,840
I always had to curry favour
with people around me.

214
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,120
To be honest,

215
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,720
I envy you.

216
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,400
Why did you say that?

217
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,320
Wei Hao makes me understand that

218
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,870
I must not think that way.

219
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,830
Everyone

220
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,310
has their own life and happy moments.

221
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,080
I shouldn't compare my weaknesses
with others all the time..

222
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,310
I just have to grasp my own.

223
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,670
Now, I got it.

224
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm very happy now.

225
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,400
All the best to you too.

226
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,160
I bet the groom is getting impatient now.

Of course I have to be there.

375

how did you study for
the postgraduate entrance examination?

382
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,200

384

385

Do you mind helping me with the revision?

387
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,390
Last year, I failed English

388
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,200

392

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,910
[Can you even consider yourself a man?]

556
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,350
[She has made it clear.]

557
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,110
[She doesn't want to see you again.]

558
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,070
Boss, do you want to switch on the lights?

559
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,070
Just switch the lights on
if you need them.

560
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,430
I think we should switch on the lights.
It's warmer that way.

561
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,630
[It's the warmth.]

562
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,760
[Sunlight]

563
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,760
[is not all about brightness.]

564
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,870
[Warmth is very important too.]

565
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,390
The collaboration with Toro

566
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,760
moves on smoothly.

567
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,670
The agreement is drafted.

568
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,520
You'll need to make a trip
to Toro's office tomorrow morning

569
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,000
for a meeting
with their senior administrators.

570
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,200
Also,

571
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,800
the branch office manager

572
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,520
hopes that you can
pay the employees a visit.

573
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,630
Ms Yu called.

574
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,240
She hopes that you could return her call

575
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,430
when you're free.

576
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,390
Boss.

577
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,830
Are you done?

578
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,210
That's all.

579
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,240
What else do you need?

580
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,390
Bring me

581
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,800
the agreement that we're
going to discuss with Toro tomorrow.

582
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,560
As for the trip to the branch office,

583
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,390
make arrangements for it.

584
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,560
All right, got it.

585
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,800
What is the phone number?

586
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,000
It's 101.

587
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,560
Do you need anything?

588
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,200
I need a bottle of liquor.

589
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,590
Ms Yu said that

590
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,960
your eyes...

591
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,390
[If reading
is taking a toll on your eyes,]

592
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,000
[just let someone read it for you.]

593
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,200
[If you need to note it down,]

594
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,350
[then just jot it down.]

595
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,720
Please send me a bottle of whiskey.

596
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,040
[Chinese privet and Ilex
are not the same thing.]

597
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,550
[What is this?]

598
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,560
[It's aloe vera.]

599
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,920
[Here.]

600
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,920
[These are eyebrows. They're messy.]

601
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,800
[That's because
I don't take care of them.]

602
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,760
[These are eyes.]

603
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,720
[These are eyelashes.]

604
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,560
[Eyelashes are thick.]

605
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,560
[My eyes always get teary]

606
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,560
[but I have good eyesight.]

607
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,800
[Su Nian Qin,]

608
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,520
[I don't want to see you again
for the rest of my life.]

609
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,640
Wu Yan.

610
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,910
Wu Yan.

611
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,600
Wu Yan?

612
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
[Tongcheng University
Autism Research Centre]

613
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,480
Madam, based on our analysis,

614
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,390
Xiao Jie has autism,

615
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,590
but there are no problems
with his intellect.

616
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,000
He might even have some hidden talents.

617
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,000
The autism that you mentioned...

618
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,280
Is it a serious illness?

619
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,670
We're from the countryside.

620
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,720
I don't think we can afford the treatment.

621
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,200
Don't worry.

622
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,800
We'll figure it out.

623
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,960
Please take a look at the agreement.

624
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,150
What does it mean?

625
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,070
It means with the consent
of the guardian,

626
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,680
we'll give him basic support

627
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,320
and treatment.

628
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,560
So if I sign the agreement,

629
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,920
you will give him treatment?

630
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,200
Is that right?

631
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,070
To put it simply, yes.

632
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,240
However, if you have any concerns...

633
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,480
Patients with severe autism
require lots of support,

634
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,320
whether in terms
of language or socialising skills.

635
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,040
I think you have conducted
preliminary examination.

636
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,240
You may take a look at the details.

637
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,960
Wu Yan, I need to remind you.

638
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,280
Treating him will be a tough battle.

639
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,070
You need to be mentally prepared.

640
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,870
We mustn't take in a patient

641
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,070
on impulse

642
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,000
and give up later on.

643
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,150
Some people do it just
for their thesis writing purposes.

644
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,150
In the end, they will be left unattended.

645
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,560
We can't do that.

646
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,310
I got it.

647
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,560
Don't worry.

648
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,460
[Toro]

649
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,560
Dismiss.

650
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,910
Nian Qin.

651
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,390
This is Ms Peng, the former owner of Toro.

652
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,480
Ms Peng, how may I help you?

653
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,630
Just call me Dan Qi.

654
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,590
You don't have to be so polite.

655
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,200
We were busy attending
the meeting just now.

656
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,040
I forgot to exchange name cards with you.

657
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,240
I'm sorry.

658
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,480
I gave the last name card

659
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,430
to someone else yesterday.

660
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,960
It's okay.

661
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,870
Nian Qin, I heard that this is
the first time you're in Tongcheng.

662
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,760
Do you want me to show you around?

663
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,790
Thank you for the offer, Ms Peng.

664
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,150
However, I have a tight schedule today.

665
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,560
I'm sorry.

666
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,390
Let me be the host tonight.

667
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,310
I'll buy you a welcome dinner.

668
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,070
You should have time for dinner, right?

669
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,430
Thank you for the invitation, Ms Peng.

670
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,390
I want to get changed.

671
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,390
Her perfume has tainted my suit.

672
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,280
Okay.

673
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,560
Thank you.

674
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,040
What are you looking for?

675
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,070
Where is the MP3 player
that I always have with me?

676
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,040
Did you leave it in the hotel?

677
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,360
Go back to the hotel now.

678
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,960
What about the dinner with Ms Peng?

679
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,160
I'll skip it.
