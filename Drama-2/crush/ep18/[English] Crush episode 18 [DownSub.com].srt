00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,760
was a luxury.

188
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,780
Do you mind me asking, Mr Wu?

189
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,620
What do you do?

190
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,820
I'm a lawyer.

191
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,820
Then this is no longer a luxury to you.

192
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,280
He is...

193
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,390
Autism.

194
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,230
I have heard of it.

195
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,740
His condition

196
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,350
seems better than most autistic kids.

197
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,140
It becomes worse if treatment
is not sought earlier.

198
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,230
He is born with it.

199
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,510
Generally,

200
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,860
there is no cure.

201
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,330
Is this condition hereditary?

202
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,140
It is not proven medically.

203
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,780
The biggest probability is maybe
getting infected with some disease

204
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,310
during the fetal period.

205
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,140
Poor kid.

206
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,060
He had no choice but to accept it.

207
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,740
Can he hear us talking?

208
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,340
He can hear some of it.

209
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,300
But autism

210
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,950
helps him automatically block out

211
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,820
all the external messages
that he doesn't like.

212
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,310
I'm sorry, Mr Wu.

213
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,980
He is not used to physical contact
with strangers.

214
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,260
He will have a meltdown.

215
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,230
I'm really sorry.

216
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,540
Here you go.

217
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,420
Thanks.

218
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,660
I was a stranger to him initially.

219
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,070
He needs time to accept someone.

220
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,950
It might take a really long time.

221
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,540
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,310
It's fine after you get used to it.

223
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,820
That is a Polley watch.

224
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,900
You like collecting watches too?

225
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,100
My previous client

226
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,870
loves collecting these watches too.

227
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,180
The first time I saw it,
I found it quite unique.

228
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,310
What did you say this is?

229
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,510
Polley.

230
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,220
You can't buy the authentic watch here.

231
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,070
I heard its entirely crafted by hand.

232
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,410
Buyers have to pre-order it.

233
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,990
Made to order?

234
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,590
I'm not exactly sure.

235
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
Anyhow, it's really expensive.

236
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,880
Like jewellery,

237
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,160
its value can appreciate too.

238
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,400
I bought this on Taobao.

239
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,900
It cost me a few hundred yuan.

240
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,830
I bought it

241
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,260
because I like the design.

242
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
Maybe it really looks authentic.

243
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,470
Mr Su.

244
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,390
Wait for Qin.

245
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,590
He went up to retrieve my document.

246
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,470
Okay, Mr Su.

247
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,140
Mr Su.

249

I'm not sure if you remember me.

250
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,390
I do.

251
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,060
I work at Toro.

252
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,780
I saw you in our company a few days ago.

253
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,030
I didn't say hi because
there were too many people.

254
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,990
In the past few years,
life didn't go well for Wu Yan.

255
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,510
Did you know that?

256
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,070
[I know.]

257
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,070
[I know it all.]

258
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,390
Ms Wu Yan, you are here.

259
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,660
Something came up at home.
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

[Tongcheng Music Broadcast]

261
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,220
No worries.
When I was late,

262
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,780
didn't you help take over too?

263
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,310
I'm returning the favour.

264
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,670
Is this the script?

265
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,150
You go.

266
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,910
Sun.

267
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,300
Do you know of any good radio show?

268
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,710
Let's listen to it.

269
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,040
Lately, there is a

270
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,650
nice talk show at this hour.

271
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,780
After the internship ends,

272
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,700
[he returned the book to me]

273
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,620
with a card inside

274
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,840
that says,

275
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,840
"I have actually fallen for you
a long time ago."

276
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,350
When reading the letter
from this listener,

277
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,070
I can't help feeling a sense of

278
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,260
regret.

279
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,600
[Hence,]

280
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,810
never feel like you don't deserve love.

281
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,130
Just say it out loud.

[To quote my personal motto,]

but what if the other party is blind?"

285
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,260
Go to a nearby KFC Restaurant.

286
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,460
I'm hungry.

287
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,670
Yes, Mr Su.

288
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,980
Look at the way you eat.

289
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,510
What an expensive item!

290
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,700
One day when we
can't afford to pay for food,

291
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,710
I'll sell it to the pawn shop.

living with a sleazy woman

293
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,740
like you?

294
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,750
What can I do about it?

295
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,990
You kept following me around

296
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,270
like you can't live without me.

297
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,540
Do you think

298
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,740
I should return this to him?

299
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,980
It feels awkward for me

300
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,980
to keep such a luxurious item.

301
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,040
Then just go.

302
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,990
You now have a reason to see him.

303
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,780
I didn't say I want to see him.

304
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,030
I just...

305
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,390
Wu Yan. Do you still love him?

306
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,510
I don't know.

307
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,620
Why do you keep his card
if you don't know?

308
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,970
I saw you put it

309
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,460
into your pocket.

310
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,940
I didn't.

311
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,630
-You did.
-I didn't.

312
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,190
It's in that pocket.

313
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,790
Take it out. Quick.

314
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,150
Why don't you reconsider it?

315
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,470
Any surgery has its risk.

316
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,680
What if there are after-effects?

317
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,910
Don't worry.

318
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,860
This surgery is like extracting a tooth.

319
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,910
Technology is very advanced nowadays.

320
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,820
But extraction...

321
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,880
People die from tooth extractions too.

322
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,670
You really have nothing
good to say, don't you?

323
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,790
Wu Yan. Let's make a bet.

324
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,270
If I survive the surgery,

325
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,980
you go talk to Su Nian Qin.

326
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,860
How about that?

327
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,690
You...

328
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,750
I will definitely lose.

329
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,670
Didn't you say this is a minor surgery?

330
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,670
Even if you wanted to lose,

331
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,150
the doctor won't let you.

332
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,030
Nobody knows for sure.

333
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,910
Didn't you say

334
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,460
people die from tooth extraction too?

335
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,350
I really mean it.

336
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,110
You two should talk it out.

337
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,940
Talk about what?

338
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,180
Anything.

339
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,550
Talk about your feelings at that time,

340
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,870
or talk about the present.

341
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,860
If you really want to
put everything behind

342
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,140
and cut ties completely,

343
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,830
you really have to talk it out.

344
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,550
Give that relationship a proper closure.

345
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,470
It helps you to let go too.

346
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,310
The nurse has called our number.

347
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,740
Go.

348
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,060
Go, quick.

349
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,130
I'll take the bet.
Now go.

350
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,310
I'll take the bet.

351
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,620
What bet were you talking about?

352
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,310
Nothing.

353
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,950
She wanted me to talk to Su Nian Qin.

354
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,790
My wife and me

355
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,340
are really at our wit's end
when it comes to

356
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,570
your bumpy relationship.

357
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,030
What?

358
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,060
I met that brat at my company
the other day.

359
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,100
I told him.

360
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,310
"You became a CEO overnight,

361
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,820
but do you know how difficult

362
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,100
Wu Yan's life is the past few years?"

363
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,980
You...

364
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,100
Why did you tell him that?

365
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,220
I...

366
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,780
I thought he should know.

367
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,030
Wu Yan. I know you have your pride.

368
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,790
But this is not about pride.

369
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,310
That was totally uncalled for.

370
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,790
Who doesn't have a hard life?

371
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,260
Everyone just push on no matter what.

372
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,100
Moreover, we are not
in a relationship any more.

373
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,750
Why did you tell him that?

374
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,750
Are you trying to make him feel guilty

375
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,950
or feel sorry for me?

376
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,860
I don't need that and I don't want that.

377
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,310
I'm sorry. I didn't think that...

378
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,190
It's okay.

379
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,260
I know you are trying to help me.

380
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,660
Thanks.

381
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,620
Wu Yan.

382
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,150
I... I'm here.

383
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,030
What's wrong?

384
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,910
Don't forget what you promised me.

385
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,550
What are you doing?

386
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,700
I want to feel what it is like
to be blind.

387
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,950
Don't help me.

388
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,460
You are really smart.

389
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,860
You even got yourself a white cane.

390
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,060
That famous saying is really true.

391
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,830
Being blind for an hour is not difficult,

392
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,500
being blind for your whole life is.

393
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,670
I never heard of that saying.

394
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,860
Honestly.

395
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,310
You didn't close it after taking things.

396
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,500
Don't blame me.

397
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,460
What is it now?

398
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,790
I just feel that

399
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,980
I had all these bad habits.

400
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,860
I definitely caused him a lot of troubles.

401
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,950
Thinking of your Young Master Su again?

402
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,060
Mumbling to yourself here

403
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,500
won't help anything.

404
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,310
I asked you to get back together but you
said there's no old flame to begin with.

405
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,430
Now look at you.

406
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,460
You are obviously stuck

407
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,950
and not moving on.

408
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,180
It's not like I don't want to move on.

409
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,030
I went for blind dates, didn't I?

410
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,670
I met new people

411
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,670
and I'm sure I want to get married.

412
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,980
But I kept recalling

413
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,030
that first time we met,

414
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,950
the lights and the smell of the lake.

415
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,320
My singing was off tune.

416
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,630
He gave me that look.

417
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,220
I remember everything so clearly.

418
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,030
I asked myself over and over again.

419
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,430
Why is this?

420
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,910
I'm a forgetful person who

421
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,740
lost her things all the time.
But why do I remember all that?

422
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,460
I came to realise later that

423
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,180
there are a lot of things
which can't be expressed

424
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,580
or forget.

425
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,340
If I can't forget, I'll just let it be.

426
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,460
I'll just live with the memories.

427
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,950
It's no big deal.

428
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,910
I understand how you feel.

429
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,950
But I really want to know.

430
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,360
Do you think in the past three years,
Su Nian Qin

431
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,800
was doing better than you?

432
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,150
I just feel that sometimes

433
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,670
you can't always stand
from your point of view

434
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,750
when you consider things.

435
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,980
You are only choreographing

436
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,260
your own story.

437
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,910
When you lost your dad,

438
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,930
Su Nian Qin's dad was
on the verge of death too.

439
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,190
His life was hanging by a thread.

440
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,340
He may look arrogant.

441
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,580
But didn't we analyse that

442
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,860
he actually

443
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,070
lacks a sense of security?

444
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,340
At that time,

445
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,530
you left after lashing it out on him.

446
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,030
How do you think he felt?

447
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,000
Eight, nine, nine.

448
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,390
[Hello?]

449
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,260
Hi, I'm Sang Wu Yan.

450
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,710
I'm looking for Su Nian Qin.

451
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,030
[Ms Sang, Mr Su is in a meeting.]

452
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,000
[May I know the reason you called?]

453
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,100
I want to meet him today.

454
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,420
Is it possible?

455
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,120
[No problem.]

456
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,810
[But when you are here, I think you might]

457
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,020
[need to wait.]

458
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,070
That's fine with me.

459
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,640
Okay.

460
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,770
I will text you the hotel address

461
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,050
and room number.

462
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,930
Okay, thanks.

463
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,760
-You must be Ms Sang.
-Yes.

464
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,730
Come in.

465
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,980
Thanks.

466
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,430
Market share for the new product

467
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,480
can't fully rely on advertising.

468
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,950
You are aware of the company's
yearly expenditure on advertising,

469
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,380
don't you?

470
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,540
Ms Sang.

471
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,350
Please wait.

472
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,820
I will inform Mr Su.

473
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,690
No, no.

474
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,150
Let them continue. I'm not in a hurry.

475
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,880
We can't afford to repeat history

476
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,860
and spend too much time
on communication channel.

477
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,100
Please take a seat at the study room.

478
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,310
I'll get you some tea.

479
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,050
Okay, thanks.

480
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,030
Thanks.

481
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,100
Alright. That's all for today.

482
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,310
Thank you for your hard work.

483
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,100
Why don't Mr Su treat us to lunch?

484
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,880
Thank you, Mr Su.

485
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
-Thank you in advance, Mr Su.
-Thank you in advance, Mr Su.

486
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,770
Alright. Pick any restaurant.

487
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,190
Report to me immediately
if something comes up.

488
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,590
-Get me my jacket.
-Okay.

489
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,500
Mr Su.

490
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,930
There's a Ms Sang waiting for you.

491
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,890
What did you say?

492
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,560
I haven't heard from her.
She is probably still waiting.

493
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,960
She fell asleep.

494
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,620
You take the team to the restaurant.

495
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,670
Give me a call when everything is ready.

496
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,700
Okay.

497
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,960
Wu Yan.

498
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,840
Nian Qin.

00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,310
Hello. Where are you now?

531
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,150
That proposal was really good.

532
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,490
-Right.
-We can wrap it up soon.

533
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,380
Try this.

534
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,910
Mr Su.

535
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,860
Did Ms Sang leave?

536
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,430
She's still sleeping.

537
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,150
I didn't wake her up.

538
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,600
Get her

539
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,660
something to eat later.

540
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,500
Ask the kitchen for something light.

541
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,670
Okay.

542
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,980
What is it, Mr Su?

543
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,860
Where is my watch?

544
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,430
Weren't you wearing it?

545
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,310
No.

546
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,310
I left it beside the basin.

547
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,490
I'll look for it.

548
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,440
Mr Su, I found it.

549
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,610
[Are you here to return the watch]

550
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,300
[and cut all ties with me?]

551
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,360
This watch...

552
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,310
What happened?

553
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,740
I don't know.

554
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,030
I took the wrong one.

555
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,400
Why has the watch I gave him

556
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,350
become so worn-out?

557
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,600
You not only didn't get to talk,

558
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,420
you even took back a worn-out watch.

559
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,870
The most valuable treasure of our home

560
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,220
is gone because of you.

561
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,460
Hello?

562
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,650
[It's just a watch.]

563
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,150
[Do you have to be so happy?]

564
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,990
Hello?

565
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,310
I'm Su Nian Qin.

566
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,100
Hi.

567
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,810
My secretary told me
you were here to look for me.

568
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,190
Yes.

569
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,790
What is it about?

570
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,070
I...

571
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,910
What is it?

572
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,660
When are you inviting me
to your wedding?

573
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,640
You can't wait
for me to get married?

574
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,510
[No, no.]

575
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,480
How could I wish that
you marry someone else?

576
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,700
Have you eaten?

577
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,930
Yes.

578
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,410
No, wait. I haven't.

579
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,420
Have you or have you not?

580
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,590
I have but I don't feel full.

581
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,510
He probably thinks

582
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,620
you have gone mad

583
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,900
after not seeing you for so many years.

584
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,420
Why don't you know if
you have eaten or not?

585
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,310
Do you want to eat out tonight?

586
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,260
I have not eaten anything.

587
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,430
Sure.

588
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,740
This is really spicy.

589
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,460
I picked this restaurant

590
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,110
so I can watch you eat this.

591
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,030
You...

592
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,030
I'm only doing this for you.

593
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,980
Nobody would be crazy enough
to have hotpot for supper.

594
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,180
Don't you feel this place is noisy?

595
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,900
I'm used to it, thanks to your trainings.

596
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,850
Why did you grow your hair?
Doesn't it trouble you?

597
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,070
I... I was in a hurry

598
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,350
so I forgot my hairband.

599
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,870
You were in a hurry?

600
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,230
Aren't you eating?

601
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,260
You didn't train me to eat spicy food.

602
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:38,940
Thanks.

603
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:58,830
Well...

604
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,390
I... I understand.

605
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,510
After breaking up,

606
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,070
it might be hard to just be friends.

607
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,080
But,

608
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,900
I hope our relationship
will not be so awkward.

609
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,780
When we broke up,

610
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,490
I was probably too impulsive.

611
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,500
I said a lot of things

612
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,970
that hurt you.

613
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,750
So,

614
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,590
if you still feel offended,

615
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,870
I apologise.

616
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,790
I accept.

617
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,630
I accept

618
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,230
your apology.
