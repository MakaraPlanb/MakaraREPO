00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
there's nothing to be afraid of.

190
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,070
If she's like what you described,

191
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,760
how did she manage to join the company?

192
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,710
If she's able to join,

193
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,430
maybe there is a way for her to stay on.

194
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,640
I'm completely clueless.

195
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,360
She was appointed to submit the proposal,

196
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,910
that's really strange.

197
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,470
This is a great opportunity to showcase

198
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,160
your skills in front of the boss.

199
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,220
Exactly.

200
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,830
I asked team leader about the headcount.

201
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,880
He said there's a budget slash this year.

202
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,780
The headcount is uncertain.

203
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,400
Okay.

204
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,790
Good. See you then.

205
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,870
Thanks, Xiao Lu.

206
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,520
Bye.

207
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,710
Face reader?

208
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,280
So? What did she say?

209
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,760
Is it

210
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,790
negative feedback for our music?

211
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,840
Xiao Lu said,

212
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,990
Galaxy Records

213
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,920
may be interested to sign us.

214
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,910
There's an audition next Wednesday.

215
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,040
What did he say?

216
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,720
That means

217
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,110
our dream might be coming true.

218
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,870
We'll become a professional band.

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
We'll be able to make money through music.

220
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,400
That means

221
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,840
I may not need to go to work anymore.

222
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,880
What a surprise!

223
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,920
Once-in-a-lifetime!

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm becoming a singer soon.

225
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,030
We are singers!

226
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,630
What am I?

227
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,840
We are singers now!

228
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,350
You came just at the right time.

229
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,600
I have good news.

230
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,600
Galaxy Records just called us.

231
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,890
We are going for an audition.

232
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,430
I won’t be joining.

233
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,650
Keep it up, guys!

234
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,600
What's wrong, girl?

235
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,160
Are you leaving the band?

236
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,320
An audition with a big company

237
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,480
is definitely about singing commercially.

238
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,430
I need to work regularly.

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,550
I can’t be a singer like you all.

240
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
So...

241
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,680
Why must you work in such a way?

242
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,990
What is stopping you?

243
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,710
Let them talk to each other first.

244
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,160
No, Xu Qian.

245
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,440
You're thinking too far ahead.

246
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,600
Just stay present.

247
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,030
Let's go for the audition first.

248
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,720
We will talk about the outcome later.

249
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,200
I have a roadshow proposal at that time.

250
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,680
After all,

251
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,590
it's not about the time-clash.

252
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,400
-It's that we...
-That's not a big deal at all.

253
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,490
I'll speak to Xiao Lu again.

254
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,160
Just reschedule the audition will do.

255
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,510
Wei Hao.

256
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,110
Why can't you look just a step forward?

257
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,270
Think about this.

258
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,470
If we pass the audition,

259
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,710
and they want to sign a contract with us,

260
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,790
I can't proceed.

261
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,280
Won't that end in disbandment too?

262
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,160
I enjoyed singing with you all.

263
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,880
I really want to perform with you

264
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,480
during the graduation party.

265
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,880
But,

266
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,790
hobbies and livelihood,

267
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,730
they are basically two different things.

268
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,320
It's true.

269
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,680
I reiterate what i said earlier.

270
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,340
We are about to graduate.

271
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,740
It's time to be wake up

272
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,310
and plan for the future.

273
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,839
What are you doing?

274
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,480
Xiao Lu has asked someone to fix it.

275
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,120
It’s mine now.

276
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,120
Isn’t it nice?

277
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,950
It's too big for you.

278
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,910
Women wearing men watches is a trend now.

279
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,000
It's cool.

280
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,030
As long as you like it.

281
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,110
Isn't this your apology gift?

282
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,510
Of course I have to accept it.

283
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,700
[Mother]

284
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,950
Hello.

285
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,200
Your mother called?

286
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,680
I checked my phone.

287
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
My mother's call was answered.

288
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,720
You took the call?

289
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,510
What did she say?

290
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,510
Nothing much.

291
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,200
She was asking about

292
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,480
your dissertation defence.

293
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,440
Wu Yan.

294
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,000
Is there anything

295
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,840
you wish to tell me?

296
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,270
I don't think so.

297
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,560
Oh, yes.

298
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
When I played on
your precious piano earlier,

299
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,980
I was getting impatient

300
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,820
and kicked it twice.

301
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,550
-What?
-I was so scared.

302
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,480
But then I thought,

303
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,430
surely this precious piano

304
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
can't be more important than me, right?

305
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Wu Yan.

306
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,120
I don't think

307
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,360
I've asked you this before.

308
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,320
Are you really

309
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,030
not bothered by my blindness?

310
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,840
I envy you instead.

311
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
You have a pair of eyes

312
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,960
that are pure, pristine, untainted

313
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,600
by the unavoidable things out there.

314
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,240
I really like your eyes.

315
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,110
Nian Qin.

316
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,910
I don’t think I've asked you this.

317
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,910
Why do you want to be a songwriter?

318
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,030
Haven't you guessed it long time ago?

319
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,200
Is that so?

320
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,360
Although I can't see the world,

321
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,360
but I want all people to notice me.

322
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,840
without knowing who I am.

323
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,900
Come to think of it,

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,080
it is also a kind of revenge.

325
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,120
Liar.

326
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,600
You don't have the heart to do it.

327
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,790
What?

328
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,000
Nothing.

329
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,080
I think such revenge

330
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,790
is really cool.

331
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,550
Let me practice now.

332
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,360
Wu Yan.

333
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,360
Wait a minute.

334
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,700
Rhythm will be wrong if you play this way.

335
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,640
Haven't I taught you before?

336
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,620
Place your fingers like holding an egg.

337
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,870
Wait a minute.

338
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,360
Let's not pick this up.

339
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,080
For ordinary people,

340
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,430
how long does it take to master a song?

341
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,660
Everyone has different skills.

342
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,710
Some may take three years,

343
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,720
some may accomplish it in just a few days

344
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,200
What about me?

345
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,760
It's hard to tell.

346
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,760
Then I don't want to learn any more.

347
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,800
Mainly because you seem

348
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
to be in pain to teach.

349
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,430
It's nothing compared
to your pain of learning.

350
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,480
I want to showcase to students

351
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,200
in my last class

352
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,270
and bid farewell in elegance.

353
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,600
Well, they don't have the chance now.

354
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,440
Today

355
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,270
is my last class.

356
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,320
Of course,

357
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,360
I'll still go for the outing tomorrow.

358
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,100
I'll be back frequently to see you.

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,390
Thank you very much.

360
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,270
I thoroughly enjoyed

361
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
spending time with all of you.

362
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,760
Thank you for
helping me grow a great deal.

363
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,840
Thank you.

364
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,720
All rise.

365
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,480
Thank you, Miss Sang.

366
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,550
You don't seem to be in bad mood.

367
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,430
-I thought...
-It's not a permanent goodbye.

368
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm joining them
for the outing tomorrow.

369
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,120
What about Xiao Lu?
Hasn't she arrived yet?

370
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,600
She is busy with something.

371
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,930
Oh, I see.

372
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,600
Let's take a taxi home.

373
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,720
Wu Yan.

374
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,430
I'm thinking

375
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,150
maybe we can take the bus?

376
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,320
You want to

377
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
take the bus with me?

378
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,310
It's boring to take a bus.

379
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,960
Let's loiter together.

380
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,120
This is how my parents fell in love.

381
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,290
-Are you humming, Su Nian Qin?
-No.

382
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,510
Obviously you did. I heard it.

383
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,990
You sing very well.

384
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,550
You're pitch is perfect.

385
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,120
Because I never learned to be out of tune.

386
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,510
Then you can sing
your own composition.

387
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,720
No.

388
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,600
Will you sing for me?

389
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,150
No.

390
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,790
Sing for me, please.

391
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,680
No.

392
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,360
Just sing.

393
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,360
I worry that you wouldn't
even order delivery when you're busy.

394
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,430
So I brought it for you.

395
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,150
Now I'm relieved.

396
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,480
I'd better get going.

397
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,030
I still hope you'll attend tomorrow.

398
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,880
I will wait for you.

399
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,510
Don’t wait any more, just start.

400
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,840
No.

401
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,910
Wei Hao, I understand what you think,

402
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,750
but we can start first

403
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,510
-while waiting for Xu Qian.
-I said no.

404
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,880
She is not here.

405
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,830
Our band is incomplete.

406
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,430
Don't force him.

407
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,960
What's the use of arguing?

408
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,270
Up to you then.

409
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,560
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,620
Please wait for a little longer.

411
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,340
[Wei Hao: We're here waiting for you]

412
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,080
Xu Qian.

413
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,000
It's our turn.

414
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,590
Line up, students.

415
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,270
Come this way.

416
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,150
Watch your steps.

417
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,910
Come, line up properly.

418
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,110
One, two, one, come over.

419
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,210
Follow my pace and walk forward.

420
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,150
Line up properly.

421
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,360
Do you smell the scent of grass?

422
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,670
What about the sound of the lake?

423
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,230
The feeling of wind blowing in the face?

424
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,420
Sun ray on the face?

425
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,720
What's wrong?

426
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,240
Nothing.

427
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,120
I'm just thinking,

428
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,450
wouldn't it be great if I'm not enjoying

429
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,080
this beautiful scenery alone.

430
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,390
Let's have our meal first.

431
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,480
Xiao Lu has left,

432
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,750
but we are still here.

433
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,840
It's awkward.

434
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,360
It's my fault.

435
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,760
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,240
You all leave first.

437
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,540
I'll wait for her.

438
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,790
Sure.

439
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,030
Just continue what you're doing.

440
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,200
I'll excuse myself first.

441
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,480
Don't be in such a hurry.

442
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,390
Wei Hao.

443
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,080
Whatever happened between you and Xu Qian,

444
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,960
that's your own business.

445
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,760
We are not in the position to comment.

446
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,240
But, this time round,

447
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,030
you've hurt your buddies.

448
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,240
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

449
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,960
You go back first,

450
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,790
I've to look for something at the park.

451
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,840
Mr Lee.

452
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,150
Could you bring them back first?

453
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,800
I need to search for my lost item here.

454
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,840
Sorry for troubling you.

455
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,240
-Wu Yan.
-Wu Yan.

456
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,480
Xiao Wei.

457
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,880
Go back with Mr Lee and the rest.

458
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,240
I'll visit you when I'm free.

459
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,580
Okay.

460
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,440
Mr Lee.

461
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,440
Mr Su.

462
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,870
I'm sorry.

463
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,230
Could you help me look after Xiao Wei?

464
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,360
I have to look for her.

465
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,600
Alright.

466
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,030
Hey lady.

467
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,320
What are you doing here?

468
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,110
Hello.

469
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,870
May i ask

470
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,560
if there is loss and found corner
in this park?

471
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,720
I lost something.

472
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,910
I just came from the management office.

473
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,860
We did not receive

474
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,240
any lost item today.

475
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,630
Is there any other place

476
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,760
I could look for it?

477
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,450
I may have dropped it on the floor.

478
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,870
It's possible that the cleaner
swept it off unintentionally.

479
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,960
Why don't you
check it out at the recycle corner.

480
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,150
The garbage today

481
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,480
is still around.

482
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,480
Is it?

483
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,600
Thank you.

484
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,000
-Garbage
-Wu Yan.

485
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,550
Why are you here?

486
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,670
How could you ask me to leave by myself?

487
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,150
I'm looking for something urgently.

488
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,870
It takes time to locate it.

489
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,550
Then you should let me stay by your side.

490
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,170
Why do you always make me worry?

491
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,560
Just wait for me here, okay?

492
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,390
I will be back soon. Please wait for me.

493
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,840
Hey...

494
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,510
Where is it?

495
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,910
Where did it go?

496
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,080
Haven't I told you not to come over?

497
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,720
You're a clean freak.

498
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,790
Why are you here?

499
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,300
Why are you disobedient?

500
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,310
Stop searching.

501
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,080
What is so important?

502
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,200
Can't we just buy a new one?

503
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,310
There's no way to get a replacement.

504
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,500
It's the audiobook I made for you.

505
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,370
You mentioned earlier

506
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,310
about that interesting movie.

507
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,320
I saw my colleague

508
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,990
reading the book by chance.

509
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,190
I was thinking

510
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,790
to record it for you.

511
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,120
I've almost finished it.

512
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,390
Now it's gone.

513
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,150
I found it.

514
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,620
Thank goodness. Everything is intact.

515
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,800
Give it to me.

516
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,080
Wait, it's a little dirty.

517
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,430
I'm saying,

518
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
give me your hand.

519
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,560
You...

520
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,880
After that,

521
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,000
kiss in between his eyebrows.

522
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,320
It ends here.

523
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,720
Speaking of this,

524
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,750
I was in the studio,

525
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,510
there was an ad hoc program to handle.

526
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,920
That's why I missed out the last bit.

527
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,080
Wait for me.

528
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,610
I found it.

529
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,680
"I can feel the snowflakes

530
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,080
melting between my lips

531
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,960
and his warm skin,

532
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,790
in a gradual manner."

533
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,520
"I took a deep breath,

534
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,719
then I told Tiffany,

535
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,040
I believe

536
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,040
I need you too."

537
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,040
Judging from your look,

538
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,760
seems you haven't figured it out.

539
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,870
Let me explain it to you.

540
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,170
In fact, at this moment,

541
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,090
The male protagonist is saying,

542
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,719
"I love you."

543
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,350
I love you not because I need you.

544
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,389
I love you, therefore I need you.

545
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,560
Got it?

546
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,429
It seems you'll never figure this out.

547
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,880
Close your eyes.

548
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,050
♫ I want to see ♫

549
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,110

♫ You're also my deepest secret ♫

560
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,680
You all went to
the music company

561
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,000
Xiao Lu introduced?

562
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,320
Xu Qian did not show up after all?

563
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,050
In fact it's not really a surprise.

564
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,000
Stop staring.

565
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,960
Even she could tell
that Xu Qian made up her mind.

566
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,820
Okay.

567
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,660
That's the story.

568
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,520
That's how it is.

569
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,350
What are you implying?

570
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,040
Are we disbanding?

571
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,430
Watch your words.

572
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,040
Why not

573
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,310
let me ask Xiao Lu again.

574
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,140
Let's see if she could give
a second chance.

575
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,230
Forget it.

576
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,290
There's no point
without the lead vocalist.

577
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,070
Brother, get real.

578
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,200
If you really want the band to persist,

579
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,630
be decisive and get a new lead vocalist.

580
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,260
What are you doing here?

581
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,200
There you are. Have a seat.

582
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,650
Quick.

583
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,680
Look.

584
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,450
I've ordered your favourite dishes.

585
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,750
These are not my favourite food.

586
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,230
Only you think they are.

587
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,670
How could you talk like this?

588
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,560
You are graduating soon.

589
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,040
As I'm not able to attend the ceremony,

590
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,760
I thought to rush over
and have a meal with you.

591
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,660
Why are you being ungrateful?

592
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,750
Ungrateful?

593
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,070
Have I ever said
you are welcome to my graduation?

594
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,720
Have I demanded you to dine with me?

595
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,150
Just leave.

596
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,280
What are you up to?

597
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,160
You!

598
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,520
Forget it.

599
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,830
Please leave.

600
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,670
And don't come back.

601
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,830
Xu Qian!

602
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,830
Why would a person like you

603
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,830
be a mother?

604
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,520
Why?

605
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,780
Please take note that musical therapy

606
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,740
is ineffective in the short term.

607
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,760
Within a short duration,

608
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,150
musical therapy is unable to provide

609
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,350
psycho-transformative space for patients.

610
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,450
Therefore,

611
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,680
musical therapy
requires long-term treatment,

612
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,200
in order to achieve the expected outcome.

613
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,230
That's it?

614
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,160
How was it?

615
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,630
I have a question.

616
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,030
Your thesis

617
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,040
seems meaningful and well done.

618
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,920
Why don't you

619
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,200
further pursue this?

620
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,270
Undergraduate studies

621
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,960
only touches the surface.

622
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,390
There's still a long way to go

623
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,040
to conduct the actual research.

624
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,670
To join the radio station is my dream.

625
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,130
Then why are you

626
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,060
enrolled in Psychology in the first place?

627
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,390
This is because

628
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,680
I felt obliged to meet

629
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,670
my parents' expectation.

630
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,780
Think about it.

631
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,310
They have put in a lot of effort

632
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,150
to raise me up to 18 years old.

633
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,640
They nurtured my learning wholeheartedly.

634
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,040
At least I must return their favour.

635
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,230
To me, majoring in Psychology

636
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,560
is not that difficult.

637
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,310
Although it's not really my cup of tea,

638
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,840
but I don't dislike it either.

639
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,670
Things are not easy for my parents.

640
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,290
They may seem decent

641
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,720
on the outside,

642
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,180
But I could tell that

643
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,390
in order to give me a good life,

644
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,570
they work so hard all these years.

645
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,270
It has not been easy.

646
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,280
By obtaining my degree in psychology,

647
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,550
At least this makes them feel relieved.

648
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,280
Even if I don't like it,
it's only four years.

649
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,200
Compared with what they've been through,

650
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,480
It's actually nothing.

651
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
What's wrong?

652
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,560
I can't say for sure.

653
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,830
I just feel

654
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,310
a little envious about you
and your parents,

655
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,110
the mutual understanding.

656
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,150
I suddenly realized that...

657
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,690
you are not that childish after all.

658
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,040
I'm childish?

659
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,670
How dare you call me childish?

660
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,960
If I was childish,

661
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
I wouldn't have won you over

662
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,840
with my major in psychology.

663
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,530
Oh yes, Nian Qin.

664
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,430
I'll be quite occupied during graduation.

665
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,660
I'll move to Cheng Yin's place.

666
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,070
It's nearer and easier for me.

667
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,950
Is that fine?

668
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,630
Deal.

669
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,680
Remember to attend my graduation ceremony.

670
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,610
Don't have to dress up or anything.

671
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,680
Just wash your face and come over.

672
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,100
Okay, be a nice boy.

673
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,870
Play the piano and take your meals.

674
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,960
Be obedient.

675
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,860
That's all.

676
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,000
I've finished my thesis presentation.

677
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,590
Your advice is most welcome
and appreciated.

678
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,550
Thank you.

679
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,470
Next.

680
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,820
Sang Wu Yan.

681
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:42,020
[Psychology Theses, Donghu University]

682
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,040
Good day, lecturers.

683
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,440
The topic of my thesis is

684
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,760
The Orff therapy towards the

685
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,450
practical research on autistic children.

686
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,520
The Orff therapy

687
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,000
is based on Orff's music

688
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,720
and its target respondents.

689
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,490
It was invented by German musicians,

690
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,960
Gertrud, Carol and Iemgard

691
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
after a long-term research.

692
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,960
Orff music education approach,

693
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,790
is the world's most famous,

694
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,280
most influential system.

695
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,350
You're still keen

696
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,290
to look at our original composition?

697
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,320
I've spoken to Mr Lee.

698
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,680
He felt that your original music

699
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,150
is very unique.

700
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,870
If being a signed artist doesn't work out,

701
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,240
we can still consider
other forms of collaboration.

702
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,680
Plus, Xu Qian came to me.

703
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,960
She explained what happened that day.

704
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,150
In fact, I do understand your situation.

705
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,020
Xu Qian?

706
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,200
She went to meet you?

707
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,240
She came and apologized to me.

708
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,120
There's nothing to be sorry about.

709
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,800
I could tell that

710
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,180
she came over after a long deliberation.

711
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,110
Are both of you still on good terms?

712
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:08,930
Wu Yan.

713
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,760
I bought the tomatoes you told me earlier.

714
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,960
Let's cook...

715
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,870
What's wrong with you?

716
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,040
There's nothing to be surprised about.

717
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,630
I fried an egg for Wu Yan before.

718
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,630
What?

719
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,590
You're really...

720
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Xiao Lu.

721
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,350
Before this,

722
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,430
was I really immature?

723
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,980
Why are you suddenly asking this?

724
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,320
Nothing.

725
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,630
Let me do it.

726
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,110
It's fine.

727
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,110
I'm the one who takes care of Wu Yan.

728
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,680
Where is Wu Yan?
She moved to Cheng Yin's place.

729
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,860
You should relax.

730
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,810
She is busy with school matters

731
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,430
Staying nearer makes things easier.
