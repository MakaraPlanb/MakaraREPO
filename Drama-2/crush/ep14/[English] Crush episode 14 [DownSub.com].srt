[Emergency]

5
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,670
Dad.

6
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,360
Stop moving.

7
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,000
You're back.

8
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,360
Your mum told me.

9
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,360
No.

10
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry, Dad.

11
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,190
I didn't know that you're sick.

12
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,630
Silly girl.

13
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,550
You don't have to apologise.

14
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,750
I'm fine.

15
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,470
I heard from mum that 
you have a boyfriend now.

16
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,670
When will you introduce him to me?

17
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,670
Dad.

18
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,110
Did mum tell you

19
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,960
that my boyfriend

20
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,880
is visually impairment?

21
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,150
Moreover, he comes 
from a complicated family.

22
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,610
Do you love him?

23
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,950
I...

24
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,520
That's the only thing that matters.

25
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,070
Nothing else matters.

26
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,550
I know my daughter well.

27
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,510
You insist

28
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,480
to do something you like 
but not something you're good in.

29
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,640
You want to love

30
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,000
but not to be loved.

31
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,720
I

32
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,320
will support all of your decisions.

33
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,040
But you...

34
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
you have to promise me

35
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,040
to take care of yourself.

36
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
I don't ask for anything else.

37
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,920
Mum.

38
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,430
Mum.

39
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,270
Go back now.

40
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,550
I'll take care of him.

41
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,000
You should take a rest.

42
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
You're just a child. What do you know?

43
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,200
-I...
-Take your luggage and go home now.

44
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm no longer a child.

45
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
I've grown up.

46
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I can do my part.

47
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,070
I can take care of Dad.

48
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,120
Furthermore, I'm part of this family.

49
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,200
Your dad needs to be turned 
every two hours.

50
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,500
Do you know how to do that?

51
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,970
Also,

52
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,390
he needs intravenous drip every night
and it usually ends at 3 a.m.

53
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,110
You have to inform the nurse 
when it's done.

54
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,670
Can you promise that you won't doze off?

55
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,950
Also,

56
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,760
there's a urinal under the bed.

57
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,230
Do you know how to use it?

58
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,270
Furthermore, you're a lady.

59
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,110
It's not convenient for you to do it.

60
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,180
Whether you can take care of him

61
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,110
is not your call.

62
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,320
Go home.

63
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,920
Your main mission

64
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,440
is just to pay your dad a visit.

65
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
It's to make him happy 
and to keep him motivated.

66
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,150
Let me make it clear.

67
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,230
If I were the one who's lying in the bed,

68
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,510
it wouldn't matter to me if you're back.

69
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,200
You may go anywhere you want.

70
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,670
People raise children for their old age.

71
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,060
Your dad and I have pension.

72
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,510
We don't have to rely on you.

73
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,350
Just make sure that 
you can sustain yourself.

74
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,640
Mum!

75
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,790
I don't have the time for argument.

76
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,320
I don't want your dad 
to overhear our conversation.

77
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,440
I've said what I'm supposed to say.

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,130
If I talk too much,

79
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
you'll complain that 
I'm interrupting your life.

80
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,640
Fine.

81
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,110
I need to tell you something.

82
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,390
After the surgery,

83
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,000
your dad was transferred to ICU.

84
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,950
The moment he woke up,

85
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,040
he asked about you.

86
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
He asked where you were.

87
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,310
He blamed me

88
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,760
for scolding you.

89
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,510
Wu Yan, think about it.

90
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,700
Your dad was not feeling well.

91
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,760
He almost lost his life.

92
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,570
What about you?

93
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,040
Your love life is everything.

94
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,440
Your dream is everything.

95
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,920
I don't get it.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
Is your parents' love

97
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,720
worth nothing?

98
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,390
Is it really a matter of course?

99
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,080
Here's your new phone.

100
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,760
You should give Wu Yan a call.

101
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,080
Her dad fell sick.

102
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,200
You should know it.

103
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,150
No parents would use illness as an excuse

104
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,400
to trick their children to go home.

105
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Nian Qin.

106
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,070
To be honest,

107
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,940
you're unschooled in the way of the world.

108
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,640
I...

109
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
Xiao Lu.

110
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,740
Actually, I received a phone call
from Wu Yan's mum.

111
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,990
Her mum said

112
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,310
they oppose our relationship.

113
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,520
For me,

114
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,510
Wu Yan has turned against them.

115
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
I know I'm a selfish person.

116
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,780
In the past,

117
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,660
I didn't think that it was wrong.

118
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,470
If I don't think for myself,

119
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,600
can I expect someone else
to think for me?

120
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,740
She doesn't want me to know about it.

121
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,570
So, I pretend not to know.

122
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,400
I even proposed to her.

123
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,520
However...

124
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,940
Now...

125
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,490
I don't know what to do.

126
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,680
If you don't give it a try,

127
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,840
how would you know that 
you won't be accepted?

128
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,220
[Emergency]

129
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,720
Here you are.

130
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,470
Look at Hao.

131
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,470
He's here early in the morning
to pay your dad a visit.

132
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,980
If you ask me,

133
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,790
Wei Hao is lovelier.

134
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,890
Wei Hao just told me

135
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,350
he's in a relationship

136
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,150
with your high school friend, Xu Qian.

137
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,300
Like I said earlier,

138
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
she's so lucky.

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,080
That's why she found a guy like Wei Hao,

140
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,590
who is caring

141
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,080
and responsible.

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,790
Mum.

143
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,650
What's wrong?

144
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,110
Was I wrong?

145
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,150
Why are you here?

146
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,590
My parents told me.

147
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,710
Your dad fell sick.

148
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,910
Of course I have to pay him a visit.

149
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,710
Thanks.

150
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,550
Why are you so polite with me?

151
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,540
I'm not chasing you away.

152
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,920
Aren't you looking

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,870
to work with another record company?

154
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,350
Don't delay your work because of me.

155
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,590
Actually, I'm hesitating.

156
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
I kind of want to stay in the hometown.

157
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,200
Xu Qian's grandma is not in good health.

158
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,440
Someone has to take care of her.

159
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,760
You've become more mature.

160
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm serious.

161
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,400
I plan to propose to her one year later.

162
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,320
I wonder if we can come home together 
when the time comes.

163
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,350
Why must it be one year later?

164
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,070
I need to save up for the wedding.

165
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,950
I have to be financially independent.

166
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,440
I mustnâ€™t mistreat her.

167
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,320
Xu Qian can sustain her own life.

168
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,250
You're right.

169
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,880
All right, you may go home now.

170
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,000
Sure.

171
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,960
What are you doing?

172
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,740
Shouldn't I bid goodbye to them
before I go?

173
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,760
You're a grown up now.

174
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,080
You should know better.

175
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,440
Mrs Sang, I'm leaving.

176
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,080
One day soon, I'll pay you guys a visit
together with my girlfriend.

177
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,430
Why are you leaving so soon?

178
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,680
Hold on.

179
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,670
Let me send you off.

180
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,950
Mum, I can send him off.

181
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,250
Bye, Mrs Sang.

182
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,550
All right, let me send you off.

183
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,880
It's okay, just stay here.

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,630
I'm going back to Xiamen.

185
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,760
Call me if anything.

186
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,840
What's wrong?

187
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
Did you chase him away?

188
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,640
I... I didn't do that.

189
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,440
I can't keep him here forever, can I?

190
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,200
Even so,

191
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,780
you shouldn't chase him away.

192
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,440
He's here to pay your dad a visit

193
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
and he brought so many things.

194
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,390
I feel bad for that.

195
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,410
I planned to let him

196
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,550
take some of them back.

197
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,560
Mum, don't do that.

198
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,950
He has a girlfriend.

199
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,860
Why do you still try to be close with him?

200
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,040
What's wrong?

201
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
If it weren't for you,

202
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,320
he might have become my son-in-law.

203
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,210
He's such a nice kid.

204
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Compared to Su...

205
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,040
What's his name again?

206
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,430
He's obviously better.

207
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,070
Will you stop comparing?

208
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,710
What is there to compare?

209
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,800
Su Nian Qin is great.

210
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,470
He's the best.

211
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,790
Why are you shouting?

212
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,580
Keep quiet.

213
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,960
You claim that he's great in every aspect.

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
You also claim that he loves you.

215
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,230
Something big happened in our family.

216
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,110
However, he didn't come

217
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,590
and pay your dad a visit.

218
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,790
He's too busy.

219
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,230
As you know,

220
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,840
it's not convenient for him to come here.

221
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,670
Please be understanding.

222
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,000
You're considerate of him.

223
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,280
But I don't get it.

224
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,930
Your dad and I

225
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,050
raised you up with love.

226
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,620
Did we do that so that 
you can be considerate to someone else?

227
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,830
Sure.

228
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,870
You think for him.

229
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,550
What about him?

230
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,540
[Missed calls]

231
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,380
[Wu Yan]

232
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,290
Su Nian Qin.

233
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,290
Come with me!

234
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,320
You must come with me.

235
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,470
Your dad is dying.

236
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,110
You have to meet him one last time.

237
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
Nian Qin, this way.

238
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,400
Do CPR.

239
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,530
We're ready.

240
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,980
Get ready emergency injection.

241
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,870
Okay.

242
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,040
Dad.

243
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,520
Take a look at this.

244
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,920
My boss really likes my proposal.

245
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,060
She thinks it can bring

246
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,800
the underground bands

247
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,280
some exposure.

248
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,920
That way, more audience will realise

249
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,390
there are many good musics

250
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,620
which have gone unnoticed.

251
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,160
It sounds interesting.

252
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,880
When it's out,

253
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,800
I'll listen to the broadcast every day.

254
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,230
Sure.

255
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
If it's a success,

256
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,860
I'll become a broadcaster.

257
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,160
However, if that happens,

258
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,760
I'll have to stay in Xiamen forever.

259
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Then you'll be...

260
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,190
I overheard the conversation yesterday

261
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
between you and your mum.

262
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't mind your mum.

263
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,880
Her bark is worse than her bite.

264
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,640
In fact, she's thought it through.

265
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,950
She told me,

266
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,400
it's your life after all.

267
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,630
The path that she thinks is right for you

268
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,400
doesn't necessarily mean that it is right.

269
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,190
Moving forward,

270
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,110
if you settle down in Xiamen,

271
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,640
have your own career,

272
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,360
and family,

273
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,710
just make some time

274
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,920
to pay us a visit at times 
with your family.

275
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,520
That's good enough.

276
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,430
What does that mean?

277
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,520
I won't do that.

278
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,920
I'll come home every day to annoy you.

279
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,520
I'll make sure you get annoyed
and chase me away.

280
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,430
Look at you.

281
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,680
No doubt you look arrogant and spoiled,

282
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,550
but since young,

283
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,310
you have never let
your mum and I get worried.

284
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,280
One of the mum's proudest achievements

285
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,190
is that you managed to get into any school

286
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,830
that she wanted you to go.

287
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,640
She's so proud of that.

288
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,280
I spoil you all the time

289
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,880
but when I think back,

290
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,000
I've been focusing on teaching 
all these years.

291
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,680
I have never

292
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,070
talked to you properly.

293
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
You've always been good at school.

294
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,140
You have never gone out of line.

295
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,350
Everything has worked out well.

296
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,750
So, we don't think

297
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,400
you suffer from

298
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,190
any stress

299
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,880
and worry.

300
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,070
That's precisely why

301
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,610
we've neglected something.

302
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,680
I know your feelings.

303
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,280
However, I didn't handle it well.

304
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,920
Don't say that.

305
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,900
I have a big heart.

306
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,030
I have never thought about it.

307
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,620
So you shouldn't worry.

308
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,760
Dad.

309
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,290
Try this.

310
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,690
I picked it for you.

311
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,400
Isn't it sweet?

312
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,600
All right.

313
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,320
I'll adjust it before sending it to you.

314
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,560
Don't worry, Ms Xi.

315
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
Even if I'm not the broadcaster,

316
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll get this show done.

317
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,350
Therefore, I would like to tell you

318
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,920
if I have to stay here

319
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,530

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,360
please take care of the show.

He's in the hospital.

looking for a liver for transplant.

364

His condition was okay not long ago.

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,000

377
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,220
Okay, got it.

378
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,640
I'll be gentle.

379
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,350

But Dad...

382
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,560
Since your dad wants to go back,
you should go back.

383
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,160

I can't.

410
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,070

He's in another ward.

443
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,750
He had a fight with Wu Yan

444
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,560
and that was a huge blow to him.

445
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,480

When your dad gets better,

475
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,450
you should meet with Ms Sang.

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,590

478
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,370
Yes.

479
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,270
I accused her parents

480
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,280
of tricking her to go home 
using sickness as an excuse.

481
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,560
I was wrong.

482
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,170
However, I know it well that

483
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,240
to her family,

484
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm just a burden.

485
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,570
Nian Qin, how could you...

486
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,070
Ms Sang is here.

00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,400
Why are you here?

489
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,430
Ms Xiao Lu said that you refused to eat.

490
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,370
You also ignored everyone.

491
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,400
She told me to check on you.

492
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,160
You're really something.

493
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,840
Why are you so sure that

494
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I'll listen to you?

495
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,820
Why are you laughing?

Must you talk like that?

497
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,720
Let me ask you.

498
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,880
When did my mum call you a burden?

499
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,430
Isn't that your own assumption?

500
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,720
What matters is not your visual impairment

501
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
nor your family background.

502
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,170
Those aren't important at all.

503
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,960
I've never thought

504
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,020
these could be the obstacles 
that stop us from being together.

505
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,340
But...

506
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,880
Do you think you're the only one
who face difficulty?

507
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,880
Do you think you're the only one
who has a temper?

508
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,130
My dad fell sick.

509
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,850
I went back to take care of him.

510
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,199
I was so worried.

511
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,739
I was struggling.

512
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,020
I was exhausted.

513
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,380
However, so many days have passed.

514
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,130
You didn't even give me a call.

515
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,070
It took me 
so much of effort to travel here.

516
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,090

That's why I put up with

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,750
â™« And move on easily â™«

531

â™« When a hug is still â™«

539
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,670
you have taken the moral high ground

and everyone around you. Am I right?

544
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,450
â™« And bet on the uncertain tomorrow â™«

545
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I thought

546
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,520
â™« What's left are lies â™«

00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,450
â™« I'm willing to take the fall â™«

559
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,140
â™« But I can't escape from rising â™«

560
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,560
â™« The hurt along the way
can only be written, not erased â™«

561
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,490
â™« The blue past â™«

562
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,790
â™« Is now covered in snow â™«

563
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,620
â™« How can love melt away? â™«

564
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,320
Mum.

565
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,600
[How is it?]

566
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,120
[Have you reached Xiamen?]

567
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,280
â™« If we had brushed past each other
without looking up â™«

568
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,150
[You went back to see Mr Su, right?]

569
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:29,000
â™« If we hadn't moved beyond friendship â™«

570
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,910
[I thought about it
and I knew I was right.]

571
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:34,900
â™« What we hope for
is an unpredictable gamble â™«

572
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,190
What's wrong?

573
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,890
You went back in a rush.

574
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,940
Did something happen?

575
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,400
â™« A precious chance â™«

576
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,600
Nothing happened. Don't be delusional.

577
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,400
â™« Who is willing to take the fall? â™«

578
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,400
When I talked to him
on the phone that day,

579
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,540
â™« And give up on taking the initiative â™«

580
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,570
I was a bit mean to him.

581
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,360
â™« Spending all the years â™«

582
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,220
Perhaps he has taken it to heart.

583
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,600
â™« For an exchange of apology â™«

584
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,650
[If you see him,]

585
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,290
â™« Is it stubbornness or determination? â™«

586
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,080
[please tell him not to take it to heart.]

587
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,520
Don't say that.

588
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,880
â™« Refuse to listen to people's advice â™«

589
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,780
You're not at fault.

590
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,880
â™« Watching the memories burn in flames â™«

591
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,500
You're not at fault.

592
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,080
[Wu Yan.]

593
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,500
[Wu Yan, what's wrong?]

594
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,960
â™« I'm willing to take the fall â™«

595
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,890
[Why is your voice...]

596
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,890
â™« But I can't escape from rising â™«

597
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,320
If there's nothing else, I've to go.

598
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,960
I need to do something. 
I'll call you back later.

599
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:13,930
â™« The hurt along the way
can only be written, not erased â™«

600
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,850
â™« The blue past â™«

601
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:22,440
â™« Is now covered in snow â™«

602
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,860
â™« How can love melt away? â™«

603
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:32,290
â™« When the final goodbye
and initial feelings â™«

604
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,560
â™« Appear before our eyes â™«

605
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,290
â™« Who is willing to take the fall? â™«

606
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,860
[Patient lift]

607
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,930
â™« And give up on taking the initiative â™«

608
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,720
Wu Yan.

609
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,980
â™« Spending all the years â™«

610
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,910
â™« For an exchange of apology â™«

611
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,110
Wu Yan!

612
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,860
Wu Yan!

613
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,450
â™« Is it stubbornness or determination? â™«

614
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,240
â™« Refuse to listen to people's advice â™«

615
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,140
Nian Qin, what's wrong?

616
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,690
Have you seen Wu Yan?

617
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,460
â™« Watching the memories burn in flames â™«

618
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,780
No.

619
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,740
I want to see her.

620
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,600
I'll look for her.

621
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,990
Just stay here, okay?

622
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,570
â™« I'm willing to take the fall â™«

623
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,560
We've just found a matching liver.

624
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,480
â™« But I can't escape from rising â™«

625
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,350
Your dad will undergo surgery right away.

626
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,890
â™« The hurt along the way
can only be written, not erased â™«

627
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,760
â™« The blue past â™«

628
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,240
â™« Is now covered in snow â™«

629
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,220
â™« How can love melt away? â™«
