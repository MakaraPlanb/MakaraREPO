Were you looking for me?

No.

7
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,920
However, I was waiting for you.

8
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,960
I've fallen sick.

9
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,600
You fell sick because
you were caught in rain?

10
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
You won't get anywhere.

11
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
Sang Wu Yan,
you weren't like this in the past.

12
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,960
Even when I injured my finger, you were...

13
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,760
That's right.

14
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,160
I learned it from you.

15
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,680
Now, my heart is as cold as metal.

16
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,400
So, where is the metal?

By the way, Dad,

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
lately,

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
you made me study psychology.

92
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,280
It's so that

It was Wu Yu.

117
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,920
How are things going on
between you and him?

118
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
My biggest wish

119
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,400
is to see you find a life partner

After your dad's demise,

122
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
I've thought it through.

123
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,280
As long as he cherishes you
and he's able to sustain the family,

124
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,400
everything else doesn't matter.

125
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,240
Mum, you're a career woman.

126
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,160
Why do you keep mentioning

127
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,480
about sustaining a family?

128
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,840
Look. I can make money on my own.

129
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,800
Isn't it great

130
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,640
for me to live like this?

131
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,080
Look for someone
who is a good fit for you.

132
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,400
Isn't it great to be with each other?

133
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,720
Furthermore, Wu is not bad of a guy.

134
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,160
Look, he's handsome
and he has a good job.

135
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
No doubt his family background
is not great,

136
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,720
but those who come from
such families

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,480
usually cherish things better.

138
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,560
He's good tempered

139
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,240
and nice to people.

140
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,800
Be it from the psychological perspective

141
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,440
or the sociological perspectives,

142
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,440
your judgment

143
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,280
is untenable.

144
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,480
Moreover, didn't you just say that

145
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,240
all these aren't important?

146
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,040
Why did you

147
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,040
start listing out the requirements?

148
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Of course I won't let you marry

149
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
someone who would mistreat you.

150
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,120
You're short-tempered.

151
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,520
You should know that.

152
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course I hope that

153
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,760
you can marry
someone with good temperament.

154
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,160
As the elders in the family
are not around,

155
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,920
if two hot-tempered persons
are together,

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,320
they might drive each other up the wall.

157
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,680
[Where are you?]

158
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,040
Look to the right.

159
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,770
Look.

160
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm talking about something serious

161
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,600
but you're not taking it to heart.

162
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,840
Listen.

163
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,880
Your future husband
has to be healthy, okay?

164
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm not looking for a slave.

165
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,880
Otherwise, if he dies early,

166
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,640
you'll be all alone.

167
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,800
All right, Mum.

168
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,740
Let's go shopping.

169
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
Let's go eat and shop.

170
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
I need some new clothes.

171
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,280
No.

172
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,060
The streets are crowded.

173
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
You can go alone.

174
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,920
Come with me.

175
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,960
I'm not going no matter what.

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,880
Let's go.

177
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,720
Miss 007.

178
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Wait for me at school.

179
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,200
How could 007

180
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,560
let his Bond girl

181
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,000
wander around alone?

182
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,720
Why are you leaving in a rush, Miss 007?

183
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,400
My name is Sang Wu Yan.

184
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,520
I've no idea who you're referring to.

185
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Okay.

186
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,720
Where is your fiance?

187
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
He is not my fiance.

188
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,280
Are you throwing hints?

189
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
When a lady

190
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,400
claims that she doesn't have a fiance,

191
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,120
she's actually throwing hints
to the man standing before her.

192
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,840
Why do you...

193
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,230
That's because I'm really interested in

194
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,270
Su Nian Qin's crush.

195
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,800
I would like to know

196
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,360
why he chose you,

197
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,760
but when it comes to
my sister who is as pretty as a fairy,

198
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,000
he doesn't even bother
to throw a glance.

199
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,560
Firstly,

200
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
I refused to be studied.

201
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,440
Furthermore, your behaviour

202
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,160
has caused harassment to me.

203
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,390
Secondly,

204
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,280
nowadays, not everyone looks at
the opposite gender

205
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,180
with the aesthetic sense of animals.

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
For example,

207
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,280
you're quite good looking.

208
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,080
However, I'm very annoyed to see you

209
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
flaunting your tail like a peacock.

210
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,520
I suddenly have a feeling

211
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,520
the possibility that you are his fiance

212
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,880
is slightly higher.

213
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,480
Why?

214
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
Now I get it.

215
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Are you the same kind of person
as Su Nian Qin?

216
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,200
Are you also someone
who keep your own counsel

217
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,760
and come from money?

218
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,440
There is another possibility.

219
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,800
He loves you so much,
he's losing his mind.

220
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,560
I think he likes me.

221
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,680
But I think it's a far cry from love.

222
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
Speaking about losing his mind,

223
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
isn't he crazy all this while?

224
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,650
That's interesting.

225
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,160
Now, I'm more interested in you.

226
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,720
Let's go.
Let me buy you a meal.

227
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,560
Don't drag me.

228
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,160
No.

229
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,680
How can you just leave?
What about that pretty lady?

230
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,430
That's my secretary.

231
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,640
I told her to go back.

232
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,720
Secretary?

233
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,280
As long as someone is pretty,

234
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,840
you tend to claim that
she's your secretary.

235
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,480
Wu Yan.

236
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,560
You can't have double standards.

237
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,400
Just because I hired a pretty lady
as my secretary,

238
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,550
I'm a playboy?

239
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,680
How about Su Nian Qin?

240
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,360
Including my sister,

241
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,240
he's surrounded by so many pretty ladies.

242
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,240
You didn't comment about that.

243
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,240
Will you stop mentioning Su Nian Qin?

244
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,240
Why do you care

245
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,680
about him so much?

246
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,840
Wu Yan.

247
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,880
Are you even jealous of a guy?

248
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,960
Let's go.

249
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,840
I said, stop dragging me!

250
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,840
Watch out!

251
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,360
I've only met you twice but I get myself
in danger every time.

252
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,160
Judging from the situation,

253
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,920
I bet Su Nian Qin

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
is tortured by you to the max.

255
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,220
Don't move.

256
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,990
You need to get treatment at the hospital.

257
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,520
I can do it.

258
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Thank you.

259
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,860
[Toro]

260
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Our collaboration with Toro

261
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,360
is proceeding smoothly.

262
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,160
Thank you

263
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
everyone from the branch office
for the help.

264
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,320
Mr Su.

265
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,720
The headquarters Sales Department
wishes to speak to you.

266
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,720
Tell them I'm in a meeting.

267
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,000
My job at the branch office

268
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,640
is coming to an end.

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,480
As such...

270
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,200
Mr Su.

271
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,800
Ms Peng of Toro is on the phone.

272
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,720
Tell her I'm having a meeting.

273
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,240
I'm going back to the headquarters
on Friday.

274
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Some arrangements...

275
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,680
Mr Su, Mr Peng of Toro...

276
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,520
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

277
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,160
Mr Peng said it's something important.

278
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,960
One Ms Sang
was involved in a road accident.

279
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,880
So, you must go there.

280
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
What?

281
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,360
Keep the wound dry.

282
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,400
Don't forget to come again for dressing.

283
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,330
Thank you.

284
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,200
The battery is flat.

285
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,840
You can't leave yet.

286
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,520
My phone is dead.

287
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,320
I need to charge it.

288
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,640
Your phone is dead?
The timing is just right.

289
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Help me with an experiment.

290
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,860
I just saved your life.

291
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,640
It's not out of line
to do me a favour, right?

292
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,640
What experiment is that?

293
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,600
It's to examine
how fast Su Nian Qin could be

294
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
when it comes to his true love.

295
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,580
I called him using your phone just now

296
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
and informed him that
you were involved in a road accident.

297
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
You!

298
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,640
How could you make such joke?

299
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,400
You look like you're in pain.

300
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm just doing you a favour.

301
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,640
It's for the sake of my sister too.

302
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,560
I hope she can give up early.

303
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,580
I'm not in pain.

304
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,840
Stop finding excuses for your mischief.

305
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,000
You looked as if you're going to
burst in tears when you smiled bitterly.

306
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,920
Do you know that?

307
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,040
Ten minutes.

308
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,410
From his company to the hospital,

309
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,970
it would take about ten minutes.

310
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,960
Ten minutes later,

311
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
you'll know

312
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,440
if Su Nian Qin really cares about you.

313
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,119
I don't need it.

314
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
I don't need to get the answer like this.

315
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,319
Call him

316
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,480
and tell him I'm fine.

317
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,079
If something happens to him

318
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,359
when he's rushing to the hospital,

319
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,880
you'll be doomed.

320
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,839
Don't go!

321
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,840
Are you coming?

322
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,680
Where is Wu Yan?

323
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
What happened to Wu Yan?

324
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,630
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,200
Wu Yan is fine

326
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,120
but she's left.

327
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,840
What?

328
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,280
Well...

329
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,200
I tricked you.

330
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,560
I ran into Wu Yan on the street.

331
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,280
Suddenly, a bicycle came

332
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,400
and knocked into us.

333
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,070
She scrapped her forehead.

334
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,390
It's just an abrasion wound.

335
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,520
I suddenly had the idea

336
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,880
to make good use of the chance

337
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,920
to see if you're indeed a couple.

338
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,160
Good to know that she's fine.

339
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,480
It seems that the experiment is a success.

340
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,880
If Wu Yan were here...

341
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,720
Stop calling her name.

342
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,320
Also,

343
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,560
stay away from her.

344
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,670
Mr Su.

345
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,270
We've been waiting for an hour.

346
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,840
Should we look somewhere else?

347
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,960
[Sorry, the number
you've dialled is not available.]

348
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,960
Look for her along the bus route.

349
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Sure.

350
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,000
[Sorry, the number
you've dialled is not available.]

351
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,340
It's Ms Sang.

352
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,160
Pull over.

353
00:20:48,900 --> 00:21:03,580

354
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,150

355
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,000
Wu Yan.

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,640

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,710
I...

379
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,760
♫ You look up and smile at me ♫

380
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,200
Your forehead...

381
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,030
♫ You say the lyric is a tongue twister ♫

382
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,990
♫ I quench the galaxy ♫

383
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,400
♫ Naturally in the dark ♫

384
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,960
♫ We hug and hold hands ♫

385
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,180
♫ I've never spoken my mind ♫

386
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,460
♫ But since I met you ♫

387
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,260
♫ Everything has changed ♫

388
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,090
♫ Since I met you ♫

389
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,810
♫ The starry sky has been behind us ♫

390
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,660
♫ Ever since I met you ♫

391
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,120
♫ I learned how to love carefreely ♫

392
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,990
If that's the case,

393
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,250
why haven't you surrendered to Mr Su?

394
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,400
If I succumb to him,

395
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
you won't have the chance
to eat this hot and sour fish.

396
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,480
Well, I don't mind to keep him waiting.

397
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,360
By the way,

398
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,160
why are you dilly-dallying?

399
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,280
That's a good question.

400
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,120
I was never a hesitant person.

401
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,400
I guess

402
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,120
I'm at the age
where I'm afraid of losing.

403
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
Su Nian Qin told me that

404
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,240
I used to fall in love
with people very easily

405
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,360
and I drown myself in love.

406
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,800
Was I really that kind of person?

407
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,000
After listening to him, I realised that

408
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,680
I've changed so much
without me knowing.

409
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,560
However, if I've changed so much,

410
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
then why...

411
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
I thought it's because I was young

412
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,520
and it was the first time I fell in love,

413
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,640
that's why I fell in love
with a lunatic like him.

414
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,360
I thought as time passed

415
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,600
and as I've grown up,
I won't make the same mistake.

416
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,480
However...

417
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,320
It's so annoying.

418
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,120
I still like him.

419
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
I can't believe that

420
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,000
I still like him.

421
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,840
Qin.

422
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,240
You may leave now.

423
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,560
She's your real boss, isn't it?

424
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
You may go home now.

425
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,240
Thanks for the hard work.

426
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,200
Okay, let me know if you need anything.

427
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,160
You still haven't won her heart.

428
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,400
I think

429
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,530
you're ageing for nothing.

430
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,560
You must have plenty of time.

431
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,640
That's why you're here
to be sarcastic to me.

432
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,080
I'm just got bored of waiting.

433
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,240
That's why I'm here to offer help.

434
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,520
Nian Qin, don't just pester the girl

435
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,720
without any plan.

436
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,500
Think about it before...

437
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,840
She doesn't love anymore.

438
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Furthermore,
what happened to her dad...

439
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,780
I was too impulsive.

440
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,760
I couldn't control my recklessness
the moment I saw her.

441
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,960
However...

442
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Nian Qin.

443
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,840
Have you ever asked her opinion?

444
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,160
It's been three years.

445
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,110
You should at least talk to her

446
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,240
and ask her about it.

447
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,960
I don't dare to ask.

448
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,320
There is no need to ask.

449
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,800
Regardless of the answer,

450
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,360
I'll still love her.

451
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:47,300
[Library]

452
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,650
Here.

453
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,240
[Haven't I taught you before?]

454
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,160
[When you play piano,]

455
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,960
[pretend that
you're holding an egg in your hand.]

456
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,240
Let's not do this.

457
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,960
How long would it take
for an ordinary person

458
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,360
to master a song?

459
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,040
It's different for everyone.

460
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,240
Some people would take three years

461
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,880
while some people
would only need a few days.

462
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,520
Xiao Jie.

463
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,000
Let me teach you how to play piano, okay?

464
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,480
Here.

465
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,440
Look.

466
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,400
Ms Xiao Lu, you got married?

467
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,440
I got married to
a nerdy university lecturer.

468
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,160
Congratulations.

469
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,640
Let's not talk about me.

470
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,400
I was observing you from the outside.

471
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Don't you think

472
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,680
he is really like Nian Qin?

473
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,600
Be it the behaviour or the expression,

474
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,800
even the appearance is similar too.

475
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,100
Xiao Jie has autism.

476
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,840
Nian Qin had it too when he was young.

477
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,640
I think he's still suffering
from the side effects until now.

478
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,120
Have you met Nian Qin?

479
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,520
You're still in love with him, right?

480
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,920
Yes.

481
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
Then why won't you get back together?

482
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,480
I'm no longer a young girl.

483
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,200
I've changed so much.

484
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,990
I won't be impulsive anymore.

485
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,920
Perhaps we're not meant for each other.

486
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,160
Well, he's indeed
getting more and more impulsive.

487
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,350
Wu Yan.

488
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,200
Do you know on the first night
when Nian Qin reached Tongcheng,

489
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,520
he got drunk?

490
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,000
It's no longer news.

491
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,840
Ever since you left,

492
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,640
he became an alcoholic
for a period of time.

493
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,320
No one could stop him.

494
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,000
At night, he went to bed
while listening to the MP3 player.

495
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,800
The next day, he would behave normally
when he woke up.

496
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,680
Wu Yan.

497
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,280
How many blind dates
have you attended in the past?

498
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,800
I guess it's twice.

499
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,880
No.

500
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,380
Including the time
Nian Qin showed up,

501
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,960
you attended three blind dates.

502
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Didn't you feel anything?

503
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,480
Don't you feel that

504
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,240
no doubt you're struggling
in the past three years,

505
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,360
but everything went your way?

506
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,080
For example,

507
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,080
your dad's office in the university

508
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,320
was preserved for no reason?

509
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,680
Why did the radio station
agree almost immediately

510
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
when you requested
to work the night shift?

511
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,680
Wu Yan has been
attending blind dates lately.

512
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
I guess she plans
to settle down and get married.

513
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,880
[Hello, boss.]

514
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,820
[What's the matter?]

515
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,400
Make some arrangements.

516
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm going to Tongcheng

517
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,200
to liaise with Toro.

518
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,090
[Sure.]

519
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,080
Xiao Lu.

520
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,480
Please get the watch repaired.

521
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,560
Make sure it remains the same.

522
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,910
Okay.

523
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,380
[Su Nian Qin, Sang Wu Yan]

524
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,680
Upon knowing that
you were attending blind dates,

525
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,920
he couldn't take it anymore.

526
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,070
Otherwise, he might continue hiding.

527
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,400
Actually,

528
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,440
he knows everything about you.

529
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,000
However, he didn't have the guts
to appear in front of you.

530
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
It's because of your dad.

531
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,560
He still feels very sorry for that.

532
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,680
Therefore, he thinks that he only deserves
to protect you from far.

533
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,160
He thinks that he shouldn't go near you.

534
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,280
As you know,

535
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,320
Nian Qin has extreme low self-esteem.

536
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,600
He is too afraid to face the fact that

537
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,320
you no longer love him.

538
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,320
That's why he decided to run away.

539
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,720
However, he can't forget you.

540
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,080
For the past three years,

541
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,480
he threw himself
into managing the company.

542
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,760
He wants to get everything in order

543
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,070
to prove to you and your mum

544
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,560
that he is a good fit for you.

545
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,440
It's twisted, isn't it?

546
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,880
However, it shows that

547
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,000
he loves you very much.

548
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
His love is deeper
than what you could imagine.

549
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,520
Of course.

550
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
You may summarise these crazy behaviours

551
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,400
into one word,

552
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
lunatic.

553
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,480
He's a sheer lunatic.

554
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,240
You're an expert.

555
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
He's mental.

556
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,200
Spill the beans.

557
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,560
What's wrong?

558
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,030
You asked me out

559
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,950
but you just let me
watch you drink in silence.

560
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,360
It's not appropriate.

561
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,560
He's so annoying.

562
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,440
He used to be so hard to please
in the past.

563
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,320
But it turns out he's
the most annoying creature on earth.

564
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,240
Why couldn't he be a jerk until the end?

565
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Why must he

566
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,840
pretend to be a faithful lover now?

567
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Now, I don't know what should I do.

568
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,130
What did he do?

569
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,680
Tell me why.

570
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,150
Why does he behave

571
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,750
like a complete different person?

572
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,400
Moreover,
he takes everything upon himself.

573
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,320
It's even harder to handle him now.

574
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,110
I really don't get it.

575
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,120
I really...

576
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,920
Look, the structure of men and women

577
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,199
are indeed

578
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,840
quite different. Am I right?

579
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,880
No, listen.

580
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,560
I told you to talk to him.

581
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,920
Did you talk to each other?

582
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,400
No matter how much he's changed,

583
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,960
your views are the most important.

584
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,520
Do you want to start all over again?

585
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,040
I don't know.

586
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,159
Look at you. You're merely in a dilemma.

587
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,560
Where has the old Sang Wu Yan gone?

588
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,159
If you have anything to say,

589
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,080
just let him know.

590
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,280
Why are you mad at yourself?

591
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,600
You're right.

592
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,560
I'll call him now.

593
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,520
Hey. You only hear what you want to hear.

594
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,480
Hello.

595
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,120
What's wrong, Wu Yan?

596
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,680
Su Nian Qin, you're such a jerk!

597
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,550
Why didn't you lie and say
that you love me?

598
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,910
Why did you keep quiet back then?

599
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
[Why?]

600
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,340
Since we've separated for so long,

601
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,380
why did you come back to me?

602
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,740
Why did you make my heart flutter again?

603
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,340
Su Nian Qin, you're inhumane!

604
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,400
Why did you drink so much?

605
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,960
Is anyone by your side?

606
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,840
No.

607
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,720
I mean,

608
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,680
Xu Qian is here.

609
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,160
Where are you?

610
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,840
Why should I tell you?

611
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,560
Pass your phone to Xu Qian.

612
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,430
Why should I let her talk to you?

613
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,910
Why should I listen to you?

614
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,000
Sang Wu Yan.

615
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,480
Pass the phone to Xu Qian.

616
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,510
Now.

617
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,080
Hello.

618
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,950
Ms Xu.

619
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,440
Please send me the current address.

620
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,760
Besides that,

621
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,440
please take care of Wu Yan

622
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,560
before I reach there.

623
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,000
Okay, got it.

624
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:38,420
[Wu Yan: Address of hot pot restaurant]

625
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,960
Something is not right.

626
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,360
Why do I feel as if I'm his subordinate?

627
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,480
Here.

628
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
How much did you guys drink?

629
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,400
I guess it's about two bottles of beer.

630
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,560
Do you drive?

631
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,760
I can send you back.

632
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,820
It's okay.

633
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,350
My husband will be here soon.

634
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,440
We'll wait for your husband

635
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
before we leave.

636
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,030
It's late.

637
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,270
It's not safe to leave you alone.

638
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
He's here.

639
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,040
I'm leaving.

640
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,560
Ms Xu.

641
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,040
Thank you for taking care of Wu Yan.

642
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,880
I should be held responsible
for this episode.

643
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,200
No, not only for today.

644
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,960
I know that

645
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,360
you've been taking good care of her.

646
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,880
Thank you.

647
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,200
You just deliberately
let him take her away?

648
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,640
If Mrs Sang knew about it, she would...

649
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,560
If you don't tell her,
how would she know?

650
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,800
Let's talk about it when we're home.

651
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,640
No.

652
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,800
Give it to me.

653
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,280
No.

654
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,320
Don't move.

655
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,600
Wu Yan.

656
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,600
Rest early.

657
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,120
Let's continue tomorrow, okay?

658
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,480
Wu Yan.

659
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,700
Give it to me.

660
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,580
No.

661
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,400
If you spill the beer,

662
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,040
you'll feel discomfort
due to the stickiness.

663
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,760
If you break the bottle,

664
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,000
what should I do if you cut yourself?

665
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,720
I won't break it.

666
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,480
All right.

667
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,560
Just hug it.

668
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,730
Sure.

669
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,880
Give me a hug.

670
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Who are you?

671
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,000
Who do you think I am?

672
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,520
How do I know who you are?

673
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,960
But I'm pretty sure that
you're trying to seduce me.

674
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,840
That's right.

675
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm Su Nian Qin.

676
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,290
How is that possible?

677
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,070
No way you're Su Nian Qin.

678
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,400
He wouldn't talk to me like that.

679
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,350
He always shouts at me.

680
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
He would say,

681
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,190
"Sang Wu Yan, shut up."

682
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,600
"Sang Wu Yan,"

683
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
"go away."

684
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
"Sang Wu Yan, don't make noise."

685
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,990
I didn't make noise. I'm not noisy.

686
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:34,970
Wu Yan,

687
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,720
from now on,

688
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,800
I won't throw tantrums at you, okay?

689
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,400
Really?

690
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,990
Yes.

691
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,860
Give me a hug.

692
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,960
Why did you place my shoes
on the coffee table?

693
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,320
In the past, no matter
where I placed your shoes,

694
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,600
you would kick it to the middle

695
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,800
and I ended up tripping.

696
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,320
It's safest
to place your shoes on the table.

697
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,880
Am I so bad?

698
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,040
There is more.

699
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,240
Once,

700
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,480
you forgot to put the kettle
with hot water back to its original spot.

701
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,750
You placed it at the edge of the stove.

702
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,270
I burnt myself because of that.

703
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,280
Is it? I don't remember it anymore.

704
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,230
Just forget it if you don't remember.

705
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,360
It looks longer from here.

706
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,600
Why are your lashes so thick?

707
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,280
Can you

708
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,600
pluck a few lashes of yours

709
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,920
and put it on my eyes?

710
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,280
You can have all of them.

711
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,040
You're smiling.

712
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,240
You...

713
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,440
Stop smiling.

714
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,840
It's really dangerous.

715
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,760
From now on,
you're only allowed to smile at me.

716
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,280
Don't smile when you're out there alone.

717
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,080
Those girls are really dangerous.

718
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,520
Su Nian Qin.

719
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,880
You only belong to me, okay?

720
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,820
I have always
belonged to you and only you.

721
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,320
You're lying.

722
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,760
I've never lied to you.

723
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,000
Ever since you appeared in my life,

724
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,720
I have always belonged to you.

725
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,440
Hold on.

726
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,240
Say that you're mine.

727
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,960
You're mine.

728
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,960
That's right.

729
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,910
No, that's not right.

730
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,360
You said it the other way round.

731
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,430
It seems that you're quite sober.

732
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,040
I won't be shy then.

733
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,710
You haven't said it.

734
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm yours.

735
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
Su Nian Qin belongs to Sang Wu Yan.

736
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,360
Now and forever.

737
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,130
Wu Yan.
