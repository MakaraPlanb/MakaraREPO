00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,180
[Episode 19]

4
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,560
What happened?

5
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,230
It was fine before you went out.

6
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,080
Why are you so angry after returning?

7
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,240
You said I went out to apologize to him,

8
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
to give each other an out.

9
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
He could've just followed it through.

10
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,079
Instead he said things like,

11
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,690
"I accept your apology."

12
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,640
I thought something big happened.

13
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,920
This looks like Young Master Su’s style.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,050
Look at you.

15
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,010
What's wrong with me?

16
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,450
You should rebuke him if you are able to.

17
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,120
When are these small lights installed?

18
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,480
Small lights?

19
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,670
When I first went out to pick you up,

20
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,880
didn't you see it?

21
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,960
Miss Xi.

22
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,710
It's really you.

23
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Why are you here?

24
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,230
Wu Yan.

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,440
I came to Tongcheng County to
do an offline promotion.

26
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,240
So I stopped by the local radio station.

27
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,160
My university classmate works here.

28
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,579
Do you work here too?

29
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,750
When I remembered
this was your hometown,

30
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,030
I just thought

31
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,200
you might be working
in the local radio station.

32
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,780
As soon as I came back,

33
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,040
I worked part-time in this
small radio station.

34
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,530
Three years have passed since then.

35
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,560
I heard that Nian Qin also
came to Tongcheng.

36
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
How are both of you doing?

37
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,650
Nothing happened.

38
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,110
Do you regret it?

39
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,040
You just left like that last time.

40
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,160
I was asked this question three years ago.

41
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,450
I regretted that initially.

42
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,490
But looking back,

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,240
I might have underestimated myself
at that time.

44
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,820
I dare to love and give.

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,760
I am not afraid of losing
if I dare to give.

46
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,250
Not I understand

47
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,320
why someone like Su Nian Qin
who lives in the cloud

48
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
would fall for you.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,360
I will be honest with you.

50
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,100
I embarrassed you at the radio station
with selfish intentions.

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
I regretted it.

52
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,120
However, I found out that

53
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
even if he lost you,

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,760
he wouldn't pay attention to me.

55
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,480
Xi,

56
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,890
who do you think

57
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,780
is the luckier person between
me and you?

58
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,590
I do not regret.

59
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,780
But I did think about it before.

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,480
If I have never met him,

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,640
or maybe,

62
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,580
I have never been with him,

63
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,520
I might not be who I am now.

64
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,910
What if it was me?

65
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,480
I will choose to be you.

66
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,320
After all, you still have a chance.

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,240
Maybe those incidents
were all misunderstandings.

68
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,560
Misunderstandings?

69
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,380
Indeed.

70
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,960
He is indeed someone

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,880
who is easy to be misunderstood.

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,400
This name, Su Nian Qin, is a curse.

73
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,890
Nian Qin, occupied with love.

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,960
Maybe it's his nature.

75
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,350
Do you know

76
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,020
Su Nian Qin is actually someone,

77
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,740
who doesn't like to cheat.

78
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,450
In his opinion,

79
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,780
he won’t commit to what he can’t do.

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,920
If he doesn't know how to answer,

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,159
then he won't answer.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,159
Because he didn't tell me anything about

83
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
his family and his past,

84
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,400
I was angry with him.

85
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,050
But I didn’t understand until later.

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Not mentioning it,

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
is the way he uses the most to escape.

88
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,430
Help me find a quieter place,

89
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
A place that has good food.

90
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,240
I am inviting someone to dinner tonight.

91
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
But boss, you have a meeting
this afternoon.

92
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,240
We are not sure what time it will end.

93
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,800
Then, supper will do.

94
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,400
Right.

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,320
That won't do.

96
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
It's not safe so late at night.

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
Shall we have dinner earlier?

98
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,680
If we come back earlier,

99
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,020
then I can continue with the meeting.

100
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,980
[Wu Yu]

101
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,260
Hello.

102
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,250
[Wu Yan.]

103
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,500
[I am Wu Yu.]

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Mr Wu, hello.

105
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,680
It is like this.

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
I have a friend from Japan.

107
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,160
He brought his kid's picture book.

108
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,120
[I had a look.]

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,680
[I think it would suit Xiao Jie.]

110
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,030
Thank you.

111
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,990
You are thoughtful.

112
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,410
Are you free tonight?

113
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,000
I will pick you up after work.

114
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,470
I will be done around 5:30 p.m.

115
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,470
[Great.]

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,200
Keep up with the white car ahead.

117
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,620
How is it? It is not bad, right?

118
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,030
It is so delicate.

119
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,620
I want it all.

120
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,070
How much does this cost?
I'll transfer the money to you.

121
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,900
No, no.

122
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,910
Then I'll transfer it to you
based on the menu's price.

123
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,730
All right.

124
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,070
The food in this shop tastes very good.

125
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,920
-Try it.
-Okay.

126
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
Thanks.

127
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,830
Please enjoy.

128
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,570
Come.

129
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
This

130
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,380
is too spicy.

131
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,530
Wu Yan,

132
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,690
sometimes I feel that you are

133
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
like a child who hasn't grown up.

134
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,860
Excuse me.

135
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,940
Thanks.

136
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,970
Drink some water.

137
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,390
Is it better now?

138
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,720
Much better.

139
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,340
[Nian Qin]

140
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,370
Hey.

141
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,570
Come out.

142
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,640
Where to?

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,080
Look to your right.

144
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,190
My...

145
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,960
I am eating.

146
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,650
I can see.

147
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,770
Can you stop doing it?

148
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,950
I will give you five seconds.

149
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,800
Otherwise, I will ask the manager
to clear the room immediately.

150
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,000
Including you.

151
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,920
What kind of a joke is this?

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,800
You don't own this place.

153
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,720
Five...

154
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,440
Four...

155
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,520
Three...

156
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,740
I am sorry.

157
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,800
I need to step out.

158
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,440
Where are you?

159
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,290
Su Nian Qin.

160
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,490
Can you stop creating problems, please?

161
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,880
Sang Wu Yan, you are dreaming.

162
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
Unless I die,

163
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,900
otherwise, you can never
be with another man.

164
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,130
We were having a meal together.

165
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,840
What are you doing?

166
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,190
You've been drinking?

167
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,580
You actually drank with another man!

168
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,200
What are you talking about?

169
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,920
Adults eat and drink together.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,160
It's normal, please.

171
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,480
It's the same in my eyes.

172
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,440
Can you be a proper, sensible man?

173
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,160
So now you call me a man?

174
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
So?

175
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,950
Does it have anything to do with this?

176
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,970
You are who you are, I am who I am.

177
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,810
I'm not yours.

178
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,920
There is nothing between us.

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,280
Why should you control me?

180
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Because I'm not like you.

181
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,310
There is no way for me to
fall in love with someone so easily,

182
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,080
let alone forget about it.

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,320
♫ And I leave my past behind ♫

191
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,020
I know what I did is wrong.

192
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,320
♫ I feel like I can hear your breathing ♫

193
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,360
But when I saw you with another man,

194
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,090
♫ And the night turns translucent ♫

195
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,510
I really wanted to beat him up.

196
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,870
I think, looking back

197
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,480
♫ Be it the city or forest ♫

198
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,670
to the first time I saw you,

199
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,020
♫ A gloomy tranquillity ♫

200
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,000
I must've looked fierce too.

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,100
♫ Lost in the midst ♫

202
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,100
♫ I close my eyes ♫

203
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,850
I have always regretted that.

204
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,070
♫ But I see your silhouette ♫

205
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,750
If I had smiled at you then,

206
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,700
♫ Forever shine for me ♫

207
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,040
it would've been best.

208
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,060
♫ Unafraid even when faced
with the unknown future ♫

209
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,360
From all the girls I've met,
you are the one

210
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,720
who cries and laughs the most.

211
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,720
♫ Because you're
the only thing I think about ♫

212
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,380
♫ I only think about you ♫

213
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,150
Every sentence that you said with a smile,

214
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,670
♫ Forever shine for me ♫

215
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,420
I remember it clearly.

216
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,640
♫ Never doubting even when I continue on ♫

217
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,220
Do you know that

218
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,040
♫ Turns out I love you so ♫

219
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,640
you develop a liking to anything easily,

220
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,060
and you will devote all of
your emotions into it.

221
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,680
♫ It is enough to confront ♫

222
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,720
♫ All the loneliness of this world ♫

223
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,100
I am really afraid that

224
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,520
you've fallen for someone else.

225
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:34,110
♫ Forever shine for me ♫

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,160
Let me know at least.

227
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,620
Did you listen to that song?

228
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,750
Do you still hate me?

229
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,290
♫ Walking through the rain
and burning fire ♫

230
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,790
♫ Can you hold me to the end? ♫

231
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,590
♫ Falling into the splendid,
eternal summer ♫

232
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,230
♫ Still unable to see clearly ♫

233
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,300
I heard it.

234
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,100
♫ Be it the city or forest ♫

235
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,880
I have never hated you.

236
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,720
♫ So near yet so far ♫

237
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,790
It's already hard enough to love you.

238
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,080
Why should I hate you?

239
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,680
♫ Waiting for the night ♫

240
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,700
♫ To consume the vulnerable heart ♫

241
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,790
♫ But then I came across you ♫

242
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,290
♫ Forever shine for me ♫

243
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,300
♫ Unafraid even when faced
with the unknown future ♫

244
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,100
♫ Because you're
the only thing I think about ♫

245
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,500
♫ I only think about you ♫

246
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,150
Hey.

247
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,200
[Wu Yan, are you okay?]

248
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,520
I am fine.

249
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,760
Sorry about that.

250
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,200
I left in a hurry.

251
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,490
[Wu Yan.]

252
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,280
[That Mr Su just now,]

253
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,320
was the person who gave you
the watch, right?

254
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,180
How did you know that?

255
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,750
It was easy to guess.

256
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,760
Is it so obvious?

257
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,980
[What did you say?]

258
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,040
Mr Wu, I am sorry.

259
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,550
I don't think I'm suitable to date you.

260
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,660
Wu Yan.

261
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,300
Actually you don't need to be nervous.

262
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,380
We can always be friends.

263
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,430
[It's late today.]

264
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,860
[Rest early.]

265
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,460
[Nian Qin]

266
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,540
[Senior]

267
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Hello, senior.

268
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,720
I'm going back now.

269
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,000
Then I'll come back now.

270
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,360
He said that he is here to see you.

271
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,040
While we tried to comfort Xiao Jie,

272
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,080
he walked straight over to play the piano.

273
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,200
Xiao Jie calmed down slowly

274
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,480
and got attracted by it.

275
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,440
So this is...

276
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,240
An old friend.

277
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,160
Xiao Jie.

278
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,900
How is it?

279
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,920
Did you feel uncomfortable just now?

280
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,569
It's fine.

281
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,839
What did you eat?

282
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
Thank you for today.

283
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
You played the piano
to calm Xiao Jie down.

284
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,190
You're welcome.

285
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,480
Isn't this what you told me before
about...

286
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,040
Orff music therapy?

287
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,150
Thank you anyway.

288
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,600
I will buy you dinner another day.

[Wu Yu]

290
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,390
Hello, Mr Wu.

291
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,760
It's not convenient to speak now.

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
I'll call you another time.

295
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,210
Bye.

296
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,840
Sang Wu Yan.

297
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,040
Why do you still like to simply grab a man

298
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
and say that he's your boyfriend?

299
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,870
He's called Wu Yu?

300
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,620
Why do you always get involved
with men whose surname is Wu?

301
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,540
I...

302
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,380
He just wanted to have a date with you,

303
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,560
but he got used by you.

304
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,440
Won't he feel miserable?

305
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,440
Why does it matter to you?

306
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,290
Yes, it doesn't matter before,

307
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
but it will be soon.

308
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,830
You...

309
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,680
Give it back.

310
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,950
What?

311
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,560
I'm here to get the watch back.

312
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,260
You took it from my room that day.

313
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
I forgot to ask it back from you.

314
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,280
I didn't go there to get the watch.

315
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,280
I just...

316
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,500
It's not...

317
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,470
Could it be that...

318
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,420
after we have not met
for a few years,

319
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
you are so stingy that

320
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,040
you want me to return the watch
that you gave me?

321
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,480
I never thought of
getting this watch back.

322
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,720
I went there that day

323
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,120
because I wanted to return
that watch to you.

324
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,440
After hearing from Wu Yu,

325
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,320
I realised that

326
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,520
the original watch is very valuable.

327
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
In the future,

328
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,000
if I hear that man's name again
from your mouth,

329
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll really beat him up.

330
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,080
Besides,

331
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,170
the watch is for you.

332
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,820
No matter what,

333
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,810
you are not allowed to return it.

334
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,560
I'm sorry to bother you.

335
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,040
Boss.

336
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,840
The dinner is about to start.

337
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,690
We really have to hurry up.

338
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,920
Let's go.

339
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,080
Didn't you say that you want to thank me?

340
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,520
There is no need to wait.

341
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,520
I have a dinner later

342
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,400
but I have no female companion.

343
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,890
I really can't help you with this.

344
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,840
I feel out-of-place when I attend
that kind of events.

345
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,860
I am here.

346
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,280
It is precisely because of you,

347
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760
I will feel even more nervous.

348
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,390
Nervous about what?

349
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,320
I...

350
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,320
What is it?

351
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,510
Maybe...

352
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,580
I better not go in.

353
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,360
No way.

354
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,080
Miss Sang, don't be nervous.

355
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
It is just a small cocktail party.

356
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,880
You don't have to talk.

357
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,040
Just relax.

358
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,370
Just go in for a drink and eat something.

359
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,640
Still, I better not go in.

360
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,760
You have to lead me.

361
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,570
You can see the way.

362
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,490
I am not going.

363
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,010
I...

364
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,470
really can't do this.

365
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,000
Now I'm so nervous, I...

366
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,970
It is a small event, don't panic.

367
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,400
You could break free,

368
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,560
meaning that you are not that nervous.

369
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,480
I... So you're a sprightly

370
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,120
beast with a human face.

371
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,400
If you dare

372
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,520
to run away when I'm not paying attention,

373
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,430
I can do something more beastly.

374
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,360
What?

375
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,480
For example, to secretly kiss your mouth

376
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
in front of everyone.

377
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,650
You have no shame.

378
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,840
Try it.

379
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,120
Qin has something to say.

380
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,200
Boss.

381
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,760
It's Toro's Design Director.

382
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
Where are you going?

383
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
I'm going to the washroom.

384
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,960
Remember what I said.

385
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,760
I promise that I won't run away.

386
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,190
Focus on your business.

387
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,210
I have not seen you for a long time.

388
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,710
Come.

389
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,180
[TC Hotel]

390
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,360
Mr Zhang, I would like to speak to you.

391
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,790
Miss.

392
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,640
You seem like you are enjoying the food.

393
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,090
Have I seen you before?

394
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,720
Is that so?

395
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,740
Are you talking about some new Bond girl?

396
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,240
Anyway, you're intriguing.

397
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,090
May I know your name?

398
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,000
No,

399
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,200
I have no ill intentions.

400
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
I'm afraid I do.

401
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,270
Your outfit is quite special.

402
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,040
Just plain, casual clothes.

403
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,800
I don't know why I am here.

404
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
So did you sneak in?

405
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,110
I came in from the main entrance.

406
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,360
You are the staff then.

407
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,660
You dare to eat here secretly?

408
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
Well, I am

409
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,240
trying to see if it's poisonous, edible

410
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,520
of if it's delicious.

411
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,800
So may I ask, is it poisonous?

412
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,870
You are so lame.

413
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
What to do?

414
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Women now

415
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,840
are so full of motherly love.

416
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,390
They like men who are
obviously lacking love,

417
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,640
the so-called

418
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,110
"cold, handsome man".

419
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,570
The colder he is,

420
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,360
the more that they think they can
warm his heart.

421
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
As for people like me,

422
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,520
perfect and flawless,

423
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,960
we are brushed off.

424
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,940
He came here for work,

425
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,140
unlike you.

426
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,940
Look at you, a professional playboy.

427
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,860
Not professional.

428
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,530
I'm just someone,

429
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,410
who hasn't found his true love yet,

430
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,000
a poor man who is searching miserably.

431
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,730
Actually, I really admire Mr Su.

432
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,230
He left his family before

433
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,590
but he managed to get
to where he is today.

434
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,880
I'm sure it wasn't just relying
on his talents.

435
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,760
He must have suffered a lot too.

436
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,170
Plus, he didn’t have to do that.

437
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,610
Relying on the Su family's
financial resources,

438
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,520
it is enough for him to
splurge for a lifetime.

439
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,640
So I think he did this

440
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
to tell everyone that he could do it too.

441
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,680
Excuse me.

442
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,200
Oh my goodness.

443
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,400
-It's alright.
-I'm sorry.

444
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,000
-It is fine. We will clean up.
-I'm sorry.

445
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,340
No worries.

446
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,490
Relax,

447
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,730
I won't make you pay.

448
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,550
Rui Xing.

449
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,160
You didn't help to entertain our friends.

450
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
What are you doing here?

451
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,440
I...

452
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,760
am asking this lady

453
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,240
about the condition of the food.

454
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,160
Who is she?

455
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
A staff.

456
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,150
Impossible.

457
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,710
No uniform, no badge.

458
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,800
Miss, do you have the invitation card?

459
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,670
I don’t think anyone would dress like this
if she was invited.

460
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,800
Who are you actually?

461
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,030
Plain makeup and casual clothes

462
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,120
will not conceal her beauty.

463
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Not to mention that

464
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,730
she is here to accompany me.

465
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,960
Not here to please you.

466
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
I accidentally knocked over

467
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,720
the dining table.

468
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,560
It was my fault.

469
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
It's okay.

470
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,440
I believe that

471
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,380
Mr Peng and Ms Peng would not mind.

472
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,250
No, it's fine.

473
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,320
They've cleaned it up already.

474
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,520
Nian Qin.

475
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,240
Is she your friend?

476
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,720
No.

477
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,880
She is my fiancée.

478
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,530
I just want to take this opportunity

479
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,000
to introduce her to you.

480
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,280
Don't forget that,

481
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,040
I'm a beast with a human face.

482
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,760
Wu Yan.

483
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,680
This is Ms Peng

484
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,950
This man,

485
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,320
is Toro's young boss,

486
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,480
Mr Peng Rui Xing.

487
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,230
I thought I had finally found

488
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,360
the only lady,

489
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,720
who is not attracted by
Mr Su's charm.

490
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,710
Turns out,

491
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,650
she is Mr Su's fiancée.

492
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,010
Of course I love him more than
anyone else,

493
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,360
including himself.

494
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,070
Do I need to express it?

495
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,760
When did Mr Su get engaged?

496
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,880
Why didn't we hear the news?

497
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,810
It's been a long time.

498
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,840
Not a recent event.

499
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,900
When we get married,

500
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,330
we will definitely send you
the wedding invitation.

501
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,020
Xiao Lu,

502
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,840
I have a good news.

503
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,360
When did I become engaged to you?

504
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,440
Three years ago.

505
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
We were at home,

506
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,150
during the last quarrel.

507
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,040
Do you remember?

508
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,780
I remember.

509
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
Before you left,

510
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,040
what was the last thing you said to me?

511
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,400
I will be very tired if you always
act like this.

512
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,220
Wrong.

513
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,100
The sentence before that.

514
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,080
The previous sentence?

515
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,280
When I come back,

516
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,000
we will register to
get married right away

517
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,360
if you are willing to.

518
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,400
I am.

519
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,760
I said I'm willing.

520
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,700
I'm not proposing to you.

521
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,540
I am just repeating what I said
at that time.

522
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,220
You asked, I agreed.

523
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,350
There is no turning back.

524
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,950
That was three years ago.

525
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,600
It's past the best-by date.

526
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,240
I said yes anyway.

527
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,510
Hurry back home.

528
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,430
I need to hurry back.

529
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
Then remember to take your
household register.

530
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,710
Come with me to the
Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow.

531
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,710
Su Nian Qin, you...

532
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,240
You...

533
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,640
Stop following me.

534
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,600
I've already arrived.

535
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,240
No, it's too dark.

536
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,800
Now you are starting to
talk nonsense with your eyes open?

537
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,840
I meant everything I said just now.

538
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,200
Everything I said to you

539
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,780
has no expiry date.

540
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,800
What I said before still stands as well.

541
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,590
I will be very tired when
you act like this.

542
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,030
Leave me alone.

543
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,960
Why did you come down so early today?

544
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,520
This one is for you.

545
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,840
This shop has good food, it just opened.
Try it.

546
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,120
Then I'll eat more.

547
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Honey, I miss you.

548
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,480
Come.

549
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,400
[We see each other every day.]

550
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
[I will be very tired
if you act like this.]

551
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,160
Boss, the restaurant is this way.

552
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,630
Do I make people feel tired?

553
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,680
What time does
the afternoon meeting start?

554
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,280
3 o'clock.

555
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,160
Then...

556
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,460
Have a great day at work.

557
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,520
I will.

558
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Mr Wei, please.

559
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,640
Thank you.

560
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,000
