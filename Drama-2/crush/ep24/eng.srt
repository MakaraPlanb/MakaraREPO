[Episode 24]

4
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,600
He hopes to express that

5
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,400
you're his number one priority.

6
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,160
Maybe he also hopes that

7
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,840
you can use the same way

8
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,160
to express that he's your
number one priority too.

9
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,440
This is his ritual.

10
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Can I interpret this as
he loves me too much?

11
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,920
Of course.

12
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,640
So that means

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,840
unless we divorce,

14
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,840
I have to put up with him
like this for the rest of our lives.

15
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,600
No, no.

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
He'll get better.

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,800
In some ways,

18
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,920
men are a little childish.

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,560
When he gets really mature,

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,120
when he feels secure about your marriage,

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
these acts will be gone naturally.

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,320
Childish?

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,240
He's not childish, he's
more like a grandpa.

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,880
Other than asking me to open the door,

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,000
he would get talkative intermittently.

26
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,760
Fortunately, I found a good way.

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,079
I used the mole on the
tip of his nose as a button.

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,960
Whenever he talks too much,
I push the button.

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Just zip up his mouth.

30
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,320
He's too clingy.

31
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Isn't this mine?

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Listen first.

33
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
Is Mr Yi Jin going to make a
comeback in the music industry?

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,720
No.

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm keeping my promise of retirement.

36
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,920
I don't like

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,240
going back and forth over it.

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,040
That's really cool.

39
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,079
But didn't you say

40
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,240
you want to let the whole
world hear your song?

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,880
I used to want that.

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,720
I used to think that

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,960
besides writing songs,

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
there was no other way

45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
to let my voice be heard.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
But now,

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,760
it doesn't matter anymore.

48
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
I wrote this song

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,880
simply because I wanted to.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
For you.

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,160
For myself.

52
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,800
And for those around us.

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,920
Since it's for me,

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
I can decide to share
it with others, right?

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,960
What do you want to do?

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
It's time for our last song for the day.

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,120
This song today is very special.

58
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,240
Because I'll only air it once.

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,920
It must be fate
that you get to listen to it.

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,600
This song is from a musician

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,440
who has disappeared for a long time,

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,880
who is also my favourite musician,

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Yi Jin.

64
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,760
I've thought for a long time

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
how I should introduce this song.

66
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,320
But in the end,

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,560
I realized that all the words
that have to be said is in the song.

68
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,720
Some words can

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,160
really only be expressed through a song.

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm sure you can feel it

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
when you hear it.

What's the matter?

135
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,360
Why aren't you eating?

136
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,280
I have no appetite.

137
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,200

I am fed up.

145

Why are you making a fuss over a kid?

147
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,680

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
Would you like me to
make you some noodles?

150
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,960
I don't want noodles.

151
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,000
What do you want to eat then?

152
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,680
Meatballs.

153
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,880
Meatballs?

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
Mix the meatballs in the rice.

155
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,560
Then say,

156
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,360
"Nian Qin, open your mouth."

157
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,240

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,320
Xiao Jie,

160
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,240
are you bleeding?

161
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,640
No.

162
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,960
Did you fracture your bone?

163
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,560
Can you move your arms and legs?

164
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
That'll do. Stop crying.

165
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Get up on your own.

166
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
If you can, stop crying.

167
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,120
You're a man.

168
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,200
Men don't cry.

169
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,000
But I'm just a child.

170
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,360
A child?

171
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,120
If you can talk and walk,
you are not a child anymore.

172
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Remember,

173
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,560
you're a man.

174
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
A man's duty is to protect the weak.

175
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
I will protect Wu Yan then.

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,840
Not her.

177
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,000
She's mine to protect.

178
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,400
Get your own girl.

179
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,720
What happened?

180
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
How did you hurt your leg?

181
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,720
Su Nian Qin, did you watch the kid?

182
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm fine.

183
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,600
I can still move my arms and legs.

184
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,080
Nian Qin, Xiao Jie,

185
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
come and eat your breakfast.

186
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,400
Brother, the stars are so far away.

187
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,120
How can people get there?

188
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,400
You'll know when you grow up.

189
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,680
In that case,

190
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,480
I want to grow up soon.

191
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't grow up.

192
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,640
Growing up is a trap.

193
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,880
Xiao Lu,

194
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
I noticed that Nian Qin

195
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,120
is quite good at spending time with kids.

196
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Every time he finished
spending time with Jie,

197
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,080
I noticed Xiao Jie
would change a little bit.

198
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,480
Change? How?

199
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,200
He's not becoming

200
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,360
as insensitive as he is, is he?

201
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,160
Xiao Jie?

202
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
Xiao Jie?

203
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,840
What are you doing?

204
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,840
Xiao Jie.

205
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,600
My goodness.

206
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,880
Get up.

207
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
Do you have any idea how
precious these fish are to Nian Qin?

208
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,640
You mustn't do this again,
do you understand?

209
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
Don't do this again.

210
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,400
Alright, alright.

211
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,240
Don't cry, don't cry.

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
Stop crying, stop crying.

213
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,560
I just saw the fishes stick their heads up

214
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,160
as if they needed some air

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
and wanted to come out,

216
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,560
so I thought I should help them.

217
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,320
Alright, alright.

218
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Don't cry.

219
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,120
Sister, I love you so much.

220
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,720
How could you hit me?

221
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Xiao Jie,

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,160
when Nian Qin comes home later,

223
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,120
will you apologize to him?

224
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,920
Otherwise, if he gets angry,

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
I don't think anyone in this house

226
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,000
can ease his anger.

227
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
And when that happens,

228
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,040
what if he hits me too?

229
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,200
Good boy.

230
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
Don't do such silly things again.

231
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,680
Didn't I tell you

232
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,280
you're a man

233
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,360
and you shouldn't cry?

234
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll be good. I won't cry anymore.

235
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,400
Xiao Jie,

236
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
good boy.

237
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,320
Stop crying.

238
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
Go now.

239
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,840
Thank you, brother.

240
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
You brat.

241
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,400
Did you hit him?

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,400
I was angry.

243
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
I only slapped him on his bum twice.

244
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,160
Don't hit the child when
you're angry next time.

245
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
Just try to reason with him.

246
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,800
If you really want to hit him,

247
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,240
wait until after you've calmed down.

248
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,920
So that you won't get carried away
by your emotions and hit too hard.

249
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
He's asleep.

250
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,520
Nian Qin,

251
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,840
I find that you are better
with children than I am.

252
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,080
And

253
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
you are quite fond of
Xiao Jie, aren't you?

254
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,960
Nian Qin,

255
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,840
tell me,

256
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,200
is it better for us to
have a daughter or a son?

257
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm fine with both.

258
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Do you prefer a daughter or a son?

259
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,560
Daughter.

260
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,440
Why?

261
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,800
What's so good about a son?

262
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,480
He will be just like Xiao Jie.

263
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,800
When he grows up, he will
compete with me for his mother.

264
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,000
And a daughter won't compete with you?

265
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,800
If we have a daughter,

266
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,920
I want to give her all the
best things in the world.

267
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,200
She will be so outrageously pampered,

268
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
no one will dare to want her.

269
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,160
That's good then.

270
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,920
She won't marry anyone.

271
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,320
She'll stay with me.

272
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,760
I'll take care of her for her whole life.

273
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,240
Childish.

274
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
Are you sure I can come
back tomorrow night?

275
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Yes.

276
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,920
Okay, we'll use this plan.

277
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
Thank you all for your hard work.

278

[Meeting Room]

279
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,080
Boss, the next meeting is starting soon.

280

[Outpatient Building]

281
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,400
Congratulations.

282
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,560
It's five weeks old.

283
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,040
The fetus is healthy.

284
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,120
Five weeks?

285
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
This little white dot is a fetus.

286
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,360
Thank you.

287
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,240
Don't mention it.

288
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,280
Nian Qin.

289
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,680
Boss is in a meeting.

290
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,600
Is there anything I can do for you?

291
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,880
No, no.

292
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,920
I'll call back later.

293
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,000
Okay.

294
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,740
[Nian Qin]

295
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,200
What's the matter?

296
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,760
What's the matter?

297
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,280
The doctor said

298
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm

299
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,680
pregnant.

300
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,360
Hello?

301
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,160
Really?

302
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,120
It's five weeks old now.

303
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm coming back now.

304
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
Don't you have work to attend to tomorrow?

305
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm going to the airport
now. I'm coming home.

306
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,680
Where are you?

307
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,120
I'm going to drive home.

308
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,320
Don't.

309
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Stay where you are.

310
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,760
I'll ask someone to pick you up.

311
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,520
Where is my wife and my child?

312
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,680
Your child is still just a
little bean sprout now.

313
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,520
Even if he's just a little bean sprout,

314
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,640
he's still an extraordinary
little bean sprout.

315
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,520
We're really having a baby.

316
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,880
However, due to unfamiliarity

317
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,520
with the local launching process,

318
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,000
there was some miscommunication,

319
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,520
which led to a cost overrun.

320
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,880
Based on our calculations,

321
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,600
the budget was exceeded

322
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,640
by about one million yuan.

323
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,360
Boss?

324
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,120
It's fine.

325
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,120
It is within an acceptable range.

326
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,400
You all have worked hard.

327
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,440
Tell the advertising department

328
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,760
I'll buy them dinner this week.

329
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,440
I have a meeting. I have to go.

330
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,520
Did he just smile?

331
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,800
Yes, Boss just smiled.

332
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,720
Inform them to write
a self-reflection report.

333
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,240
I'm home.

334
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,520
How was your day?

335
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,960
What did you do today?

336
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,080
I went shopping with Xiao Lu.

337
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,720
You should go shopping less.

338
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,680
There are so many people out there.

339
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,120
Someone might bump into you easily.

340
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,400
Xiao Lu is also a clumsy person.

341
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,320
Two clumsy people getting together,

342
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,520
it's just horrible to even think about it.

343
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,880
You can just tell me

344
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
if there is anything you
want to buy next time.

345
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,040
If you don't need anything, you mustn't...

346
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,840
Nian Qin, I'm starving.

347
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm craving for tomato egg noodle.

348
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
I want to eat it now.

349
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,880
Sure. Coming right up.

[Xiao Lu]

351
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,240
Xiao Lu.

352
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,440
What's wrong?

353
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,000
When Nian Qin came home today,

354
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,560
he didn't go through that ritual.

355
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,400
That means

356
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,880
he's starting to feel
secure in your marriage.

357
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,400
That's so soon and so sudden.

358
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,760
How did it suddenly disappear?

359
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,320
It's probably because of your child.

360
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,560
Our child?

361
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Since you're pregnant,

362
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,920
it made him feel like
he's not just a husband,

363
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,160
but also a father now.

364
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,640
The sense of dual responsibility

365
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,280
has strengthened his
sense of security and identity.

366
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,040
He no longer needs

367
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,440
external validation.

368
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,920
Drive.

[Outpatient Building]

370
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,280
What's wrong?

371
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Why did you go back to talk to Dr Zhao?

372
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm just a little worried.

373
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
What if my child

374
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,320
is born blind like me?

375
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440
Did the doctor say anything?

376
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,240
He said he isn't sure if it is hereditary.

377
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,840
So far, everything looks normal.

378
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,960
But when I was born,

379
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,640
everything looked normal too.

380
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,680
It wasn't until a few days later

381
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
that they found out that

382
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,920
there were issues with my eyes.

383
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Look,

384
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,000
your father and mother are fine,

385
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,120
so it's not hereditary.

386
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,440
So our child will be fine too.

387
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,160
What if he's not?

388
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
There is no "what if."

389
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,400
What if there is?

390
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,080
Even if there is, I'm not afraid.

391
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,320
Our baby has a good father

392
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,160
who will look after
him for his whole life,

393
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,840
who will never let him suffer.

394
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,680
So there is nothing to be afraid of
even if there is a "what if."

418
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,880
I will not show my face
or make any statements.

419
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,960

426

[Hello, Wu Yan.]

427
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,520
Why was your phone busy just now?

428
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,680
Nian Qin,

429
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,960
are you alright?

430
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,400
I'm fine. What about you?

431
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,360
Are you okay?

432
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,440
I'm okay.

433
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
The baby is fine too.

434
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,040
He just rolled in my belly.

435
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,240
Are you alone?

436
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Madam Zhang is here too.

437
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,160
She just came back
from grocery shopping.

438
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,640
Stay at home and don't open the door.

439
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,880
Draw the curtains.

440
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,680
Unplug the landline phone line.

441
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,840
I'll come back to pick you up tonight.

442
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,200
Nian Qin, are you really fine?

443
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,200
Don't worry.

444
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,040
I'll put an end to this soon.

445
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm not worried about people's opinion.

446
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,920
I'm worried about you.

447
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm worried that you are feeling sad.

448
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,800
Don't worry.

449
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,080
How can I be sad when I have you?

450
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
Those things in the past

451
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,600
shouldn't have made you sad.

452
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
The more unpleasant your past was,

453
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,240
the more it proves that

454
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,600
you deserve to be happy in the future.

455
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,760
Wu Yan, I'm sorry.

456
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,360
There are many things I should've...

457
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,200
It's the first time I've heard you

458
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,840
apologize to me in a
sober and serious manner.

459
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,840
Nian Qin,

460
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,320
I'll make you happy.

461
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,160
I will make up for all the happiness

462
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,400
you missed in the past.

463
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,520
Wu Yan.

464
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm fine.

465
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,800
I just drew the curtain.

466
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,320
Ask Madam Zhang

467
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,160
to lock all the doors and windows.

468
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,640
She's cooking now.

469
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,040
I don't want to bother her
over a trivial matter like this.

470
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,560
I can manage it.

471
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,480
Think of it as exercise.

472
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,920
Be careful.

473
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
Maybe you should put the phone down first.

474
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,280
It's okay. I'm strong.

475
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,520
Wu Yan.

476
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,040
I'm fine. I was just trying to scare you.

477
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,760
Boss, the director of the
public relations department...

478
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,920
Wu Yan, I have to go.

479
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,240
Take care of yourself.

480
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,520
Wait for me to come home.

481
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,480
I will.

482
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,760
I need to go home now.

483
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,280
Okay.

484
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,000
But there are many reporters
in front of your house now.

485
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,960
Wu Yan's inside the house.

486
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,800
She needs me.

487
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,120
How about this?

488
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,680
Nian Qin.

489
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,920
Wu Yan, let me hug you.

490
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,720
Where is your ring?

491
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,800
I washed my face before I went out.

492
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,520
So I took it off.

493
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,280
Then, I forgot to put it back on.

494
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,080
Don't simply take it off
after you've put it on.

495
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
You're forgetful.

496
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,720
If you lose it,

497
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,160
I could buy you another one,

498
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
but you might think it's inauspicious.

499
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,760
Where are we going?

500
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,320
Let's find a hotel.

501
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,800
Why don't we go back to our old apartment?

502
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,360
I don't like hotels.

503
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,679
Go to the apartment in Lujiang.

504
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,080
Qin said you're tired.

505
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,360
Why don't you take a nap?

506
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,360
I can't sleep.

507
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,199
How about I sing you a lullaby?

508
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,920
I'm afraid I'll have
nightmares for three days.

509
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,000
How can you still be so mean?

510
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,880
I hate you.

511
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,239
Wu Yan,

512
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,440
what the media said is true.

513
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,880
My mother did pass
away in a car accident.

514
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,520
I only found out later that

515
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,880
she actually died in front of me.

516
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,320
Stop, Nian Qin.

517
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,560
I'm not going to press you for an answer.

518
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,040
You can tell me what happened in the past

519
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,280
when you're ready, okay?

520
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,120
Are you

521
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,960
really okay?

522
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,600
I am.

523
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,360
Ever since I have Sang Wu Yan,

524
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,400
I'm no longer sad.

525
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,400
Careful.

526
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,040
You say this word

527
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,880
dozens of times every day.

528
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,800
I'll protect our home.

529
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,120
Don't worry.

530
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm just worried that
you're feeling upset.

531
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,800
Your man is not as fragile as you think.

532
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,400
Wu Yan.

533
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,600
My stomach hurts.

534
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,120
Wu Yan, Wu Yan.

535
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,960
I'm sorry.

536
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,320
Nian Qin.

537
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,120
What if we lose the baby?

538
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,120
Then so be it.

539
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,160
We don't want him anymore.

540
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,320
How could you say that?

541
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,760
You love him so much.

542
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,600
How could you say you don't want him?

543
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,280
So if I die,

544
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,200
will you not want me as well?

545
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,080
Don't you dare.

546
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,880
Stop talking about dying.

547
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,000
What if I really die?

548
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,160
If you dare to pass away

549
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,320
and leave me behind,

550
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,560
I'll find someone new immediately.

551
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,680
I'll forget you in just a few days.

552
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,960
You're lying.

553
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,680
You wouldn't do this to me.

554
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,000
[Goodbye.]

555
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,560
[Wu Yan.]

556
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,800
Wu Yan.

557
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,280
Where is our baby?

558
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,680
How is he?

559
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,520
He's fine.

560
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,790
♫ Every time I thought I would cry ♫

561
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,080
♫ When the light fades away ♫

562
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,790
♫ I search everywhere
for the familiar voice ♫

563
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,120
♫ Slowly penetrating the tides
and raindrops ♫

564
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,560
♫ Even though I try to carry on ♫

565
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,860
♫ And I leave my past behind ♫

566
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,160
♫ I feel like I can hear your breathing ♫

567
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,870
♫ And the night turns translucent ♫

568
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,280
♫ Be it the city or forest ♫

569
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,650
♫ A gloomy tranquillity ♫

570
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,800
♫ Lost in the midst ♫

571
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,810
♫ I close my eyes ♫

572
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,780
♫ But I see your silhouette ♫

573
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,640
Mum, picking leaves is wrong.

574
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,500
♫ Forever shine for me ♫

575
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,360
♫ Unafraid even when faced
with the unknown future ♫

576
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,440
You're right.

577
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,330
♫ Because you're
the only thing I think about ♫

578
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,100
♫ I only think about you ♫

579
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,160
Su Nian Qin, when I picked the leaf
back then,

580
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,640
♫ Forever shine for me ♫

581
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,120
why didn't you say anything?

582
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,760
Don't you still keep it with you?

583
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,320
Let's go.

584
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,880
Su Nian Qin.

585
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,720
Look.

586
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,640
Be honest with me.

587
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You fell for me hard
at that time, didn't you?

588
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,720
It took me a long time

589
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,280
to allow myself to fall in love with you.

590
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,400
Allow?

591
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,560
Su Nian Qin, seriously...

592
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,600
Wu Yan,

593
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,200
thank you.

594
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,600
Thank you for changing me.

595
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,440
No.

596
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,080
I merely let you

597
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,880
get back to your old self.

598
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,720
Then,

599
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
thank you

600
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,440
for finding me.

601
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,120
[Thanks to all those who
worked hard on "Crush"]

602
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,250

603
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,100
[Thank you for finding us.
End of series.]
