[Episode 4]

4
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,270
I don't take carbonated drinks.

5
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,470
I was having a brain fade.

6
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,829
However, please be understanding.

7
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,030
If they believe it,

8
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,320
we shall move on.

9
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,440
It can be considered that

10
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,440
you've contributed to a good relationship.

11
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
You'll be rewarded for that.

12
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't need it.

13
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Why did you cry?

14
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
I was acting.

15
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,390
I had to be sincere, right?

16
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,079
Be honest.

17
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,520
That guy and I knew each other
since we were young.

18
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,720
My dad and his dad are colleagues.

19
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,670
We live in the same building.

20
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,600
We grew up playing together.

21
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,550
Xu Qian

22
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,390
transferred to our class when
we were in our sophomore year.

23
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,000
The moment I saw her,
I immediately felt awed.

24
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,360
She's so pretty.

25
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,110
She's fair and slim.

26
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,110
However, she's distant and cold.

27
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,240
In the first month we shared a desk,

28
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,470
we barely talked.

29
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,960
However, since the music test...

30
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,550
Miss.

31
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,030
Sang Wu Yan is having a sore throat.
She can't talk.

32
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,160
I see.

33
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,110
Sang Wu Yan, you may take the test later.

34
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,550
Thank you.

35
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,640
[After that, we became best friends.]

36
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,880
[We always spent time 
together after school.]

37
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,550
[Xu Qian loved listening to the radio.]

38
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,600
[So, we always listened
to the radio together.]

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
[Because of that, 
I fell in love with radio too.]

40
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,440
[Hello, everyone.]

41
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,600
[Thank you for listening to the show.]

-[Today...]
-Hey.

43
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:41,830
My mom said that

44
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,920
your parents won't be home tonight.

45
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,200
She asked me to call you over for dinner.

46
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,550
[Let's talk about the stories around us.]

[Whether you're sad or happy,]

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,159
[nothing's better than 
turning off the lights,]

49
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,159
[putting on your headphones,]

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,580
[and immersing yourself in...]

51
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,000
Let me introduce someone to you.

52
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,720
She's my best friend, Xu Qian.

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
Please take care of her.

54
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,920
Okay.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,270
Hello, my name is Wei Hao.

56
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,270
Hello.

[Inquiry on result of the Unified National
Examinations and University Admission]

[Sang Wu Yan
is admitted into Psychology Course]

59
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,720
There's no suspense at all.

60
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,390
Psychology in Southeast University.

61
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,920
My parents' dream has come true.

62
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,270
Software engineering?
Do you plan to go into the IT industry?

63
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,720
I know nothing about the course.

64
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,390
It doesn't matter.

65
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,830
As long as I get enrolled
into a university.

66
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,640
Broadcast journalism?

67
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,720
Aren't you interested in finance?

68
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,270
I changed my mind in the end.

69
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,040
Great.

70
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,510
You're a lady of spine.

71
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,830
Good.

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,760
[Nothing much had changed 
after we got into the university.]

73
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,160
[I should put it this way.]

74
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,350
[I thought nothing much had changed.]

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,640
[In the first year,]

76
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,320
[both of them started a band.]

[Wei Hao has been obsessed with music.]

78

[Xu Qian has a good voice.]

79
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
[It's natural that
she became the vocalist.]

80
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,640
[I couldn't do much for them.]

81
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,670
[However, I was the one 
who came out with the band name.]

82
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,040
In Japanese, it's known as Momo.

83
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,670
It sounds so adorable.

84
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,830
What do you think?

85
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,230
I think it's okay.

Attention, members of Momo.

93
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,510

[The three of us always
spent time together.]

102
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,230
[In the end, I couldn't even 
fit in between them anymore.]

103
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,230
[Worst of all, I became
the obstacle between them]

104
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
[without even knowing.]

105
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,510
How strange.

106
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,830
It's quite childish.

107
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,830
Yes, I'm quite childish.

108
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,920
I was thinking that

109
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,640
if I showed them I've moved on
with a new relationship,

110
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,670
they would...

111
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,270
Sang Wu Yan.

112
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,440
Are you a bodhisattva?

113
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,110
I am.

114
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
Not only I'm a bodhisattva,

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,670
I'm glowing with the divine light.

116
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Do you want my blessing?

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,760
Wipe your mouth.

118
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,000
You're so dirty.

119
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,669
It's such a nice handkerchief
but you use it to wipe your mouth?

120
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,280
What a waste.

121

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,520
[Nian Qin.]

124
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,790
[Where are you?]

125
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,790
[I've reached the entrance
of the welfare home.]

126
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,030
Continue walking.

127
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
Turn right when you
reach the first junction.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,590
Then, turn left.

129
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,030
You'll see a KFC Restaurant.

130
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,710
Wait for me at the entrance.

131
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,080
Are you done?

132
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,400
Let's go.

133
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,230
Sure.

134
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,880
Nian Qin.

135
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,880
Daddy.

136
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,400
See you at school.

137
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Why did she call you Daddy?

138
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,790
Let's go home.

139
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,960
It's strange.

140
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,910
Nian Qin perceives the world

141
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,910
through smell and sound.

142
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,150
Hence, he dislikes

143
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,520
places that are full of strong smells

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,030
and noises.

145
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,030
However, he came out of that place

146
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,150
with a girl.

147
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,230
When I saw that,

148
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,790
I thought I saw the wrong guy.

149
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,030
I asked him

150
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,910
but he's being him.

151
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,230
He didn't say anything.

152
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,150
He asked you who is Yi Jin?

153
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,400
He's not Yi Jin for sure.

154
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,350
Based on my observation,

155
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,670
if he's not Yi Jin,

156
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,280
he will deny it right away.

157
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,670
You talked as if

158
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,230
you know him really well.

159
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,760
What's wrong, young lady?

160
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,280
Are you in love?

161
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,470
Not to that extent.

162
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,520
After all,

163
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm a lady who have seen the world.

164
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,350
I need to continue observing.

165
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,590
Forget it.

166
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,470
You've announced that he's your boyfriend.

167
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,400
I...

168
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,110
That's because...

169
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,960
That's because...

170
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,080
It's just a white lie

171
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,030
in front of Xu Qian.

172
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,230
It's merely acting.

173
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,520
Both of them hid
their relationship from me.

174
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,640
That annoys me.

175
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,710
However,

176
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,710
I don't want them

177
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,000
to miss out on each other because of me.

178
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,960
They knew each other because of me.

179
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,520
Su Nian Qin was there anyway.

180
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,640
So,

181
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,880
I made good use of his presence.

182
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,880
If you ask me,

183
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,000
your subconscious
was messing with you.

184
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,400
If that's not it,

185
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,710
what are you trying to observe?

186
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,520
Listen.

187
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,400
The same lady picked him up again.

188
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,400
I observed closely today.

189
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,790
They're so close with each other.

190
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,590
I think

191
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,520
that lady is quite pretty.

192
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,670
When she talked,
she sounded really gentle.

193
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,470
She's quite friendly too.

194
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,760
She has a nice voice.

195
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,640
If I were a guy,
I would fall in love with her.

196
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,550
So,

197
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,000
if he's really Yi Jin,

198
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,670
we have mastered

199
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,200
a valuable piece of news.

200
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,320
The magical relationship
of the mysterious genius songwriter.

201
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,030
Isn't that attractive?

202
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,470
My goodness.

203
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,760
What on earth

204
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,080
are you thinking?

205
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,840
I think it's a good idea.

206
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840
It's really a good idea.

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,710
You're crazy.

208
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,670
It will work.

209
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,150
No way.

210
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm serious.

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,670
No way.

212
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,710
Mr Li.

213
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,710
It's Xiao Wei's birthday this month?

214
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,110
Yes.

215
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,320
The school will prepare presents

216
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,350
for birthday celebrants of the month.

217
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,470
She'll receive the present too.

218
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,910
I wonder how she is going to
celebrate her birthday.

219
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,350
Mr Su.

220
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,710
Do you want to

221
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,880
celebrate Xiao Wei's birthday too?

222
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,230
It's on 12th. Are you available?

223
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,880
I'll go there after work.

224
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm going to attend a concert.

225
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,350
You can't make it then.

226
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,760
Forget it.

227
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,280
It's okay.

228
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
I'll send her your regards.

229
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,440

230
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,640
Join the class.

231
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,910
Go into the class now.
The bell will ring soon.

232
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,670
Sure.

233
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,640
I forgot my glass.

234

It's okay, Mr Li.

235
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,030
Please proceed with the class.
I'll get you the glass.

236
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,150
Thank you.

237
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,230
Don't mention it.

238
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,790
My goodness!

239
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,200
Are you okay?

240
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,350
Are you hurt?

241
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,910
Don't move. Let me take a look.

242
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,840
Hold on.

[Staff Room]

244
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:55,980
[Don't try this at home 
as it's merely to cater to the plot]

245
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,440
What is it?

246
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,400
It's aloe vera.

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,440
I'm sorry. It's an accident.

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,880
Please don't get mad.

249
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,710
Is it?

250
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,200
Yes, I swear.

251
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,280
[I'm doomed.]

252
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,710
[It's a fatal mistake. Goodness.]

253
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,910
[These hands are born to play piano.]

254
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,150
[I didn't know aloe vera
smells like this.]

255
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,640
What happened?

256
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,000
I accidentally scalded myself

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,230
when I was getting water.

258
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,550
That's so careless of you.

259
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll get you a bigger
thermos flask tomorrow.

260
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,640
Fill it up with hot water
and bring it with you.

261
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,350
Don't get water on your own.

262
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm good.

263
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,350
Are you sure?

264
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,670
It looks so painful.

265
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,880
Xiao Lu.

266
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,440
Can you

267
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,910
get me a pot of aloe vera?

268
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,760
Why do you suddenly...

269
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,200
Mr Su, how is your hand?

270
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,230
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,760
You've apologised before.

272
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,200
Have a candy.

273
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't take sweet food.

274
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,400
I'll bring you something
savoury next time.

Xiao Wei is here.

278
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay, thank you.

279
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,069
Mr Wang.

280
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,640
Was she looking for Xiao Wei?

281
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes.

282
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,880
She bought quite a lot
of food for Xiao Wei.

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,230
Xiao Wei, I brought...

287
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,040
What's wrong, Ms Sang?

288

Are you on duty today?

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,110
When they're playing in the classroom,

290
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
they left the broom on the table.

291

It's Mr Su's class later.

292
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,640
Mr Su likes it tidy.

293
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,070
So, I need to clean up the table

294

before he's here

295
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,190
so that he won't mess up his clothes.

296
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,430
Xiao Wei, do you like Mr Su?

297
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,190
Yes, Mr Su is gentle.

298
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,400
Is he?

299
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,280
Why?

300
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,070
Why did you stop me?

301
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,070
What they want

302
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,190
isn't a pack of candies from you

303
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,800
or a box of cookies from someone else.

304
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,710
But this is a thing within my ability

305
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,160
that I could do for them.

306
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,520
It's precisely because this is
the only thing you can do.

307
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,110
Hence, it's better to not do anything.

308
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,880
You're being too sensitive.

309
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,400
I just want her to know that

310
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,190
even if she doesn't have parents,

311
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,560

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,470
ran into a young girl
whose mother was terminally ill.

376
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,310
When they bid goodbye with each other,

377
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,950
she gave him a little orange lantern.

378
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,110
Today,

379
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,350
I've prepared mandarins for you.

380
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,680
Let's make a lantern with the mandarin.

381
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,560
Okay?

382
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,640
Okay.

383
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
Be patient, everyone.

384
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,070
The light from the lantern might be dim

385
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,680
but it represents the desire for light.

386
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,830
Be assured that this question 
will come out in the examination.

387
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,400
So, promise me.

388
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,710
Memorise the answer

389
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,190
before you start eating the mandarin.

390
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,350
Okay?

391
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,710
Okay.

392
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,280
Mr Wu.

393
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,350
Has Mr Su left?

394
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:50,950
He's just left.

395
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,920
He applied for leave
to attend to something.

396
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,800
Thank you.

397
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,160
It's me.

398
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,040
It's okay, the rain is not heavy.

399
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,190
I'm free anyway.

400
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,590
I've nothing to do.

401
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,310
Let me keep you company.

402
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,590
Here, it's your handkerchief.

403
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,000
You can dry yourself off.

404
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,230
[I didn't want to return it.]

405
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,040
[I've just wasted a chance
to initiate a conversation.]

406
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,820
♫ Nothing much to say ♫

407
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,260
♫ I've been waiting for something ♫

408
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,460
♫ It's written in the stars ♫

409
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,900
♫ There's a voice in my ears ♫

411
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,460
♫ Because of that, 
I'm no longer afraid of sunset ♫

Isn't it Ilex?

432
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,950
Of course not.

433
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,950

435

♫ I feel as if ♫

441
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,780
♫ I would never want to let go ♫

442
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,420
♫ Even if the whole world
outside the window ♫

443
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,820
♫ Is shaking like there's no tomorrow ♫

444
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,620
♫ As long as I'm holding your hand ♫

445
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,340
♫ I can't find any reason to be afraid ♫

446
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,590
The simplest way to tell them apart...

447
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,800
is to take a look at the edge of the leaf.

448
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,000
Feel it.

449
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,230
It's smooth.

450
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,040
Ilex's leaf is serrated.

451
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,680
Can you feel it?

452
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,710
Aloe vera has serrated leaves too.

453
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,880
Yes.

454
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,160
You're very perceptive.

455
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,070
Your car is here.

456
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,160
Nian Qin.

457
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,350
Thank you.

458
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,110
Why are you holding a leaf?

459
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,830
Nothing.

460
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,900
[The tombstone of Li Mei Ting]

461
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,520
He's here to pay his mom a visit.

462
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,760
Somehow he wanted

463
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,360
to come here out of a sudden.

464
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,909
What?

465
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,909
Okay, I got it.

466
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,870
I'll find the right time

467
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,520
to persuade him to go home.

468
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,389
As you know, he's against it.

469
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,280
I've to go.

470
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,230
So, in the end,

471
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,670
you didn't talk about
what happened yesterday?

472
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,390
Yes.

473
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:07,870
No, wait.

474
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,840
Why does he sound

475
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,670
so emotionally unstable?

476
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,360
He's just like our objects of study.

477
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,710
You dislike psychology

478
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,390
because you hate

479
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,360
dealing with complicated people, right?

480
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,360
Why are you so patient to him now?

481
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,710
I'm...I don't know.

482
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,670
Every time I look at his back,

483
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,470
I feel like hugging him for no reason.

484
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,190
It just felt like doing this.

485
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,470
Like this.

486
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,320
Young lady, congratulations.

487
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,710
You're doomed.

488
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,040
Why?

489
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,150
You've fallen in love.

490
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,000
That's not right.

491
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,520
According to the triangular theory
of love by Sternberg,

492
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,230
love is formed of intimacy,
passion and commitment.

493
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,520
I haven't started

494
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,040
dragging him into the bottomless pit.

495
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,040
[I'm just]

496
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,150
[falling in love with him at first sight.]

497
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,430
Mr Su, you're early today.

498
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,430
I forgot to bring the text book home.

499
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
I'm here early to prepare for the class.

500
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,950
Who drew on the mandarin?

501
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,950
It's so funny.

502
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,360
The expression

503
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,950
looks exactly like you.

504
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,950
I've to go.

505
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,840
[Mr Su.]

506
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,870
[Have a mandarin.]

507
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,670
[Don't be mad.]

508
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,040
[I've to go to the classroom now.]

509
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,600
[You eat it.]

510
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,470
Xiao Lu.

511
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,230
Did you see

512
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,320
a mandarin here?

513
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,710
I ate it.

514
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,080
Why did you take it without permission?

515
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,950
Isn't it just a mandarin?

516
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,670
There are plenty of mandarins
in the fridge.

517
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,950
Do you want it? I can get one for you.

518
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,190
No.

519
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,470
Where is the mandarin skin?

520
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,120
Forget it.
