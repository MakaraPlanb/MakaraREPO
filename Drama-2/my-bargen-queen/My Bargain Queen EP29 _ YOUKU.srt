00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 29]

3
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,510
Hello.

4
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,910
Are you Qin Hebo's family member?

5
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
Mr. Qin was injured and hospitalized.

6
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,440
What?

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,320
Wait, is he seriously injured?

8
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,320
Are you okay?

9
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,440
I am so scared.

10
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,190
How did you

11
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,320
hurt your head?

12
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,830
I am fine.

13
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,190
All right.

14
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,550
I am so worried.

15
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,800
But…

16
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,470
Who are you?

17
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,190
Wait.

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,390
Stop making jokes

19
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,880
at this moment.

20
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,190
The doctor said that
I was hit hard on the head.

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,550
I…

22
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,670
What's wrong with you?

23
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,360
Does it hurt?

24
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,750
I have a splitting headache

25
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,550
whenever I want to recall something.

26
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,750
Wait.

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,110
Doctor. Doctor.

28
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,160
Why does it hurt so much?

29
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,750
Are you okay?

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,240
Are you important to me?

31
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,320
Listen.

32
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,910
Are we familiar?

33
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,360
Don't you remember me?

34
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,520
Of course I am very important to you.

35
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,880
Qin Hebo.

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,720
You are Qin Hebo?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
No.

38
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,960
You are Qin Hebo.

39
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,270
I am Fu Shuangshuang.

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,270
I am the one you have liked
for a long time.

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,000
You?

42
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,520
I like you?

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,320
How come

44
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,550
I have no impression at all?

45
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
You can't forget me.

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,160
It is my fault.

47
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,110
I shouldn't have hesitated

48
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,720
all this time.

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,550
I…

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,960
I actually didn't hate you long ago.

51
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,160
I just want to tell you that

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,600
I like you

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,320
when you come back
from the business trip.

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,110
I've liked you for a long time.

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,720
And I like you

56
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,550
non-stop, uncontrollably.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,670
Just don't…

58
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,190
Don't forget me, okay?

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,750
Say it again.

60
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,549
Say it again.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,920
I said that…

62
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,000
It's so sweet. Say it again.

63
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,110
What should I say?

64
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,670
Are you lying to me again?

65
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,440
I didn't lie to you.

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,760
I waited so long and

67
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,390
finally you said this.

68
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,760
My head hurts.

69
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,040
What did I just say?

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,390
Did you also get a heavy blow
to the head?

71
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,390
My head hurts.

72
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,110
What to do?

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,320
Pass it to me.

74
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,110
Pass it to me and you won't hurt.

75
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,440
Is that okay?

76
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,550
It still hurts.

77
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:53,950
Mr. Qin Hebo.

78
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,760
It's time for you to take medicine.

79
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm fine now.

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,480
[Ning Meng]

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,270
Hello, Ning Meng.

82
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,550
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

83
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,790
What's up?

84
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,440
I want to

85
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,110
talk to you clearly

86
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,440
about you and my brother and Zhijun.

87
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,440
Is this still necessary?

88
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,320
It's good for everyone
to make it clear.

89
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
I don't think

90
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
you want to be embarrassed forever.

91
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,440
It doesn't taste good.

92
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,040
Is this also spicy?

93
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,760
Okay.

94
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,550
We also tried the drinks.

95
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,830
What are you doing?

96
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,160
Is the selection

97
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,350
a failure?

98
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,160
Once this milk

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,950
is sold during our live,

100
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,040
there will definitely be
countless complaint calls.

101
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,320
Qian, why are you back?

102
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,000
Didn't you go to work in Evergreen?

103
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,320
The App was launched.

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,320
I don't have to go every day.

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,510
Today we are going to try this crab.

106
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,830
The crab is great.

107
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,000
Big and full of roe.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,640
And with reasonable price.

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,390
Well.

110
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,480
Pregnant women cannot eat crabs.

111
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,510
Remember to remind the audience

112
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,670
during the live streaming.

113
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,320
Take notes for me.

114
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,440
Ai.

115
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,790
Can't pregnant women eat crabs?

116
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,670
I always thought it is pseudoscience.

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,000
Crabs are cold in nature.

118
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,760
It is high in fat and content

119
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,040
and is hard to digest.

120
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Pregnant women should eat less

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
or none.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,950
Is she afraid to come?

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,640
My brother will pick me up
to the hospital in a while.

124
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,110
Will I let the cat out of the bag?

125
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,640
Don't worry, it's well arranged.

126
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
You just need to play it well.

127
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,670
No problem.

128
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,950
Is it this private room?

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,950
Okay, got it.

130
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,320
Ning Meng.

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,720
Here you are.

132
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,230
Miss Chen is also here.

133
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,510
In my heart,

134
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,200
Manhui is the best sister-in-law candidate.

135
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,760
Why can't she be here?

136
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,640
Ning Meng.

137
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,760
I thought you asked me here today

138
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,790
to talk about…

139
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,160
I want to tell you that

140
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,550
you two have broken up.

141
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,950
Please stop pestering him.

142
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,390
If this is what you want to say,

143
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,640
I don't think

144
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,440
we need to talk today.

145
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,070
Meng.

146
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,950
She wants to be with your brother

147
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,600
for a higher social position.

148
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,070
So shameless.

149
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,720
She doesn't even know
how to break up amicably.

150
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,110
Make yourself clear or I won't let you go.

151
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,600
Don't go too far.

152
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,760
Enough is enough.

153
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,720
Don't embarrass everyone.

154
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,950
I am leaving.

155
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
You can't leave.

156
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,640
Why not?

157
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,760
Okay.

158
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,400
Let me help you.

159
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,150
What are you doing?

160
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,320
What are you doing?

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,400
I'll ask for help.

162
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,910
You just want me to push you

163
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,230
and have a miscarriage.

164
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,710
And then?

165
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,840
Blood packs.

166
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,550
You two are well prepared.

167
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,960
Do you know how many people

168
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,910
will be hurt by doing this?

169
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
Xia Qian, what's going on?

170
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,520
What are you doing?

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,280
She isn't pregnant at all.

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,520
I saw her eating crabs in the restaurant

173
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,110
that day.

174
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,000
And I felt strange.

175
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Later

176
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,400
I found her medical examination report

177
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,640
from you.

178
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,840
I went to the doctor

179
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,710
according to the address above.

180
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,960
Ms. Ning Meng

181
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,670
has been doing physical examinations
in our hospital before.

182
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,400
But she is not pregnant.

183
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,590
And I didn't

184
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,960
sign here.

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,080
Is there any misunderstanding in this?

186
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll leave

187
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,670
you alone then.

188
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,590
Ning Meng.

189
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
You've been lying to me all the time?

190
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,030
Meng.

191
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,590
How could you do this?

192
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,150
I just don't like her.

193
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't quite like you either.

194
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,230
Not to mention how ugly

195
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,110
your slander against Xia Qian is,

196
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,440
did you think about He Zhijun's feelings

197
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,710
when you did this?

198
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
You should be able to tell

199
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,200
how much he yearns for the baby
during this period.

200
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,280
How could he accept that

201
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,760
you made up such a lie?

202
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,230
I don't want to say anymore.

203
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,670
Reflect on it yourself.

204
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,110
Zhening.

205
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,760
Zhening.

206
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,910
I don't know this.

207
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't know that her pregnancy is fake.

208
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,520
Neither do I know that

209
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,230
she was going to use this
to frame Miss Xia.

210
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,150
Miss Chen.

211
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
Do you think you are smart,

212
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,230
and everyone else is a fool?

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,880
Zhening.

214
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,030
Did you misunderstand me?

215
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,590
If there is nothing else,

216
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,790
go back first.

217
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,520
It's still working time.

218
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,470
Darling, don't leave.

219
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,840
I know it's my fault.

220
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,030
I mean it.

221
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,320
Darling, I made a mistake.

222
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,280
I mean it.

223
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,880
Could you stay?

224
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,960
Darling, I am begging you.

225
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
I know it's my fault.

226
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,960
Really.

227
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,670
Darling, I am begging you.

228
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,400
Can you give me a chance?

229
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,320
I am begging you.

230
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,110
Don't leave.

231
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,230
Darling, I mean it.

232
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,280
I am begging you.

233
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,910
Miss Chen's probation period

234
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,520
should be over.

235
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,590
How is her performance during this period?

236
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
Her performance isn't outstanding.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,440
But Miss Chen is
Ms. Ning Meng's friend.

238
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,110
And her dad…

239
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,550
When did Evergreen

240
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,960
become a place for nepotism?

241
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,440
I thought too much.

242
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,000
Whether she can stay or not

243
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,110
should be in accordance
with Evergreen 's rules.

244
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,030
Okay, sure.

245
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,760
I am going back.

246
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,710
Xia Qian.

247
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,470
Sorry.

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,760
Ning Meng hurt you.

249
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,590
You don't have to apologize.

250
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,790
It has nothing to do with you.

251
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,760
My concern leads to this mess.

252
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,200
I didn't expect her

253
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,960
to make up all these to lie to me.

254
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Although Ning Meng

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,710
used to be willful,

256
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,960
she was kind

257
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,350
and upright

258
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,470
deep down.

259
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
I don't know

260
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
when she became like this.

261
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,080
Don't worry.

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,710
Let's

263
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,760
take it easy.

264
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,910
Zhening.

265
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,760
No matter how angry you are,

266
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,710
you can't completely ignore her.

267
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,110
I am worried that

268
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,670
she will do something extreme again.

269
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,670
Okay.

270
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,520
I will have a good chat

271
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,350
with Ning Meng.

272
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
But it's good.

273
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,760
We don't need

274
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,590
to hide from others anymore.

275
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,150
You've worked hard all day long.

276
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,760
Go back. I am leaving.

277
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,550
Okay, I will watch you back.

278
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
I will watch you back.

279
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,840
I am leaving.

280
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,080
Does your head still hurt?

281
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,230
It's okay.

282
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
If you feel uncomfortable,

283
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,350
tell me at any time.

284
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,760
By the way,

285
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,640
why did you figure it out?

286
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,960
Figure what out?

287
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,960
To be together with me.

288
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,230
I just feel that

289
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,910
I have been suppressing my emotions,

290
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,200
which is quite uncomfortable.

291
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,110
I thought too much about the future.

292
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,230
But now

293
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,640
I just want to seize the present.

294
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,760
Don't worry.

295
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,230
I won't let you down this time.

296
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,760
Take me back to the hotel first.

297
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
And you go back to rest.

298
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,550
You are just discharged.

299
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,640
Can you stay in the hotel alone

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,440
without anyone taking care of you?

301
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,080
I am fine.

302
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,760
Just a little scratch.

303
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,670
How about going home

304
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,200
during this time?

305
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,760
Turn right.

306
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,640
What are you doing?

307
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,230
I will sleep on the sofa.

308
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,470
And you in bed.

309
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,000
Wait.

310
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,560
I should sleep on the sofa.

311
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,680
How could you sleep on the sofa?

312
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
I am your boss.

313
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,950
Just listen to me.

314
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,760
You haven't recovered yet.

315
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,070
You are the boss.

316
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,760
But I am the queen here.

317
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,920
You have to listen to me.

318
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,160
Sleep in bed.

319
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,230
Queen?

320
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,230
You are arguing irrationally.

321
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,760
That's my style.

322
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,680
Just get in.

323
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
I don't care.

324
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,520
I'm lying flat anyway.

325
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,920
Unless you carry me in.

326
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,190
I am coming.

327
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,400
Hurry up.

328
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,760
I will sleep on the sofa.

329
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,400
Acupoint.

330
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,760
Or we could

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,230
sleep together.

332
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,310
What are you doing?

333
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,590
I haven't…

334
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,350
You haven't recovered.

335
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,070
Then when I am fine, we…

336
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,680
No!

337
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,230
I mean you haven't recovered.

338
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,470
So let me turn off the light.

339
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,070
Well.

340
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
There is another one.

341
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,400
Please.

342
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,040
I haven't recovered.

343
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
My arms are not long enough.

344
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,760
I can't reach it.

345
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,400
You do it.

346
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,830
All right, let me.

347
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,800
Why don't you turn it off?

348
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I am injured.

349
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,880
And my arm is also short.

350
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,040
Kitty.

351
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,560
Let's go.

352
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,590
Baby.

353
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,920
Go have fun.

354
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,470
Why are you making breakfast

355
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,400
on a whim?

356
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,520
Boyfriends

357
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,190
should get up to make breakfast.

358
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,280
Clean yourself up.

359
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,160
It's almost done.

360
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Then I'll wait to eat.

361
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,950
We are going to have breakfast.

362
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,160
I prepare for you.

363
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,000
This is yours.

364
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,110
Remember to eat it.

365
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,640
Here comes the breakfast.

366
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,520
It smells good.

367
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,070
Take a try.

368
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,160
By the way,

369
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,230
did you name it?

370
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,430
Let's name the kitten.

371
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,590
Well.

372
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,920
I thought about the name before.

373
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,590
Really?

374
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,230
What's it?

375
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,310
I'd like to call it Tiger.

376
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,760
Tiger?

377
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,560
The name is way too tacky.

378
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,190
The elders said that

379
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,310
a tacky name

380
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,520
can bring good luck to it.

381
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,230
No.

382
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,230
Tiger is so strange.

383
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Let's change a name.

384
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,680
How do you like to name it?

385
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,280
Pudding.

386
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,590
Pudding?

387
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,590
Does pudding have any special meaning?

388
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,110
Nothing.

389
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,400
It's just cute.

390
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,470
What's more,

391
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,680
many things in the world

392
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,920
make no sense.

393
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,230
I want to call it Tiger

394
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,190
because I hope it to be healthy.

395
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,590
You want to call it Pudding.

396
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,310
Well…

397
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,880
Let's call it Pudding of Tiger.

398
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,070
What about the nickname being Pudding?

399
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,310
Formal name is Pudding of Tiger.

400
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,880
Normally we call it Pudding.

401
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,230
So

402
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,230
we still have to call it Pudding.

403
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,830
Right?

404
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,040
Pudding of Tiger.

405
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,680
Pudding of Tiger.

406
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,920
I can't help you anymore.

407
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,110
Your name is Pudding now.

408
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,830
How troublesome to call it that.

409
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,230
Pudding.

410
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,350
Right?

411
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,710
Pudding. Pudding.

412
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,880
Well.

413
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,190
Look at her.

414
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,310
I heard that

415
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,160
her degree in the United States is fake.

416
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,800
Her dad paid a large amount
of sponsorship fee

417
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,950
to let her enter the school.

418
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,230
But her academic performance was so poor

419
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,520
that she didn't graduate.

420
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,070
Really?

421
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,920
If you cannot

422
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,830
stand the heat,

423
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,470
get out of the kitchen.

424
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,830
You are right.

425
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,110
In the end, she is the one embarrassed.

426
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,400
Mr. Sheng.

427
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,040
How is Meng these days?

428
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,800
He Zhijun left.

429
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,560
Ms. Ning Meng's not
in a good condition.

430
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,680
Now someone is taking care of her.

431
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,950
But she eats very little every day.

432
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,000
Ms. Ning Meng didn't
eat anything today.

433
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,950
Okay, you can go.

434
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,400
Meng.

435
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,400
I am here.

436
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,400
Guess what I prepared for you.

437
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,920
I cooked everything myself.

438
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,470
Come on.

439
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,760
So many dishes.

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,470
Meng.

441
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,640
Come on, eat them while hot.

442
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,710
Brother.

443
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,190
Zhijun left.

444
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,190
I know.

445
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,760
Are you also angry with me?

446
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,880
Meng.

447
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,110
I know that

448
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,680
Chen Manhui played a big role

449
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,760
in this.

450
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,680
But have you ever reflected
on your own problems?

451
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,680
If you continue to be like this,

452
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,760
not only will your marriage
with He Zhijun be ruined,

453
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,950
but I will also be disappointed in you.

454
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,190
Meng.

455
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,800
You have been the beloved of our family

456
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,230
since childhood.

457
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,710
After our parents passed away,

458
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,190
I never forced you to do anything.

459
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,880
I agreed with all your decisions,

460
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,560
including studying abroad

461
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,470
and any work you did.

462
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,590
The only thing I object to

463
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,230
is your marriage with He Zhijun.

464
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,520
I admit that

465
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,310
I was biased against He Zhijun
to some extent.

466
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,950
But after you two got married,

467
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,760
I could tell how much he likes you.

468
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,470
He can tolerate your bad temper.

469
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,430
He truly loves you.

470
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,070
I sincerely hope that

471
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
you two will have a happy life

472
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,590
in the future.

473
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,640
But you are going

474
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,310
much further

475
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,040
and making the situation worse.

476
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,520
I can't indulge you anymore.

477
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,560
Brother, it's my fault.

478
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,950
I am the one to blame.

479
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,760
Could you intercede with Zhijun

480
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,280
and ask him to come back?

481
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,640
Brother, please.

482
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,800
I can go for him,

483
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,280
but certainly not now.

484
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
He is in a fit of anger.

485
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,400
How could I go for him now?

486
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,760
Let him calm down.

487
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,190
Listen.

488
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,470
After He Zhijun calms down,

489
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,560
go apologize to him sincerely.

490
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,560
Understand?

491
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,560
Yes.

492
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,950
As long as he is willing to come back,

493
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,830
I can do anything.

494
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,830
Okay.

495
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,230
Eat something.

496
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,920
Starving

497
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,640
can't solve the problem.

498
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,190
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

499
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,560
Mr. Sheng, goodbye.

500
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,470
Why are you here?

501
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,310
It's off work time.

502
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,640
Have you done your work?

503
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,560
Yes.

504
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,800
Good.

505
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,680
I'll send you home.

506
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,280
It's so obvious.

507
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,950
Miss Xia is the clear winner.

508
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,400
Should this

509
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,160
be moved back

510
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,280
to Miss Xia again?

511
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,470
Hope there won't be any changes this time.

512
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,560
Aunt.

513
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,590
We two are together again.

514
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,430
I knew you two would get back together.

515
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,230
Sheng.

516
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,830
I am not complimenting my own girl.

517
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,160
It is very difficult for you

518
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,830
to find another girl as good as her.

519
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,950
You have to treat her well.

520
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,310
You!

521
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,560
It is also hard for you

522
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,430
to find another boyfriend as good as Sheng.

523
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,400
Do the same.

524
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,560
Got it.

525
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,350
Be serious.

526
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,040
Of course I know.

527
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,000
Okay.

528
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
It's a good day today.

529
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,710
I will cook for you myself.

530
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,710
Let's drink.

531
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,280
Aunt.

532
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,950
No need.

533
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,000
I have to!

534
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,280
It's a good day.

535
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,590
I'd like to eat stir-fry shrimp.

536
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,560
Me too.

537
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,710
Okay, stir-fry shrimp.

538
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,470
And stir-fry razor clams.

539
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,430
Sure.

540
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,710
I also want to eat that.

541
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,430
Wait for me.

542
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,040
It will be ready soon.

543
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,590
You even have the same taste.

544
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,590
Why did you parrot what I said?

545
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,590
Your phone.

546
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,470
Check it for me.

547
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,800
It's a voice message from Cindy.

548
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,110
Mr. Qin.

549
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,880
I heard that you were injured.

550
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,310
Are you fine?

551
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,350
Do you want me to visit you?

552
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,590
What's up?

553
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,830
Why are you in a daze?

554
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,230
Who is Cindy?

555
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,950
Your colleague?

556
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,800
Why haven't I heard of her?

557
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,680
Why does she care about you so much?

558
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,350
Here.

559
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,880
Okay.

560
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,760
Why are we taking photos?

561
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,950
You haven't answered me yet.

562
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,760
Who is Cindy?

563
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,880
Cindy…

564
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,560
Cindy is the supplier of our hotel.

565
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,710
I will show you

566
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,760
the conversation just now.

567
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,560
It's okay.

568
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,080
[Qin Hebo]

569
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,310
Why is your profile photo…

570
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,400
It can save a lot of trouble.

571
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,470
If you still feel worried,

572
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,830
I will tell you the password.

573
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,710
520222.

574
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,230
520.

575
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,590
I love you.

576
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,040
222. Who's 2?

577
