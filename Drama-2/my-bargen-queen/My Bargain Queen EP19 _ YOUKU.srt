[My Bargain Queen]

2
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
You are now holding

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,440
10% of Evergreen's shares.

5
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,120
According to the original agreement,

6
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,640
I completed the task.

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,240
Now I want to quit.

8
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
Quit?

9
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,080
Would Mr. Xue let Qin Hebo

10
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
go to Mr. Gao's office
to steal the materials?

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
If he intends to

12
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
destroy Evergreen's reputation,

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
leaking the information of VIP customers

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,280
is the best way.

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,560
Are you going to ask An An

16
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,360
to stay there

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,280
and catch Qin Hebo with the goods?

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,360
I will be there myself.

19
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Zhening.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
I will go with you.

21
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,920
Zhening.

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,600
In fact,

23
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,400
you don't want it to be Qin Hebo,
do you?

24
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
Of course not.

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,120
If it were him,

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
all my good impressions of him

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,720
would be shattered.

28
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,800
Sisters.

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,840
Today I will recommend you

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360
a mask.

31
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,080
The mask.

32
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,040
Right.

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,600
This pre-essence mask.

34
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,960
It works well and is affordable.

35
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,560
You…

36
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,400
It seems that he won't come.

37
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,200
Okay.

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
The goods you most look forward to

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,720
will be available soon.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,040
Let's count down together.

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,920
Three.

42
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,080
Two.

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,480
Go.

44
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,360
Thank you.

45
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,080
I asked a friend of mine before,

46
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,920
if a person had done something bad,

47
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,040
could he get better?

48
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,200
You gave me the answer today.

49
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Before you gave me

50
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
a list of weddings in May.

51
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,480
I owe you.

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,520
Today's text message

53
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
is to pay you back.

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
Shuangshuang.
Don't explain to me anymore.

55
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,160
I don't care about your explanation.

56
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
We met here.

57
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,720
It would be nice

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,640
to end here.

59
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,280
It's a good end.

60
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,080
Shuangshuang.

61
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,800
Let go.

62
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,120
Let me go.

63
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,720
Shuangshuang.

64
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,000
Let me go.

65
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
You asked me before,

66
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
if you stopped serving the devil,

67
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
would we still have a chance?

68
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
I really want to believe you.

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
I want to believe that
you are telling the truth.

70
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,400
But ask yourself

71
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,480
if you can make it?

72
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,560
Could you give up
what you have now?

73
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,360
Can you let go

74
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,240
of who you were?

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
If you can't even do this,

76
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,320
how can you ensure that
you can get better?

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Nothing like this would happen.

78
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
About this…

79
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,320
I don't know how to explain.

80
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Can you give me another chance?

81
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,880
What else can I do for you?

82
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,760
Qin Hebo.

83
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,520
Just because I like you,

84
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,960
I hurt my most important friend.

85
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
Because I like you,

86
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,760
I went bad.

87
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,680
I am already a bad person.

88
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,920
Liking you costs too much.

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
I don't want to go on anymore.

90
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
I do like you.

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,800
But I hate…

92
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,840
I hate myself being like this.

93
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,040
You are back.

94
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,760
What happened to you?

95
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
I have a stomachache.

96
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,560
I just went to the pharmacy.

97
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,880
That's okay.

98
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,360
Go back early to rest.

99
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
Go back early.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,720
Hard work for you.

101
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,480
[Mr. Xue]

102
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Sorry.

103
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,280
Last night,

104
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
it was me who told Qin Hebo.

105
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,880
Actually…

106
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
I'm a spy!

107
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,520
I don't know that Qin Hebo at all.

108
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,840
I lied before.

109
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,600
I'm doing this

110
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,840
because I want to steal something

111
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
from him.

112
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm also a spy, actually.

113
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,040
What do you mean?

114
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,240
My purpose

115
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
is to take over the entire Evergreen Hotel.

116
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
Forget it.

117
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,160
Forget what I said.

118
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,000
I just wanted to give him
another chance

119
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,200
and I believed that
he could get better.

120
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,440
But…

121
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,920
Sorry, I am the one to blame.

122
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,000
I am sorry for you.

123
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,080
I am sorry for you.

124
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,240
It's all over.

125
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,360
I'm afraid you will get hurt.

126
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,040
Shuangshuang.

127
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
There is a saying

128
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,640
goes that

129
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,560
why people make mistakes?

130
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
Because everyone makes mistakes.

131
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
This is why

132
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,760
a pencil comes with an eraser.

133
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,760
It has already happened.

134
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Face it bravely.

135
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,520
Cheer up.

136
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,920
Give yourself a chance
to choose and change.

137
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,640
Think about it.

138
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,000
If you want to calm down,

139
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
it's understandable.

140
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,760
No problem.

141
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
But you have to think about
when you will be back.

142
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,440
Worth Or Not needs you.

143
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,080
Thank you, Qian.

144
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,440
Never say that between us.

145
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,400
Nobody's inside.

146
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
That girl went back home.

147
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,680
Mr. Sheng.

148
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Qin Hebo submitted a letter
of resignation to the board of directors.

149
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,960
This is the resignation document

150
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,720
that the Personnel Dept.
needs you to sign.

151
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,440
Emily.

152
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,600
After I leave,

153
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,760
you could no longer stay in Evergreen.

154
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,840
I found a job for you,

155
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,640
and the salary and treatment
is no worse than here.

156
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,040
Can I still work with you?

157
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,680
I want to take a rest.

158
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,240
Work hard.

159
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
Let me pack things up for you.

160
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,560
I have nothing to pack up.

161
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,480
Just leave me alone.

162
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,760
Okay.

163
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,120
How about it?

164
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,120
Is Vice General Manager Qin

165
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,080
satisfied?

166
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
Thank you for your consideration.

167
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,600
By the way, Hebo.

168
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,680
Join the board of directors meeting later.

169
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,880
In the future,

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,440
we have to fight together.

171
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,920
I made it myself.

172
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
Congratulations on your promotion.

173
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,440
Why?

174
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,120
You want money?

175
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
The position of
the general manager of Evergreen?

176
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,360
Or Evergreen's shares?

177
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,280
I don't get it.

178
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,240
How much did Mr. Xue pay you?

179
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,240
You even ruined Meng's wedding.

180
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,600
Haven't you always regarded her
as your own sister?

181
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Did you even pretend these?

182
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,840
I failed to live up to you
and Meng's feelings.

183
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,000
Sorry.

184
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,000
I just want an explanation.

185
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,080
I could forgive your past misdeeds.

186
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,520
I have nothing to explain.

187
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,560
I don't need your forgiveness either.

188
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,240
Say goodbye to Meng for me

189
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,720
I didn't tell her

190
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,560
about your deeds.

191
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,120
I don't want her to know

192
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,280
your true colors.

193
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
But starting today,

194
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,360
we are done.

195
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,600
Quite fair.

196
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,040
Qian.

197
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
I got you a glass of juice.

198
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,560
Thanks.

199
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,840
Are you still thinking about Shuangshuang?

200
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,560
How do you know?

201
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,920
You are not at your best all day long.

202
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
And you called Ai as Shuangshuang.

203
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,000
Right.

204
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,200
It's just…

205
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I am uncomfortable
when she is not here.

206
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,040
I do miss her.

207
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,640
I know

208
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,560
you are just used to

209
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,040
Shuangshuang always by your side.

210
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,000
Her sudden departure

211
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,480
makes you feel uncomfortable.

212
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
But don't worry.

213
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,760
She just got caught in her emotions

214
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,000
and couldn't get out for a moment.

215
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,200
She will come back

216
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,599
after a while.

217
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,319
Mu Xiaoyan.

218
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,680
What happened to you today?

219
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
You are so considerate.

220
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,000
I am always like that.

221
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,600
But you never figured it out.

222
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,880
You are usually like this.

223
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,920
And this.

224
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,040
Really?

225
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,240
Well.

226
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,240
We have to believe that

227
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Shuangshuang will definitely come back.

228
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,880
Hebo.

229
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,440
Come on.

230
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,320
Let's talk in the car.

231
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,040
Not necessary.

232
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,760
Let's talk here.

233
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,320
We don't have to hide.

234
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,800
In fact,

235
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,640
I have always admired you.

236
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,920
I believe that

237
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,880
as long as we join hands,

238
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
Evergreen will soon be ours.

239
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,320
But I didn't expect you

240
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
to give up such a bright future
and opportunity.

241
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,560
You let me down.

242
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
I promised to buy Evergreen for you

243
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,880
in order to return your favor.

244
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,840
Nothing else matters.

245
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,800
Maybe you forgot it.

246
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,080
When I failed to start a business,

247
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,920
I went to Lihe Capital for investment.

248
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,360
And I was rebuffed many times.

249
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,640
until one day…

[Meeting room]

251
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,960
Sorry.

252
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,080
Sorry.

253
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,040
It's okay.

254
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,480
Young man.

255
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,400
Are you sure

256
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,080
to enter with this?

257
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
I have a suit.

258
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,080
If you don't mind,

259
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,880
I can lend it to you.

260
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,600
Thank you.

261
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,920
Thank you. Thank you.

262
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,640
Thank you. Thanks so much.

263
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
Sorry to bother you.

264
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,280
How was the conversation going on?

265
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,600
They agreed to consider my plan.

266
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,360
Thank you for your clothes.

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
In fact, I noticed you for a long time.

268
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,920
You have been here for a month.

269
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,400
Normally, one would be dispirited

270
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,640
after being rebuffed once or twice.

271
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,120
But I found that

272
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,960
you are very persistent.

273
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,040
It's so rare.

274
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,080
Because I thought

275
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
they would like my plan.

276
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,280
Why do you think

277
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,520
they always reject you?

278
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,960
Sometimes

279
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,280
people need packaging.

280
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,720
Brat.

281
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,160
Would you like to

282
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,680
work at Lihe Capital?

283
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,880
Are you serious?

284
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,960
Yes.

285
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,920
Later you gave me a set of clothes

286
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,320
and a work opportunity.

287
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,560
I was really grateful.

288
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
But compared to what you gave me,

289
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,280
I may lose more now.

290
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,520
I am leaving.

291

Shuangshuang

292
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,200
likes Qin Hebo so much.

293
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,560
That's why she informed him.

294
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,560
It doesn't matter anymore.

295
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,080
Qin Hebo left Evergreen.

296
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,320
Do you need me there?

297
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,560
It's okay. Don't worry about me.

298
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,440
Well.

299
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,520
Those with different values

300
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,080
cannot be forced to be friends.

301
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,880
Maybe his departure

302
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,320
is good for both of you.

303
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,680
Yes, I got it.

304
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,800
Although Qin Hebo left Evergreen,

305
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
Lihe Capital

306
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
has now penetrated into Evergreen.

307
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,400
I guess they will soon

308
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,160
send a shareholder representative

309
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,040
to Evergreen.

310
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,440
The next opponent

311

roll with the punches.

314

If husband and wife work together,

315
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,320
there would be infinite power.

316
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,360
Who is your wife?

I am thinking of my dad.

338
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,640
You never talked about your dad.

00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,240
Carry my luggage.

577
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:06,960
Wait!

578
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,560
Hello.

579
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,920
Ms. Chen?

580
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,160
Miss Xia.

581
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,720
I am so sorry.

582
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
There is a traffic jam.

583
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,440
I may be late.

584
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
How long would it take?

585
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,960
I have some work to do.

586
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,560
Well.

587
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,760
Please hurry up.

588
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,760
Sure, I'll be there as soon as possible.

589
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,480
Okay, thanks.

590
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,560
Open your mouth.

591
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,760
What's up?

592
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,600
Hello, Qian.

593
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,920
Why are you not here yet?

594
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
The suppliers are here.

595
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,120
Deal with them first.

596
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,480
I will go downstairs in a while.

597
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,800
Okay.

598
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,560
Who's that?

599
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,080
Why didn't you tell me?

600
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,440
I don't want to distract you.

601
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
It distracts me even more

602
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,000
by doing this.

603
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,240
I will ask someone

604
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,760
to look after him 24 hours a day.

605
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,200
24 hours?

606
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,680
Don't be so nice to him.

607
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,440
He doesn't worth it.

608
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,880
Should we tell your mom?

609
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,960
No.

610
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,840
My mother said

611
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,600
she didn't want to see him all her life.

612
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,160
All right, let's eat.

613
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,440
Hello, it's me.

614
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,480
Everything is going well.

615
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,600
Why so much trouble?

616
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,920
At least she could hate me less.

617
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,600
It's better than being turned away
as soon as we meet.

618
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,280
Whatever.

619
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,640
You have to face it directly.

620
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,880
It is useless to escape.

621
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,920
Shuangshuang.

622
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,920
Why are you back alone?

623
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,600
Where's the guest?

624
00:42:59,440 --> 00:42:59,960
I missed him.

625
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,400
Missed?

626
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,200
You missed him?

627
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,960
Why?

628
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,560
Didn't I give you the phone number?

629
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,720
No one answered.

630
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,600
No one answered the phone.

631
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,240
What?

632
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,400
