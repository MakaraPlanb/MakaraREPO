4
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,030
Are you OK?

5
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,990
Sorry.

6
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,300
I'm Korean.

7
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,470
Korean?

8
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,530
Well, are you from Korea?

9
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,630
I grew up in the US.

10
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,060
OK? So I can't speak Korean.

11
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,620
Just a little bit.

12
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,630
So...

13
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,680
Let me take you back to your room?

14
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,050
No, no, no.

15
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,620
You look, there is my room.

16
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,900
Thank you!

17
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,930
No.

18
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,640
Thank you.

19
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,950
You look so familiar.

20
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,340
Have we met before?

21
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,610
Really?

22
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,760
No. I don't think so.

23
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,670
Don't you remember me?

24
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,290
The elevator?

25
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,020
No.

26
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,360
Oh, there.

27
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,360
It's my room.

28
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,820
Hi!

29
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
Get out!

30
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,640
What?

31
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,300
You speak Chinese?

32
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,850
Good, then.

33
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,610
Easy for us

34
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,370
to communicate.

35
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,620
What are you doing?

36
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,610
I said get out!

37
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,330
Or I'll scream.

38
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,560
I own this hotel.

39
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,680
Go ahead.

40
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,470
Try and see if anyone will come and save you.

41
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,740
I said get out!

42
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,010
Are you going to

43
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,410
keep pretending?

44
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,760
Let go of me.

45
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,530
Miss Xia.

46
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,610
Get away from me.

47
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,320
Sheng Zhening!

48
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,700
I have confirmed just now.

49
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,790
This man is Xing Pingyuan

50
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,150
How about the arrangements?

51
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,450
All set. We are ready to go tomorrow.

52
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,430
Careful with the details.

53
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,010
Make it immaculate.

54
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,710
Don't worry. It will be.

55
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,730
Boss, I'm sorry.

56
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,360
I shouldn't approach Xing Pingyuan without consulting you.

57
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,380
You've been working here long enough.

58
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,520
You should know.

59
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,980
Every guest is Xing Pingyuan.

60
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,640
Indeed.

61
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,100
Boss, please don't be angry.

62
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,940
I'll write a self-criticizing statement of 5000 characters.

63
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,520
Plus one-month bonus cut.

64
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,620
For you to remember the lesson.

65
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,780
For me to remember the lesson.

66
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,490
Anything else?

67
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,100
One more thing.

68
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,200
What you did to Miss Xia today,

69
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,420
wasn't it a bit out of line?

70
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,640
I told her to go to Xing Pingyuan. You should blame me.

71
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,820
Why do you spare the plotter and go after the accessory?

72
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,280
Even...

73
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
Even...

74
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,450
did that.

75
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,600
Could it be that you fall in love with her?

76
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,880
Your annual bonus, don't you want it either?

77
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,620
I'm off, boss.

78
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,180
So many clothes at home, why are you still buying?

79
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,680
This is for tomorrow.

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
Tomorrow?

81
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,930
Yupp.

82
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,910
By the way, you need to take a day off tomorrow.

83
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,750
We are going to Tower No.2 
for a make-up oath-taking ceremony.

84
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,790
What oath-taking ceremony?

85
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:28,460
You know, our wedding was complete. 
And I need closure for that.

86
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,450
But.. too much work.

87
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,440
Not at all. I've got everything sorted.

88
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,790
You only need to show up.

89
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,770
Very well, then.

90
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,470
I'll be there.

91
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,130
Look good?

92
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,410
Nice.

93
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,240
A bit tight, tough.

94
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,550
Not at all. You look really nice.

95
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,580
My husband was born a specimen. You look good in anything.

Darling.

119
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,630
You said it's just oath-taking.

120
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,230
Right. I didn't invite anyone else.

121
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,850
Just the two of us

122
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,780

Yes. It's beautiful.

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,540
Oh hey.

127
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,890
I need to use the washroom.

128
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,070
- Right. Be quick though.
- OK.

129
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,230
Mr. He Zhijun,

130
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,560
Please deliver your oath to your beloved.

131
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,640
Some people say,

132
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,130
"I've been waiting

133
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,460
for the only matching soul in this world."

134
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,370
But I had no idea

135
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,630
how I could feel the existence of that soul.

136
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,780
Until I met you.

137
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,680
Mengmeng, You made me realize

138
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,990
that I am only complete when I'm by your side.

139
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,280
You complete my soul.

140
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,790
I've been thinking,

141
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,610
will I be happy with someone who's similar to myself,

142
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,450
or will it last longer when we have complementary traits.

143
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,850
But after we've gone through days and nights,

144
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,900
I realized

145
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,960
that it is because we're heading in the same direction

146
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,050
it didn't take long

147
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,560
for us to find each other in the world.

148
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,910
If I can only make one wish in my whole life,

149
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,480
I wish we could always find happiness

150
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,320
in the simplicity of life, just like now.

151
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,030
Miss Ning Meng, please say your vow to your love.

152
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,290
My vow is the question I'd like to ask Zhijun.

153
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,420
Zhijun.

154
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,160
Will you love me,

155
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,920
and be loyal to me until forever?

156
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,790
Of course, you're my wife.

157
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,920
I will always love you.

158
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,380
I want you to swear that if you ever betray our love,

159
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,660
you will never be happy with anyone else.

160
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,410
Zhijun!

161
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,660
Can you promise me?

162
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,890
Yes.

163
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,340
Be prepared.

164
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,440
Hold on a second!

165
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,230
Why are you here?

166
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,930
Does that have anything to do with you?

167
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,210
Now, Mr. He Zhijun, you may lift the veil

168
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,880
and kiss your bride.

169
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,060
What happened?

170
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,220
The elevator broke down. Call someone.

171
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,570
Bro... What's happening to you?

172
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,220
Hey, dude.

173
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,040
There's no signal.

174
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,500
- What's wrong? 
 - What happened?

175
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,690
I have claustrophobia.

176
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,430
What do we do?

177
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,150
See if he's alright.

178
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,870
Hey, dude. Are you alright?

179
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,570
- Hi. 
 - What happened?

180
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,320
The circuit broke down. GM Sheng is trapped in the elevator.

181
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,060
I can't wake him up!

182
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,180
Hey. What are you doing? Hey!

183
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,350
Artificial respiration.

184
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,300
No! Hey!

185
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,980
Why? Why not?

186
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,430
You just can't. Hey, no! I mean it!

187
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,160
I'll do it!

188
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,220
Brother!

189
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,050
The door is open.

190
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,480
Sheng Zhening!

191
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,650
Anybody hurt?

192
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,110
- Brother! 
 - Help the injured guy get out first!

193
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,690
Brother! Are you okay?

194
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,590
Help my brother get out! Please!

195
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,920
Take it slow, dude.

196
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,170
Help my brother get out! Now!

197
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,580
Take it slow. Be careful.

198
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,370
Brother! Hold on to it!

199
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,960
Be quick! Save my brother now!

200
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,640
Here, hurry up.

201
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,620
Xia Qian!

202
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,300
- Brother! 
 - Xia Qian!

203
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
Hurry up! Be quick!

204
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,990
What happened?

205
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,040
I've no idea.

206
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,370
You're unsafe here. Come over.

207
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,280
Lean your head and your back against the wall.

208
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,550
Bend your knees, just as I'm doing.

209
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,990
Are you scared?

210
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,400
I'm not really scared.

211
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,810
I'm just thinking that if anything happens,

212
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,690
there will be a lot of regrets in my life.

213
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,220
What regrets?

214
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,180
A lot of them.

215
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,690
For example,

216
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,660
I haven't seen the aurora yet.

217
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,280
I want to take my mom to a Michelin restaurant.

218
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,390
And I haven't met a boy who could sing a love song for me.

219
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,020
What songs do you want to hear?

220
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,580
Why? Are you singing it for me?

221
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,330
Why not? It'll take some time before we get rescued.

222
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,570
Alright, you can sing a song. That will fulfill one of my wishes.

223
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,720
♫ <i> Having each simple day in our hands </i> ♫

224
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,850

237
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,240
Not anymore.

238
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,460
Thank you.

239
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,760
You're welcome.

240
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,330
Old fashioned.

241
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,350
That song is too old. Between the two of us...

242
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,920
What? Sheng Zhening got trapped in the elevator?

243
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,760
He's already out. He's fine now.

244
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,630
Is that how you do it?

245
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,300
I'm sorry, Vice GM Qin. I should have been more thoughtful.

246
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,560
But there's one more thing that I haven't told you.

247
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,980
I've scheduled Ning Meng's wedding vow ceremony today as well.

248
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,820
Who told you that you can do it without my permission?

249
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,050
This is the only way we can deny our involvement.

250
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,960
Vice GM Qin. More and more shareholders are now aware of it.

251
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,790
I think they will hold a shareholder's meeting soon.

252
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,020
So I think you should get ready for it.

253
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,920
You can leave now.

254
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,420
Come in.

255
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,940
GM Sheng, someone is looking for you.

256
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,970
Thank you so much for saving me yesterday.

257
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,520
I heard that you performed...

258
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,530
some first-aid measures on me.

259
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,160
I'm sorry that Evergreen has brought you so many troubles.

260
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,080
Thank you.
Please have a seat.

261
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,930
Anan, make some tea.

262
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,810
To tell you the truth, I am the rater of your hotel this time.

263
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,170
The incident that happened in Building 2 was supposed to cause a star drop.

264
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:38,100
But, Evergreen Hotel is indeed the most comfortable and the most customer-oriented hotel I've stayed in.

265
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,110
To put it simply, the service is up to our standard.

266
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,620
But the facility itself does need an upgrade.

267
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,080
GM Sheng, if you're willing to renovate Building 2,

268
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,550
I may consider not to report the result of the rating this time.

269
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,250
After the renovation is done,

270
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,380
I'll come back and visit again.

271
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,920
Thank you.

272
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,280
I don't agree with the idea of renovating Building No.2!

273
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,380
Neither do I.

274
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,240
The revenue of Building No.2 has never been ideal.

275
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,020
It's not worth it to invest a lot of money and renovate it.

276
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,120
We should sell Building No.2 soon

277
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
while it's still functioning.

278
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,270
At least we can cut the loss in time.

279
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,420
Indeed.

280
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,900
We can't sell Building No.2.

281
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,510
I don't agree with the idea of selling it.

282
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,450
Building No.2 is where our business started.

283
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,130
It's also the icon of Evergreen.

284
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,970
If we sell it now,

285
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,870
we're telling our peers in the industry that Evergreen is going downhill.

286
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,240
It's too much of a price for us.

287
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,310
This is not worth it.

288
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,660
That makes sense.

289
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,790
I don't think we should renovate Building No.2 now either.

290
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,170
We haven't figured out how much it would cost to renovate Building No.2,

291
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,110
but it's definitely a huge amount.

292
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,430
So I think we should

293
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,410
think long-term.

294
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,330
It makes sense.

295
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,990
If that's the case,

296
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,550
The renovation fee for Building No.2

297
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,990
will be paid by myself.

298
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,400
It's not a small amount.

299
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,620
Zhening!

300
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,000
I know that Building No.2 is very important to you.

301
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,350
But I think you're going too far down your own way.

302
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,780
I understand.

303
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,740
But I have to protect Building No.2

304
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,080
You're going against the shareholders.

305
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,850
This will make it difficult for you to manage the hotel in the future.

306
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,260
What's more,

307
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,330
there are many uncertainties that will affect the renovation of Building No.2

308
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,640
If you put all your money into it,

309
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,520
what if anything unexpected happens?

310
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,580
To play it safe,

311
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,450
I think you should sell Building No.2.

312
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,430
Brother Hebo.

313
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,010
Rationally, I agree with what you said.

314
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,970
But emotionally, I can't agree.

315
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,750
You know that Building No.2 was built by my father.

316
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,790
It was very important to him.

317
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,070
My dad's now gone,

318
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,770
and I should be the one protecting Building No.2 for him.

319
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,070
Besides, the shareholders don't want to renovate Building No.2

320
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,750
only because it's a long-term investment,

321
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,900
and can't make a profit in the short run.

322
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,350
But if you look at the long-term goal,

323
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,790
the benefits of renovating Building No.2

324
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,250
outweighs the drawbacks for Evergreen, for sure.

325
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,190
I understand.

326
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,250
I respect your decision.

327
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,470
Hey, who do you think the girl is?

328
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,200
That girlfriend of GM Sheng?

329
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,320
Hello, GM Sheng!

330
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
GM Sheng.

331
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,210
It's all in the flashdrive.

332
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,260
What about the computer?

333
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,750

You haven't been eating for quite a few days, right?

340
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,400
This should be enough for you.

Why don't you come down and eat?

He should be responsible for you as your adopter.

Right?

345
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,170
We should scold him!

346
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,070
If he's not giving you food, I will.

347
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,200
I'm so sorry.

359
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,490
You should worry about yourself instead.

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,310
The press is utterly pervasive.

364
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,680
You sold the cars and the apartment,

365
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,360
how are you going to live your life?

366
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,080
<i> [Are you alright?] </i>

367
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,650
Why are you sitting here?

368
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,660
What happened to you?

369
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,310
Isn't that obvious?

370
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,090
Is that yours?

371
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,880
Can I have a look?

372
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,690
I thought you usually stay in your hotel.

373
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,010
Now it's the peak season of the hotel.

374
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,100
The rooms are limited,

375
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,590
and because we're renovating Building No.2,

376
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,500
I just don't want to waste the resources of the hotel because of personal reasons.

377
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,870
How about your friends?

378
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,160
I guess you can stay at their place for a few days.

379
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,800
I don't have any friends.

380
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,560
Stop sitting here.

381
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,660
I'll pay for the hotel room for you.

382
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,410
I don't have my ID card with me.

383
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,550
I lost it. Didn't have a chance to get a new one yet.

384
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,920
Oh.

385
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,350
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

386
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,720
You should go home.

387
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,080
I‘ll just make do with this bench

388
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,290
for tonight.

389
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,010
Really, I'm fine.

390
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,100
Dinner!

391
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,560
Breakfast for tomorrow.

392
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,500
Lunch.

393
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,000
And dinner.

394
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,980
I'll just eat these.

395
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,840
I've run out of hot water too.

396
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,200
Well, I still have to eat.

397
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I'll just eat it.

398
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,510
I'll eat the noodles dry.

399
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,970
There's an extra room at my place.

400
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,600
I can clean it up and you can stay there.

401
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,600
- Do you mind? 
 - That's so inconvenient.

402
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm a girl, I don't even mind.

403
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
What's inconvenient for you?

404
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,780
Let's go.

405
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,530
Hurry up. Pack your stuff.

406
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,940
Okay? Be quick.

407
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,660
<i> [GM of Evergreen Group Sells All His Assets for Hotel Renovation] </i>

408
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,990
I'm surprised that GM Sheng would do that to himself.

409
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,790
Vice GM Qin. What's our next step?

410
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,300
If Building No.2 is renovated,

411
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,130
it will be even harder for us to sell it.

412
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,060
The renovation is such a big project.

413
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,050
It wouldn't be easy to do it well.

414
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,280
Come in.

415
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,320
Put it down.

416
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,460
Have a seat anywhere you like.

417
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,670
I'll clean up the room for you.

418
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,670
Done. The room's ready for you.

419
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,700
You can stay in the guest room.

420
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,270
OK.

421
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,880
I might have to stay here until I receive my salary next month.

422
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,450
It's OK.

423
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,880
Thanks.
Of course.

424
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,680
You and I are sort of

425
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,700
friends in need.

426
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,820
I’m staying at my friend's place.

427
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,360
Is the room big enough?

428
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,630
It should be...

429
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,960
30 square meters?

430
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,050
How about the bed?

431
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,770
The bed? It's not bad.

432
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,190
Don't worry about me.

433
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,860
Okay. Good night, brother.

434
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,240
What is it?

435
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,390
Um... before you go to sleep,

436
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,220
you better lock the door.

437
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,580
Shouldn't it be women who lock the door?

438
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,730
Why are you asking me?

439
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:54,310
No reason. Just do it.

440
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,630
Excuse me, how much is this watermelon?

441
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,380
It moves!

442
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,890
- What are you doing?
- Don't move!

443
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,840
I vaguely remember craving watermelon.

444
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,420
Then the watermelon got away. And I went to catch it.

445
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,430
I'm sorry.

446
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,320
I didn't tell you that I sleepwalk.

447
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,310
But you know, how could I bring that up?

448
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,690
Besides, I've already warned you to lock up. You didn't listen.

449
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,380
Do you still want to live here?

450
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,760
Fine.

451
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,960
I'll lock up.

452
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,950
I know you still think of Xia Qian.

453
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,060
Didn't I explain to you the other day? 
Why is it still bothering you?

454
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,120
I know, I said her name, and that bothers you.

455
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,470
Yes, I am not over her yet.

456
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,800
Momo, whatever caused our breakup,

457
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,300
we were together before. She is not a complete stranger to me.

458
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,940
It's a normal reaction.

459
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,350
Tell me, if that day the elevator dropped and I had no reaction, what would you think?

460
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,420
Think it through.

461
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,350
I understand it all. It's just I love you too much.

462
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,450
I don't like that you care for someone else.

463
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,220
I understand that.

464
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,930
Tell me, then,

465
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,560
what can I do to make you happy?

466
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,230
Can you stop seeing her?

467
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,820
- Fine.
- Really?

468
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,310
- Really. I won't see her again.
- I love you, darling.

469
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,210
Time to go.

470
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,750
Darling, can't you stay?

471
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,700
Didn't you promise to spend more time with me?

472
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,090
Mengmeng, we had two weddings. I already took too much leave.

473
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,220
Okay...

474
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,580
Good girl. Tonight I'll cook.

475
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,300
- I'm off.
- Go!

476
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,590
Sis, I got you breakfast. Do you want it upstairs or downstairs?

477
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,070
No...quick!

478
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,130
- What?
- Mu Xiaoyan might come up.

479
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,160
Why is he here?

480
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,210
If he knows that we live together, I can never come clean of this.

481
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,690
Hurry up.

482
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,360
Sis!

483
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:41,420
I'll take him downstairs. You sneak out from the backdoor.

484
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,910
Coming.

485
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,570
- What is it?
- Ta-da!

486
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,090
I got you some stuffed buns.

487
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,200
I'll put them here. Let me wash my hand first.

488
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,030
- What's wrong?
- You can't. The tap isn't working.

489
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,810
- Don't worry. I can fix it.
- I'll do it.

490
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,060
Let's eat.

491
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,180
You bought so many. Let's eat downstairs.

492
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,480
- No vinegar downstairs.
- Then eat them plain.

493
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,070
Go, go, go.

494
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,600
I'm starving.

495
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,420
You go ahead. I need to fetch something.

496
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,830
Hurry!

497
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,420
Hurry up!

498
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,170
What is it?

499
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,970
I don't know why...

500
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,700
This morning I'm really sleepy. I'm letting some fresh air in.

501
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,370
Come and eat.

502
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,730
Hurry, they are getting cold.

503
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,890
I might just see Sheng in the courtyard. That tall guy.

504
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,530
What was he doing here?

505
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,880
How could it be? You were mistaken.

506
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,920
- What filling?<>- It's your favorite.

507
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,310
Great!

508
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,680
Oh, right.

509
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,680
My mom asked me to bring something over.

510
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,530
Mo Xiaoyan, give me your car key.

511
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,310
Thanks!

512
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,570
You never let me use it.

513
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,990
Get in.

514
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,350
You won't find a taxi at this time. I'll drive you.

515
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,790
Before you go home, let me know first.

516
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,380
Make sure Mo Xiaoyan and the lot don't see you.

517
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,010
I really don't mind you staying over.

518
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,570
Just don't let them know. If my mom finds out, I'll be dead.

519
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,400
Really? That serious? We come and go.

520
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,060
Eventually, they'll see us. You can't hide it forever.

521
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,370
You do as I say.

522
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,360
Fine.

523
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,120
Don't forget.
