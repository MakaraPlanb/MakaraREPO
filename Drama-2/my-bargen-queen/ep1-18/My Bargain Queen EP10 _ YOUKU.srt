[Episode 10]

3
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,150
Are you okay?

4
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,150
Sorry.

5
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,320
I am Korean.

6
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:01,990
Korean?

7
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,510
Are you a Korean friend?

8
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,840
I grew up in the U.S, okay?

9
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,200
So I can't speak Korean.

10
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,870
Just a little bit.

11
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,350
So

12
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,680
let me take you back to the room?

13
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,840
No. No. No.

14
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,870
Look.

15
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,560
There is my room.

16
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,590
Thank you.

17
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,630
No.

18
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,560
Thank you.

19
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,790
You look so familiar.

20
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,510
Have we met before?

21
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,510
Really?

22
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,590
No. I don't think so.

23
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,150
Don't you remember me?

24
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,990
In the elevator?

25
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,350
No.

26
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,430
Oh, there.

27
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,150
It's my room.

28
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,999
Can I?

29
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,070
Get out.

30
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
You speak Chinese?

31
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,030
Great.

32
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,720
In this way, it will be much easier

33
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,470
for us to communicate.

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,680
What are you doing?

35
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,400
I asked you to get out.

36
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,230
Did you hear me?

37
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,790
I'll call someone if you don't go out.

38
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,790
This whole hotel is mine.

39
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,350
Go ahead.

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,310
Just try.

41
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,880
See if anyone comes to rescue you.

42
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,630
I asked you to get out.

43
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you going to

44
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
continue to pretend?

45
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,030
Let me go.

46
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,440
Miss Xia.

47
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,880
Get up.

48
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,230
Sheng Zhening.

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,470
Just confirmed.

50
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,840
This person is the hotel reviewer.

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,470
How is the arrangement?

52
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,000
It's all arranged.

53
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,230
It can be implemented tomorrow.

54
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,030
Make it neat

55
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,190
and clean.

56
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,750
Don't worry.

57
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,630
There will be no problems.

58
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,280
Mr. Sheng, it's my fault.

59
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,190
I shouldn't have gone to the hotel reviewer

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,280
on my own.

61
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,910
You have been in the hotel
for so long,

62
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,190
you should know that

63
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,070
every guest is a reviewer.

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,560
Yes.

65
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,440
Mr. Sheng.

66
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,960
Calm down.

67
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,000
I will write a five-thousand-word
self-criticism when I go back.

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,560
Plus one month's bonus deducted.

69
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
To teach you a lesson.

70
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,790
To teach me a lesson.

71
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,230
Anything else?

72
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,310
One more little thing.

73
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,630
Did you go too far

74
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,960
with Miss Xia today?

75
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,070
I asked her to find the hotel reviewer.

76
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,510
I am the one to blame.

77
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,910
You left the mastermind alone

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,470
and tortured an accessory.

79
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,910
And you even

80
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,790
did that

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,600
to her.

82
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,600
Do you like Miss Xia?

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,790
Don't you want the year-end bonus?

84
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,400
I am leaving, boss.

85
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,440
I have so many clothes at home.

86
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
Why buying me a piece
of clothes again?

87
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
This is for tomorrow.

88
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,310
Tomorrow?

89
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,440
Yes.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,630
By the way,

91
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,600
I need you to ask for a leave tomorrow.

92
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,120
Tomorrow,

93
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,470
let's go to building No.2

94
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,440
to make vows.

95
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,790
What vows?

96
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,910
As you know,

97
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,510
the incompleteness of our wedding

98
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,350
has always made me feel uncomfortable.

99
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,230
Well…

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,510
But it's troublesome.

101
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,310
Not at all. I got everything ready.

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,790
You just have to be there tomorrow.

103
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,160
All right.

104
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,560
It's up to you.

105
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,350
Is it nice?

106
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,840
Yes.

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,120
It just seems a bit tight.

108
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,600
Not at all.

There is a saying like this.

I have been waiting for

the only soul in the world
that fits with me.

153
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,990
But I always wondered

154
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,400
how I could perceive

155
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,480
the existence of the soul

156
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,750
until I met you.

157
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,310
Meng.

158
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,430

You complete my soul.

162
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,670
I used to doubt

163
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,920
whether two people with similar personalities

164
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,840
will be happier,

165
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,110
or the complementarity
of personalities will last longer.

166
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,630
But after what we have gone through,

167
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,870
I found that

168
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,310
it's because we have the same direction,

169
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,670
we can find each other so quickly

170
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,510

171
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600

172
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,630
in this life,

173
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,360
I only hope that we can go on

174
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,070
as simple and happy

175
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,240

Ms. Ning Meng.

177
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
Please tell your lover

178
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,070

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,480

180
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,160
what I want to ask Zhijun.

181
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,280
Zhijun.

182
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920

184
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,920
forever?

185
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,990
Of course.

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,070
You are my wife.

187

you and others

191
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,630
will never be happy.

Zhijun.

193
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,480
Can you do it?

194
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,870
Yes.

195
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,360
Ready.

196
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,310
Hold on.

197
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,280
Why are you here?

198
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,920
Does it have anything to do with you?

199
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,870
Now, Mr. He Zhijun,

200
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,840
you can lift the veil

201
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,840
and kiss your bride.

202
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,960
What's wrong?

203
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,630
The elevator broke down.

204
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,160
Make a call.

205
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,280
Brother, what's wrong with you?

206
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,750
Brother.

207
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,190
No signal.

208
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,670
What's wrong?

209
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,240
What's wrong?

210
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,600
I have claustrophobia.

211
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,670
What can we do?

212
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:44,990
Take a look.

213
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,360
Brother.

214
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,670
Are you okay?

215
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:54,960
Hello.

216
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,630
What's wrong?

217
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,160
The circuit is broken.

218
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,280
Mr. Sheng is trapped in the elevator.

219
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,920
He can't wake up.

220
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,720
What are you doing?

221
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,160
Artificial respiration.

222
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,040
No.

223
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,630
Why not?

224
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,920
No reason.

225
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,670
Just don't do that.

226
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,240
Let me do this.

227
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,110
Brother.

228
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,040
The door is open.

229
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,750
Sheng Zhening.

230
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,630
Is anyone injured inside?

231
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,070
Brother.

232
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,160
Send the wounded up first.

233
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,110
Brother, are you okay?

234
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,600
He is awake.

235
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,510
Save my brother.

236
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,360
Hurry up.

237
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,600
Take care, brother.

238
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,070
Slow down.

239
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,630
Save my brother. Hurry up.

240
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,790
Slow down.

241
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,790
Be careful.

242
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,070
Brother, hold on.

243
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,069
Hurry up.

244
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,759
Save my brother. Hurry up.

245
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,520
Hurry up.

246
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,520
Xia Qian.

247
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,309
- Brother!
- Xia Qian!

248
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,639
Come on.

249
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,720
What happened?

250
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,430
No idea.

251
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,880
It's not safe.

252
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,270
Come over.

253
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,120
Keep your head and back close to the wall.

254
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,430
Bend your knees slightly.

255
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,270
Do the same as me.

256
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,030
Are you afraid?

257
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,360
Not exactly.

258
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,120
I am scared

259
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,360
because I feel that

260
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,360
if something happens,

261
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,390
there are still many regrets in my life.

262
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,600
What regrets?

263
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,000
So many.

264
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,150
Such as,

265
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,150
I haven't seen aurora.

266
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,190
I want to take my mother
to a Michelin restaurant.

267
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,190
No boy

268
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,390
has ever sang love songs to me.

269
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,910
What song do you want to listen to?

270
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,190
Are you going to sing?

271
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,390
What if I am?

272
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,640
Anyway, we can't get out for a while.

273
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,070
All right, go ahead.

274
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,310
You are fulfilling one of my wishes.

Not anymore.

291
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,000
Thank you.

292
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,000
You are welcome.

293
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,270
Out of fashion.

294
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,910
The song is out of fashion.

295
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,270
Between us…

296
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:31,960
What?

297
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,720
Sheng Zhening is trapped in the elevator?

298
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,840
He is already out.

299
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,520
And he is fine now.

300
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,310
What did you do?

301
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,550
Sorry, Mr. Qin.

302
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,240
I am not thoughtful enough.

303
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,600
But there is one thing

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I haven't told you yet.

305
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,480
I also arranged the ceremony

306
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,760
for Ms. Ning Meng today.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,720
Why did you do this without permission?

308
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,550
Only in this way

309
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,840
can we distance ourselves from it.

310
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,310
Mr. Qin.

311
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,480
Shareholders are now successively

312
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,790
aware of this.

313
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,030
The shareholders meeting
should be held soon.

314
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,190
So you'd better get ready.

315
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,840
Leave me.

316
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,310
Please come in.

317
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,760
Mr. Sheng.

318
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,910
Someone's looking for you.

319
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,070
Thank you so much for saving me yesterday.

320
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,270
I heard that you also

321
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,480
gave me first-aid treatment.

322
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,120
We are the one

323
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,190
who caused you trouble.

324
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,390
Thank you.

325
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:15,840
Take a seat.

326
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,600
An An.

327
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,910
Make a cup of tea.

328
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,150
To tell you the truth,

329
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,070
I am the hotel reviewer

330
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,720
for your hotel this time.

331
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,600
[Li Zhipeng]

332
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,480
It stands to reason that
Evergreen would be downgraded

333
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,430
because of the accident in building No.2.

334
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,840
But

335
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,310
Evergreen Hotel

336
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,960
is indeed the most comfortable

337
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,270
and people-oriented hotel
I have ever stayed in.

338
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,310
In short,

339
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,910
the service reaches the standard.

340
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,790
But the hardware facilities

341
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,190
do need to be optimized.

342
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,030
If Mr. Sheng is willing to

343
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,430
renovate building No.2,

344
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,070
I can consider not

345
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,960
to report the results of the rating.

346
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,670
I will investigate again

347
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,310
after you complete the renovation.

348
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,390
Thank you.

349
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,150
I disagree with the renovation
of building No.2.

350
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,150
Neither do I.

351
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,070
Building No.2's turnover
has been unsatisfactory.

352
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,670
If we invest a large sum of money
in renovation,

353
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,840
it will be not worth the candle.

354
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,030
Now that there is no major problem

355
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,150
with it,

356
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,790
we should sell it immediately.

357
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,640
At the very least,
we can cut loss in time.

358
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,240
Yes, it's better to sell it.

359
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,070
Sell it.

360
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,550
Building No.2 can't be sold.

361
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,360
I don't agree with that.

362
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,960
Building No.2

363
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,790
is our start-up building

364
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,030
and also symbol of Evergreen.

365
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,640
Selling building No.2 now

366
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,190
is equivalent to telling other peers

367
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,190
that Evergreen is ailing.

368
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,030
It's to kill the goose
that lays the golden eggs.

369
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,070
And the loss outweighs the gain.

370
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,310
It makes sense.

371
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,670
Right.

372
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,190
I disagree with the reconstruction
of building No.2 now.

373
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,150
The cost of refurbishing building No.2

374
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,120
hasn't been calculated yet,

375
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,790
but it must be a lot of money.

376
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,070
So I suggest that we should

377
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,840
take the long view on this issue.

378
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,670
Exactly.

379
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,910
Mr. Qin's analysis makes sense.

380
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,360
How long do we have to wait?

381
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,030
Yes.

382
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,150
In this case,

383
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,360
I will personally fund

384
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
the renovation cost of building No.2.

there are too many uncertainties

You should be clear that

411

Building No.2 was built by my dad,

412

In addition,

417
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
the shareholders don't want
to renovate building No.2,

418
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,600
simply because the investment cycle
is relatively long

419
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,910

00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,320
Also, I have reminded you

577
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,960
to lock the door.

578
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,830
But you didn't lock yourself.

579
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,390
Would you still live in my house?

580
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,000
All right.

581
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,760
I will lock the door.

582
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,800
I know

583
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,040
you still care about Xia Qian
in the bottom your heart.

584
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,670
I explained it to you that day.

585
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,870
Why do you still care about this?

586
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,430
I know.

587
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,320
What you care about is that
I called Xia Qian that day.

588
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,350
Yes, I admit that

589
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,430
I still care about her.

590
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,080
Meng.

591
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,960
No matter why we broke up,

592
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,560
we were together before.

593
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,760
I can't have no feelings for her.

594
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,190
This is the emotion

595
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,150
of all normal people.

596
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,430
Tell me.

597
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,040
If the elevator fell down that day

598
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,280
and I had no reaction at all,

599
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
what would you think?

600
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,350
Think about it.

601
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,830
I understand.

602
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,280
I just love you so much.

603
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,040
If you care about other girls,

604
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,430
I feel uncomfortable.

605
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,110
I can understand your emotions

606
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,520
and your feelings.

607
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,960
Tell me.

608
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,080
What should I do

609
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,190
to make you happy?

610
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,720
Can you never

611
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,870
see her again?

612
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:00,870
Okay.

613
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,430
Really?

614
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,280
Yes, I will never see her again.

615
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,350
Darling, I love you.

616
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,320
I should go to work.

617
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,190
It's almost time.

618
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,910
Darling.

619
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,720
Can you not go to work?

620
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,870
You promised

621
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,560
to stay with me more at home.

622
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,390
Meng.

623
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,960
We had two weddings in total.

624
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,080
I took too many days off

625
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,960
to do this again.

626
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,480
All right.

627
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,760
Listen to me.

628
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,480
I'll come back to cook for you at night.

629
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,430
Okay.

630
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,320
I am leaving.

631
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,080
Go ahead.

632
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,559
[Mu Xiaoyan]

633
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,800
Qian.

634
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
I bought breakfast.

635
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,560
Are you eating upstairs or downstairs?

636
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,590
My gosh.

637
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:08,910
Come on.

638
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,800
What?

639
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,150
Mu Xiaoyan might go upstairs.

640
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,480
Why is he here?

641
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,280
As long as Mu Xiaoyan knows that

642
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
I live with you,

643
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,630
I can't make myself clear.

644
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,720
Come on.

645
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,350
Qian.

646
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,960
I will take Mu Xiaoyan downstairs.

647
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,040
You should go from behind.

648
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,720
Coming.

649
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,390
What's up?

650
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,870
I bought buns specially for you.

651
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,480
I will put them here.

652
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,280
I am going to wash my hands.

653
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,830
What's wrong?

654
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,670
You can't wash hands here.

655
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,830
The faucet is broken.

656
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,960
It's okay, I can fix it for you.

657
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,430
I know how.

658
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,110
Eat buns.

659
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,560
So many.

660
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,760
Let's eat downstairs.

661
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,430
No vinegar downstairs.

662
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,520
Just eat it.

663
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,630
Let's go.

664
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,390
Let's go.

665
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,520
I am starving.

666
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,320
Go ahead.

667
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,040
I will go get something.

668
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,520
Okay.

669
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,630
Come on.

670
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,110
Come on.

671
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,630
I am leaving.

672
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,670
Hurry up.

673
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,190
What's wrong, Qian?

674
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,800
I am very sleepy

675
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,800
this morning.

676
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,190
Just to get some fresh air.

677
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,720
Come over and eat.

678
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,670
Hurry up. The buns are getting cold.

679
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,280
I seemed to see Mr. Sheng of Evergreen

680
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,240
in the courtyard just now.

681
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,960
So tall.

682
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,480
Why is he here?

683
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,720
How come?

684
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,960
Your eyes were playing tricks on you.

685
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,190
Really?

686
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,110
What stuffing?

687
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,150
Your favorite.

688
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,390
Great!

689
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,190
It occurred to me that

690
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,480
my mom asked me to send her something.

691
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,280
Mu Xiaoyan.

692
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,760
Give me your car key.

693
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,670
The car key.

694
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,280
Thanks.

695
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,590
I am leaving.

696
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,670
You never lend me.

697
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,040
Get on the car.

698
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,390
You can't get a taxi now.

699
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,280
I will send you there.

700
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,560
Tell me in advance

701
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,870
when you come home from work.

702
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,430
Don't let Mu Xiaoyan see you.

703
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Actually, it doesn't matter to me

704
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,560
that you live in my house.

705
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,320
Just don't let them know.

706
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,560
If my mom knows about it,
I am done.

707
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,830
Why so nervous?

708
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,520
I will inevitably run into them
when I go to and from get off work.

709
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,280
We can't hide it.

710
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,240
You have to listen to me.

711
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,390
Completely.

712
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,000
Got it.

713
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,190
