00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,960
<i> Episode 12 </i>

4
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Have you had dinner?

5
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,640
Eat some more.

6
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,590
Sheng Zhening.

7
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,470
I have to say something nice about you. What I read from the novels

8
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,460
is that the GMs are never busy with anything.

9
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,260
Well, they don't really do anything

10
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,380
apart from dating the heroine.

11
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,340
But that changed after I've met you.

12
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,120
A GM really does have a lot of things to worry about.

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,510
There are problems that he can't solve.

14
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,640
I'm sorry for breaking your

15
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,050
imagination about GMs.

16
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,390
No.

17
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,680
I think this is great. You feel more approachable.

18
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,750
Approachable?

19
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah.

20
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,070
Approachable, from a creative writing perspective,

21
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,710
if you're a character from the novel,

22
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,600
then a GM like you will be more down-to-earth.

23
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,930
Really.

24
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,600
Have some food.

25
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,540
I've really had dinner already.

26
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,030
<i> [Mom] </i>

27
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,970
It's my mom.

28
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,320
Mom.

29
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,630
<i> Qianqian, ask Sheng to go to work later today. </i>

30
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,220
<i> I've brought some chicken soup for you. </i>

31
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,890
She's bringing some chicken soup for us. Stop eating.

32
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,970
You can go down and go to work first. I'll be downstairs later.

33
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,110
Why? I like chicken soup.

34
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,660
Hey. Wake up!

35
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,110
Are you not done acting before my mom's eyes?

36
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,550
Hurry up. She'll be nagging a lot.

37
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,830
Stop eating and clean up.

38
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,650
No. I want chicken soup.

39
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,740
Sheng Zhening!

40
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,630
Qian! Are you there?

41
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,040
It's Mo Xiaoyan.

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,230
I'll go.

43
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,610
Qian!

44
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,820
What are you doing?

45
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,490
Qian! Are you there?

46
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,700
What's up? I'm changing my clothes.

47
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,560
I've brought the monthly finance report for you.

48
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,860
Well, put it in the office downstairs. I'll go down and review it.

49
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,910
Qian, are you alright?

50
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,580
I hear a man's voice.

51
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm watching a TV drama.

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,640
OK, I'll put it downstairs.

53
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,540
What are you doing? I'll go down first and you can find a chance later. OK?

54
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,010
- Hey. 
 - Hey!

55
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,440
Aunt Liping. I'll help you.

56
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,620
Come with me!

57
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,090
What a coincidence!

58
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,080
Here, come on in!

59
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
Let me introduce. This is Sheng,

60
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,670
He's Xia Qian's boyfriend and the GM of Evergreen Hotel.

61
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,050
- Auntie. 
 - Time for some chicken soup!

62
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,390
Great, let's have some soup.

63
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,560
- What did she mean? You are... 
 - Shh.

64
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,950
We're pretending. We pretend to be a couple.

65
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,490
Mu Xiaoyan, no matter what happens,

66
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,600
You must keep the secret for me.

67
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,590
But there's no need for you to live together if you're pretending!

68
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,370
We're not living together! We're sharing the apartment.

69
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,300
I don't believe you.

70
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,450
I don't care.

71
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,830
You must say nothing and ask nothing before my mom.

72
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,190
It's absolutely delicious!

73
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,870
The chicken soup from our hotel can't compare.

74
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,310
Have some more if you like it.

75
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,790
Sit here, Xiaoyan.

76
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,950
You should have some too.

77
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,390
Qianqian.

78
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,390
Here, have some soup.

79
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,080
Do you like it?

80
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,180
The chicken soup made by my mom is the best.

81
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,390
Sheng.

82
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,550
May I ask, when do you wish to have a child with Xia Qian?

83
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,550
I've finally made it clear.

84
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,950
I told Xiaoyan we're just pretending to be a couple.

85
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,590
Why do you have to explain it to him?

86
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,800
Of course. It's easier for you. You won't need to hide from him.

87
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,520
I think that even if one more person knows we're pretending,

88
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,150
there's an extra risk of being exposed.

89
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,410
Don't worry about it.

90
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,380
I've warned him. He dares not.

91
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,570
Hurry up. Or you'll miss the No.11 Bus.

92
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,630
- OK. 
 - See you!

93
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,490
- Hey, what's up? 
 - We have a problem.

94
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,720
The customs found pests in the wood imported from Africa,

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,530
termites, jewel beetles, and the seeds of invasive plants.

96
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,610
Did the customs tell us how they will deal with it?

97
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,340
They will quarantine and destroy the problematic wood directly.

98
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,000
In that case,

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,290
we can't keep up with the renovation schedule.

100
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,930
I don't have enough money to buy new wood.

101
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,830
The renovation for Evergreen Building 2 has stopped?

102
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,020
When I did the budget comparison, how come it didn't

103
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,840
occur to me that there's a risk of termites in the wood?

104
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,640
If it's written on the report, maybe they wouldn't have bought it.

105
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,120
It's not your fault.

106
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
That batch of wood was indeed the most cost-effective option.

107
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,730
But who knew this would happen?

108
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,420
But...

109
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,040
I should have been very sensitive about those details.

110
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,330
<i> I'll come home later today. </i>

111
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,320
<i> Don't wait for me for dinner. </i>

112
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,050
<i> This is the gift for you. </i>

113
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,710
<i> I'm sorry. You've made a mistake. We're not a couple. </i>

114
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,610
<i> She's... She's my little sister.</i>

115
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,100
How much have you been drinking?

116
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,540
Stop drinking! Have some clams. It helps you sober up.

117
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,400
What happened? Did anyone break your heart?

118
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,550
You're nodding and shaking your head.

119
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,590
Did anyone break your heart or not?

120
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,640
It's unrequited love. Does that count?

121
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,580
Unrequited...

122
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,900
Yes, of course.

123
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,400
But that's not a big deal.

124
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,380
You can still find someone better.

125
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,080
Look at Qian. She's now with Sheng.

126
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,540
He's excellent in every way.

127
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,880
Although Qian and Sheng Zhening are just pretending,

128
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,250
but they may grow attached to each other. And they share an apartment.

129
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,720
It's sooner or later that she‘ll rise to the bait!

130
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,790
What did you say? They're pretending to be a couple?

131
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,390
Qian asked me to not tell you. Don't tell her.

132
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
You're back.

133
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,240
How did it go? Is everything alright?

134
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,730
- Yeah. 
 - What about the renovation?

135
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,750
- Can they still proceed? 
 - Yeah.

136
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,950
Is there any solution?

137
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Don't worry. It's not a big deal. I can work it out.

138
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,540
It's time to rest.

139
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,700
The other day, I was outside the door

140
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,000
and heard what you and Mr. Song were talking about.

141
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,450
I know that you want to become the GM of Evergreen.

142
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,630
What do you think, then?

143
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,850
I can let you have the position of the GM.

144
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,970
When the car accident happened to my dad and Mengmeng, you were the one who saved Mengmeng.

145
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,910
All these years, you're the one who's always been helping me.

146
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,310
You helped me grow to become a professional hotel manager.

147
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,360
Brother Hebo.

148
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,220
Compared with the position of the Evergreen GM,

149
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,900
I think our friendship values more.

150
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,960
I've just been doing my part.

151
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,760
I mean it.

152
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,460
Over the years, I've always been grateful to you.

153
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,560
This is not an impulsive decision.

154
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,420
Objectively, you're capable of being the GM.

155
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,180
There's one more thing.

156
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,150
I believe you know that there are termites in the wood we bought for the renovation.

157
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,870
I don't have enough money to buy new ones for now.

158
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:42,030
If you become the GM, I hope you can convince all the shareholders to renovate Building No.2

159
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,980
Is Building No.2 that important?

160
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,460
Very important indeed.

161
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,390
Is that the strings attached?

162
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,330
It is my request.

163
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,510
OK. I'll do my best.

164
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,110
Shareholders, I'm going to make an announcement today.

165
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,040
From today on,

166
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,150
I will resign from the position as the GM of Evergreen.

167
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,320
Vice GM Qin will take my place

168
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,770
as the new GM.

169
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,890
I will fully dedicate myself to Evergreen

170
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,890
and I hope to have your support.

171
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,550
Then let's discuss the plan of renovating Building No.2

172
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,410
What? You're helping Sheng Zhening renovate Building No.2?

173
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,110
Yes. The shareholders agreed.

174
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,490
Why would you do that?

175
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,350
Whether or not we can acquire Evergreen

176
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,010
depends on how much shares we have in our hand,

177
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,790
and how many of the shareholders will accept

178
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,360
Evergreen being acquired by Lihe Capital.

179
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,190
Additionally, although Sheng Zhening may have been impetuous in terms of renovating Building No.2,

180
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,820
But in the long term, I think what he insists makes sense to me.

181
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,460
Are you sure?

182
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,910
Yes.

183
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,570
OK. Just do as you said.

184
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,630
Why are you changing the curtains in my room all of a sudden?

185
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,330
Well, you said

186
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,100
that the old curtains can't block the light. So I changed it.

187
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,270
Now you've got nothing and lost your job. Who knows how long you'll be staying at my place?

188
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,320
Unless something unexpected happens, in three months

189
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,420
they will ask me to return.

190
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,970
Are you a fortune teller?

191
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,670
Let's wait and see.

192
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,650
Xia Qian!

193
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,170
Mom. What's up?

194
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,250
You guys are not boyfriend and girlfriend.

195
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,980
- How do you know? 
 - How do I know?

196
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,410
Mu Xiaoyan told me all about it! He said you were pretending!

197
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,190
Xia Qian, good for you.

198
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,030
I've been so worried about your marriage, but you found someone to fool me!

199
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,630
And you're even living with him now!

200
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,540
Yes, I did lie to you and I was hiding the truth.

201
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,760
But I'm in love with him now!

202
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,170
Sheng Zhening is my boyfriend indeed!

203
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,020
Why was I so impulsive?

204
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,850
Now I've done that,

205
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,090
how am I supposed to face him tomorrow?

206
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,940
Stop.

207
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,720
- What is it? 
 - Don't you want to explain what happened last night?

208
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,900
I was forced to do it.

209
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,510
- Forced? 
 - Yeah.

210
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,290
Who forced you to do it?

211
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,740
My...my mom.

212
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,790
OK, OK.

213
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,850
It was my fault.

214
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,960
I was frivolous and took advantage of you.

215
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,280
OK?

216
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,120
How would you like to make up for it?

217
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,170
Make up for it?

218
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,950
What do you want?

219
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,740
What are you doing?

220
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,420
Don't go too far.

221
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,700
Why are you so nervous?

222
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,340
I'm not nervous.

223
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,000
Did you think I was going to kiss you back?

224
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Of course!

225
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,540
Or what? Why did you suddenly get so close to me?

226
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,090
This was on your hair.

227
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,820
Well... Thank you.

228
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,640
I want to have some good food for dinner.

229
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,050
That's how you can make up for it.

230
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,140
No problem.

231
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,190
Xia Qian!

232
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,060
Xu Lu! What brings you here?

233
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,370
I heard from our classmates that you started up a bargaining company

234
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,440
and it's doing really well, so I thought I'd come and visit.

235
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,360
This is my company.

236
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,730
Well, it's not that easy actually.

237
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,630
Starting up a business is hard. We're just making ends meet.

238
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,870
Anything I can help you with?

239
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,950
A friend of mine works in an internet technology company.

240
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,010
His company is moving their office soon,

241
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,630
and they want to purchase some furniture.

242
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,470
Like printers, tables, and chairs. But their budget is limited.

243
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,910
So I thought maybe your bargaining company could help.

244
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,380
I'm sure we can.

245
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,130
Thank you so much for asking me.

246
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,990
If there is a chance we can work with them, we'll do our best.

247
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,620
That will be great!

248
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,040
I'm about to leave. Shall we talk on the way?

249
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,570
Great.

250
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,650
Being in this position does feel very different.

251
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,650
How does it feel?

252
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,850
Exhausting.

253
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,510
I just realized that Sheng Zhening might have been way smarter than I thought.

254
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,430
He managed Evergreen so well at such a young age. That was really something.

255
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,560
GM Qin, you've just taken over the role of the GM.

256
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,590
It takes time to get used to it.

257
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,300
You'll do better than GM Sheng.

258
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,100
By the way, the Head of the Construction Department of Building No.2 will be here to discuss the renovation.

259
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,200
Are we really helping Sheng Zhening renovate Building No.2?

260
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,400
I promised Sheng Zhening to make sure the renovation of Building No.2 can go on.

261
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,100
Then... What about persuading the other shareholders to sell their Evergreen share?

262
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,300
These are two separate things. Just do as planned.

263
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,800
Okay.

264
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,570
What are you thinking about?

265
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,020
Any updates on your friend and the guy?

266
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
You were right.

267
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
They are long lost brother and sister.

268
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,800
Is that true?

269
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,100
- Why are you laughing? She's almost crying... 
 - What are you talking about?

270
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,500
Why are you gossiping during work hours?

271
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,700
We're not gossiping.

272
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
We've got a job.

273
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,400
A job? What job?

274
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
It's a very urgent task. Listen carefully.

275
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,700
We need to prepare a detailed price comparison sheet by next week.

276
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,500
- Are you that busy? 
 - Exactly.

277
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,000
We were supposed to submit the project proposal next week,

278
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,300
but the client wants to see it in three days!

279
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,100
I have to work late. Don't worry about me.

280
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,800
You can eat first.

281
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,180
Do you think you need an assistant in the company?

282
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,500
An assistant?

283
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,970
I can't live in your apartment for free.

284
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
I can be your assistant.

285
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I can balance out the rent with my salary.

286
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,900
- How's that? 
 - Who?

287
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
You will be my assistant?

288
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,800
I know you were the GM of Evergreen,

289
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,000
but it's completely different from being an assistant.

290
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,700
These are miles apart.

291
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,500
These are completely different professions. You can't make it.

292
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,800
I'll give it a try, we'll see if it works.

293
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Fine. Eat first.

294
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,200
As an assistant, you need to study the briefing document provided by Huixin Technology.

295
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,500
Then you should familiarize with some of the budget reports that Fu Shuangshuang prepared.

296
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,800
This is our meeting room.

297
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,000
If you have more time, you can search online for cost-effective

298
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,600
brands of office desks and chairs based on Huixin Technology's budget,

299
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,700
and create a detailed price comparison report.

300
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,700
- I'll send the report template to you later. 
 - OK.

301
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,800
After you're done, you can get off work.

302
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,300
This is your desk.

303
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,400
OK.

304
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,000
When can I start reviewing the proposal for  Huixin Technology?

305
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,200
This is just your first day at work.

306
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,800
It's my job to review the proposal.

307
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,600
Where is everybody else?

308
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
They worked overnight.

309
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,800
They won't come to the office. They will work from home.

310
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,200
It's your first day at work.

311
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,000
You don't have to work too hard or pretend to know everything.

312
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,700
You can ask me if you have any questions.

313
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,700
OK.

314
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,500
GM Xia.

315
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Don't call me GM Xia. That sounds weird.

316
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,300
Just call me Xia Qian. Any questions?

317
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,400
I've finished my work. What do I do next?

318
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
So fast?

319
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,100
What about the price comparison report? You finished as well?

320
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,200
I read through our price comparison report. Huixin Technology

321
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,000
requested that the office furniture has to be eco-friendly.

322
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,510
But one of the carpets we selected

323
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,300
is likely to have a high level of formaldehyde.

324
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,300
Really?

325
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,600
This is all the information about that carpet vendor.

326
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,000
Two months ago, a company sued them

327
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
for high-level formaldehyde in their carpets. Although the lawsuit has not been concluded yet,

328
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,400
but I don't think we should take the risk.

329
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,600
So in the final price comparison report, we should remove

330
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
that vendor from the list.

331
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,200
What's next?

332
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,400
I've wiped the windows, vacuumed the carpet, watered the flowers,

333
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
and I've organized the bookshelf.

334
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
What's next?

335
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,900
You can take a rest.

336
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,190
So many dishes! It's just the two of us.

337
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,600
The flowers look nice.

338
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,200
Do you like it, darling?

339
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,800
I will buy new flowers every day.

340
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
You don't have to change it every day.

341
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,800
We're married now. We can keep it simple.

342
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,300
We need a sense of ritual in our life. It's the joy of life.

343
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,000
We can't just

344
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,300
eat, sleep, work, eat, sleep, and work.

345
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,000
That would be boring.

346
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
Where did you learned all that?

347
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,800
From the books!

348
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,300
Darling, eat some more.

349
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,400
I heard from Xiaotong that

350
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,600
you are too busy to have lunch at work every day.

351
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,200
You should eat more at home.

352
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,800
She also told me

353
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,200
that you would stay late, and you work harder than all of them.

354
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,200
Mengmeng, are you talking about Xiaotong from our hospital?

355
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,400
How do you know her?

356
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,600
She always comes to my bakery for coffee and cake.

357
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,200
Darling, I think it was a brilliant idea to open my bakery right next to your hospital.

358
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,800
I can see you more often.

359
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,200
I can also strengthen your relationship with your colleagues. Isn't that nice?

360
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Mengmeng, I actually don't think it's a good idea for you to come to the hospital that often.

361
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,000
We're just colleagues.

362
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,600
There's no need to be too close to them.

363
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm afraid that it will influence my work if you get too close.

364
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Darling, I wasn't talking to them that much.

365
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,200
I just wanted to know how you're doing at work.

366
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,000
I opened a bakery next to your hospital,

367
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,800
just to see you more often.

368
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,000
You see, after we got married,

369
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I don't get to see you that much.

370
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,100
I understand, Mengmeng.

371
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,800
In the future, I will stay at home and be with you besides work hours.

372
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,600
Eat some more! It took me so long to prepared the food.

373
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,700
Don't worry, GM Sheng.

374
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,200
The renovation of Building No.2 is going well. I'm keeping an eye on it.

375
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
OK.

376
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh, there's one more thing.

377
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,400
What is it?

378
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,100
How can I become a good assistant?

379
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,200
Assistant?

380
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,570
You're not working as an assistant to Miss Xia, are you?

381
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,400
Don't ask questions you shouldn't ask.

382
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,800
The thing is, I've finished all my work in advance,

383
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
and the work was done really well.

384
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,600
I even did work that was not part of my job.

385
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,600
I thought my supervisor would appreciate an assistant like that.

386
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,000
GM Sheng, I can see you're so used to being the boss.

387
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,200
You have no experience of being an subordinate.

388
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
Why?

389
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
<i> A good assistant should not only be skillful at work, </i>

390
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,400
but possess another essential quality, a different type of skill.

391
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,300
- What is it? 
 - Pretending to be a fool.

392
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
- Pretending to be a fool? 
 - Exactly!

393
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,000
Think about it. If you perform so well in front of your boss,

394
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,800
what would she do? She will be vigilant about you,

395
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,400
wondering whether you're trying to replace her, and eventually stand off from you.

396
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,700
At this time, you should pretend to be a fool.

397
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,600
<i> To make her feel that you're in her control, and that she's safe. </i>

398
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,270
Occasionally, you should make her feel like she's instructing you

399
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
and feel fulfilled.

400
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,400
You've made a lot of mistakes before my eyes,

401
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,200
is that you pretending to be a fool too?

402
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,600
I've never done anything like that, GM Sheng.

403
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,800
I really haven't met your standards yet.

404
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Look at that. What did you do with the report sheet?

405
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
There are so many mistakes!

406
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,100
I thought you did well yesterday. What happened today?

407
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,000
It's my first time to work on a report sheet and I'm not familiar with it.

408
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,500
And I didn't have enough time...

409
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,200
Well, I have to say something about that.

410
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,600
First time to work on it, I understand there will be mistakes.

411
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,100
Sure, no problem.

412
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,400
But if you overvalue the efficiency, that's your problem.

413
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm sorry.

414
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,200
Fine, fine.

415
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Everyone started from a rookie.

416
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,800
Just don't make the same mistakes ever again.

417
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Then... how am I supposed to do with the report sheet?

418
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,200
Grab your chair here, I'll teach you.

419
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,500
What a headache! It's such a simple report sheet.

420
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,400
Have a seat, please.

421
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,300
I think that GM Sheng has an agenda.

422
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,400
He's working hard. What agenda?

423
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,000
No, I mean... He's the GM of a hotel,

424
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,400
even if he's broke, he should at least have a place to stay.

425
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,000
Now he's even working at Worth or Not!

426
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Didn't you read the news? He had a lot of troubles too.

427
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,200
Qianqian just doesn't like sitting there and watching him suffer!

428
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,100
She's definitely going to help him, and of course he's not staying in her place for free.

429
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,500
Don't worry. Qianqian knows how to protect herself.

430
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,350
- Are you a man?
- What are you doing?

431
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,470
Arm-wrestling. If I win, you do what I say.

432
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,110
Man to man. In or out?

433
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,290
And if I win?

434
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll do what you say.

435
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,010
Deal.

436
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,810
Go, replace the gallon bottle of the water machine.

437
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,460
Baked sweet potatoes are ready.

438
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,070
Wow, they smell so good.

439
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,630
Smells nice.

440
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,410
Careful, it's a bit hot.

441
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,880
Really, very sweet.

442
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,600
Hey!

443
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,850
Come along.

444
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,900
Baked sweet potato. Super delicious!

445
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,550
We also leave some for you.

446
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,220
No, thanks. I've never had street food.

447
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,850
So good.

448
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,750
It's well-made.

449
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,980
The timing and heating were perfect.

450
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,840
On second thought, it won't harm to try one.

451
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,280
Here—

452
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,140
I've taken a bite. You don't want it, do you?

453
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,440
Disgusting!

454
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,950
Don't worry. I'll buy some more for you.

455
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,340
Hmm, so sweet.

456
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,110
Are the medical records for tomorrow's appointments ready?

457
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,960
All ready. Two patients for tomorrow. And the records are here.

458
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,710
One of them was referred by Director Lu. I've checked.

459
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,390
The patient doesn't like the room to be too bright.

460
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,470
Noted.

461
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,400
Also, here are the few cases whose return visits are overdue. Contact them tomorrow.

462
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,360
Schedule them soon.

463
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,010
Noted.

464
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,330
Dr. He, what's the occasion today?

465
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,890
Such nice flowers.

466
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,500
Darling, hope my beautiful flowers

467
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,200
will be with you through your working days.

468
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,800
Your loving wife.

469
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,340
- Well, Mr. Wang?
- Not well.

470
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,400
What's the problem?

471
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,560
First, I don't like your template. 
My eyes hurt reading the quotation list.

472
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,220
That's easy.

473
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,280
We will change the template in a light green tone.

474
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,440
Also, the office supplies you chose. 
We are a science and technology company.

475
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,350
Our office supplies should be of some techno sense.

476
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,120
Didn't I send you some reference designs?

477
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,760
We have seen the pictures. However, we've also checked.

478
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,170
The set of desks and chairs you got your eyes on is entry lux.

479
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,760
Your budget is limited. To balance it,

480
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,830
we chose this set only for the vice general managers and above.

481
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,380
Can't you buy some knockoffs?

482
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,010
We can't do that.

483
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,380
If the quality is not guaranteed, 
potential safety hazards will follow.

484
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,940
Anyway, I don't like the supplies you chose.

485
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,090
Well, so much for today. I've still got work.

486
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,310
Give me a new price comparison budget tomorrow.

487
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,710
Hold on, did you say tomorrow?

488
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,180
All of us are waiting for the new office supplies.

489
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,300
Hurry up!

490
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,850
Take care.

491
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,940
Can't we just drop the project?

492
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,760
Why? There's money in it.

493
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,570
I've seen worse clients. Those who don't pay the retainage,

494
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,380
those who steal fruits of labor,

495
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,490
and those who terminate the contract.

496
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,610
This is no big deal.

497
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,030
No worries. You know now.

498
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,150
Boss?

499
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,770
Check Huixing Technology for me.

500
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,200
See if they do any business with our hotel.

501
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,740
Noted.

502
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,430
Sheng Zhening.

503
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,550
Look at how sleepy you are.

504
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,060
You don't have to stay here with me. Go upstairs and rest.

505
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,860
When do you see staff punching out before the boss?

506
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,310
What's wrong?

507
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,350
Are you OK?

508
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,730
I'm fine. Hypoglycemia.

509
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,630
A candy should do.

510
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,350
Have one.

511
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,590
Well, have some rest upstairs.

512
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,270
Let's go.

513
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,890
Thanks.

514
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,700
No, I'm still a bit dizzy.

515
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,140
I will sleep for half an hour.

516
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,320
If I don't get up, remember to wake me.

517
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,740
Hello, have you found anything?

518
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,610
Huixing Technology has no business with us.

519
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,560
But their CEO and you probably went to the same university.

520
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,530
Also a Stanford Business School graduate.

521
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,680
Zixuan or something.

522
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,940
Chen Zixuan?

523
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,110
Yes, Chen Zixuan.

524
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,010
Do you know the person?

525
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:43,490
