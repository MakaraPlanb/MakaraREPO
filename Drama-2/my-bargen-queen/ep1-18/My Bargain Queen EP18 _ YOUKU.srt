00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,120
Excuse me.

4
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,590
What's up?

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,360
I am the boyfriend

6
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,120
of the girl who lives upstairs.

7
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm here to discuss with you

8
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,160
about the leakage problem.

9
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,750
Then come in and take a look.

10
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,080
Look at my wall.

11
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,190
The wall was just painted a few days ago.

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,110
Look at all the water.

13
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,520
Look at it.

14
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,630
There is indeed a leakage.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,830
And the bath heater

16
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,630
also leaked.

17
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,030
It's all water inside.

18
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,390
Even the bath heater has water.

19
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,110
Look.

20
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,030
So much water.

21
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,670
Why not ask a maintenance personnel
to take a look?

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,080
After the overhaul,

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,720
the water will be sucked up.

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,750
Well.

25
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,910
Forget about the bath heater.

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,600
Tell me how to deal

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
with the water at the corner of the wall.

28
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,720
Let's do this.

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,000
I will pay you 500 yuan first.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,960
500?

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,360
1000?

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,390
1500?

33
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,030
Here.

34
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,600
Here.

35
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,670
Why did you transfer 2,000 yuan to me?

36
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,960
The extra 500 yuan is for you 
to keep this a secret.

37
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,550
Don't let my girlfriend know that

38
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,390
I have been here.

39
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,240
Sorry to bother you.

40
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,670
Look.

41
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,190
The flesh is so fresh.

42
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,520
I can't help but eat it.

43
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,830
Let me try for you.

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,160
See what's the taste.

45
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,160
I have to say,

46
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,670
this is definitely the best snack
I have ever eaten.

47
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,270
Girls can eat it

48
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,960
for beauty

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,470
and weight loss.

50
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,320
Boys watching the live broadcast,

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,960
buy it for your girlfriends.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,600
All right?

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
[My Summer No. 1: Qian, I like you]

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,630
I can't stop it.

55
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,390
Thank you, everyone.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,880
I like you.

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,960
I love you all.

58
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,910
There is an account
during the live streaming today

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,520
named My Summer No. 1.

60
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,440
It seems that Qian has fans.

61
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,670
I think this is good.

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,390
Maybe there will be

63
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,230
My Summer No. 2,

64
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,480
No. 3 and No. 4.

65
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,160
But,

66
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,440
I already have a boyfriend.

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't think we should deceive consumers

68
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,440
for the sake of sale volume

69
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,720
and pretend to be single.

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,230
Right?

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,550
Are you against it?

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,230
Invalid objection.

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,230
Thanks to you.

74
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,880
And there are accounts like

76
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,920
No. 8.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,790
You were quite satisfied at first.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,880
What did you say?

79
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,390
I said that

80
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,110
I won't take my salary for next two months.

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
What's the use of deducting your salary

82
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,640
for one year?

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,510
Find a way

84
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,070
to solve this.

85
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,510
Got it.

86
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,600
It's okay.

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,230
The Property Management said

88
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,270
they would be responsible.

89
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,000
Really?

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,510
Sorry to bother you.

91
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,350
Never mind.

92
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,480
The property would be responsible?

93
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,790
Darling.

94
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,920
Where have you been this afternoon?

95
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,920
I called you many times,
but you didn't answer.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,390
When are you coming back?

97
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,840
[I'll go back in a while]

98
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,040
Have you ever thought that

99
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,110
it could be

100
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,320
your overprotection

101
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,790
that made Ning Meng become like this?

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,670
I'll go back in a while.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,390
I am occupied today.

104
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,880
Darling.

105
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
Are you working overtime?

106
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,830
I'll wait for you at home.

107
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,830
I don't dare to sleep if you don't come back.

108
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,950
I will go home now.

109
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,390
Do you have something on your mind?

110
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,830
No.

111
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,880
I am just tired.

112
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,440
Then you should take more rest.

113
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,200
Why come to me early in the morning?

114
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
I miss you.

115
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,160
I'd like to see you.

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,200
By the way,

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,480
I watched your live streaming.

118
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,950
What about it?

119
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,160
Is it better?

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,350
Much better.

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,790
But I think it can be even better

122
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,830
on the current basis.

123
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,790
During the live streaming,

124
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,480
there was a person

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,040
named My Summer No.1.

126
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,270
You saw it?

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,670
Are you jealous?

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
Why would I?

129
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,790
Just an ordinary audience.

130
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,790
Besides,

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,320
you are an anchor.

132
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,670
You will definitely have a lot
of fans in the future.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,350
This is unavoidable.

134
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,390
Aren't you jealous?

135
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,760
No.

136
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,640
I thought you would be jealous.

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,040
I'm still thinking about
how to explain to you.

138
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,920
I didn't expect you to understand it.

139
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,670
He is just

140
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,760
an ordinary audience.

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,390
But I don't think

142
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,950
his name

143
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,440
is polite.

144
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,880
Why not?

145
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,070
I am adapting now.

146
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
But he is just an ordinary audience.

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
He just uses that name for fun.

148
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,070
But I think

149
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,350
for an ordinary audience like this,

150
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,950
it is necessary to block him.

151
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,070
Block?

152
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,350
Is it necessary?

153
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,390
You are jealous.

154
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,110
No.

155
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,590
You are.

156
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,229
No!

157
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,000
You are jealous.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,520
Okay, if I'm jealous,

159
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,029
can you block him?

160
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,710
No way.

161
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,350
He is just an ordinary audience.

162
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,710
I am just suggesting you.

163
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,960
Well.

164
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,960
But I'm not jealous.

165
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,150
You went so far.

166
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,320
It didn't do anything wrong.

167
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,000
[Omeprazole Enteric-coated Capsules]

168
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,280
Darling.

169
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,000
What medicine are you taking?

170
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,440
Nothing.

171
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,670
I just have a stomachache.

172
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,150
Darling.

173
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,280
Let me take you to the hospital

174
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,230
to see a doctor.

175
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,080
Not necessary, I am a doctor.

176
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,550
I know my own situation well.

177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
Darling, I mean it.

178
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,000
Go to the doctor.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,840
- It's better to…
- Ning Meng.

180
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,110
Don't force me anymore.

181
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,790
I said I was fine.

182
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,910
Darling, it's my fault.

183
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,030
I just worry about you.

184
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,520
I mean,

185
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,640
if you go…

186
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,320
Don't be like this.

187

All right, it's my fault.

188
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,150
I will never think too much

189
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,710
in the future.

190
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,550

I'm really tired.

194
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,520
After we got married,

195
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,470
I forgot what we were like before.

196
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,440
We just get angry and apologize

197
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,590
every day repeatedly.

198
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,790
Is this the life you want?

199
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
I am going to read.

200
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,910
Hello, I am online.

201
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,400
Welcome everyone
to my live streaming.

202
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,520
Before the live streaming,

203
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,000
I would like to explain

204
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,280
my emotional state to you.

205
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,790
I have a boyfriend.

206
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,280
He's very excellent.

207
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,320
I love him so much.

208
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,670
He's the one in my life.

209
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,520
The only one.

210
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,200
So…

211
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
So cheesy.

212
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,280
Never mind.

213
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,470
So I am not single.

214
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,520
All right.

215
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,880
No more nonsense.

216
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,910
Today's live streaming is about to begin.

217
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,350
What I want to

218
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,280
recommend today is tea.

219
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,550
The price is quite reasonable.

220
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,030
Just buy it.

221
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,080
Three people unfollowed today.

222
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,880
We lost three fans.

223
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,640
We lost three today,

224
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,760
we are going to earn thirty more tomorrow.

225
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
I agree with Qian.

226
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,790
Our live streaming

227
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,400
should be honest and trustworthy.

228
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,670
We should stick to the truth.

229
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,230
Never make any false persona.

230
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,640
Right.

231
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,760
Lies will eventually be exposed.

232
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,000
At that time,

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,840
it will bring more damage.

234
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,960
Shuangshuang is right.

235
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,550
All right.

236
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,230
It's enough.

237
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Let's work harder.

238
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,110
Most of Mr. Gao's assets

239
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,280
are with his wife.

240
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,470
If he divorces his wife,

241
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,150
he would surely suffer great losses.

242
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,080
So if he wants to keep his assets,

243
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,880
he definitely doesn't want

244
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,710
the cheating video to be exposed.

245
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,320
He would agree to sell his shares.

246
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,280
Do you need me to send it to Mr. Xue now?

247
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,440
Not necessary.

248
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,350
I'll arrange this.

249
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,670
Okay.

250
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,710
Hebo.

251
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,670
I am planning to transfer directly

252
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,760
the shares of Evergreen held by someone else

253
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,000
to Lihe Capital,

254
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,670
and then formally enter the board
of directors of Evergreen.

255
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,320
Since we have already made it clear,

256
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,320
we don't have to hide ourselves.

257
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,960
I…

258
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,400
Sorry.

259
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,200
Hebo, I have to answer the call.

260
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,910
It's me.

261
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,000
Go ahead.

262
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,030
Okay, got it.

263
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,960
Don't worry.

264
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,230
We are friends.

265
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,710
I will try my best.

266
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,910
Okay.

267
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,150
Hebo.

268
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,320
Is there any progress

269
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
with Mr. Gao?

270
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,550
I have no news yet.

271
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,550
I will let you know if there is any news.

272
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,550
Hurry up.

273
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,030
The 30th anniversary celebration
was a success.

274
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,320
Mr. Sheng's abilities

275
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,790
are obvious to all.

276
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,790
I think it is more appropriate

277
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,910
for him to act as the general manager.

278
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,200
Frequent changes in positions

279
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,150
will make Evergreen's management

280
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,550
seems unstable

281
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,640
and impact a bad influence.

282
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,550
Mr. Qin is doing a good job.

283
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,110
There's no need for the change.

284
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,000
Mr. Qin, what do you think?

285
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,790
I have no objections.

286
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,910
It depends on the decision
of the board of directors.

287
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,710
Okay.

288
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,910
Let's hold a meeting next week

289
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,000
to formally discuss today's topic.

290
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,840
If there is nothing else,

291
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,550
I will leave.

292
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,280
Look…

293
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,710
The meeting hasn't finished yet.

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,550
He…

295
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,110
They are burning the bridge.

296
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,840
You have paid so much for Evergreen

297
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,350
in the past few months.

298
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,790
They want to take your place

299
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,200
as soon as Sheng Zhening comes back.

300
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,520
The video was sent to Lihe Capital.

301
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,470
Why didn't Mr. Xue

302
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,590
take action?

303
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,840
Should I urge him?

304
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,910
No.

305
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,520
Mr. Qin.

306
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,320
Do you have anything on your mind?

307
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,350
You seem to be absent-minded recently.

308
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,520
Nothing.

309
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,790
I am just tired.

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,880
Leave me alone.

311
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,880
Okay.

312
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,000
Meng.

313
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,400
When did you arrive?

314
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,520
I just arrived.

315
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,229
Why didn't you go up to find me?

316
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,680
There's a place I want to go.

317
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,709
Sure.

318
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,880
According to Ai's data analysis,

319
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,590
it is obvious that

320
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,589
the number of live views of clothing

321
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,589
is much higher than that
of others.

322
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,400
But we don't cover this area.

323
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,000
I think it's a chance.

324
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,590
It happens to be a short slab.

325
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,350
What are you doing?

326
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:36,830
You.

327
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,950
Apply to the head office

328
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,920
for some clothing brands.

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,640
Are there any requirements for the style?

330
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,110
No excessive requirements.

331
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,280
But the fabric and workmanship

332
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,230
must be the best.

333
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,920
The finished product

334
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,430
needs to be the same as those in the video.

335
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,880
Okay.

336
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,190
Leave it to me.

337
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,680
Why did you bring me here?

338
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,310
We visited here last Valentine's Day.

339
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,950
Do you remember?

340
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes.

341
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,280
Zhijun.

342
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,680
I went to see Doctor Zhang.

343
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,880
Professor?

344
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,430
Meng.

345
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,880
What happened to you?

346
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,710
Going back to

347
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,470
the familiar psychological clinic

348
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
reminded me of

349
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,920
when we first met.

350
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,830
I am really happy,

351
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,830
grateful,

352
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,880
and cherish the life we have now.

353
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,040
Zhijun.

354
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,640
I know I did a lot

355
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,110
that irritated you.

356
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,760
I will never interfere with your work again.

357
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,280
I will never doubt you,

358
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,950
nor will I be afraid of you 
being stolen by others.

359
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,400
I know I can't change it all at once.

360
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,310
But Zhijun, give me some time.

361
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,040
- Meng.
- I will definitely…

362
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,070
Meng.

363
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,640
I really didn't blame you.

364
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,110
You don't have to worry

365
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
about my feelings for you at all.

366
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,560
You don't have to worry about

367
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,350
bad things happening

368
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,640
in the future.

369
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,350
Okay?

370
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,110
Zhijun, let's sit here.

371
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,830
Okay.

372
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
Why are these all ancient costumes?

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,280
It's the Han Chinese costume brand
recommended by the head office.

374
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,950
This month, the head office

375
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,800
launched the activity 
with the theme of traditional culture.

376
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,160
Han Chinese costume, jewelry

377
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,110
and cosmetics

378
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,110
all contain traditional elements.

379
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,760
Well…

380
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,280
Who would buy this dress 
during the live streaming?

381
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,710
The head office must have given these to us

382
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,800
because of our poor performance.

383
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,040
They are making things difficult for us.

384
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,110
It's okay.

385
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,110
Actually, I found that

386
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,520
the workmanship and quality

387
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
of these clothes are good.

388
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,590
The quality is pretty good.

389
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,710
I got an idea.

390
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,710
Shuangshuang.

391
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,640
You like to watch

392
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,800
all kinds of costume dramas.

393
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,280
You can try them on.

394
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,190
I do watch costume plays.

395
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,710
But I can't do this.

396
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,880
You know I'm nervous in front of the camera.

397
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,430
Well.

398
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,800
I…

399
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,350
I can't hold these.

400
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,160
You should try it.

401
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,800
I…

402
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Take a seat.

403
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,560
One for you.

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,880
What's this?

405
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,880
Do you remember it?

406
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,040
Why do you still have this?

407
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,680
When I was sick,

408
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,350
I couldn't fall asleep every day,

409
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,230
so you gave me recordings

410
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,880
of the natural environment.

411
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
You told me that

412
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,350
the world is big.

413
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,830
I shouldn't be confined

414
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,880
to the little painful world.

415
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,230
At that time, you told me that

416
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,400
you downloaded it from the Internet.

417
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,590
But I know

418
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,560
this must be recorded

419
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
by you.

420
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,950
I could hear your breath.

421
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,160
Why didn't I notice that?

422
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,710
Of course you didn't.

423
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,190
I would notice

424
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,880
and feel

425
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,710
everything you do

426
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,520
at every moment.

427
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,590
I will keep all of you

428
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,310
in my heart.

429
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,640
I know.

430
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,590
Zhijun.

431
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,400
Let's travel around.

432
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,160
You said before that

433
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,110
you would take me to travel around the world.

434
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,680
Sure, it's up to you.

435
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,230
Hello.

436
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,710
Hello.

437
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,230
Hello.

438
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,280
My house tripped.

439
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,070
Can you arrange for someone to check it?

440
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,560
Okay.

441
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,000
We will arrange it for you tomorrow.

442
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,760
Wait.

443
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,110
Why tomorrow again?

444
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,430
You made the arrangements very fast

445
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,110
for the leakage in my house last time.

446
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,760
Why do you decline with all kinds
of excuses this time?

447
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,350
Didn't you

448
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,950
solve the leakage

449
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,190
with the owner yourself?

450
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,590
Myself?

451
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,280
Yes.

452
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,280
Your boyfriend

453
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,230
asked me to hide it from you.

454
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,190
What boyfriend?

455
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,070
The man

456
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,880
who paid the compensation for you last time.

457
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,470
He is quite handsome,

458
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,190
wearing a suit.

459
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,880
And he seems very rich.

460
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,520
Did you quarrel?

461
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,760
No.

462
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,280
Thank you.

463
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,710
Never mind.

464
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,880
The person in the village
who has the best relationship

465
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,110
with me is Xiao Lang.

466
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,830
Do you watch my live streamingevery time?

467
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,190
This is his home.

468
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,190
But this time…

469
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,950
Not every time.

470
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,590
When I am busy,

471
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,110
I would ask An An to record it

472
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,950
to watch later.

473
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,920
Don't watch my live streaming tomorrow.

474
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,160
Why?

475
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
There's no reason why.

476
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,640
Just don't watch it.

477
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,110
Neither can you record it.

478
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,310
All right.

479
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,470
This is the compensation

480
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,520
for the leakage

481
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
you paid for me last time.

482
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,160
2000 yuan

483
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,590
in total.

484
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,800
I don't want to owe you anything.

485
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,560
Shuangshuang.

486
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,230
What else?

487
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,000
If I promise you

488
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,040
not to do anything bad,

489
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,830
do we still have a chance?

490
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,190
I don't know.

491
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,470
Why do you keep ironing there?

492
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,710
The clothes would be broken.

493
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,880
What happened?

494
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,560
Anything in your mind?

495
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,950
Tell me.

496
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,160
If a person always serves the devil,

497
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,070
would he get better?

498
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,110
Why asking about this?

499
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,000
I am watching a play.

500
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,000
There is a bad guy

501
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,640
who did much wrong before,

502
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,710
but he wants to get better.

503
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,070
Do you think

504
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,280
it is possible?

505
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,470
No idea.

506
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,680
It depends on the screenwriter.

507
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,950
Let me help you.

508
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,880
Take a rest.

509
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
Take care.

510
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,160
So weird.

511
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,070
Why did I agree?

512
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,560
So weird.

513
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,830
Where are you?

514
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,830
Anyone at home?

515
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,360
[Zhening]

516
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,310
I am at home.

517
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,710
I am getting changed.

518
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,710
Why are you here?

519
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,310
I finished the work at hotel.

520
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,470
So I came to work with you.

521
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,280
I told you last night

522
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,230
not to watch my live streaming.

523
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,310
Why did you break your promise?

524
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,400
I just said not

525
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,400
to watch your live streaming,

526
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,400
but I didn't say not

527
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,230
to watch you work.

528
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,000
You are arguing irrationally.

529
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,680
Are you finished?

530
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,710
You will be late.

531
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,280
No.

532
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,190
Soon.

533
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,830
Hold on.

534
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,470
What's up?

535
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,760
Nothing.

536
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,240
[An An]

537
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,310
Hello.

538
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,520
Okay, I got it.

539
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,400
I will be back soon.

540
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,190
What happened?

541
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,710
There is an urgent case.

542
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,830
I have to go back.

543
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,280
Just go.

544
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,680
I am fine.

545
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,350
I will go downstairs

546
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,110
after I get changed.

547
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,950
Okay, that's good.

548
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,760
I am leaving.

549
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,760
Take your time.

550
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,680
Put this.

551
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,470
Put it in the front.

552
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,680
Man, I…

553
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,470
I'm crooked.

554
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,680
This way.

555
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,400
No, that way.

556
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,350
Here, the opposite direction.

557
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,160
The light.

558
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,830
The light.

559
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,710
My face is still dark.

560
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,000
No, aim it at my face.

561
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,040
Qian.

562
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,680
You look amazing in this.

563
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,430
What?

564
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,350
I am uncomfortable.

565
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,590
So weird.

566
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,520
Exactly, Qian.

567
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,110
You can even hold this style.

568
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,070
So nice.

569
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,160

Is Mr. Sheng with you?

574
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,400
No, he isn't.

575
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,000
He left after receiving your call.

576
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,400
He didn't return to Evergreen.

577
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,310
And his phone is turned off.

578
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,760
I can't reach him at all.

579
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,640
Really?

580
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,070
He left in a hurry.

581
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,190
Anything urgent happened?

582
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,800
Mr. Gao of our hotel

583
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,640
sold his shares to Lihe Capital.

584
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,000
Lihe Capital is now our shareholder.

585
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,230
Mr. Xue hasn't taken any action.

586
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,680
So I went for him.

587
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,470
But he told me that

588
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,470
you didn't send Mr. Gao's video
to him.

589
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,350
So I…

590
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,760
How could you make the decision 
without my permission?

591
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,710
I wanted to do you a favor.

592
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,800
I thought you are concerned 
about your relationship with Mr. Sheng,

593
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,470
so you couldn't bear 
to send the video to Mr. Xue.

594
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,950
That's why I…

595
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,520
Get out.

596
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,160
Get out.

597
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,830
Sorry.

598
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,470
Sorry.

599
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,310
The number you dialed is…

600
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,800
The number you dialed is power off.

601
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,590
Sorry.

602
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,950
The number you dialed is power off.

603
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,350
Power off?

604
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,350
Hello.

605
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,280
The number you dialed is power off.

606
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,070
Sorry.

607
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,880
The number you dialed is power off.

608
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,350
Mr. Sheng.

609
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,070
You are finally back.

610
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,110
What's going on?

611
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,110
Mr. Gao has always 
been a shareholder of Evergreen.

612
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,070
He suddenly sold his shares to Lihe Capital

613
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,680
made other shareholders upset.

614
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,230
Several shareholders asked me

615
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,920
if there is a problem 
with Evergreen's operations.

616
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,110
I asked Mr. Gao to record a video statement.

617
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,950
Ask all the shareholders

618
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,280
for an emergency meeting.

619
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,230
Besides,

620
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,640
Lihe Capital not only bought

621
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,110
Mr. Gao's 5%shares.

622
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
They also secretly

623
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,350
asked Mr. Xue

624
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,520
to buy the shares of Mr. Lin and Mr. Yu.

625
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,160
They are just not acquired

626
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,430
in the name of Lihe Capital.

627
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,680
So far,

628
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,000
they own at least 10%

629
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,160
of Evergreen's shares.

630
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,280
I got it.

631
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,400
Go schedule the meeting.

632
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,680
Okay.

633
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,520
Excuse me. Thanks.

634
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
This way, please.

635
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,590
So strange.

636
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,880
He just told me that

637
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,230
he couldn't reach you.

638
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,430
I was so worried that

639
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,310
I rushed over.

640
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,520
I thought you were with Ms. Xia,

641
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,920
so I…

642
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,430
I went to Mr. Gao's house for a meeting.

643
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,070
And my phone was out of power.

644
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,190
It's okay.

645
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,680
All right.

646
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,400
I am going to have a meeting.

647
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,310
I will be back soon.

648
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,110
Wait here for me.

649
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,830
Is there a problem 
with Evergreen's operations?

650
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,110
Mr, Gao has always been a shareholder
of Evergreen.

651
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,920
Why would he suddenly

652
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
sell his shares now?

653
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,830
I believe that many people heard

654
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,710
about Mr. Gao selling his shares,

655
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,190
and there are many speculations.

656
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,590
I have a video statement

657
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,430
from Mr. Gao.

658
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,110
I sold the shares for some personal reasons,

659
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,950
but not for Evergreen's operations.

660
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,710
It's a pity that

661
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,040
I will not be able

662
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,350
to work with you in the future.

663
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,000
Wish you success in your work.

664
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,110
Recently, there have been rumors

665
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,520
that there's a problem 
with Evergreen's operations.

666
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,880
The expansion of Evergreen

667
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,280
over the past ten years is obvious to all.

668
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,310
The operations have always been
in an orderly way.

669
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,680
Obviously,

670
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,430
someone is trying to take the opportunity

671
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,680
to interfere us

672
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,110
and make a profit in troubled situations.

673
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,040
I hope everyone here

674
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,070
will not be misled.

675
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,070
Come on. Come on.

676
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,950
Xian is here.

677
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,280
Hello, how is he?

678
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,710
Come on.

679
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,400
Is he handsome?

680
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,230
Don't go.

681
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,710
Everyone says you are handsome.

682
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,040
Look.

683
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,000
He is handsome, right?

684
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,400
Come on.

685
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,760
Look at this.

686
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,070
Dignified, elegant and gentle.

687
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,160
So beautiful.

688
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Are you still the anchor I know?

689
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Of course.

690
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,950
Bai Suzhen under the Mount Qingcheng.

691
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,949
Cultivate this body for
thousands of years in the cave.

692
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,469
Great!

693
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,039
We are here to sell the goods.

694
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
All the Han Chinese costumes on us

695
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,150
will have

696
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,670
an amazing

697
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,840
discount.

698
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,190
The first 30 orders

699
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,840
will be given

700
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,560
the embroidered shoes

701
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,630
worth 198 yuan.

702
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,630
So nice.

703
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,669
So good, just buy it.

704
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,560
Take a look at the comments.

705
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,320
So many comments.

706
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,150
60 kg is no problem.

707
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,230
Don't worry.

708
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,800
It makes us look slimmer.

709
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,910
Let me see.

710
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,630
Someone asked if it's possible to wear out.

711
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
As long as you like. Sure.

712
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,469
You can wear everything.

713
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,909
We can just go shopping like this.

714
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,390
Right.

715
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,760
And take some photos.

716
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,670
Someone envies you.

717
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,760
He is jealous.

718
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,670
They want to buy you.

719
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,710
Xu Xian isn't for sale.

720
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,150
But my clothes are.

721
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:07,910
I think

722
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,760
everything is for sale.

723
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,470
We can sell him together.

724
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,000
I feel like I went through the veil
of time

725
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,710
wearing this suit.

726
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,470
And I am so elegant.

727
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,360
Am I cool?

728
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,430
- So cool.
- Am I unworldly?

729
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,000
So cool.

730
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,360
It is indeed more intuitive

731
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,950
to show the data in the dynamic histogram.

732
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,040
Right?

733
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,280
It's really better.

734
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,000
You are back.

735
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,390
Take a look.

736
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,430
I made a chart with An An

737
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,630
of Evergreen's turnover

738
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,950
in recent years

739
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,360
according to year and month.

740
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,430
In this case, shareholders can see clearly

741
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,870
that Evergreen is constantly growing.

742
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,670
Just to

743
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,760
set their mind at rest.

744
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,910
But I don't know if it will work.

745
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,430
Diagrams are more convincing
than words.

746
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,560
Is it appropriate for you

747
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,470
to dress like this?

748
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,670
Nothing inappropriate.

749
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,390
I was so busy that I forgot to get changed.

750
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,760
Come with me.

751
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,150
What's up?

752
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,390
Here is the dress.

753
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,840
Get changed.

754
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,840
When did he buy it?

755
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,760
Hold on.

756
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,760
Stop it. I will be okay soon.

757
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,760
Zhening.

758
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,520
Come in and do me a favor.

759
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,600
Didn't you get changed?

760
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,760
This dress is troublesome.

761
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,000
Untie it for me.

762
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,670
You didn't want me

763
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,150
to watch your live streaming
because of this?

764
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,600
Yes, it's so weird.

765
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,600
Not at all.

766
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,520
It's cute.

767
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,280
All right.

768
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,910
Enough.

769
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,320
Well, what happened

770
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,520
to Mr. Gao?

771
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,280
Why did he sell his shares to Lihe Capital?

772
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,190
Hasn't he been a shareholder of Evergreen 
for a long time?

773
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,800
Mr. Gao's room was installed with a camera.

774
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,560
Something

775
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
was filmed.

776
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,630
Lihe Capital blackmailed him with this video.

777
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,670
Evergreen's security is very strict.

778
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,520
No outsiders can come in.

779
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,470
Is it possible that

780
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,000
Evergreen's internal employee did it?

781
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,760
I was thinking

782
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,910
it might be Qin Hebo.

783
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,430
Last year, he changed

784
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,910
all the coded locks

785
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,710
in the office areas of Evergreen.

786
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,390
The manufacturer of the coded locks

787
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,560
is closely related to Lihe Capital.

788
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,040
Now Evergreen is like

789
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,840
an unlocked door.

790
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,840
Well.

791
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,520
Have you figured out a way?

792
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,800
Don't worry. I will deal with it.

793
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,600
All right. Get out.

794
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,320
I will get changed myself.

795
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,080
The effect of our live streaming

796
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,840
is so great.

797
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,150
All the dresses were sold out.

798
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,150
And all the eyeshadows

799
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,320
and lipsticks you used are sold out.

800
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,230
We got 1000 more fans.

801
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,080
They strongly demanded 
another live streaming.

802
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,470
Stop it.

803
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,280
I am flattered.

804
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,950
Are you?

805
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,360
Now that the fans are so enthusiastic,

806
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,630
let's do one more.

807
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,360
And here is my plan.

808
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,360
In the future, the live streaming

809
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,190
will be handed over to Mu Xiaoyan.

810
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,320
Am I capable?

811
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,560
Why doubting yourself?

812
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,120
I am ready to do the behind-the-scenes work.

813
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,430
Because before I was forced

814
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,150
to do the live streaming

815
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,470
by myself.

816
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,760
Through the data this time,

817
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,950
it is obvious that

818
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,280
Xiaoyan is more suitable than me.

819
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,760
You are more open.

820
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,120
And you can lead more people.

821
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,150
I agree.

822
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:25,910
Me too.

823
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,870
Then I will take a try.

824
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,190
Here you are.

825
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,150
The laurels of honor.

826
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,840
Mr. Sheng.

827
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,600
Mr. Xue of Lihe Capital

828
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,630
would like to invite you to dinner

829
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,560
with other shareholders.

830
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,470
Right at our hotel.

831
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,630
The shareholders are asking
if you would be there.

832
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,710
White Vengeance at my site.

833
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,120
Why not?

834
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,360
Lihe Capital is already a shareholder
of Evergreen.

835
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,670
For Evergreen's future,

836
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,280
we will be in the same boat

837
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
and share weal or woe in the future.

838
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,320
Come on.

839
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,470
For Evergreen's future.

840
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,430
Cheers.

841
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,630
Evergreen's food

842
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,910
is so delicious.

843
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,000
Mr. Sheng.

844
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,150
What do you think?

845
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,520
Mr. Xue, I'm glad you like it.

846
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,800
Mr. Sheng.

847
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,430
Mr. Gao sorted out all the hotel's

848
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,800
VIP customer information.

849
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,320
The new housekeeping manager

850
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,600
will on board tomorrow.

851
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,840
Put the materials in his office.

852
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,390
Let him hand over tomorrow.

853
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,630
Got it.

854
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,710
Mr. Qin.

855
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,630
What a coincidence.

856
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,430
Why didn't you come

857
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,120
for the dinner with the shareholders?

858
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,080
I have been waiting for Mr. Xue
for a while.

859
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,430
Great.

860
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,600
I also have something to tell you.

861
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
