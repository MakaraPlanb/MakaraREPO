6
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,460
Something seems off with sis today.

7
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,510
No, not really.

8
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,290
Why are you hiding your phone?

9
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm not.

10
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,110
Are you in love?

11
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,060
What are you talking about? I'm working.

12
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,100
Really?

13
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,040
Get back. Are you slacking when Qian is out?

14
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,070
I'm telling her right now.

15
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,470
Fine, fine.

16
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,570
I'll video you.

17
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,310
Didn't you sleep at Miss Xia's place?

18
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,060
How come that your forehead...

19
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
The budget is way over.

20
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,860
I'll inform the Purchasing Department to do another one.

21
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,650
Brother, where are you staying now? 
I'd like to come and see you.

22
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,230
Last time, I didn't see you at Evergreen Hotel.

23
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,230
Also, I didn't help with the decoration of Tower No. 2.

24
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,930
Mengmeng, don't worry. I'm staying with a friend. Everything is fine.

25
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,130
You take care of yourself. I have a meeting. Laters.

26
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,970
Sure, take care.

27
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,660
Mengmeng.

28
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,160
- Zhijuan!
- So much fruit.

29
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,550
I prepared everything you like. See if you like them.

30
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,940
I've already eaten at the hospital.

31
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,400
But I worked so hard. Come, sit down.

32
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,870
First, some kiwi.

33
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,530
Very sweet.

34
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,980
Zhijuan, I want to help.

35
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,150
But nobody seems to need me.

36
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,500
Come.

37
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,140
Overthinking is not good for you.

38
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,530
Or, we can try to find something you like. A job, for example?

39
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,740
Then you'll be too busy to overthink.

40
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,260
Sheng Zhening, go and take your shower. I'll be next.

41
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,960
Okay.

42
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,000
Hmm...

43
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,290
I bargained the floor price down by two yuan.

44
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,520
How about the timber?

45
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,110
I can bring it down by 50 cents, tops.

46
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,720
Fine, as long as it's a discount. Always better than nothing.

47
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,360
Tomorrow you and Mo go and find out about the wall paints.

48
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,700
See how much discount they can offer.

49
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,960
Okay, bye.

50
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,980
We've done bargain for decoration materials before.

51
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,040
But most of them are worth 2-3 million, tops.

52
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,620
This one is worth tens of millions. 
I've never tried and am not confident at all.

53
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,580
In essence, they are the same. The only difference is scale.

54
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,460
Bigger in quantity, the bigger the space for bargaining.

55
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,080
Compared to your smaller deals,
this one will be easier to handle.

56
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,410
- Theoretically—
- Stop being modest.

57
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,990
You did a pretty good job for the group automobile purchase.

58
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,690
Indeed. Miss Xia, you really should take it.

59
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,970
Did you take it or not?

60
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,340
- Well? Such a big project!
- Yes!

61
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,300
What can I do?

62
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,800
So you dropped it?

63
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,950
Look at you both!

64
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,060
Such a big order, with so much money. 
How can I drop it?

65
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,850
- Yah!
- We'll be rich!

66
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,330
Now, listen. Put everything else on hold for now.

67
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,930
We focus on the decoration of Evergreen Hotel Tower No. 2. 
This is our priority.

68
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,080
Roger!

69
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,220
How come that we cross paths with Evergreen
so much lately?

70
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,780
Last time there was so much crisis. 
But eventually, we earned big.

71
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,300
Indeed the good gain takes long pain

72
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,780
We'll get rich!

73
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,680
Your treat.

74
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,790
I'm off.

75
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,150
Are you sure they've signed with Worth or Not?

76
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,120
Affirmative. They have signed the contract.

77
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,040
Fu Shuangshuang works there. Maybe we can use her.

78
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,730
I have my own plan. We're done here.

79
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,260
Very well.

80
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,260
<i>Busy lately? You don't even go home.</i>

81
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,620
<i>I've fed the cat. Don't worry.</i>

82
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,920
<i>[Just got back from a business trip.]</i>

83
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,840
<i>[Thanks for taking care of the cat.]</i>

84
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,940
<i>Just got back from a business trip. 
Thanks for taking care of the cat.</i>

85
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,970
<i>You can't treat a cat like this. If you really care...</i>

86
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,460
<i>You're welcome.</i>

87
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,710
Such a cool answer... are you mad that I replied late?

88
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>[From: Qin Hebo]</i>

89
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,190
<i>Such a cool answer... are you mad that I replied late?</i>

90
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,310
<i>No.</i>

91
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,810
That means "yes". Let me make it up to you.

92
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,920
<i>I am not angry, you don't need to make it up to me. I am going to bed now.</i>

93
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,450
What was that?

94
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,480
What were you looking at so happily?

95
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,810
What?

96
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,550
I asked you a question.

97
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,640
I was counting money.

98
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,860
No wonder you were so happy.

99
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,890
How much is your budget for the wooden flooring? I made a price list, have a look.

100
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,690
It works.

101
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,620
Did you even have a good look at it?

102
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,410
Why are you here?

103
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,060
I was passing by so I though I would bring you something.

104
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,730
Come over, I brought you some snacks.

105
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,780
I know you are angry that I did not respond timely.

106
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,760
So I am here to formally apologize.

107
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,560
I am really not angry.

108
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,480
I just feel like you did not take responsibility for your cat.

109
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,950
I have been pretty busy on a business trip the past few days

110
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,960
but I told the housekeeper to take care of it.

111
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,630
I didn't realize they would be so careless.

112
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,750
I promise a situation like this will never occur again.

113
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,840
If you are busy just let me know, I can take care of it for a few days.

114
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,800
Really?

115
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
Yes.

116
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,820
That's great. I really swear it will not happen again.

117
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,130
Next time I will definitely let you know beforehand.

118
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,600
Then I will reluctantly on the cat's behalf forgive you.

119
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,500
Then on my cat's behalf, please have some food.

120
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,930
So generous.

121
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,690
Have a look.

122
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,380
Wow.

123
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,310
Three layers.

124
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,190
Then I won't hold back.

125
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,490
Okay.

126
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,720
It's really good.

127
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,360
Eat more.

128
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,660
It's getting late, time to sleep.

129
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,170
I can't sleep, I still haven't finished organizing the price for your bedding.

130
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,200
What are you doing?

131
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,940
As your employer, I order you to go to bed right now.

132
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,900
I refuse.

133
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,550
I will fire you.

134
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,680
Then as your landlord, I can kick you out of the house. Leave!

135
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,690
Take a shower then immediately go to bed.

136
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,000
You can't just take it!

137
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,090
You can't control me.

138
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,850
It's getting late, shouldn't you be sleeping?

139
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,440
Ever since you finished eating, you have been stuck to your computer typing. What are you doing?

140
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,710
It's for your Evergreen.

141
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,300
Evergreen?

142
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Your Evergreen Hotel's second floor renovation materials is being bargained and managed by my company.

143
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,900
I am working so hard so that your company can save money.

144
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,440
Oh.

145
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,850
Am I doing a good job?

146
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,940
Yeah, it's pretty good.

147
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,130
Material, price, and price ratios are all very clear.

148
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,020
I am very impressive.

149
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,630
You-You should also head back so you can rest early.

150
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,060
The cat is also at home all alone right now.

151
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,970
That's true.

152
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,760
How about this, when you're done working we should go out to eat.

153
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

154
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm leaving.

155
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,750
Okay.

156
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,890
Bye bye.

157
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,990
Rest early.

158
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,520
Okay.

159
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,070
Open the door.

160
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,680
- Who is it? 
 - Your mom!

161
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,030
- Mom 
 - What took so long?

162
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,230
Open the door! Open the door!

163
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,540
What are you doing?

164
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,540
What?

165
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,760
Get up! My mom is at the door!

166
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,940
<i>Open the door!</i>

167
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,740
<i>This child</i>

168
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,280
<i>Open the door!</i>

169
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,430
<i>What are you doing?</i>

170
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,950
Mom, why are you here?

171
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,200
I brought you breakfast.

172
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,750
Just giving it to me is fine, I going downstairs to work.

173
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,250
Why didn't you let me in earlier?

174
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,480
I was cleaning up.

175
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,100
You don't have something you are hiding, right?

176
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,410
Why would I have a secret?

177
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,970
I was cleaning up, the house is a mess and I was afraid you would scold me.

178
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,740
Is that so?

179
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,590
What secret would I have? What don't you know?

180
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,860
Hurry up.

181
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,710
I have stuff to do, I need to go downstairs.

182
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,260
It will be really fast. Did you even brush your teeth before drinking that?

183
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,030
I brushed already, I brushed after waking up.

184
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,750
Hey!

185
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,990
Explain, what is going on here?

186
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,050
Speak.

187
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,300
Fu Shuangshuang.

188
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,150
Two days ago she came over and stayed the night. I haven't had time to clean up.

189
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,810
Fu Shuangshuang was living here?

190
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,260
That kid...doesn't even clean up when

191
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,980
living in another person's house.

192
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,720
It's a simple task.

193
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,780
That's right.

194
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,370
That's enough.

195
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,470
I am leaving. Quickly eat before it gets cold.

196
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,870
You were the one who came to find me.

197
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,420
- Otherwise I would have cleaned up. 
 - Okay. Hurry up, brush your teeth and clean your face.

198
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,150
That's enough, you don't need to see me off. I'm leaving.

199
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,260
I am not sending you off. Hurry up and leave, I am in a rush.

200
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
This child...

201
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,920
- Mom 
 - Okay, I know!

202
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,890
The blankets were still warm.

203
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,980
Come on out, my mom left.

204
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,460
Xiaosheng, wouldn't you say that your relationship is developing too fast?

205
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,950
Mom, we are just roommates.

206
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,510
- We haven't slept together yet 
 - Shut up!

207
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,850
Come on, have a seat.

208
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,810
Let go!

209
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,040
You guys weren't even on good terms a few days ago,

210
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,910
why are you guys suddenly roommates?

211
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,190
After my unwavering efforts,

212
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,660
Qianqian was moved by my sincerity. Isn't that right?

213
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,330
- Yes. 
 - Oh, so that's how it was.

214
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,060
Look at you two, it's not that I don't approve of you two.

215
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,470
But is it necessary to hide it from me?

216
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,960
Mom, we didn't want to hide it from you.

217
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,550
It's just that it hasn't been that long so we haven't had time to tell you.

218
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,860
Next time if there are new developments you have to let me know beforehand, okay?

219
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,310
Things like engagement, marriage, pregnancies are all big events in one's life.

220
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,860
Do you understand?

221
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,680
Yes.

222
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,420
You keep going on and on,

223
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,620
he has to go to work.

224
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,850
Oh, then I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

225
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,600
Sit down. I will send him off.

226
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,500
Okay, okay.

227
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,090
Let's go.

228
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,150
Okay. I'm leaving, Auntie.

229
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,570
Come back often.

230
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,490
Let's go.

231
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,140
Bye, Mom.

232
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,560
Aiyo.

233
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,720
Hey,

234
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,740
w-what do we do in the future?

235
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,130
What else can we do?

236
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,020
We already told my mom, so we have to keep pretending.

237
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,370
- But— 
 - To thank you for cooperating, you don't have to pay rent.

238
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,640
But pretend till when?

239
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,130
How should I know?

240
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,100
Maybe one day I will find true love and dump you.

241
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,060
Why can't it be that I dump you?

242
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,520
Why would you dump me?

243
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,140
The character you portrayed chased after me.

244
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,550
You pestered me to be with you. You are the infatuated one.

245
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,370
So, only I can be the jerk.

246
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,800
Then maybe my infatuation and single-mindedness is an act,

247
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,690
I am originally a jerk and after deceiving you I dump you.

248
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,320
Why would you deceive me? You can't manipulate my feelings.

249
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,460
Then that's settle. Only I can dump you, I will be the jerk.

250
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,920
If I dump you, you will still have face.

251
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,650
Get in the car.

252
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm off.

253
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Hurry up.

254
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,600
Why are we here? Do you want cake?

255
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,200
One moment.

256
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
Is it pretty?

257
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
Do I look like a patissier?

258
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,800
Indeed you do.

259
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,200
Very much.

260
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,900
Darling, you said I should find a job

261
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,600
to keep myself occupied.

262
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,800
So I rented this place.

263
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,400
It's just opposite your hospital.

264
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,500
We can go to work and leave together every day.

265
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,200
Don't you think I'm thorough, darling?

266
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,800
But...

267
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Running a bakery is a lot of work.

268
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,200
And you just snapped your fingers. Will it last long?

269
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Don't worry, darling.

270
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,600
I've always liked making desserts.

271
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,400
For sure, I'll be fantastic at it.

272
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,800
Very well, then.

273
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
Since we have discussed before,

274
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,400
and you were all happy with the price we offered.

275
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Today, I've invited you here to discuss the discounts.

276
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Here is what I think—

277
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
You know our prices over the past years.

278
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,600
This is the lowest we could offer.

279
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
True. It won't even cover the cost if it gets lower.

280
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
I understand that.

281
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,100
First, let me finish.

282
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,700
This discussion today is also in your own interest.

283
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,800
If you agree with my offer,

284
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,400
Upon the completion of Evergreen Tower No.2,

285
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,800
you can put your own advertisement

286
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,900
in its washrooms, elevators, corridors, etc.

287
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
You all know Evergreen Hotel.

288
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,800
They have a huge clientele, 
which means huge potential benefits.

289
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,600
The way I see it, this is a win-win deal.

290
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,800
Just for your consideration.

291
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,300
- It could work.
- Yeah.

292
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Finally done!

293
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,700
<i>My work is done. Dinner?</i>

294
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,000
<i>Sure, same place.</i>

295
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
<i>Okay!</i>

296
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,800
Tired?

297
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
It's OK.

298
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Hey,

299
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,300
what shall we eat?

300
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,250
Darling!

301
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,600
I’m here to pick you up.

302
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,200
Okay! I'll leave you two to it. I'll disappear!

303
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,090
It's late. How come you are here?

304
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,600
Have you forgotten? My bakery closes at the same time.

305
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,000
From now on, we can come and go together.

306
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,700
How romantic, don't you think?

307
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,100
Fine.

308
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Cheers!

309
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
You are in a good mood today.

310
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,600
I am! The work is finally finished.

311
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,200
So beautiful is my mood.

312
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,500
Let's drink and celebrate, then.

313
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,000
Sure.

314
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800
Wow. This one finished already.

315
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,600
Excuse me, one more sake, please.

316
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,020
Cheers!

317
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
- Make sure you eat.
- OK.

318
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Why are you watching me?

319
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,200
Eat yourself.

320
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
This is not bad.

321
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,600
Stop drinking.

322
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
Okay, okay.

323
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Here, all yours.

324
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,000
Two more to come. Enjoy!

325
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,100
- Hurry up!
- Fine. You go ahead.

326
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,000
I want the eyes.

327
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
He's the guest. Let him.

328
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,400
- Mom!
- Thanks, antie.

329
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,000
Here.

330
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
Take more.

331
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
I will!

332
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm not full yet.

333
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Rice, please.

334
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,000
OK.

335
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Here, honey.

336
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,000
Thank you!

337
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You are welcome, honey.

338
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,600
Here, honey, open up.

339
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Me, too.

340
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
I say, someone else is here.

341
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,790
Antie, please help yourself.

342
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm so stuffed.

343
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,880
And he forgot his wallat.

344
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,800
Mom.

345
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
What are you doing?

346
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,400
Give it back!

347
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,000
- Give me the photo.
- I gave it to Sheng.

348
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
- You gave it to him?
- Mhm.

349
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
What's going on? Are you selling your own daughter?

350
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Correct! Congratulations!

351
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,800
Let go of me.

352
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,900
What kind of mother are you?

353
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,300
Fine, I won't give him.

354
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
What cruelty.

355
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,700
Also, my mom likes you a lot.

356
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,700
She won't say no if I marry you on the spot.

357
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Can't you

358
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,800
be a little annoying? Keep some distance from her.

359
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,400
Make her hate you.

360
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,000
In this way, when I dump you, she won't hate me.

361
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,400
The image I build is a dedicated nice guy.

362
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
What are you doing?

363
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,200
Nothing.

364
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

365
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,300
Then what?

366
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,900
That photo in your wallet, I want it back.

367
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,900
I hid it.

368
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,000
I know. Where?

369
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm telling you, you'll never find it.

370
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,600
That's my photo.

371
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,400
Antie gave it to me. So, it's mine now.

372
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,800
Tell me, what for?

373
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,400
None of your business.

374
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,700
Do you want to make fun of me?

375
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,800
You are sticking around...what? Wanna watch me sleep?

376
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
Go ahead.

377
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,200
Out!

378
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Just you wait. One day I'll find it.

379
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,930
Xiaoyan, what's on your mind?

380
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:11,570
I saw sis seeing a stranger off a few days ago. 
Maybe they have a thing?

381
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,160
Client, maybe? Don't overthink.

382
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,100
Fine. I've got my eyes on them anyway. 
Don't you lie to me!

383
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,640
I want to ask you something.

384
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,740
If a man makes congee for you

385
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,290
when you have a hangover, gives you his door pin

386
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,140
and often treats you with dinners and drinks.

387
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,990
Do you think he likes you?

388
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,390
Someone is wooing you?

389
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,770
Not me! It happened to my friend. She was asking me.

390
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,030
Your friend sounds like a romance idiot.

391
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,350
Only under two circumstances will a man go this far.

392
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,670
Which are?

393
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,900
One, he likes her.

394
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,400
And the second?

395
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,770
Two, they are siblings long separated.

396
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,250
What do you think my friend should do?

397
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:24,540
If I were her, I will initiate. Give more positive reactions.

398
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,840
How?

399
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,610
Boss, something's up.

400
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,070
What's wrong?

401
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,400
Heavy rain in the south. Our delivery trucks got caught up in mudslide and rolled over.

402
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,170
Luckily, no one got hurt. But we lost the timber and the tiles.

403
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,030
Was it fully insured?

404
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,230
I've contacted them. They are dodging with excuses.

405
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,220
Even if we get compensation, it would only be 10%. 
Should we go to court?

406
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,130
If we go to court, everything will be too late.

407
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,420
Make purchases again. We won't push the deadline.

408
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,020
Understood.

409
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,450
How much loss?

410
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,780
Four trucks' worth.

411
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,980
They already have a tight budget. It won't last long.

412
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,920
Are you busy, Mr. Qin?

413
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,380
Hello, please sit.

414
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,430
You can't spare 3 million?

415
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,050
You are a member of the board.

416
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,050
For sure, you can benefit from the completion of Tower No.2.

417
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,690
OK, understood.

418
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,980
Hey, I've heard.

419
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,460
Are we getting tight?

420
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:00,350
Okay, I'll try to bring the price further down.

421
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,630
It can't be.

422
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,650
Lower prices might compromise the quality of the product.
I don't want that.

423
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,460
Then what can we do?

424
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,410
Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

425
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,510
This can't happen again.

426
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,870
Not just me, other shareholders are not happy

427
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,450
with Sheng's decision, either.

428
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,880
He's too young, easily carried away by impulse.

429
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,180
We've been discussing,

430
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,570
and agreed that you are a better fit 
for the general manager post.

431
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,340
If you are willing,

432
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,170
We can join forces with other few shareholders 
and make it happen.

433
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,580
No need to concern.

434
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,000
We only need to persuade the shareholders 
who are close to Sheng.

435
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,650
It won't be too hard. But the thing is, are you willing?

436
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,260
Please give me some time to consider.

437
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,790
Think it through, then. Give me an answer soon, 
so that we can proceed.

438
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,950
Understood.

439
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,400
This way, please.

440
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,910
What do you think, boss?

441
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,100
It would be nice to become a general manager.

442
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,900
But a handful of shareholders' support won't be enough. 
Sheng is the key.

443
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,030
<i>[Caller: Fu Shuangshuang]</i>

444
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,460
- Hello?
- Hello.

445
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,720
<i>Thanks for taking me home and preparing breakfast.<i></i></i>

446
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,090
No problem.

447
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,710
Are you free tonight? Let me treat you to a movie.

448
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,540
Movie?

449
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,060
I should reciprocate.

450
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,500
- Very well, then. I'll pick you up after work.
- OK.

451
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,480
I'll leave you to your work, then.

452
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,160
Bye.

453
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,790
Boss, could it be that she falls for you?

454
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,550
I don't think it's necessary for you two to stay in touch.

455
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,690
Ah!

456
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:22,330
Um...this is the funny part, not scary yet.

457
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,460
It's just...horror movies are usually funny first,

458
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,090
later you will cry. I'm taking precautions.

459
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:39,590
If you are so scared, why do you have to watch it?

460
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,130
It's... probably been too long.

461
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,600
Not scared now, are you?

462
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,020
Wait,

463
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,840
I'll buy you a beverage.

464
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,370
Okay.

465
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,630
What would you like?

466
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,100
Would you like...?

467
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,410
Anything will do.

468
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,360
Two cokes, please.

469
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,150
We have a promotion for couples. If you two can take a photo,

470
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,390
and pin it on our wall, we will offer free drinks and popcorn. 
How about...

471
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,770
Sorry, you got it wrong. We are not a couple.

472
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,090
Just...a little sister.

473
