00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,550
Mr. Yu is a fence-sitter.

4
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,960
He will change his mind when he see
those negative comments

5
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,320
about Evergreen.

6
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,550
Ask Mr. Xue to take this chance
to approach him,

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,510
and see if it's possible to convince him
to transfer the shares.

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,150
Okay.

9
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,680
Anything else you want me
to do about Evergreen?

10
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,199
No.

11
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,430

Hello, Mom.

14
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,680
What's up?

15
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,710
Xia Qian.

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
You must come back for dinner tonight.

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,630
I have something important to tell you.

18
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,200
Do you hear me?

19
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,430
Okay.

20
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,230
I see.

21
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,870
Bye.

24
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,200
Look at number six.

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,150
How is he?

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,710
He is a little bit too old.

27
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,320
He is much older than Qian.

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
What's wrong with that?

29
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,350
The older one cherishes his partner more,

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,960
but he is too ugly.

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,400
He must meet
his mother-in-law's standard first,

32
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,680
otherwise it will affect

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,710
the genes of our future grandchildren.

34
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,280
Well.

35
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,040
You are only invited here

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,120
to give some advice.

37
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,710
Be aware of who you are.

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,840
All right.

39
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,560
I will be aware of who I am.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,200
You know what, He Zhijun

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,680
looked decent back then,

42
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,630
but I just don't like him.

43
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,230
I don't think he is

44
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,350
that kind of guy who can
share a meal with us in the same pot.

45
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,120
And then

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,870
what happened in the end?

47
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,840
You have a lot of foresight.

48
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,480
Of course.

49
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,200
Well,

50
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,590
do you think we can

51
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,120
share a meal in the same pot?

52
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,480
Do you want to be punished?

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,400
Do you want to clean the pot?

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,350
No.

55
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,840
Actually, I think this one

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,870
looks all right. See.

57
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,320
He seems to be pretty honest.

58
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,480
He looks aggressive.

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
He does look aggressive.

60
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,510
What's good about them?

61
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,870
When did you come back?

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,590
You walked too quietly,

63
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,350
you know.

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,430
I've been listening to you two for a while.

65
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,590

00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,839
They are all pretty good, I mean it.

Uncle Hu.

78
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,400
Why are you on her side?

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,400
She has phased obsessive-compulsive disorder.

You...

81
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,280
See for yourself.

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,190
What's this?

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,470
I don't have any feelings for them. Too ugly.

84
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,190
Wait.

85
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,190
There are a bunch of guys.

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,880
I don't get it.

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,510
How can you not have any feelings?

88
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,960
Stop eating.

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,630
Just look at it closely.

90
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,400
Look at it really closely,

91
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
then you will have feelings.

92
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,160
Falling in love at first sight
happens rarely.

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,680
Love grows when

94
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,630
you look at me, I look at you,

95
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,720
and you keep looking at me,
and I keep looking at you.

96
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,190
Fine. Don't look at it.

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,470
Let's not look at them.

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,310
Let's listen.

99
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,440
Let's listen.

100
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,190
Let them tell her.

101
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,560
My name is Hu Lang.

102
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,470
I'll play it to you.

103
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,190
Just listen.

104
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,280
Nod your head

105
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,070
when you like him,

106
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,630
and I'll ask your uncle to write it down.

107
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,720
Just listen.

108
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,400
What are you doing?

109
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,560
I just want to have some home-made food.

110
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,560
I finally got home,

111
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,400
can't you leave me alone for a while?

112
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,120
No one keeps you from having home-made food.

113
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,470
The point is

114
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,350
we don't have blind dates
in this way anymore.

115
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,790
We don't need the tapes and the phones.

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,190
It's outdated.

117
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,230
We all use

118
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,720
apps

119
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,310
and various dating platforms.

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,160
Don't worry. I know how to do.

121
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,350
Don't worry.

122
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,230
Show me your phone.

123
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,680
Let me see if there is any app in it

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
and if there is any suitable man in the app.

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:48,910
Give it to...

126
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,960
Can't you let it go?

127
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,310
I'm full and I'm going back.

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,400
Qian.

129
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,750
Wait, did I say anything wrong?

130
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,470
Why is she so angry?

131
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,230
Is it because the guys we picked
are not good enough?

132
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,470
She is too snappy.

133
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,910
Meng.

134
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,630
Honey, you are back.

135
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,120
Why did you take these things out?

136
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,510
What's wrong?

137
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,310
Is there anything I can't see?

138
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,960
No.

139
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,400
You can see if you want.

140
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,790
Honey, look.

141
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,190
You were so silly and cute back then.

142
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,880
Meng.

143
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,160
Stop looking at it.

144
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,750
What's wrong?

145
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,440
I just want to take a look.

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,310
It's your wedding vows.

147
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Xia Qian.

148
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,790
I like how energetic

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
and how hearty you are.

150
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,400
You are like a little sun

151
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,440
shining on me all the time

152
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,120
and making me feel bright and radiant.

153
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,030
From now on...

154
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,720
Stop reading it.

155
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,880
It's so romantic.

156
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,070
It's in the past.

157
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,600
Don't think too much about it.

158
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,910
I know it must be hard for you.

159
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,630
You learned

160
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,030
my relationship with Xia Qian at our wedding

161
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,630
and you can't accept it.

162
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,910
I should have told you earlier,

163
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,000
but I was afraid that you would
think too much about it.

164
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,630
I really have nothing to do with
Xia Qian now.

165
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,910
But our wedding was interrupted.

166
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,190
We didn't even finish our vows

167
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,190
in the wedding.

168
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
I think our wedding is incomplete

169
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
and imperfect.

170
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
Who said that?

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,880
We have our family's blessings

172
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,280
and the most beautiful bride

173
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,560
at our wedding.

174
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,960
It's the most perfect wedding.

175
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,310
By the way,

176
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,910
you promised me.

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
Don't fill your head with these thoughts.

178
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,960
Always live a positive and happy life.

179
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,630
Mr. Sheng.

180
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,360
We are going to

181
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,310
negotiate with the couple for Evergreen

182
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,670
and see if there is any way to solve it.

183
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,110
It happened

184
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,550
because we took the order.

185
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,550
We are more or less
indirectly responsible for it.

186
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,400
If we could be more careful

187
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,280
and more cautious,

188
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,280
maybe none of this would have happened.

189
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,190
They came after Evergreen

190
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,870
and came after me.

191
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,670
Even without this matter,

192
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,600
they would try to get something else on us.

193
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,840
You mean they?

194
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,310
It's more complicated than I thought.

195
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,510
Are you really sure you want to get in this?

196
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,430
Or what?

197
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,360
It must be solved

198
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,360
so that I can have a good sleep.

199
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,310
A financial planner.

200
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,240
Thirty-four years old.

201
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,630
He looks good.

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,670
Next one.

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
This Liu is good.

204
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,990
You're back.

205
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,630
Why are you back so late?

206
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,110
Is your injury healed?

207
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,510
Are you here to urge me to get married?

208
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,600
No.

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,920
I'm not here urge you today.

210
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,630
I brought some food for you.

211
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,070
All right.

212
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,800
Since you're back,

213
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,630
I'm leaving then.

214
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,870
Don't go.

215
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,310
Sit down.

216
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,190
Thanks, Mom.

217
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,840
As long as you don't urge me,

218
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,110
you are my good mom.

219
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,480
You...

220
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,600
Don't leave tonight.

221
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,840
Stay here with me.

222
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,550
It's strange.

223
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,800
Anything happened?

224
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,280
Nothing.

225
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,720
I couldn't sleep well these days.

226
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,110
I can only sleep well with you being around.

227
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,960
Fine.

228
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,190
I can sleep here,

229
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,670
but you have to promise me

230
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
that we won't sleep in the same room.

231
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,400
You're a bad sleeper.

232
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,280
You punch and kick in your dream.

233
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,070
You fall asleep vertically
and wake up horizontally.

234
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,550
You fall asleep horizontally
and wake up vertically.

235
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,750
Will any man dare to

236
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,550
marry you when they know that?

237
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,840
What's more scary is

238
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,280
that in the midnight...

239
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,630
How many times have I told you?

240
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,360
You can say anything

241
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,110
except

242
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,800
this matter.

243
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,280
Okay, I see.

244
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,400
I should just marry you off
as soon as possible.

245
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Again.

246
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,160
All right, I won't say it.

247
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,840
What?

248
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I've thought about it.

249
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,720
It's too hard to

250
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,550
marry a good man now.

251
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,430
I think we should find
a matrilocal son-in-law.

252
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,110
I can rest assured

253
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,310
in this way.

254
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,190
The point is that I have found a guy for you.

255
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Why are you here?

256
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,600
Evergreen's reputation is damaged.

257
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm broke now

258
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,480
and I owe a lot of money.

259
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Aunt Dou promised me

260
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,670
that she will pay the debt for me

261
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,190
if I marry you.

262
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,190
How is my taste?

263
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
Look at his figure

264
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,160
and his face.

265
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,550
If it wasn't for Evergreen's bankruptcy,

266
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,960
how would you have such a good chance?

267
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,400
Sheng.

268
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,110
I won't ask anything else

269
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,040
from you.

270
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,990
Two kids in three years.

271
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,040
Can you do it?

272
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,310
I'll try.

273
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,190
Louder.

274
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,720
I will try.

275
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,160
Good. Good.

276
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
No time like the present.

277
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,310
Well,

278
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,280
you two get married tomorrow.

279
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,600
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

280
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,240
Yeah.

281
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,040
I was having a nightmare all night.

282
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,070
You kept calling someone named Sheng...

283
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,800
Sheng and something and Ning...

284
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,280
Sheng...

285
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
What's the name...

286
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,360
Sheng Zhening?

287
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,800
Yes.

288
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,630
That's the name.

289
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,550
- You also said...
- Why would I call his name?

290
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,600
you said

291
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,040
“I won't bear your children”,

292
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,240
“I won't bear your children”.

293
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
Who is Sheng Zhening?

294
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,310
He looks really good.

295
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,800
Really?

296
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,070
He is also kind.

297
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,840
Mom.

298
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,070
I read a novel recently.

299
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,310
Sheng Zhening is the protagonist in it.

300
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,990
I really like him.

301
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,480
I dreamed

302
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,600
that I was with him last night.

303
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,480
What's wrong with you?

304
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,160
You only dream of these useless things.

305
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,670
Can the man in the novel marry you

306
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,840
or have a baby with you?

307
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,750
How is it useless?

308
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,920
Can't I even have a dream?

309
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,550
Just eat.

310
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,840
[Sheng Zhening]

311
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,280
Who is it?

312
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,870
A girlfriend.

313
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,070
Hello.

314
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,430
Hello.

315
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,630
I'm at your house.

316
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,110
Come down.

317
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,190
Wait.

318
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,480
What are you doing here?

319
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,840
You don't have to pick me up.

320
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,160
I'll go there by myself.

321
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,920
It's okay. It's on my way.

322
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,920
It's on you way.

323
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,160
Okay, thanks.

324
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,510
Who is that?

325
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,600
A client.

326
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,280
We really connected.

327
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,310
She is a girlfriend I met recently.

328
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,550
You two connected.

329
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,550
A client.

330
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,670
Male or female?

331
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,720
A girlfriend, Mom.

332
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,510
You are such a gossip.

333
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,990
I'm leaving.

334
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,750
She is waiting for me.

335
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,840
You are not eating anymore?

336
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,430
I'll eat with my girlfriend.

337
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,920
Okay, clean it up.

338
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,990
Hello.

339
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,430
Let's go?

340
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,920
Are you giving me a ride?

341
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,870
Get in the car.

342
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,520
[Mom]

343
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Mom, what's wrong?

344
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,920
Let me ask you.

345
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,070
Do you have a boyfriend?

346
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,870
Why are you talking about this again?

347
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,750
How do I have a boyfriend?

348
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,310
Stop fooling me.

349
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,750
I just saw it.

350
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,160
You lied to me.

351
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,840
You told me it's a female client.

352
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,670
Is he that person?

353
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,070
How long have you known each other?

354
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,840
When are you going to bring him back

355
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,190
and let me see him?

356
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,720
Mom.

357
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,280
I'm outside now.

358
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,750
I'll talk to you later tonight.

359
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,280
No, no.

360
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,550
Tell me what happened now.

361
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,110
You kept calling

362
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,070
a name, Sheng something Ning,

363
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,360
in your dream last night.

364
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,070
Is he that person?

365
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,190
You said you won't bear his children.

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,270
Are you pregnant?

367
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,599
Hello?

368
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,640
Hello?

369
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,550
What's wrong? Bad reception?

370
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,600
Hello?

371
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What's wrong?

372
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,430
She hung up on me.

373
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,960
I guess the phone is too old.

374
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
It doesn't work very well recently.

375
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,240
I should get a new one.

376
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,390
Is your mother angry?

377
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,520
No.

378
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,000
She is just like that.

379
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
She makes a big deal out of everything

380
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,520
and she is always suspicious.

381
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,520
It's okay.

382
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,270
Did you not sleep well these days?

383
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,840
No.

384
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,270
I'm a pretty strange person.

385
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,480
I sleep really well.

386
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,240
I never dream or something like that.

387
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,070
Han Chao's car is already there.

388
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,640
I think he is inside.

389
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,640
Let's go.

390
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,030
Han Chao has been avoiding us.

391
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,190
I heard

392
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,910
that he has a special relationship
with this tea house.

393
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,270
He will save a lot of good tea

394
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,150
for them in private.

395
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,600
He comes here to have tea with his friends

396
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,070
this time of every month.

397
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,270
Not with his wife?

398
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,550
Looks like you are the clingy type.

399
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,120
Still play together after getting married.

400
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,000
Except

401
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,360
the working hours

402
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,150
and a little private space

403
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,960
for each other,

404
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,840
an intimate couple spends
the rest of the time together.

405
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,360
You think quite a lot.

406
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,790
Looks like you've made many plans.

407
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Is it bad?

408
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,640
Has Mr. Han Chao arrived?

409
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,270
I don't think Mr. Han
has an appointment today.

410
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,190
We just made an appointment.

411
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,190
Well,

412
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,840
we'll see Mr. Han after he is finished.

413
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
We want a box.

414
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,240
Make me a pot of the best tea.

415
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,670
We'll have some tea first.

416
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,760
Let's go.

417
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,480
Please come with me.

418
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,070
Let go of my hand.

419
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,670
Work with me. Don't mess it up.

420
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,000
Watch the steps.

421
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,640
This way, please.

422
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,120
This room is nice.

423
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,360
What do you think?

424
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,670
There is sunshine in the south facing room.

425
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,520
The view is good, too.

426
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,270
Honey.

427
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,270
I don't like other rooms.

428
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,600
I just like this one.

429
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,910
Is it okay?

430
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,520
Anything you want.

431
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,000
This one.

432
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,360
Please have a seat.

433
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,270
I'll serve you tea right away.

434
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,310
If you hold me so tightly

435
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,070
and closely again...

436
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,520
Be careful.

437
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,910
It surprised me

438
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,150
that you can act cute.

439
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
You can show more of your cute side

440
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,000
in the future.

441
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,270
It's work. What can I do?

442
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,520
Aren't I cute most of the time?

443
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Don't mention it again.

444
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,360
Do you think

445
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,150
that foreman has a very weird attitude?

446
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,390
It's like Han Chao is

447
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,880
doing something unethical here.

448
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,390
I just saw

449
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,120
a woman in the next room.

450
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,840
I don't think she is Mrs. Han.

451
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,910
Surely not.

452
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,670
Sounds like she is having a good time.

453
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,790
I will bring you with me

454
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,480
if I go to this kind of place next time.

455
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,760
I brought you here this time.

456
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,760
It sounds like there are two people.

457
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,000
Isn't it a friends gathering?

458
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,960
Interesting.

459
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,760
Sorry

460
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,840
that we came in without knocking.

461
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,270
Hurry.

462
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,070
Sorry for the disturbance.

463
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,640
Let's go.

464
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,760
My bag.

465
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,430
No need to see me off.

466
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,760
I'll come again when I have time.

467
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,520
I don't want you to leave.

468
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,270
Be good.

469
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,520
I'll come to see you whenever I have time.

470
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,190
Give me a hug.

471
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,430
Jerk.

472
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,000
Madam.

473
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,910
A couple wants to see Mr. Han.

474
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,190
Who?

475
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,360
They are in this room.

476
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,270
I have to go.

477
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,000
Are you still angry?

478
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,390
Pull up.

479
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,240
I want to get off and calm down.

480
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,000
It's their business.

481
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,790
Do you have to be that mad?

482
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,640
He's a jerk.

483
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,270
Don't be mad, all right?

484
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,070
How about this,

485
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,550
I'll take you to have something delicious.

486
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,270
How is it?

487
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,240
Aren't you mad at

488
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,030
such things

489
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,760
and such people?

490
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,640
What's to be mad at?

491
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,640
Pull up.

492
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,070
I'm worried that you will do
something stupid.

493
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,640
That I will go back and beat him up?

494
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,880
I'm worried that you will tell his wife.

495
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,960
Shouldn't I tell his wife?

496
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,790
She has been cheated for years just like me,

497
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,430
but she still feels happy

498
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,360
and enjoys her marriage.

499
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,150
Is it good?

500
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,760
I understand how you feel.

501
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,840
But,

502
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,640
it's still their family affair.

503
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Don't get too involved in this.

504
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,030
What's more,

505
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,240
considering our relationship with Mrs. Han,

506
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,600
I don't think it's proper

507
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,550
for us to tell her about it.

508
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,190
All right, I know it.

509
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,070
Otherwise I won't be so annoyed.

510
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,550
I'm having a meeting later.

511
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,390
I'll ask An An to drive you home.

512
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,790
Don't bother.

513
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,790
I'll get a cab.

514
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,640
I think I left my phone in your car.

515
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,190
Give me your car keys.

516
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,840
Okay.

517
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,390
Give the keys to An An

518
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,880
after you get your phone.

519
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,910
Go ahead.

520
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,480
Mr. Sheng.

521
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,960
Mr. Han.

522
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,550
I couldn't find you.

523
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,520
I didn't expect to run into you here.

524
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
Are you here for a meal?

525
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,720
Don't you know why I'm here to see you?

526
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,520
Let's talk.

527
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,150
Oh, right.

528
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,640
We haven't talked about

529
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,600
you slandering Evergreen.

530
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,960
Are you going to apologize to Evergreen first

531
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,840
or tell me

532
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,310
who asked you to do it?

533
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,390
I just want to make a deal with you.

534
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,150
We don't trust each other at all.

535
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,960
Not to mention making a deal.

536
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,960
Control yourself.

537
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,600
I'll withdraw the lawsuit
against Evergreen right away

538
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,190
as long as you won't tell my wife

539
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,240
what you saw today.

540
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,840
That's what it is.

541
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,880
It turns out that Mr. Han also worries about

542
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,640
being caught cheating.

543
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,150
Don't you get tired?

544
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,670
It's a mistake that every man makes.

545
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,120
Besides, I'll go home after having fun.

546
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,720
And my feelings are real.

547
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,520
So,

548
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,270
I think you won't go too far.

549
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,550
I think you got me wrong.

550
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I'm not interested in

551
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,600
your family affair at all,

552
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,360
and I'm not a contemptible man

553
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,600
who would use this kind of disgraceful thing
as a bargaining chip.

554
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,640
But you slandered Evergreen.

555
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,150
I will make you pay in another way

556
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,390
and you will accept your defeat.

557
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,880
Sheng Zhening.

558
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
Don't be such a hypocrite.

559
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,240
As far as I know,

560
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,000
Evergreen is in a mess.

561
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,520
I'd like to see how long
you are going to make it.

562
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,790
Don't

563
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,310
worry about that.

564
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,270
Since you are so clear about

565
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,310
what's going on inside Evergreen,

566
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,790
I guess the person who supports you

567
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,360
is not far away from me.

568
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,960
By the way,

569
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,190
I need to correct you

570
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,910
that not all men

571
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,910
like to cheat.

572
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,360
Mr. Sheng.

573
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,600
Your keys.

574
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,310
Little girl.

575
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,120
Eavesdropping is not a good thing.

576
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,390
You were making a good point.

577
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,270
I was learning from you.

578
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,270
It's a little improper

579
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,120
to look at me in this way.

580
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,000
That's how I look at people.

581
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,960
You are over thinking.

582
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,520
I'm exhausted.

583
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,520
I told you not to go.

584
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,360
You had to be there.

585
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,520
Exactly.

586
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,150
What do you get?

587
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,960
Han Chao

588
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,960
is a jerk.

589
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,670
He cheated on his wife.

590
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,190
He is having an affair with another woman.

591
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,840
How long has he been married?

592
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,070
Does his wife know it?

593
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,550
Of course not.

594
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,550
Shuangshuang, it was killing me.

595
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,270
I really want to rush to Yan Caiting

596
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,910
and tell her

597
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,430
to wake up.

598
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,670
Her husband cheated on her.

599
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,640
Calm down first.

600
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,240
Don't get too mad.

601
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,430
Do you want someone

602
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,390
to tell you the truth back then?

603
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,640
They could remind me in a gentle way

604
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,120
or just tell me,

605
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,070
I can accept it,

606
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,960
so I wouldn't get hit so hard

607
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,790
when I suddenly knew the truth.

608
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,430
Qian.

609
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,190
I get it.

610
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,790
It's okay.

611
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,880
All right.

612
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,310
Relationship is too complicated.

613
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,240
Hello.

614
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,880
I made an appointment in advance.

615
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,190
This is my trial voucher.

616
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,550
Okay.

617
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,910
Just a moment, I'll register for you.

618
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,030
Ms. Yan.

619
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,910
Please wait for a moment.

620
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,270
Your beautician will be ready soon.

621
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,640
Thanks.

622
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:47,960
Yan...

623
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,270
This way, please.

624
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,030
Miss Xia.

625
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,190
Ms. Yan.

626
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,270
Oh right.

627
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,960
I should call you Mrs. Han now.

628
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,150
You can call me anything you want.

629
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,600
Why are you here?

630
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,520
My company took a group order.

631
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,670
I'm here to experience the service
for the clients.

632
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,520
Your work is quite interesting.

633
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,070
Hello.

634
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,880
Put us in the same room.

635
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,070
Okay.

636
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,240
Is it okay?

637
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,720
Of course.

638
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,520
We can have a good chat then.

639
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,360
Let's go.

640
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:21,880
Okay.

641
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,960
This way, please.

642
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,390
Thanks.

643
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,030
It feels good.

644
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,310
Mrs. Han.

645
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,000
Your skin is so good.

646
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,150
Looks like having a facial here regularly

647
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,150
does work.

648
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,720
Miss Xia, you are born with good skin.

649
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,310
You don't need to spend so much time

650
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,120
getting a facial like us.

651
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,270
No. No.

652
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,840
You are loved.

653
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,120
Your complexion

654
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,840
is good from the inside out.

655
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,880
By the way,

656
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,070
how is it going with Mr. Sheng?

657
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:18,880
Who?

658
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,150
Mr. Sheng.

659
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,240
He and I?

660
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,480
There is nothing between us.

661
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
We are enemies.

662
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,760
I think you two fit each other.

663
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,480
You will make an interesting couple.

664
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,760
What about Mr. Han?

665
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,310
How is he doing?

666
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,390
Did you watch the video online?

667
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,000
It's between men.

668
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,190
Let them solve it on their own.

669
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,640
Don't get me wrong.

670
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,790
I'm not trying to help him.

671
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,120
I want to ask

672
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,000
if your married life

673
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,070
is doing well.

674
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,790
Miss Xia.

675
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,070
You are talking strangely.

676
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,240
Don't you think it's abrupt?

677
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,480
Mrs. Han.

678
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,480
I...

679
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,150
Sorry.

680
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,640
Sorry.

681
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,190
I think I'm a little abrupt.

682
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,640
Sorry that I offended you.

683
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,030
I have something to do.

684
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,270
Have a good rest.

685
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm leaving.

686
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,150
See you next time.

687
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,670
It's work.

688
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,760
I met Xia Qian today.

689
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
Do you remember her?

690
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,720
The one who came to discuss the wedding date?

691
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,790
I thought

692
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,430
she came for Evergreen,

693
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,840
but it turned out
we just ran into each other.

694
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,720
Don't worry.

695
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,000
I'll take care of it.

696
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,150
I'll go to the bathroom.

697
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,390
Hello.

698
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:47,910
Ms. Yan.

699
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,520
I need you to investigate a person.

700
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,280
Hello, madam.

701
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,150
Do you want some tea?

702
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,870
This house was rented not long ago, right?

703
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,909
Han is a stingy man.

704
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,760
Don't you think you deserve better than this?

705
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm not going to be with him
for the rest of my life.

706
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,520
All I want is to be happy now.

707
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,000
He has gained some experience.

708
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,480
He only picks girls like you,

709
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,320
so he can hide it well when he comes home.

710
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,630
You are generous.

711
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,350
You still married him anyway.

712
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,429
He cried and begged me to marry him.

713
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,080
He said he would change.

714
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,800
I don't know if he changed,

715
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,759
but he gave me everything he could.

716
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,080
He is just having some fresh air here.

717
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,910
Han and I

718
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,670
took this phone taken in the Aegean Sea.

719
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,670
I heard that you also
like the Aegean Sea a lot.

720
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,630
Has Han taken you there?

721
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,630
I think he won't have the chance

722
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,480
to take you there anymore.

723
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,870
Sheng Zhening!

724
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,520
You are a two-faced man.

725
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,720
You played dirty.

726
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,520
You are such a hypocrite!

727
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,190
Such a hypocrite!

728
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,240
What are you doing?

729
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,760
Go away.

730
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,390
An An.

731
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,670
Mr. Han.

732
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

733
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,590
Drop the act.

734
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,150
Didn't you promise not to tell my wife?

735
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,590
Now she knows everything.

736
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,080
Fine.

737
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,670
Even if it wasn't you,

738
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,390
it was that the stupid woman around you

739
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,350
who did it.

740
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,910
Watch your mouth.

741
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,870
Let's solve all of our problems this time.

742
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Wait for the lawyer's letter.

743
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,480
Security guard!

744
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,000
Send him out.

745
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,190
Let's wait and see.

746
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,040
Han always said he is busy

747
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,830
and he doesn't time to take me on a trip.

748
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,320
But I didn't know until today

749
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,280
that he took a woman

750
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,480
to the Aegean Sea

751
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,590
when I was sick at home.

752
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,800
I told him my wish thousands of times,

753
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,630
but he did it with another woman.

754
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,240
Ms. Yan.

755
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,910
I understand your feelings.

756
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,830
I feel like I'm a joke.

757
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,000
I forgave him again and again.

758
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,870
I thought he was ready to
settle down with me.

759
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,320
Now I finally see through him.

760
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,520
If

761
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,000
you need help,

762
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,280
I will try to help you.

763
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,590
I think I can help you

764
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,590
with Evergreen.

765
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,480
Really?

766
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,150
That would be great.

767
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,320
Actually, I've been curious about

768
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,560
who is trying to bring down Evergreen

769
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,560
and who is behind everything.

770
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,830
I remember

771
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,150
where was a woman who came to us

772
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,080
and asked us to give you what you want.

773
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,110
She said if we work with her,

774
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,040
we will get a substantial reward.

775
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,960
Hello.

776
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,870
I'm here on behalf of Lihe Capital.

777
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,390
I hope you can agree to Xia Qian's request.

778
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,520
Thanks.

779
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,590
Nice doing business with you.

780
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,830
Who gave money to this woman?

781
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,960
Han mentioned it.

782
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,000
I think it's called

783
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,430
Lihe Capital.

784
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,960
I advised him

785
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,670
not to get involved in it,

786
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,590
but he won't listen to me.

787
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,830
Mrs. Han.

788
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,240
I don't care why you and Mr. Han

789
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
did it,

790
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,040
or who asked you to do it,

791
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,910
you can come at me.

792
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,190
It has nothing to do with her.

793
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,430
Don't get this wrong.

794
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,630
She is here to help us.

795
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,560
I told you he still cares about you.

796
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,910
All right.

797
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,350
Tell Han Chao

798
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,430
that if he wants to take this to court,

799
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,560
I'll be on Evergreen's side.

800
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,720
I see.

801
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,280
[Worth Or Not]

802
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,150
Ms. Yan just said

803
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
that Lihe Capital is behind this.

804
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,590
Does Evergreen have any issue

805
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,590
with Lihe Capital?

806
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
I only heard

807
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,430
that Lihe Capital wants
to acquire Evergreen.

808
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,320
Looks like

809
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,390
they have already taken actions.

810
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,720
Don't worry.

811
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,870
These things are very common

812
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,080
in business relations.

813
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,960
Besides, Mrs. Han has agreed

814
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,830
to make a video statement for us.

815
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,720
Just leave the rest of it

816
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,430
to Evergreen's PR Dept.

817
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,870
Okay.

818
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,630
I almost forgot it.

819
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,150
I need to go to my mom's place.

820
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,760
I'll drive you there.

821
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,000
What are you laughing at?

822
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,390
Nothing.

823
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,000
It feels like you really become my driver.

824
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:15,910
Let's go.

825
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,000
All right.

826
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,800
Thank you for driving me back, Mr. Sheng.

827
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,000
You did Evergreen a big favor.

828
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,350
I should be thanking you.

829
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,000
No need to say that.

830
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,760
Bye.

831
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,760
Wait!

832
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,320
Wait!

833
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,830
Since we are here,

834
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,520
