4
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,620
How come I've twisted my ankle?

5
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,480
You're getting old.

6
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,120
The ground wasn't flat.

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,890
Alright.

8
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,870
Easy, take it slowly.

9
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,450
Rest early.

10
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,640
How come he still has no feelings for me, even after that?

11
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,010
What happened to me?

12
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,990
His "I love you" was meant for someone else.

13
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,500
Any other ways?

14
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,980
Actually, it's not important if he likes your friend or not.

15
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,680
What's important is if your friend likes him or not.

16
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,730
She hasn't asked him yet.

17
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,730
She should hurry up.

18
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,930
It's so hard.

19
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,840
<i> It's just been a few days. You have to hold on to it.</i>

20
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,370
Otherwise, all your previous effort will be wasted,

21
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,940
Hello.

22
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,900
I've finished the price comparison report.

23
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,240
OK, I'll bring it to you now.

24
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,510
Hi, here's the menu. Let me know if you need anything.

25
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,140
Okay.

26
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,870
Slow down, slow down!

27
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,840
Hi, can I order something?

28
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,530
I'm so sorry.

29
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,740
I'm so sorry. Let me help you wipe it off.

30
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,170
It's okay.

31
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,000
He didn't do it on purpose.

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,240
- You can go. I'll deal with it myself. 
 - Okay.

33
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,850
You should be careful next time.

34
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,620
What should I do?

35
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,580
You can use this jacket to hide it.

36
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,580
Thank you so much.

37
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,640
I'll return it to you later.

38
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,420
Thanks.

39
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,820
Excuse me, are you Miss Xia?

40
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,090
-Hello.
 - Hello.

41
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,610
I'm Xia Qian. Please have a seat.

42
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,670
Please.

43
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,580
I'm sorry, I've spilled over some water.

44
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,560
Please take a look at this.

46
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,310
Hey. Aren't you Sheng Zhening's minion?

47
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,940
Aren't you the gofer at Worth or Not?

48
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,850
I want this book.

49
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,320
This is one book.

50
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,170
26 Yuan.

51
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,120
13 Yuan for each of us.

52
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,830
13 Yuan.

53
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,690
Wait for me there. I'll get a change of clothes over to you.

54
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,110
I'll do it. I need to go there for some other errands as well.

55
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,420
Hi.

56
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,640
Here's your jacket.

57
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,110
Thank you.

58
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,730
If I didn't have that, I would have been at a loss.

59
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,280
- You're welcome. 
 - I'm leaving then.

60
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,390
Are you a bargainer?

61
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,600
Have a seat and let's chat.

62
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Okay.

63
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,060
This is my business card.

64
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,820
This is my business card.

<i> Lihe Capital 
Qi Lin, Senior Finance Consultant </i>

66
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,910
Miss Xia.

67
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,680
Miss Qi.

68
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,520
I want to consult you about something.

69
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,360
As a bargainer, can you bargain for apartments?

70
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,090
I just returned to China. I'd like to buy a new apartment.

71
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,510
GM Sheng, you have to control yourself.

72
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,510
It's not that I want to see her. I'm just doing my job.

73
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,800
<i> I’m not being clingy. </i>

74
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,750
Okay, but don't do it again.

75
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,050
Bargaining for apartments is a difficult thing indeed .

76
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,780
It's not like furniture or other smaller items

77
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,960
which you can buy in bulk.

78
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,730
Actually, the more you buy, the more room for bargaining.

79
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,980
We need to find a balance point in there.

80
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,740
Well, looks like a bargainer can't really bargain for everything.

81
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,930
Not really. If you really want to...

82
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,520
Why are you here?

83
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,930
Where's Shuangshuang?

84
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,650
She's busy.

85
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,450
Zhening.

86
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,810
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

87
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,370
Let's go.

88
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,060
I didn't expect that we would run into each other there.

89
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,710
What a coincidence.

90
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,460
It's not a coincidence.

91
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,350
That cafe, do you still remember what it used to be?

92
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,270
Stop thinking.

93
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,880
In high school, we used to get milk tea there every day.

94
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,410
Right. It used to be a milk tea bar.

95
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,680
Things changed. I would have forgotten if you didn't ask.

96
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,350
Go on. Don't keep her waiting.

97
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,470
I won't blame you for neglecting your friend when you're in love.

98
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,800
I didn't tell you that I really like her, did I?

99
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,180
You gave up your job as the GM and became her assistant.

100
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,510
Don't tell me it's because you see a lot of potential in being an assistant.

101
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,990
Alright, I'll go inside. See you next time.

102
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,170
Are you very good friends with Qi Lin?

103
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,620
Have you known her for a long time?

104
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,590
When did you get to know each other?

105
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,820
You seem very interested in her.

106
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,800
No. I just like her a lot.

107
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,560
I want to get to know her more. Nothing else.

108
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,300
Just asking.

109
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,610

- Hello? 
 <i> - Hello, Zhening.</i>

114
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,620
- Do you remember our violin teacher back in middle school? 
 - Yeah.

115
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,340
She's celebrating her 60th birthday the day after tomorrow. I'd like to visit her.

116
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,090
<i> Do you have time? </i>

117
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,490
You should go. Why not?

118
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,910
It's a good chance that you and Miss Xia can be separated for a few days.

119
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,280
Or you'll be bored of staying together every day.

120
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,780
Hey. Are you reluctant to leave her?

121
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,260
It's just for one day.

122
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,000
How's that possible.

123
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,860
GM Xia.

<i> Leave Application Form for Worth or Not Employees </i>

125
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,870

With Qi Lin.

127
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,450
No. We've been too busy.

128
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,220
Turn around and look. We still have a lot of report sheets to do.

129
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,810
I really shouldn't have approved this.

130
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,710
But since you've been working hard,

131
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,510
you can go. Come back soon.

132
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,510
Very curious about everything that happened between them?

133
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,620
Feeling uneasy?

134
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Feeling so disturbed and couldn't sleep

135
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,260
at the thought of them being together?

136
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,040
It's not as serious as that.

137
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,290
I can assure you, she soon will be.

138
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,350
What do you think happened to my friend?

139
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,290
What else could it be?

140
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,260
She's in love! She's feeling jealous.

141
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,520
If you don't come to visit me,

142
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,130
I won't even recognize you if I run into you guys in the street!

143
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,020
You've both grown up.

144
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,350
Ms Chen, you haven't changed at all.

145
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,880
- You're still so young. 
 - I'm young?

146
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,380
You're sweet as ever. You always make me happy.

147
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,850
You're not like Sheng.

148
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,080
He doesn't say a word apart from practicing the violin.

149
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,860
I remember that when he had any questions,

150
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,760
he always asked you to speak them up.

151
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,120
Did I?

152
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,980
Ms Chen, I don't remember it.

153
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,830
I remember very clearly about you two.

154
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,920
You were both studying the violin,

155
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,590
Qi was very smart.

156
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,690
She always tried to get words out of me, to teach you

157
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,820
everything I know.

158
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,880
Sheng was very persistent.

159
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,280
Once he decided to do something, he would fully dedicate to it.

160
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,450
He could see nothing else besides that.

161
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,490
Ms Chen, actually, time changed a lot of things.

162
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,330
Look at us. We're different now.

163
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,890
You're still young. Why would you say sad things like that?

164
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,960
If you ask me, I'd say that you look prettier, and he looks more handsome.

165
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,090
Everything else is just like before.

166
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,100
Ms Chen. we're here to celebrate your birthday for you.

167
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,420
Although we stopped learning violin, but we miss you a lot.

168
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,960
Birthday? My birthday isn't today.

169
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,120
My birthday is the day after tomorrow.

170
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,820
- The day after tomorrow? 
 - Right.

171
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,580
<i> [I need to stay here one more day. I'll be back the day after tomorrow.] </i>

172
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,060
I'm so sorry. I got the wrong date.

173
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,330
It's okay.

174
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,030
Sorry I'm late.

175
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,430
Is that all you're wearing today?

176
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,680
How do I look?

177
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,400
The weather forecast says it's going to get a lot colder today.

178
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,990
Didn't you see the weather forecast?

179
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,490
I didn't. I just randomly grabbed a dress. My dresses are all like this.

180
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,420
It... It looks nice.

181
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's hurry up. There are wild swans in this park.

182
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,860
- Are you cold? 
 - No, I'm fine.

183
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,390
Put on my jacket.

184
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,010
No, I'm good. You can keep it.

185
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,390
I'm not cold at all.

186
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,420
But you might catch a cold. That's not good.

187
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,150
See, they wear a lot.

188
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,690
Here.

189
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,790
Maybe we should do it another day.

190
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,130
Thanks. We can't,

191
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,840
we haven't seen the wild swans yet.

192
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,950
I heard it's somewhere here. Where are they?

193
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,150
- Wild swans. 
 - Well...

194
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,660
We can watch the wild swans next time. Okay?

195
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,200
I don't want you to catch a cold.

196
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,820
Next time? No.

197
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,700
Or maybe we can go to the hot pot. I've made a reservation.

198
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,330
- Hot pot? 
 - Yes.

199
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,360
Forget about it. I'll send you home.

200
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,180
Hot pot makes you warm!

201
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,460
This place is the same as before. Nothing's changed.

202
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,810
Do you know why I learned violin back in the days?

203
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,320
Why?

204
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,970
Because of you.

205
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,390
Because of me?

206
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,290
Actually, I didn't like violin at all.

207
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,790
Back in those years, practicing the violin with you was the happiest thing for me.

208
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,180
Would you like some baked sweet potatoes?

209
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,280
I'll be right back.

210
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,120
Hi, sir. I‘d like a sweet potato please.

211
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,870
Would you like to try?

212
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,690
I'm good, thanks.

213
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,550
As I remember, you never eat street snacks.

214
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,790
Then I realized that street snacks are actually good.

215
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,490
Seems like you've changed a lot these years when we were apart.

216
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
Is it because of the girl, Xia Qian?

217
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,940
Maybe.

218
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,790
<i> [What are you busy with?] </i>

219
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,530
<i> What are you busy with? </i>

220
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,240
- You can go work on it. 
 - Okay.

221
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,190
Hello, GM Sheng? What's up?

222
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,580
I really want to know what Xia Qian is doing now.

223
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,190
<i> But I can't contact her. So...</i>

224
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,220
You should go and check what she's doing.

225
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,850
I'm working, GM Sheng. How am I supposed to slip away?

226
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,590
If the HR department looks for you, ask them to call me directly.

227
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,270
Got it.

228
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,360
Hello, Miss Xia.

229
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,220
Thank you.

230
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,240
GM Sheng took a trip to another city.

231
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,600
Didn't he tell you what he's up to?

232
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,230
No.

233
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,670
Why are you here to visit him today?

234
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,480
Well, it's nothing urgent.

235
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,250
I haven't seen him for a while. I just want to see how he's doing.

236
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,450
Hey,

237
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,120
GM Sheng has a friend. Her name is...

238
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,540
Qi... Qi Lin.

239
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,970
Do you know her?

240
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,650
Oh, Qi Lin.

241
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,640
I heard about her from GM Sheng.

242
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,140
They've known each other for a long time,

243
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,810
since they were kids.

244
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,190
They're kind of like childhood sweethearts.

245
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,020
Really?

246
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,100
Why do you ask, Miss Xia?

247
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,560
GM Sheng,

248
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,970
your GM Sheng.

249
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,920
He went on a business trip to another city with Qi Lin.

250
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,750
And it's not even for business.

251
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,860
I don't know what they're up to. But...

252
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,380
She is

253
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,330
a childhood sweetheart.

254
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,810
It's okay if they want to go on a date.

255
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,310
But I'm his boss. He's got work. We've got a lot of work to do,

256
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,200
what if the work gets delayed?

257
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,570
Shouldn't I remind him to come back earlier?

258
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,570
Yes. Miss Xia, you're absolutely right.

259
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,680
GM Sheng's not thinking about dating anyone,

260
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,220
but what if they get in the mood for love on a business trip?

261
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,300
We never know. Love is unpredictable.

262
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,500
How could you have said that?

263
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,620
<i> What if she misunderstands? </i>

264
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,320
Isn't that nice?

265
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,810
Think about it. Even if Miss Xia cares just a little bit about you, she would get nervous.

266
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,020
Next time before you make any decisions, you must let me know. Is that clear?

267
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,500
Okay.

268
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,650
<i> Hurry up, baby. </i>

269
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,260
<i> Daddy! </i>

270
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,600
<i> Come here. </i>

271
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,650
<i> Daddy will hold you up! </i>

272
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,350
<i> - Is it hot today? 
 - Yes! </i>

273
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,330
Have I really caught a cold?

274
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,040
<i> [Old Driver] </i>

275
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,430
Hello?

276
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,450
Hello.

277
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,100
I'm not busy today. Come outside to watch the wild swans.

278
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,400
Sure, great.

279
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,990
Have you caught a cold?

280
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,950
No, no. I got choked on water.

281
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,890
Sheng Zhening!

282
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,830
I'm sorry.

283
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,700
Sheng Zhening!

284
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,510
Look at this.

285
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,740
Your temperature is 38.5°C. How is that okay?

286
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,670
Have some congee.

287
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,450
I'll answer the call.

288
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,420
Hello?

289
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,550
<i> Hello, GM Qin.</i>

290
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,060
There's a contract from the purchasing department that you need to sign.

291
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,540
Are you at home? Shall I bring it to you?

292
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,550
<i> I'm not at home now. </i>

293
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,410
Put the contract on my desk.

294
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,480
I'll sign it tomorrow.

295
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,950
Okay.

296
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,300
You can go back to work. I'll just get some sleep.

297
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,480
It's okay.

298
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,590
Don't worry about me.

299
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,240
Take some rest.

300
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,050
I'm fine. You can go back to work.

301
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,020
- Excuse me. 
 - Hello.

302
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,200
Can you help me look up the room number of Sheng Zhening?

303
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,390
I'm sorry, we can't share that information with you.

304
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,370
I understand.

305
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,120
It's very urgent. I'm his assistant.

306
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,740
He forgot to give me the room card when he left.

307
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,420
I need to pick something up from his room.

308
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,010
I'm so sorry, lady.

309
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,170
This is private information of our guest.

310
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:19,060
I'm very sorry, but we can't tell you that. Please forgive us.

311
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,410
Then what can I do? I can't finish my work.

312
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,860
This is in our company's rules.

313
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,040
We can do nothing about it.

314
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,890
Well then.

315
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,320
Get me a room and I'll wait for him.

316
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,230
Okay, one moment please.

317
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,580
Care to have a drink?

318
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,540
Ruirui, it's getting late. You should go to bed.

319
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,640
<i> Good night, mom. </i>

320
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,070
Go to bed now. I'll be back soon and sleep with you.

321
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,130
<i> Okay. Bye! </i>

322
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,070
Bye!

323
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,520
Why did you decide

324
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,810
to move to a different country?

325
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,040
After I graduated from university,

326
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,050
I really wanted a green card.

327
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,670
So I got married with a local Chinese.

328
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,110
Then we gave birth to Ruirui.

329
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,770
After a long time, I realized

330
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,060
that it was not the life that I wanted.

331
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,630
So I got divorced.

332
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,460
You

333
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,190
have never changed.

334
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,030
Whatever your goal is,

335
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,200
you'll work towards it right away.

336
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,170
In fact, I'm very regretful

337
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,990
that I didn't choose you.

338
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,860
I'm wondering if I've still got a chance

339
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,850
to make up for it.

340
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,580

00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,760
I'm very sorry—

358
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,860
<i>The subscriber you dialed has activated—</i>

359
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,060
Hello, Evergreen Hotel, front desk. May I help you?

360
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,490
Hello. I'd like to speak to Anan, Mr. Sheng's assistant.

361
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,200
Could you patch me through?

362
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,140
I'm sorry. That will be beyond our capacity.

363
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,780
Well...

364
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,270
It's OK. Thanks.

365
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,790
It's all your fault. She is not even picking us now.

366
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,300
It's all my fault.

367
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,250
I'm on my way to explain to her in person.

368
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,670
<i>No need.</i> You will book me a return ticket right now, asap.

369
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,830
<i>I'll tell her myself.</i>

370
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,260
Now?

371
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,300
<i>Have you any idea what time it is? It's too much effort. 
Let me do it</i>

372
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:48,590
Boss...you are too sensitive about this. 
May her phone was dead.

373
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,020
<i>Now you can't think straight because of your feelings for her.</i>

374
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,710
- I think—
- I'm fine being a simp!

375
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,910
The type beyond salvation.

376
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,390
Fine. I'll book the flight right now.

377
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,880
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to be your sister!

378
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,860
Am I not being obvious? I like you!

379
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,080
I want to be your girlfriend!

380
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,090
I'm not a good boyfriend.

381
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,600
You and I won't work.

382
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,750
Can't you spare some more time?

383
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,760
Please bring my apologies to the teacher.

384
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,850
It looks like

385
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,700
I have no chance whatsoever.

386
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,730
Coming back this time, I thought I might have a chance.

387
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,490
Sorry.

388
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,930
For the first time, I know I stand no chance. Best of luck!

389
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,480
Thanks.

390
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,880
<i>The flight is at 11:30.</i>

391
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,060
<i>Now is 10:30. It takes at least an hour to the airport. You better hurry up.</i>

392
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,130
Ok. Got it.

393
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,270
Sorry! Please wait.

394
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,170
One moment.

395
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,230
Wait...

396
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,380
Could you run it a few more times?

397
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,070
Miss, we've run it over 20 times.

398
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,070
That's a lot. It's the end of our shift.

399
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,720
Five times. I won't ask for more.

400
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,010
Very well, Miss.

401
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,060
Mr. Sheng Zhening.

402
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,300

I like you.

420

I just want to be your girlfriend.

421

It's OK.

422
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,720
Anyway, I've said it out loud.
