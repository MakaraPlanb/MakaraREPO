197
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,640
She likes him.

198
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,080
She's jealous.

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,440
If you didn't come

200
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,840
and we met in street,

201
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,910
I would not recognize you.

202
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,350
You've grown up.

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,790
Ms. Chen.

204
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,080
You didn't change at all.

205
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,230
You are still young.

206
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,520
Young?

207
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,670
You are so sweet,

208
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,350
trying to make me happy.

209
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,350
Not like Sheng.

210
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,840
He doesn't talk anything

211
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,640
but violin.

212
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,880
I remember,

213
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,670
when he had questions,

214
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,640
he always told you to ask me.

215
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,670
Did I?

216
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,790
Ms. Chen.

217
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,000
I didn't remember that.

218
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,590
I remember your things

219
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,790
very well.

220
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,550
You know.

221
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,150
You both learned violin.

222
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,710
Qi was smart

223
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,910
and tried every means

224
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,520
to let me teach her

225
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,840
my secret violin skills.

226
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,790
Sheng

227
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,710
is persistent,

228
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,230
devoted to the thing

229
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,230
that he wants to do.

230
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,880
Nothing else can change his mind.

231
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,280
Ms. Chen.

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,960
Time changes many things.

233
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,590
Look, we both

234
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,760
have changed.

235
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,400
Why are you young guys

236
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,710
so moody?

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,790
I think,

238
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,590
you've got more beautiful

239
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,790
and he's got more handsome.

240
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,150
All other things are still the same.

241
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,760
Ms. Chen.

242
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,030
We come here today

243
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,520
to celebrate your birthday.

244
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,000
We haven't

245
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,470
learn violin since then,

246
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,640
but we've been missing you.

247
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,230
Birthday?

248
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,880
You remember it wrong.

249
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,840
My birthday is the day after tomorrow.

250
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,910
The day after tomorrow?

251
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,910
Yes.

252
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,440
[Xia Qian, I can't go back
until the day after tomorrow]

253
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,840
Sorry.

254
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,000
I remember the time wrong.

255
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,350
It's fine.

256
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,430
Sorry, I'm late.

257
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,679
But...

258
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,309
Do you wear so little?

259
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,310
Does it look good?

260
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
The weather forecast says

261
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,310
it'll be cold today.

262
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,280
Didn't you see

263
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,310
the weather forecast?

264
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,830
No, I didn't.

265
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,710
I randomly picked one

266
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,350
from my closet.

267
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,280
Randomly?

268
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,710
It looks good.

269
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,230
Let's go.

270
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,920
There are wild swans in this park.

271
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,400
Are you cold?

272
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,800
I... I'm not.

273
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,470
- Here.
- I'm not.

274
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,110
Take my coat.

275
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,310
No, no, no.

276
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,040
You wear it.

277
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,070
I am not cold at all.

278
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,560
But you'll catch a cold.

279
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,280
That'll be bad.

280
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,680
Look, they all wear so much.

281
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,710
Here.

282
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,160
How about we go home?

283
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,520
Thanks.

284
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,160
We can't.

285
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,640
We haven't seen the wild swans.

286
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,160
They should be nearby.

287
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,640
Where are they?

288
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,880
- But...
- Wild swans.

289
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,920
Let's see them next time.

290
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,470
Okay?

291
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,590
It'll be bad if you

292
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,230
catch a cold.

293
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,830
Next time?

294
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,760
No.

295
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,350
Why don't we go to eat hot pot?

296
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I've ordered the seats.

297
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,680
Hot pot?

298
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,470
Forget it.

299
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll send you home.

300
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,590
Hot pot will keep us warm.

301
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,520
This place is still the same as before.

302
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,400
Nothing changed.

303
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,880
Do you know

304
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,590
why I learnt violin back then?

305
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,560
Why?

306
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,160
For you.

307
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,520
For me?

308
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,880
I didn't like violin at all.

309
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,920
Those years when we studied together

310
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,760
was the happiest time to me.

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,160
Would you like some roasted sweet potatoes?

312
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,350
Wait a minute.

313
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,400
Sir.

314
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,040
A box of sweet potatoes, please.

315
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,110
Would you like to try it?

316
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,680
No, thanks.

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,070
You didn't eat

318
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,470
roadside snacks before.

319
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,070
Then I found that

320
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,800
these snacks were quite good.

321
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,920
Looks like you've changed a lot

322
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,400
these years.

323
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,640
Is it because of Xia Qian?

324
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,040
Probably.

325
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,560
What are you doing?

326
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,430
Go and take care of it.

327
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,070
Yes.

328
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,470
Mr. Sheng.

329
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,070
What's up?

330
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,520
I want to know things

331
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,470
about Xia Qian,

332
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,830
but I can't contact her.

333
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,400
So,

334
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,350
go and see what she is doing.

335
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,830
Mr. Sheng, I'm at work.

336
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,680
I can't.

337
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,430
If HR goes to you,

338
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,400
let him call me directly.

339
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,310
Yes, sir.

340
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,230
Hello, Ms. Xia.

341
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,310
Thanks.

342
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,950
Mr. Sheng

343
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,880
went for a trip.

344
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,560
Did he tell you anything about it?

345
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,310
No.

346
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,400
You come for him today.

347
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,190
What's the matter?

348
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,160
Nothing important.

349
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,280
I haven't seen him for a while.

350
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,230
I come and take a look.

351
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,070
Mr. Sheng has a friend.

352
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,880
Her name is...

353
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,310
Qi...

354
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,040
Qi Lin.

355
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,350
Do you know her?

356
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,800
Qi Lin?

357
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,190
Mr. Sheng mentioned her to me.

358
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
They've known each other

359
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,070
since childhood.

360
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,040
Childhood sweethearts, you can say.

361
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,000
Really?

362
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,110
Miss Xia, why are you asking?

363
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,310
Mr. Sheng,

364
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,470
your boss,

365
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,430
went out for business with Qi Lin.

366
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,800
Not for business.

367
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,110
I don't know what they went for.

368
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,830
It's just...

369
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,230
Are they

370
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,400
childhood sweethearts?

371
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,710
Dating is fine.

372
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,110
But I'm his boss.

373
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,190
He has work to do.

374
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,070
There is much work for him.

375
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,400
What if the work is delayed?

376
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,520
Should I ask him to come back soon?

377
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,110
Yes.

378
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,520
I agree.

379
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,590
He didn't intend to involve
in a relationship.

380
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,950
But they are together on a trip.

381
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,040
It's possible that

382
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,160
they fall in love.

383
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,400
Feelings, you know.

384
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,190
How could you say that?

385
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,590
What if she misunderstood it?

386
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,110
That would be good.

387
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,880
Look.

388
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,310
She'll get nervous

389
