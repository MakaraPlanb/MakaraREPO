[My Bargain Queen]

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,320
Manager Sun didn't recommend me at all.

4
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,080
Then why did Sheng Zhening say that?

5
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,120
Sheng Zhening is the boss
of Evergreen.

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,470
He wants to give you an order,

7
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,470
but because of his ego,

8
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,550
he can't say it directly.

9
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,910
So he took Manager Sun as an excuse.

10
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,760
Why does he insist on

11
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
handing over the order

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,870
of car group buying to me?

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,840
It must be because he did something wrong

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,280
and feels guilty,

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,350
so he wants to make up for it.

16
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,630
What is this?

17
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,480
Heart?

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,280
No.

19
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,990
I mean…

20
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,070
It seems that

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,590
Mr. Sheng is pretty good.

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,590
It is too hot

23
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,350
to drink.

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
What's this? Is it yours?

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,840
Cat food.

26
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,280
You don't have a cat.

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
Why buying cat food?

28
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,760
I found a stray cat

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
in Evergreen.

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
It looks pitiful.

31
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,150
So I feed it once in a while.

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,070
No wonder

33
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,590
you didn't resign.

34
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,790
You are not willing to leave it.

35
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,280
Sort of.

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,400
It must be a very cute cat.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,710
Absolutely.

38
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,480
Nice.

39
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,320
Come on.

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,960
Let's change a posture.

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,680
Here.

42
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,960
Change a posture.

43
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,510
The girl should shake her fist.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,760
And the boy should jump up.

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,790
Something like that.

46
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,280
All right.

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,150
Three, two, one.

48
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,560
Three, two, one. Go.

49
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,070
Nice.

50
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,200
One more.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,070
Good.

52
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:56,840
Here.

53
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,870
Three, two, one.

54
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,790
The set of photos

55
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,510
is perfect.

56
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,350
Very good.

57
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,120
Let's change a posture.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
What about you carry her?

59
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,680
No way.

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,560
My husband just injured his arm.

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,230
Just change a…

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,510
Your arm!

63
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,030
It's okay.

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,310
Bravo.

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,510
Nice.

66
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,280
One more set.

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,000
Hold on.

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,310
You are just going to send a contract.

69
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,000
Why are you so formal?

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,470
I am always like this.

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
In addition to handing
over the contract today,

72
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,880
I also want to thank Sheng Zhening in person.

73
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,840
After all, he gave us

74
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,600
a big order.

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,840
Evergreen is really the best party A
I have ever seen.

76
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,280
Nice order, little work.

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,470
Fast pay.

78
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,030
Just go.

79
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,160
Come on.

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,880
I am leaving.

81
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,880
Fast pay counts most.

82
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,510
Miss Xia.

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,230
Are you looking for Mr. Sheng?

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,310
I want to give him the contract
for the car group buying.

85
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,070
Mr. Sheng is out.

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
When will he be back?

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
I am not sure.

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
If there is any urgency,

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,470
I can give him a call.

90
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,400
Not necessary.

91
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,400
Well.

92
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:22,910
I will give it to you.

93
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,750
Hand it over to him.

94
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,470
Okay.

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,350
I am leaving.

96
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:26,910
Thank you.

97
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,190
Long time no see.

98
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,880
I didn't ask you.

99
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,720
Have you received the handkerchief

100
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,510
I left here before?

101
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,720
Don't you ask me why I am here today?

102
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,680
I came to hand over the contract
to Mr. Sheng.

103
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,030
But he is out.

104
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm unlucky.

105
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,560
You've been in Evergreen for so long.

106
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,160
What do you think of Mr. Sheng?

107
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,310
Do you have a lot to say?

108
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,840
I will give you paper.

109
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,440
Write down all what you want to say,

110
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,350
to scold, and to complain about.

111
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,680
I'll hold it for you.

112
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,720
What is this?

113
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,600
[Handsome, overall good]

114
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,400
Handsome?

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,600
Overall good?

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
Really?

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,190
I don't think so.

118
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,190
He is so weird.

119
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
He has OCD.

120
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,400
He cares a lot.

121
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,230
He is troublesome

122
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,310
and narrow-minded.

123
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,350
He is totally unreasonable.

124
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,470
All right.

125
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,000
What I said is only part of it.

126
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,750
Generally speaking,

127
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,960
he is a good guy.

128
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,070
Today I am also here

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,510
to thank him.

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,360
We had some conflicts before.

131
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,509
But he just let go and helped me.

132
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
I really want to thank him.

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,360
But unluckily,

134
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,550
he is out.

135
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,109
I don't know

136
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,630
when we will meet again.

137
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,750
I hope everything goes well

138
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,840
with Mr. Sheng

139
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,040
and that he is in good health.

140
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,110
Be happy every day.

141
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,840
You work so hard.

142
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,040
I also wish you health 
and happiness every day.

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,750
All right.

144
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,550
I am leaving.

145
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,840
I will leave you alone.

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,750
You want to write more?

147
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,120
[Mr. Sheng would be here. He comes to see the flowers
every afternoon at this time. Please wait a moment.]

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
Mr. Sheng would be here.

149
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,510
He comes to see the flowers

150
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,630
every afternoon at this time.

151
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,670
Please wait a moment.

152
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,430
Really?

153
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,510
Okay, I will wait for him.

154
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,630
Here you are.

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,430
Hebo.

156
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,800
I found out that you haven't
treated me

157
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,310
as kindly as before.

158
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,190
I haven't heard from you these days.

159
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,800
You wronged me.

160
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,960
I was on a business trip.

161
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,110
But I thought about you all the time.

162
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,990
Take a seat.

163
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
I asked you here

164
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,280
to give you the wedding gift.

165
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,310
What's inside?

166
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,110
Let me take a look.

167
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:36,990
Open it.

168
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,750
I asked a designer
to customize it for you.

169
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,240
So nice.

170
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,800
Do you like it?

171
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,190
Yes.

172
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,600
I would wear it

173
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,630
at the wedding.

174
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,360
So beautiful.

175
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,110
Hebo.

176
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,800
I hope that on the wedding day

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,190
you and my brother can hold me

178
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,550
to Zhijun together.

179
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,550
How can I do this?

180
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,870
Your brother will be jealous.

181
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,800
He won't.

182
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,430
This must be what he wants.

183
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,110
In the car accident that year,

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,510
if you hadn't given me
a blood transfusion in time,

185
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,240
I guess I would be dead now.

186
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,040
I know this is the kindness
of you and brother.

187
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,160
But it isn't in compliance
with the rules.

188
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,550
But I…

189
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,240
Listen to me.

190
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,040
Although I can't hold your hand,

191
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,070
I will definitely witness your happiness

192
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
on the spot.

193
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,960
All right.

194
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,920
Mr. Sheng.

195
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
Where are you going in such a hurry?

196
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,310
What a coincidence.

197
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,190
Why are you here?

198
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,430
What a coincidence?

199
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,920
It's just time.

200
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,070
I want to tell you that

201
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,190
the car group buying case is over.

202
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,920
I just chatted

203
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
with your gardener here.

204
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,960
He praised you.

205
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,430
About what?

206
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,190
He said you are handsome.

207
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,240
And?

208
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,430
And you are a nice guy.

209
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,840
Nothing else?

210
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,190
What else do you want?

211
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,430
I told you last time that

212
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,630
the juice of the blue daze is poisonous.

213
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,510
Your skin will be allergic.

214
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,040
Wipe the wound.

215
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,990
The juice of the blue daze is poisonous.

216
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,840
Your skin will be allergic.

217
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,750
Last time?

218
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,430
When?

219
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,160
Why don't I remember?

220
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Stop pretending.

221
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,510
You've been exposed.

222
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,510
When did you find out?

223
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,240
Not very early.

224
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,400
When is that?

225
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,070
When I was on a business trip with you,

226
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,630
I saw that handkerchief

227
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,750
in your room.

228
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,600
And I knew the gardener was you.

229
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,240
Wipe it.

230
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,240
You will really be allergic.

231
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,600
Thank you.

232
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,920
I look forward to seeing you
next time.

233
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,960
I haven't finished yet.

234
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,110
Actually I want to thank you.

235
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,990
Thank you for comforting me that day.

236
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,990
Nothing else?

237
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,630
I have already told the rest

238
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,920
to the gardener.

239
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,800
You don't need to know.

240
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,240
Seven days…

241
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,040
I am back.

242
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,800
Qian.

243
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,240
You look so happy.

244
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,960
You won the lottery?

245
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,190
Nothing special.

246
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,670
Didn't you say that you hate going
to Evergreen most?

247
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,280
Now I find that Sheng Zhening

248
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,510
is not that annoying.

249
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,920
How can you not hate him that much?

250
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,670
I…

251
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,670
I can't make myself clear.

252
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,960
I will go in first.

253
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,070
What's wrong with you?

254
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,510
Unhappy?

255
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,600
I feel that

256
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,310
Sheng Zhening's relationship with Qian

257
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,430
is getting closer and closer recently.

258
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
What does it have to do with you

259
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
if they are getting closer?

260
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,550
Of course it has something to do with me.

261
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,430
Hold on.

262
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,400
Look at you.

263
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,670
Do you like Qian?

264
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,800
What's going on, Mu Xiaoyan?

265
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,750
Mu Xiaoyan?

266
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,600
Yes.

267
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,920
I like her.

268
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,990
Really?

269
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,550
It's true.

270
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,190
I actually liked her since college.

271
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,750
But at that time

272
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,240
she was still with He Zhijun.

273
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,190
So I couldn't tell her.

274
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,310
I still like her

275
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,510
until now.

276
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,110
Wait.

277
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,480
You had a crush on her for so long.

278
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm always by your side.

279
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,750
Why didn't I tell that

280
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,630
with my intuition?

281
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,240
I got it.

282
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,040
No.

283
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,800
All right.

284
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,840
I won't speak it out.

285
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,600
I promise.

286
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,750
Dear, put it here.

287
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,070
Is it hot?

288
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,840
Not really.

289
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
We can just

290
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,960
buy these things

291
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
ready-made.

292
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,240
No way.

293
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,510
I have to make the wedding souvenir

294
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,360
by myself.

295
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,310
Give me that packing bag.

296
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,040
This.

297
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,960
Wait.

298
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,510
What's wrong?

299
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,360
Not this one.

300
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,600
This is flawed.

301
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,870
This pattern is not clear.

302
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
If you didn't say it,

303
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
I wouldn't find it.

304
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,360
I hope that everything

305
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,190
about our wedding is perfect.

306
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,630
I'll leave this one for you.

307
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,600
Does it taste good?

308
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,240
Dear.

309
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,510
Tomorrow we will have
the wedding rehearsal.

310
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,800
Are you ready?

311
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,760
Don't worry.

312
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,640
I want one too.

313
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,360
Feed me.

314
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,310
Tastes good?

315
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,430
Why are you still here?

316
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,270
Isn't your task completed?

317
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,550
The salary will be paid in two days.

318
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,430
I have to wait until I get my salary.

319
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,360
So I am here for my last shift.

320
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,550
What are you doing?

321
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,070
Play with the cat.

322
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,310
I'm afraid it has nothing to eat at night.

323
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,120
So I come to take a look.

324
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,070
I just fed it.

325
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,310
Don't always feed it good cat food.

326
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,430
If it becomes picky,

327
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,910
how could I raise it after you leave?

328
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,910
It's so little

329
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,790
and is growing up.

330
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,760
It has to eat well.

331
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,390
Moreover,

332
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
even if I leave,

333
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,640
I will often come back

334
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,840
to improve the food for it.

335
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Remember what you said.

336
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,150
I will thank you for it.

337
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,120
It likes what I fed it.

338
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,790
Right?

339
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,030
Are you free tonight?

340
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,550
I will treat you to dinner.

341
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,000
Why do you invite me to dinner
out of sudden?

342
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,790
Because you fed it.

343
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,760
I don't eat cat food.

344
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,550
Relax.

345
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,840
Cat food is way too expensive.

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,430
I am growing up.

347
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,150
I want something expensive.

348
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,880
Then take this.

349
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:45,840
I!

350
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,640
Sit here.

351
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,520
Here.

352
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,240
Hello, may I help you?

353
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,120
We will take a look at the menu first.

354
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,430
Okay.

355
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,030
I will call you later.

356
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,760
The food is expensive here.

357
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,670
You work in Evergreen.

358
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,190
Don't you know that?

359
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,240
I know.

360
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,310
But it's okay to have a splurge occasionally.

361
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,520
Wait.

362
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,880
Take a look.

363
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,670
I will go to the bathroom.

364
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,640
So expensive.

365
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,150
Will he leave?

366
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,880
Mr. Qin.

367
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,480
When we check out,

368
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
you just say that

369
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,070
it's on Mr. Qin today,

370
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,270
and I only need to sign.

371
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,720
Okay.

372
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,240
Okay.

373
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,840
Madam, would you like to order?

374
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,150
A stir-fried seasonal vegetable.

375
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,240
Spinach with nuts.

376
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,310
Wait.

377
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,030
Is there half a portion
of Yangzhou fried rice?

378
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,600
No.

379
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,480
Then one Yangzhou fried rice.

380
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:03,880
Enough.

381
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,430
Okay.

382
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,360
Let me check.

383
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,910
Spinach with nuts, 
stir-fried seasonal vegetable.

384
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,240
And Yangzhou fried rice.

385
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,840
It's enough.

386
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,600
Just these dishes.

387
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,310
Just these dishes?

388
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,430
It's enough.

389
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,240
I am losing weight recently.

390
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,550
You can only  have the strength

391
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,190
to lose weight after you are full.

392
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,760
I will order two more dishes.

393
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,760
All right.

394
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,720
Well.

395
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,310
Fried yam with fungus.

396
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,760
Fried abalone with XO sauce.

397
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,760
Wait.

398
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,720
Are you sure?

399
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,430
Crispy shrimp balls.

400
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,360
Baked beef short rib with red wine.

401
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,240
It's enough.

402
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,960
We can't eat that much.

403
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,760
Two more.

404
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,310
Ginger kale.

405
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
Stewed Dalian mussels with black truffle.

406
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay.

407
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,880
Enough.

408
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,790
Sure?

409
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:54,960
Okay.

410
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,600
Okay.

411
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,360
I will place an order now.

412
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Are you crazy?

413
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,030
So many dishes.

414
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,430
It will cost you a month's salary.

415
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,120
Well.

416
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,480
To be honest,

417
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,240
I did Qin Hebo a favor.

418
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,270
So he said that

419
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,150
no matter what I order today,

420
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,310
he pays the bill.

421
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,600
Really?

422
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,760
That's why I took you here.

423
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,720
You should have told me earlier.

424
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,910
Is it true?

425
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,600
Yes.

426
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,720
Waiter.

427
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,910
Bring me the menu.

428
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,520
Since it is his treat,

429
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,430
I will add some dessert.

430
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,190
I just chose it.

431
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,000
But I didn't order.

432
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,390
Iced Mochi.

433
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,840
Egg tart.

434
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,000
Two pieces each.

435
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,430
Do you want more?

436
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,360
But you ordered a lot.

437
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,760
One more bottle of watermelon juice.

438
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,520
I can take it away.

439
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,070
Okay.

440
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,910
Are you not losing weight now?

441
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,550
Not today.

442
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,600
I'm so full.

443
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
This is your purchase order.

444
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,120
Mr. Qin said that

445
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,360
you just need to sign here.

446
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,270
Okay.

447
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,360
So I should sign Qin Hebo.

448
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,910
Okay, thank you.

449
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,910
No way.

450
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,880
This is the most expensive.

451
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,070
I have to eat it.

452
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
I tried so hard.

453
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,310
I don't lose weight today anyway.

454
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,070
This is also expensive.

455
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,190
These two are the most expensive.

456
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,000
And that's also expensive.

457
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,600
All expensive.

458
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,000
Eat more.

459
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,360
Let me help you.

460
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,310
I eat quite a lot, right?

461
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

462
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,880
You're a big eater.

463
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,550
When I was a kid,

464
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,270
I could eat seven plates of food
at the buffet.

465
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,600
Cheers.

466
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,670
Hello.

467
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,520
This is for you.

468
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,270
Okay, thanks.

469
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,600
Come over and help.

470
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,480
I…

471
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,270
There will be a wedding rehearsal.

472
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,190
Play music for them.

473
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
I don't know how to play music.

474
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,310
It's very simple.

475
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,240
Just press a key.

476
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,720
This one first.

477
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,120
Then let's begin from here.

478
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,070
Look, here.

479
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,480
Okay, put it here.

480
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,310
Got it.

481
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,550
Hello, Shuangshuang.

482
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,430
I am in the period and it hurts.

483
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,880
Come bring me a medicine.

484
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,720
Okay.

485
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,550
I'll give you painkillers now.

486
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,790
Hurry up.

487
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,030
I didn't bring the USB flash drive.

488
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,310
It's fine.

489
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,550
An An just said that

490
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,720
the hotel has backup music.

491
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,430
Why am I so careless?

492
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,030
I forgot to bring
such an important thing.

493
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,310
I have already called.

494
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,430
He should be here soon.

495
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,790
I will definitely remind you
to take it tomorrow.

496
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,270
Mr. Sheng.

497
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,190
Sorry for being late.

This is Wang.

Mr. Guo is busy today.

504
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,960
So I came instead of him.

505
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,640

Let's start.

511
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,760
Okay.

512
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,390
One pill should be enough.

513
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,000
Are you okay?

514
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,190
Shuangshuang.

515
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,430
Find a place to rest.

516
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll help you with your work here.

517
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,070
All right.

518
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,880
Just over there.

519
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,070
I need to play music for them.

520
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,790
Okay.

521
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,390
Thank you then.

522
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
Take the water

523
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,910
and medicine.

524
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,270
You are so nice.

525
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:30,960
I am going to take a rest.

526
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Okay, just go.

527
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,150
Are you going to play music?

Yes.

Hold on.

534
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,190
I would like to ask

535
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,910
what is the content of today's banquet?

Wedding rehearsal.

537
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,670

It's your turn,
Mr. Sheng and the bride.

541
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,390
Slow down.

542
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,550
The bride should look ahead

543
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,720
and keep smiling.

544
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,520
Very good.

545
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
Slower your pace.

546
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,390
Lift your wedding dress

551

After sending the bride here,

552
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,640
you can leave.

Turn off the music.

I didn't expect you

to still remember it.

578

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,360
Brother.

581
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,840
The car accident had nothing
to do with you.

582
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,000
We shouldn't continue to

583
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,120
live in the painful memories of the past.

584
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,480
Brother.

585
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,670
When I met Zhijun back then,

586
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,600
I never thought that

587
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,480
he could pull me out

588
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,240
of such a depressed mood.

589
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,310
I feel very happy now.

590
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,310
In fact,

591
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,270
forgetting the pain of the past
doesn't mean

592
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,550
forgetting the thoughts
and feelings for father.

593
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,390
Brother.

594
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,910
Promise me.

595
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,840
Let's try to let go of the past

596
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,120
and lead the present life seriously.

597
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,600
All right?

598
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,760
Okay.

599
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,120
I promise you.

600
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,790
By the way, today's song

601
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,880
was just an accident.

602
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,430
Xia certainly didn't know.

603
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,600
Don't blame her.

604
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
Qian, I am sorry.

605
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,720
I mean…

606
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,720
If I knew that

607
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,390
today was their wedding rehearsal,

608
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,390
I would never let you come.

609
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,550
Sorry.

610
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,030
I just picked a piece of music randomly.

611
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,190
How did I provoke them?

612
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,720
You mean Ning Meng?

613
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,760
No.

614
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,240
It's…

615
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,360
Forget it, it doesn't make sense.

616
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,520
In short, I have no luck

617
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,910
in Evergreen.

618
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Don't let me come again.

619
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,310
I am leaving.

620
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,430
Have no luck?

621
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,880
Xia certainly didn't know

622
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,270
about today's song.

623
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,480
Don't blame her.

624
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,270
Xia Qian.

625
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,390
Xia Qian.

626
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,150
What's up?

627
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,120
My attitude was not good today.

628
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,030
Sorry.

629
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,030
Well.

630
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,240
Is Ning Meng

631
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,030
all right?

632
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,430
She asked me to apologize to you.

633
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,430
Today

634
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,000
I lost control of myself.

635
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,910
Why does she react so much

636
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,390
to a piece of music?

637
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,070
Because that song

638
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,720
is related to my father's car accident.

639
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,030
When my father

640
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,430
had a car accident,

641
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,150
this song happened to be playing
in the car.

642
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,790
After that, Ning Meng

643
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,070
got a very rare disease.

644
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,310
Every time she heard this song,

645
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,310
she would recall that bad memory.

646
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:09,910
For so many years,

647
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,910
we have deliberately

648
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,480
avoided this song.

649
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,360
I'm afraid she would be influenced.

650
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,790
I thought she was almost recovered.

651
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,390
I didn't expect that today…

652
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,790
Sorry.

653
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,760
Not at all.

654
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,270
I am fine.

655
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,960
I just thought

656
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,960
you were strange at that moment.

657
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,070
It turns out to be like this.

658
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:36,960
Sorry.

659
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,030
Well.

660
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,840
As compensation,

661
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,910
I will treat you to a meal.

662
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:52,960
Okay.

663
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,240
What do you want to eat?

664
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,000
I will book a restaurant.

665
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,270
No matter how expensive it is?

666
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,960
Sure.

667
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,070
No matter how expensive it is.

668
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,600
Wait for me to rip you off.

669
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,880
Come on.

670
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,720
I will not show mercy.

671
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,760
Okay.

672
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,240
When you finish it in a while,

673
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,070
just leave.

674
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,310
I handed in my resignation letter.

675
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,640
But I should be leaving
the day after tomorrow.

676
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,760
Not resign.

677
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,150
You got fired.

678
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,120
Fired?

679
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,070
I haven't got my salary yet.

680
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,760
I won't leave.

681
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,150
Do you know that today is

682
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,760
wedding rehearsal
for Mr. Sheng's sister?

683
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,430
You screwed up
such an important thing.

684
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,720
Do you still want salary?

685
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,760
It's lucky for you

686
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,790
if they don't let you compensate.

687
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,640
Playing music

688
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,720
is not my job at all.

689
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,790
I was asked to do this by you.

690
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Why should I take responsibility alone?

691
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,670
If so,

692
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,030
you are also responsible.

693
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,120
Even if I am responsible,

694
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,480
so what?

695
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,240
Even if the general manager of Evergreen

696
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,190
is right in front of me,

697
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,190
what can he do to me?

698
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,960
Really?

699
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,030
Mr. Qin.

700
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,910
Let's go.

701
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,480
Leave him alone.

702
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Mr. Qin.

703
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,190
I didn't mean that.

704
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,110
Mr. Qin?

705
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,079
Apologize.

706
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,079
Sorry.

707
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,800
I just checked the toilets
of the entire banquet hall.

708
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,959
They're the most unhygienic ones

709
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,520
in our hotel.

710
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,870
If I were you,

711
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,350
I would go and clean it immediately.

712
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,280
All right.

713
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,760
You?

714
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,960
You…?

715
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,720
So you are Qin Hebo.

716
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,190
You lied to me for so long.

717
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,350
I lied to you?

718
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:00,870
You?

719
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,670
Wait.

720
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,800
You said that

721
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,320
you are very familiar with Qin Hebo.

722
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,390
To tell you the truth.

723
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,080
What Qin Hebo owes me is

724
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,670
debt of love!

725
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,910
Debt of love?

726
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,000
And don't forget,

727
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,560
you arrange me

728
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,670
the job of the driver.

729
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,040
How can you say that I lied to you?

730
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,630
One who wears suit and hair gel

731
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,390
is either a boss or a driver.

732
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,320
Our boss wouldn't keep

733
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,630
a stray cat on the rooftop.

734
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,590
You guessed right.

735
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,150
Just my instinct.

736
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,830
If I said anything inappropriate

737
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,670
to you

738
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,590
during this period,

739
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,590
please don't take it seriously.

740
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,480
Sorry.

741
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,590
What did you say?

742
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,350
Nothing.

743
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,080
You mean

744
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,720
the debt of love I own you?

745
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,240
Well.

746
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,240
No.

747
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,630
That's not what I said.

748
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,760
I didn't say that.

749
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,040
All right.

750
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,350
It's getting dark.
Let's have dinner.

751
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,630
I am not hungry.

752
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,870
I will quit.

753
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,960
I am leaving.

754
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,240
Are you coming to see it again?

755
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,630
Look.

756
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,590
It doesn't move.

757
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,480
This…

758
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
I'm glad to meet you

759
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,960
during this time.

760
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,280
But I may not be able

761
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,390
to see you often in the future.

762
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,350
I am here to say goodbye.

763
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,480
I always go on business,

764
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
what will it do if you don't come?

765
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,430
If he is on a business trip,

766
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,390
I will come to feed you.

767
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,910
I won't let you starve.

768
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,000
Why is it so spicy?

769
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,110
You should order a mild one.

770
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,150
I always have a question.

771
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,630
Say it.

772
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,150
Why did you become a bargainer?

773
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,350
This profession

774
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,040
is not common.

775
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,960
Of course not.

776
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,720
Well.

777
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,560
I grew up

778
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,960
with my mother.

779
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,870
We didn't have

780
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,760
much money.

781
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,760
Every time we went out shopping

782
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,390
we would try our best to save money.

783
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,390
At first,

784
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,520
I learned from adults

785
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,760
to bargain.

786
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,560
Later, bargaining became my habit.

787
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,760
I get a sense of accomplishment in it.

788
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,910
When I grew up,

789
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,390
I discovered that many people

790
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,670
have a bargaining demand.

791
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,910
Some people are afraid to bargain

792
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,870
because they're not eloquent.

793
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,830
Some people don't understand
the product

794
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,080
so they don't dare to bargain.

795
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
So I made up my mind.

796
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,000
I would use my bargaining skills

797
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,430
to help more consumers

798
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,560
buy the most wanted things

799
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,760
at the lowest price.

800
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,320
That's it.

801
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,630
Is that enough?

802
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Don't you eat?

803
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,870
I never ate

804
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,960
at a roadside stall.

805
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,280
I am concerned.

806
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,960
Is that enough for you?

807
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,040
I can make you more.

808
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,910
Not necessary, thanks.

809
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,910
If you don't eat, I would.

810
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,590
Take this.

811
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,960
I peeled for you.

812
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,560
Drink water.

813
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,800
Should I eat or not?

814
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,880
[Mr. He & Miss Ning]

815
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,590
Thanks.

816
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,670
Welcome.

817
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,320
Okay.

818
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,590
Here you are.

819
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,000
Hello.

820
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,520
I took the video and came early.

821
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,240
Hello, everyone.

822
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,960
Welcome to

823
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,760
such a happy wedding

824
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,240
in such a beautiful season.

825
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,040
A pair of true lovers

826
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,800
got to know each other
and fell in love.

827
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,110
[He Zhijun, Ning Meng]
They went through a sweet romantic journey.

828
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,760
At this moment,

829
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,830
I believe that everyone

830
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,630
is in the same mood as me,

831
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,390
looking forward to

832
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,390
the bride and groom.

833
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Now, let's send blessings

834
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,560
to them.

835
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,430
It's your turn.

836
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,190
Dad, mom.

837
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm getting married today.

838
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,080
Take care.

839
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,870
Let's bless the two of them.

Isn't this Zhijun?

844
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:29,720
No one said anything about it.

845
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,480
This is so uncalled for!
