00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,910
Your luggage.

4
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,120
Thank you, Mr. An.

5
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,480
You are welcome.

6
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,400
I'd like to ask

7
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,070
which room Mr. Sheng is in?

8
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,990
I'm asking for the work's sake.

9
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,840
It's more convenient for me

10
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,790
to contact him.

11
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,230
Mr. Sheng stays in room No. 09.

12
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,200
Down the end of the hallway.

13
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,560
But, Ms. Xia,

14
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,230
Mr. Sheng likes quiet,

15
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,350
and he doesn't want to be disturbed.

16
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
You can let us know

17
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,230
if you need anything.

18
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,230
I got it.

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,960
Are you okay?

20
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,710
Nothing. Just a cold.

21
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,070
Then I'll leave now.

22
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,790
Okay.

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,280
Any information about Qin Hebo?

24
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,630
Qin Hebo, 41 years old,

25
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,320
single.

26
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,710
Word has it that he's a bossy,

27
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,840
serious,

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,200
and mysterious man.

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,070
Is that all?

30
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,350
Are you kidding?

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,200
I've done my best.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,760
How am I supposed to find him based on that?

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,680
I still have two big plates of potatoes
to wash.

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,560
I have to go now.

35
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,200
Bye-bye!

36
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
Good luck!

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,560
41 years old, single…

38
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,960
A kitten!

39
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,590
Whose is it?

40
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,680
What's your name,

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,990
kitty?

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,430
Who's your owner?

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,630
Are you hungry?

44
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,230
Is it your cat?

45
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,480
Our hotel has a rule that the employees

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,790
are not allowed to keep any pets.

47
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,760
You know that, don't you?

48
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,320
So, you don't know who I am?

49
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,350
I don't.

50
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,190
Then can you keep this secret for me?

51
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,720
I surely can,

52
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,720
but on one condition.

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
On one condition?

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,120
Can I come here

55
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,600
and pet it in the future?

56
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,720
Don't worry! When I pet it

57
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,230
I'll bring it some can food.

58
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,600
Sure.

59
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,630
It must be a tabby cat.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,230
When I picked it up on the street,

61
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,120
it was seriously ill.

62
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,030
That's probably why

63
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,280
its owner abandoned it.

64
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,400
You spent a lot

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,790
of money to cure it, right?

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,960
That's not important.

67
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,350
It's a little life after all.

68
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,630
Kitty,

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
you should thank this nice man.

70
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,280
He saved your life!

71
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,030
You are so kind.

72
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,120
It's the first time I've heard
someone call me kind.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,880
How come?

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,910
It's because they didn't know you well.

75
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,400
I think you are a good man.

76
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,230
You've just met me,

77
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,310
and you can tell that I'm good?

78
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,190
How long I've known you

79
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,790
has nothing to do with your nature.

80
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,680
I just go with my guts.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,350
I have good instinct.

82
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,280
Since you have good instinct,

83
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,350
can you guess

84
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,190
what I do in this company?

85
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,840
You are a driver, right?

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,880
Driver?

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes. How do you know?

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,350
Of course I know.

89
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,440
One who wears suit and hair gel

90
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,070
is either a boss or a driver.

91
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,000
Our boss wouldn't keep

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,280
a stray cat on the rooftop.

93
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,840
Yeah.

94
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,720
You guessed right.

95
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,880
Just my instinct.

96
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,030
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

97
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,630
My name is Fu Shuangshuang. And you?

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,470
My last name is Qin.

99
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,280
Oh, the same as your Vice General Manager's!

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,790
It's a shame that he sits in the car,

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,280
and you drive the car.

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,030
That's why people say life is unfair.

103
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,030
It's alright.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
As long as you are a good person.

105
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,600
Uh-oh!

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Oh, no!

107
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,070
I'm late for the roll call!

108
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,350
I have to go now! Bye-bye!

109
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,030
Driver?

110
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,000
How is it going with Sheng Zhening?

111
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,880
I just got settled last night.

112
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,400
They gave me a big room.

113
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,750
As for work,

114
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,560
I only got Mr. An to contact with.

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,560
I don't think

116
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,280
Sheng Zhening is an easy-going person.

117
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,280
He your major client.

118
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,750
You should be more active.

119
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,120
Talk something else aside from work.

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,230
Fu Shuangshuang.

121
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,310
Whose side are you on?

122
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,510
You want me to be more active?

123
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,310
Like bringing him some food,

124
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,790
or asking him something about work.

125
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,160
It'll help to bring you guys closer.

126
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,230
Would that work?

127
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,630
Give it a try!

128
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,030
I'm busy. I've got to go!

129
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,350
Be more active?

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,070
I can't do it.

131
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,360
Sheng…

132
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,070
Ms. Xia!

133
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,599
Hi.

134
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,990
Are you here to see Mr. Sheng?

135
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,920
Yes.

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,110
I…

137
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
prepared a fruit plate, and I'm here

138
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
to give it to Mr. Sheng.

139
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,190
Mr. Sheng is in a meeting.

140
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,190
He won't be available until later.

141
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,280
Yeah?

142
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,600
It's okay.

143
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,920
I can put it in his room.

144
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,800
How about this? You can leave it to me.

145
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,430
I'll give it to him

146
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,400
when he's back.

147
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,720
Okay.

148
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,670
Alright! Thank you!

149
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,480
You are welcome.

150
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,400
I met a driver today.

151
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,310
I may be able to get

152
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,040
some information about Qin Hebo from him.

153
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,920
What did you get?

154
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,800
Nothing.

155
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,840
Don't stop!

156
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,190
Here! Here! Here!

157
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,190
Do you think Sheng Zhening will give

158
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,750
Qian a hard time while she's there?

159
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,870
Qian is quite seasoned.

160
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,160
Dealing with Sheng Zhening is just
a piece of cake to her.

161
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Instead of worrying about her,

162
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,840
I'd rather think about

163
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
the guest list for the wedding in May.

164
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,600
10 minutes already!

165
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:10,920
Now.

166
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,870
Here.

167
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
Come on!

168
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,310
My sheet is still hanging outside!

169
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,750
A heavy rain is expected tonight.

170
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,920
I have to hurry back and take the sheet in!

171
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,430
You…

172
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,600
My sore back!

173
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,040
Here's some information

174
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
about the premium cars of our company,

175
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,190
including the details

176
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,190
of performance, prices and models.

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,600
[Aoruihua Automobile
Agency & Trading Co. Ltd.]

178
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,990
I

179
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,550
need to make a detailed budget

180
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,800
according to the information.

181
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,040
It'd take a few days.

182
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,400
That's okay.

183
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,430
Then I'll see you later.

184
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,280
By the way,

185
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,750
thank you for the fruit plate!

186
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,240
You are welcome.

187
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,960
If you like it…

188
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,430
No need.

189
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,630
I hope you can put your focus

190
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,240
on the project of car group buying.

191
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,800
Sure.

192
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,600
Has An An told you

193
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,990
that we have certain requirements

194
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,280
for the car performance?

195
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,190
No.

196
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,550
He didn't talk to you this morning?

197
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,400
No.

198
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,400
[Changsheng Boutique Hotel]

199
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,920
He's having a high fever.

200
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,670
Mr. Sheng,

201
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,190
excuse me, please.

202
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,720
An An,

203
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,750
it'll make you feel better.

204
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,800
And

205
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,510
why is the window closed?

206
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,280
Let me.

207
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,550
Thank you, Mr. Sheng!

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,990
It should be open to let the fresh air in.

209
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,550
Okay.

210
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,310
I don't mean to blame you,

211
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,070
but why did you drink that much

212
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,360
while you knew that you had a fever?

213
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,310
Of course you'd feel terrible.

214
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,110
I'll put the cooling patches

215
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
in the fridge later.

216
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,190
Remember to change it.

217
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,920
Mr. Sheng,

218
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm sorry

219
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,480
I can't take

220
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,160
care of you for a while.

221
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,510
I'll ask the hotel

222
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,720
to assign you another assistant.

223
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,240
Don't worry about it.

224
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,630
Mr. Sheng.

225
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,400
Hello?

226
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,550
You are still having a fever?

227
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,990
I don't want to either,

228
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,360
but it's out of my control.

229
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,920
Mr. An!

230
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,750
Ms. Xia.

231
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,480
You are having a fever.

232
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,630
Where are you going all dressed up?

233
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
I need to prepare dinner for Mr. Sheng.

234
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,670
I know Mr. Sheng is busy,

235
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,190
but he can take care of his own diet, right?

236
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,800
Ms. Xia, you may not know

237
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,400
that I've been taking care

238
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,510
of Mr. Sheng's daily routine.

239
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,670
It worries me

240
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,160
when someone else does it.

241
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,310
But you are sick.

242
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,190
Now, please go back and rest.

243
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll go prepare dinner for him.

244
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,430
Are you sure?

245
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,400
Of course. Why not?

246
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,750
It's no big deal. I can do it.

247
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,800
Now, go back.

248
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,600
Here.

249
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,630
Take the orange juice.

250
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,430
It's good for you.

251
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,400
Then, thank you, Ms. Xia!

252
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,960
No worries!

253
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,960
Come on.

254
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,800
Eat something.

255
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,240
Sit here.

256
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Do you feel better?

257
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,190
Yes, I do.

258
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,510
Thank you!

259
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,240
Don't mention it.

260
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,160
And Mr. Sheng's dinner…

261
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,550
Don't worry.

262
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,280
I've got everything under control.

263
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,750
Mr. Sheng is having dinner right now.

264
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,070
To be honesty, Mr. An,

265
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,510
you've been working too hard.

266
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,870
That's why you are sick.

267
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,070
What else can I do?

268
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,920
Mr. Sheng is used to me taking care of him.

269
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,400
Well,

270
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,510
just so you know,

271
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,670
I've asked the attendant

272
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,190
to take away your laundry.

273
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,310
You'll have it back tomorrow morning.

274
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,870
I also bought you some meal replacements,

275
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,870
and put them in the fridge.

276
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,280
You can have some when you are hungry.

277
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,870
There's also fresh orange juice.

278
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,600
Drink more. It's a good source of vitamin C.

279
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,750
And I put

280
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,600
the cooling patches on the night stand.

281
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
Remember to change it frequently.

282
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,190
Okay?

283
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,550
Thank you, Ms. Xia!

284
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,070
Anytime!

285
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,480
If there's nothing else,

286
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,670
I'll go back

287
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,430
and let you eat.

288
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,480
Okay.

289
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,840
Ms. Xia.

290
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,430
Yes?

291
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,550
I hope you can do me a favor.

292
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,360
Don't make it sound so serious.

293
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,840
Just ask.

294
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,310
Could you please take care

295
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,430
of Mr. Sheng for me for a few days?

296
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,840
Mr. Sheng is quite picky.

297
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,630
Do you think I can handle it?

298
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,960
I think you can.

299
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,630
I'll tell you all the things that you need

300
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,630
to pay attention to.

301
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,360
I'm sure you can do it.

302
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,070
I'm okay with it.

303
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,920
But what if Mr. Sheng is not?

304
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,550
I'll just have to tell him later.

305
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,550
Leave the rest to me.

306
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,480
Okay. It's a deal.

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,670
That's great!

308
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,840
If you can fill in
as Sheng Zhening's assistant,

309
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,040
you'll have more opportunities
to get close to him.

310
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,480
You bet!

311
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,600
That's exactly what I thought,

312
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,160
so I agreed to do it.

313
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,040
Don't get anxious, though.

314
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,110
Take it slow.

315
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,630
Got it.

316
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,069
How to iron it?

317
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,030
An An.

318
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,960
You've recovered?

319
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,600
It's me.

320
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,550
Well,

321
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,550
I've prepared breakfast for you.

322
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,670
An An said

323
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,120
you only drink coffee

324
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,270
in the morning.

325
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,030
It's not good for your stomach.

326
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,360
So, I've got you some warm milk

327
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,430
and fried egg.

328
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,960
It's over there.

329
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,080
[Mr. Sheng]

330
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,520
Mr. Sheng.

331
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,190
Hello?

332
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,480
Why is she in my room?

333
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,310
The doctor said I've got a bad flu.

334
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,190
I'm afraid I can't take care

335
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,670
of you this week.

336
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,430
But you need an assistant,

337
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,790
so I asked Ms. Xia to fill in for me.

338
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,480
She's detail-oriented,

339
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,480
and I'm sure she can do it well.

340
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,960
You know that I don't like

341
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,070
a stranger to be in my room.

342
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,240
Ms. Xia is not a stranger.

343
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,310
Mr. Sheng,

344
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,390
I've got a headache again.

345
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,640
I need to take some medicine.

346
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm hanging up now.

347
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,790
Mr. Sheng,

348
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,360
I've ironed the collars, cuffs,

349
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,910
and the gaps between the buttons

350
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,120
of your shirts.

351
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,000
I promise there are no wrinkles.

352
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,670
I've also cleaned

353
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,000
your desk with alcohol,

354
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,270
and cleaned the leaves

355
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,720
with water.

356
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,880
That's all.

357
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,240
I see.

358
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,480
Why don't you eat?

359
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,030
Is it too hot?

360
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,150
Oh,

361
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,550
do you know Mr. Qin Hebo's

362
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,520
driver?

363
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,480
I do.

364
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,310
Could you please introduce him to me?

365
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,390
I wanna meet him.

366
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,720
I think the one you really

367
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,880
wanna meet is Qin Hebo, right?

368
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,640
You always ask about Qin Hebo.

369
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,520
What do you want to do to him?

370
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,310
I'm just a cleaning lady.

371
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,120
What could I do to him?

372
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,070
So you ask about him all the time

373
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,550
because he owes you money?

374
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,670
I don't think he'd do that
as the vice general manager.

375
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,190
To tell you the truth.

376
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,840
What he owes me is

377
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,310
debt of love!

378
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,120
Debt of love?

379
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,550
It was the first day I worked here.

380
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,120
Because I didn't do my job right,

381
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,120
the head attendant had me
take the night shift as a punishment.

382
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,070
I was cleaning the hallway.

383
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
When I got near

384
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,150
to the last room,

385
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,480
Mr. Qin walked out of the elevator suddenly.

386
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,670
What are you doing?

387
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,960
Mr. Qin.

388
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,270
I'm taking the night shift.

389
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,070
Me… Me too!

390
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,190
Let's… Let's go work together.

391
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,550
Wait! Wait! Wait!

392
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,030
I'm working here!

393
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,760
Wait!

394
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,670
I'm working, too!

395
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,910
I need to clean the hallway!

396
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,720
I… I… I…

397
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
Yes. That's right.

398

Wait! Wait!

399
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,120

Help!

402
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,960
He dragged me into his office.

403
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,520
After he got me into his office,

404
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,150
he took out a bottle of foreign wine.

405
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,760
Why… Why are you crying?

406
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,000
Pour me some wine.

407
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,640
Go on! More! More!

408
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,520
The one with more wine is yours.

409
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,310
Cheers!

410
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,030
It was late at night,

411
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,310
and there were only him and me in the room.

412
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,670
I was so afraid!

413
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
But then I realized

414
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,520
that he was already drunk;

415
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
he'd pass out after drinking more,

416
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,790
and it wouldn't be too late for me

417
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,640
to escape then.

418
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,150
So, I stayed and drank with him.

419
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,880
As it turned out,

420
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
he started to speak his heart to me,

421
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,030
and he cried and laughed at the same time.

422
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,640
That's when I learned

423
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,270
that he was actually so helpless and lonely.

424
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,480
I was totally drunk with mixed feelings.

425
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,910
So,

426
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,190
what happened next?

427
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,960
And then…

428
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,640
Help… Help me

429
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,240
take this off.

430
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,600
Pour wine for me.

431
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,430
Let's… Let's do cross-cupped wine.

432
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,120
Cross… Cross…

433
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,310
What… What happened later was terrible!

434
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,880
Really terrible!

435
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
It was.

436
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,430
The next morning,

437
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,150
I realized

438
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,960
that I made a huge mistake!

439
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,360
But Mr. Qin told me

440
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,520
that it was only a misunderstanding.

441
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,000
I think it was a big misunderstanding.

442
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,960
But that Mr. Qin can be a heartbreaker, huh?

443
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,360
Just because of his charm and ruthlessness,

444
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,640
I still can't get over him.

445
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,840
So… So you've been trying

446
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,520
to find out where he is

447
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,070

As drivers, we rotate shifts often.

451

Next time when I get to drive for Qin Hebo,

452
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,240
I'll give him a bumpy drive

453
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,310

here's something I'm not sure
if I should tell you.

No.

You know, Ms. Xia has been asking

583
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
all kinds of questions about you these days.

584
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,190
She said she wanted
to be a qualified assistant,

585
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,910
but the questions she asked

586
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,360
had nothing to do

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,640
with taking care of you.

588
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,240
They were more like the questions

589

that someone likes you would ask.

590

she asked me which room you stayed.

Don't you think she has a crush on you?

594
