Episode 8

3
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,690
Mr Yu has always been hesitant, and if he sees all these negative comments about Evergreen, he'll definitely hesitate.

4
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,360
Ask Mr. Xue to talk to him soon

5
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,720
and see if there's any possibility of transferring the shares.

6
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,630
OK.

7
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,500
Anything you need me to do on Evergreen's side?

8
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,880
No.

9
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,460
OK.

10
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,600
<i> Mom </i>

11
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,870
Hello, mom. What's up?

12
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey, Xia Qian.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,090
You must come home for dinner tonight.

14
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,660
I've got very important issues to talk to you. Did you hear that?

15
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,400
OK. Got it.

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
Gotta go.

17
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,510
This will definitely work!

18
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:56,170
<i> [Liping Barbecue] </i>

19
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,110
Look at No.6. What do you think?

20
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,890
He seems a bit too old.

21
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,200
I think he's much older than Qianqian.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,090
What's wrong with that? Older men know how to take care of women.

23
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,080
But he does look a bit ugly.

24
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,580
First of all, you have to be satisfied.

25
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,820
That will affect the genes of our grandchildren!

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,300
I'm only asking you to give suggestions.

27
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,970
Be aware of your role!

28
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,320
OK, OK.

29
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,760
I'll keep that in mind.

30
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,210
You remember her ex, He Zhijun? Wasn't he handsome?

31
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,630
But I didn't like him. He doesn't look like someone who can share a meal with us.

32
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,990
You see what happened in the end?

33
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,890
You're very insightful indeed!

34
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,870
Of course.

35
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,970
Then... Do you think you and I can share a meal together?

36
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,680
Are you trying to piss me off? Do you want to wash the pans?

37
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,040
No... Hey, I think this one's a good choice.

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,990
He looks like an honest guy.

39
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,610
This guy... He's got a fierce look.

40
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,580
He does! Why are you staring at him?

41
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,150
When did you come back?

42
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,630
You were so quiet! We didn't hear your footsteps.

43
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,870
I've been here listening to you for quite a while.

44
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,420
Take these pictures down the board. They look like suspects.

45
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,400
We've got so many guests here. Don't scare them off.

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Uncle Hu, take these pictures down.

47
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,530
Qianqian.

48
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,900
You see, your mom's doing this all for you.

49
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,580
These are all excellent young men.

50
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,970
Just pick one. They're all great.

51
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,200
Uncle Hu, why do you have to stand by her side?

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,980
She feels like she has to do it once in a while.

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,160
You...

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Look at that.

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,090
What the hell is all this?

56
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,730
I don't like them. They're not good-looking.

57
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,820
Hey! I've got so many choices for you.

58
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,720
I just don't understand. How could you not like any of them?

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,670
Stop eating. Stop.

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,810
Just stare at the board.

61
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,970
Look closely. Try harder. You will start to like them.

62
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,280
How often does love at first sight happen?

63
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,780
Mostly it happens when you look at me, and I look at you,

64
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,720
we keep looking at each other,

65
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,800
and then we fall in love!

66
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,670
Fine. You don't have to look at them then.

67
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,660
If you don't want to look,

68
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,690
We can listen instead.

69
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,750
- Let's listen to this. 
 - Let them speak for themselves!

70
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,910
<i> My name is Hu Lang...</i>

71
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,460
I'll play the recordings, and you'll listen.

72
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,400
If you find anyone you like, just nod your head.

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,080
And I'll ask Uncle Hu to write it down.

74
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,760
Hey! Listen to this! Don't...

75
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,260
What are you doing?

76
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,100
I just want to have some home-made food.

77
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,010
I don't get to come home that often,

78
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,620
can I just have some peace to myself?

79
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,250
Nobody is stopping you from eating home-made dishes.

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,260
Well, the key is

81
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,620
that we don't date like this anymore.

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,270
Listening to the recordings,

83
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,000
or seeing pictures, these are outdated.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,880
We use dating apps and dating platforms.

85
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,260
Don't worry. I know how to do it.

86
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,340
Then just show me your phone.

87
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,950
Let me see if there's an app, and if there's anyone that works.

88
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,170
Can you stop poking your nose into it?

89
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,730
I'm full. I'm going home.

90
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,240
- Hey! 
 - Hey, Qianqian!

91
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Did I say anything wrong?

92
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,940
She's got such a bad temper!

93
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,470
Maybe she thinks that these men are not good enough.

94
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,490
Has she swallowed a grenade?

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,510
Mengmeng.

96
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,450
Darling, you're back.

97
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,590
Why did you try to find all this stuff?

98
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,490
What's wrong with that? Is there anything secret?

99
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,400
No. Just look at it if you want.

100
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,240
Look at that, darling! You were so young and cute.

101
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,240
Mengmeng. Don't look at this.

102
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,640
Why? I just want to see it.

103
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,730
It's your wedding vow!

104
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:23,300
Xia Qian, I love that you are assertive, cheerful,

105
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,580
that you're like the sun,

106
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,480
always shining,

107
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,390
making me feel bright and radiant,

108
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,620
- Form today on... 
 - Stop reading it.

109
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,060
How romantic.

110
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,840
What happened in the past is the past.

111
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
Don't think too much.

112
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,620
I know that you might feel uneasy about it,

113
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,310
knowing what happened between Xia Qian and me

114
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,540
the moment of our wedding.

115
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,010
and even couldn't accept it.

116
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,480
Actually, I should have told you earlier.

117
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,840
But I was afraid that you would overthink it.

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,670
There's nothing between Xia Qian and me now.

119
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,130
But our wedding was interrupted.

120
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,430
And we didn't have a chance to finish our vows.

121
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,770
I think our wedding was incomplete

122
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,550
and imperfect.

123
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,600
That's not true.

124
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,190
On our wedding,

125
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,640
we had our family's wishes,

126
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,800
and the most beautiful bride. It is the most perfect wedding.

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,700
Hey.

128
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,500
You promised me that

129
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,350
you'll never overthink it again,

130
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,920
and we'll live a positive and happy life.

131
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,230
GM Sheng.

132
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,050
We're hoping to negotiate with the couple on behalf of Evergreen.

133
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,690
See if there's any solution.

134
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,560
This all happened because we accepted the order.

135
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,040
We should be taking some indirect responsibility.

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,600
If we had been more careful and cautious with it,

137
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,340
maybe this would not have happened.

138
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,430
They just want to get back on Evergreen, and on me.

139
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,230
If this did not happen,

140
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,030
they would find other opportunities.

141
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,740
They?

142
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,750
It was more complicated than I thought.

143
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,670
Are you sure you want to get involved?

144
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,120
What else should I do?

145
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,730
In order to get a good sleep,

146
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,550
I have to sort it through.

147
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,140
Financial planner, 34 years old.

148
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,000
This one looks handsome!

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Next one.

150
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,770
This one looks good too!

151
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,240
Hey.

152
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,550
You're back.

153
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,060
Why are you back so late?

154
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,250
Have you recovered from your injury our the leg?

155
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,130
You're not here to pressure me again, are you?

156
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,110
Oh, no. I'm really not here to pressure you today.

157
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,670
I just wanted to send some food over to you.

158
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,290
OK, since you're back, I'll leave.

159
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,850
Don't leave.

160
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,550
Sit here.

161
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,570
Thanks, mom.

162
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,320
I love you as long as you don't pressure me to get married.

163
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,880
Don't leave tonight. Just stay here with me.

164
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,830
That's unusual. Something happened?

165
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,580
Nothing happened!

166
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,340
I haven't been sleeping well these days.

167
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,620
I'd get some good sleep if you're by my side.

168
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,840
OK, I'll stay. But you have to promise me

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,980
that I will have my own room. When you sleep,

170
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,810
you move a lot as if you're doing Kung Fu.

171
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,280
You always wake up in a different posture from when you fell asleep.

172
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
If anybody else knows about it,

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,890
who would be willing to marry you?

174
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,340
And what's scarier is that when it's midnight, you...

175
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,510
Hey!

176
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,190
I've told you many times!

177
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,250
You can talk about anything else, except for this.

178
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,780
Fine. I know.

179
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,550
You should get yourself married as soon as possible!

180
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,940
Again?

181
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,100
OK, OK. I'll shut up.

182
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,040
What is that?

183
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,860
I've thought it through. It's so hard to marry a good man  these days.

184
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,740
Let's just have a guy marry in our home,

185
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,790
so I don't have to worry.

186
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,400
Also, I've picked the guy for you.

187
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,240
What are you doing here?

188
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,090
Chang Sheng's reputation is damaged.

189
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm bankrupted. I have a bunch of debts.

190
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,820
Aunty promised me that

191
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,310
as long as I marry you, she will help me with the debt.

192
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,850
What do you think of your mother's taste?

193
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,340
Look at his body. Look at his face.

194
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,930
If Chang Sheng didn't close down, it will never be your turn to have him.

195
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,440
Little Sheng, I don't have other requirements for you.

196
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,170
Just have two kids in three years with her. Can you do that?

197
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,470
I will try my best.

198
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,850
Louder!

199
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,480
I will try my best!

200
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,290
That's good.

201
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,870
Let's not wait.

202
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,530
How's this? You two get married tomorrow.

203
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,750
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

204
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,930
You don't say. I had a nightmare for the entire night.

205
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,750
You've been yelling a name. Sheng...Sheng...what was the name?

206
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,700
Sheng...something Ning...

207
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,760
Sheng Zhening?

208
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,660
That's right! That's the one!

209
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,990
I'm fine.

210
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,860
You were saying something about...I'm not having your baby!

211
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,620
Who is Sheng Zhening?

212
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,250
-He's so cute.
-Really?

213
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,480
And he's nice.

214
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,480
Mom, I read a novel recently.

215
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,900
Sheng Zhening is the main character.

216
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,870
I love him so much.

217
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,670
I had a dream about marrying him.

218
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,770
Is there anything wrong with your brain?

219
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,910
Why are you dreaming about that nonsense? Can a fictional character marry you or can he have a baby with you?

220
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,620
How was that nonsense? Can't I have a dream?

221
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,560
Just eat.

222
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,880
<i>[Sheng Zhening]</i>

223
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,240
Who's that?

224
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,010
A girl friend.

225
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,090
Hello?

226
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,320
Hey, I'm downstairs. Come on down.

227
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,330
Wait.

228
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,800
What are you doing here?

229
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,710
There's really no need. I can go there by myself.

230
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,050
It's fine. It's on the way.

231
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,570
Is it?

232
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,250
Ok. Thank you.

233
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,570
Who was that?

234
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,900
A client.

235
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,310
We have great conversations. A new girl friend I made.

236
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,790
Have great conversations...a client...

237
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,270
A guy or a girl?

238
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,180
A girl friend.

239
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,650
You gossip.

240
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,850
I'm going. She's waiting for me.

241
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,080
Are you done eating already?

242
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,650
I will eat with my girl friend.

243
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,010
Clean up a bit, will you?

244
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,980
Hello.

245
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,500
Let's go.

246
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,440
You are driving me?

247
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,060
Get in.

248
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,560
<i>[Mom]</i>

249
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,530
What's up, mom?

250
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,810
Let me ask you, are you having a boyfriend?

251
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,920
Why are you doing this again?

252
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,310
Where do I find a boyfriend?

253
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,180
<i>What are you talking about? I saw everything.</i>

254
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,210
And you are still lying saying he's a female client.

255
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,590
<i>Was it him? How long have you known each other?</i>

256
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,390
When are you taking him home to meet your mother?

257
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,260
Hey, I'm outside.

258
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,360
I will talk to you when I get back tonight.

259
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,460
<i>No no no. You have you explain yourself right now.</i>

260
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,170
<i>You were screaming a name last night. Sheng...something Ning.</i>

261
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,920
Was it him? And you were talking about not having his babies.

262
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,180
<i>Don't tell me you are pregnant. </i>

263
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,360
Hello? Hello?

264
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,070
-<i>Hello?</i>
-What's going on? Is it bad signal?

265
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,200
Hello? What's going on?

266
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,450
Hey. And she hung up on me!

267
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,520
Maybe it's because of this old phone.

268
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,450
It's been having problems. I ought to get a new one.

269
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,600
Is your mother upset?

270
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,460
No, she's not.

271
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,460
She just gets excited sometimes. She's like that.

272
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,830
She's always suspecting something. It's fine.

273
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,150
Are you not sleeping well these days?

274
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,040
I am.

275
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,360
I'm just weird like that.

276
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,410
I always sleep well and never have dreams.

277
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,810
Oh.

278
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,390
Han Chao's car is already here.

279
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,200
I think he must be in.

280
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,630
Let's go.

281
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,670
Han Chao has been avoiding people. I've heard that

282
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,280
he has a special relationship with this tea house.

283
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,640
He saves good tea for them.

284
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,220
Every month this time,  he comes here to meet friends and drink tea.

285
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,420
He doesn't bring his wife here?

286
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,960
Seems like you are a clingy type, Miss Xia.

287
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,190
Couples don't hang out after they get married.

288
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,450
Couples who are doing well hang out with each other

289
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,220
outside of work

290
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,960
and personal times.

291
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,820
You are thinking too much. Is that your plan?

292
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,070
Is it not nice?

293
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,550
Is Mr. Han Chao here yet?

294
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,320
Mr. Han isn't meeting anyone today, is he?

295
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,710
We made the appointment last minute. How's this?

296
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,510
We will talk to him after he's done.

297
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,870
Open a room for us and bring your best tea.

298
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,700
We will drink tea as we wait.

299
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,690
Let's go.

300
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,590
Please, come with me.

301
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,070
Let go.

302
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,760
Work with me. Don't mess this up.

303
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,150
Careful with the stairs.

304
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,770
This way, please.

305
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,290
This one is nice. What do you think?

306
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,720
This one has a lot of light and the sight is beautiful.

307
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,200
Honey,

308
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,910
I don't like other rooms. I just want this one, ok?

309
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,510
Whatever you say.

310
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,100
This one.

311
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,370
Please settle in. I will bring the tea.

312
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,240
If you get this close to me again,

313
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,580
you better watch.

314
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,180
I didn't expect you can pretend to be girly.

315
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,000
You should be this adorable more often.

316
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
It's for work.

317
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
What else could that be for? Also, I'm always adorable.

318
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Stop mention things like this from now on.

319
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,070
Don't you think the greeter's attitude was very strange?

320
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,300
He made it looks like Han Chao is doing something despicable here.

321
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,600
I just saw a woman in the room next door.

322
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,100
She doesn't look like Mrs. Han.

323
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,800
She can't be.

324
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,600
They sound happy.

325
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
It sounds like two people.

326
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,910
Isn't it supposed to be a party?

327
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Interesting.

328
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,300
Sorry for not knocking.

329
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
So sorry to disturb.

330
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,200
Let's go.

331
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
My purse.

332
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,200
No need to walk me out. I will come when I'm free.

333
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,800
But I don't want you to leave.

334
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Be good. I will come to you whenever I'm free.

335
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,500
Hug hug.

336
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,500
Jerk.

337
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
-What's up?
-There was a couple saying they are looking for Mr. Han.

338
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Who are they?

339
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,300
They are in this room.

340
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
I have to go.

341
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,000
Are you still mad?

342
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,380
Stop the car. I need to get off and calm myself.

343
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,400
Why get upset for other people's business?

344
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
He's such a jerk!

345
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Stop being angry, ok?

346
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
How's this? I will take you to eat something nice.

347
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
What do you say?

348
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,800
After seeing what happened and people like him,

349
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
how could you not be mad?

350
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,200
For what?

351
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,900
Stop the car.

352
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm worried that you will do something stupid.

353
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Are you worried that I will go back and beat him up?

354
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm worried about you telling his wife.

355
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Shouldn't I though?

356
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,800
I was cheated on for many years and thought I was happy.

357
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,300
I was enjoying it like a fool. How was that good?

358
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,000
I understand how you feel,

359
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,400
but it's other people's business. You need to separate them.

360
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,000
Also, based on our relationship with Mrs. Han, it's not appropriate

361
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,200
for us to tell her, is it?

362
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
Ok, I got it.

363
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,200
Or else, I wouldn't be this upset.

364
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,100
I'm going to a meeting. Have An'an drive you home later.

365
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,000
It's ok. I will take a car.

366
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,100
I think I left my phone in your car.

367
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,600
-Give me your car key.
-Ok.

368
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,400
Just give it back to An'an after getting your phone.

369
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
Go ahead.

370
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Mr. Sheng.

371
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,300
Mr. Han.

372
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,200
I couldn't find you for the longest time and you showed up here.

373
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
Are you here to eat?

374
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,000
You don't know why I'm here, do you?

375
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
Let's talk.

376
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,400
Oh, right.

377
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
We haven't talked about how you vilifying Chang Sheng.

378
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Are you about to apologize to Chang Sheng

379
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,000
or are you planning on telling me who asked you to do this?

380
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,200
I came here to make a deal with you.

381
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,400
We don't even trust each other. Why would I want to make a deal with you?

382
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Control yourself.

383
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,700
As long as you don't tell my wife what you saw today,

384
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,400
I will withdraw the law suit against Chang Sheng.

385
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
I was wondering what the deal could be.

386
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,400
Didn't know you are worried about being discovered for cheating.

387
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Isn't that tiresome?

388
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,800
Every man makes this mistake.

389
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Also, I always go home after playing around. I don't fall in love.

390
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,600
So,

391
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
you wouldn't do your worst.

392
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,800
I believe that you misunderstood me.

393
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm not interested in your affair at all.

394
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,600
I wouldn't be the person who stabs you in the back either

395
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,000
and hold nasty secrets like this as bargaining chips.

396
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,100
But you vilified Chang Sheng.

397
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,000
I will get back at you in other ways and you can't do anything about it.

398
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,400
Sheng Zhening, are you trying to be nobel here?

399
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Based on what I know, Chang Sheng is a mess right now.

400
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,000
I wonder how long you will last.

401
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,500
Don't you worry about it.

402
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,800
You know about Chang Sheng so well.

403
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,100
It seems that your people is not far from me.

404
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,300
Right, another thing,

405
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,100
I need to correct you. Not every man makes such mistakes.

406
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,600
Mr. Sheng.

407
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,800
Your key.

408
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Girl, ear-dropping is not good.

409
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,500
But Mr. Sheng was making a lot of sense. I was just learning.

410
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,200
They way you are looking at me is not very appropriate.

411
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,200
This is how I look at every one. You are overthinking.

412
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm so tired.

413
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I told you not to go, but you just had to.

414
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,200
That's what I say. Did you achieve anything?

415
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,900
Han Chao is a jerk!

416
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,200
He's messing around with other women behind his wife's back.

417
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,200
They haven't been married for that long. Does his wife know?

418
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,800
She definitely doesn't. It was so hard for me to keep the secret, Shuang Shuang.

419
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
I really wanted to run to Yan Caiting and tell her

420
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,600
to wake up, her husband is cheating on her.

421
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,300
Calm down first. Don't be so riled up.

422
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,380
Did you want someone to tell you the truth back then?

423
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,200
Someone couldn've tell me in the gentlest waty.

424
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,000
Or just tell me. I can accept that.

425
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,800
So I didn't have to be in such a shock when I found out.

426
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,900
Sister Qian, I understand. It's ok.

427
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,200
-Ok.
-Love is so complicated.

428
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

429
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,600
I've made an appointment. This is the rsvp.

430
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,500
Ok. I will sign you up.

431
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,200
Please wait, Ms. Yan. Your massage therapist is getting ready.

432
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,500
Thank you.

433
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Yan...

434
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,000
This way, please.

435
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,900
Miss Xia!

436
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Ms. Yan.

437
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,200
Right, I should call you Mrs. Han.

438
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Call me whatever you like.

439
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,200
What are you doing here?

440
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,000
Our company got a group purchase project. I'm here to help my client to try it.

441
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,700
Your work seems fun.

442
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,400
Hello, could you get one room for the both of us?

443
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Ok.

444
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,100
Is that ok?

445
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,000
Of course, so we can talk.

446
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
-Let's go.
-Ok.

447
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,900
This way, please.

448
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,300
Thank you.

449
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
It's so nice.

450
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
Mrs. Han.

451
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,900
You skin is so pretty.

452
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,200
It looks like getting treatments here does work.

453
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Your skin is born good, Miss Xia.

454
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
Unlike us, we have to spend so much time on maintaining it.

455
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
That's not true.

456
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,400
You have someone loves you.

457
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,100
The energy comes form within.

458
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,200
Right,

459
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,400
how is it going with you and Mr. Sheng?

460
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Who?

461
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Mr. Sheng.

462
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,200
Him and I?

463
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We are not an item.

464
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,200
We are like "frienemies".

465
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,400
I think the two of you are cute. You guys would make a fun couple.

466
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,000
How's Mr. Han?

467
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,600
How is he doing lately?

468
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,000
Have you seen the video online? It's between men.

469
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,600
Just let them handle it themselves.

470
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,200
You misunderstand me. I'm not helping him in any way.

471
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
I just want to ask,

472
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,200
how's your marriage going?

473
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,200
You are making it sound strange, Miss Xia.

474
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,700
Don't you find it impolite?

475
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,200
Mrs. Han, I...

476
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

477
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
I was being impolite.

478
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Sorry for offending you.

479
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,300
I need to go. Have a good rest here.

480
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
Bye.

481
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,400
See you next time.

482
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,850
Someone from work.

483
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,950
I met Xia Qian today. Do you remember her?

484
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,240
- The one who negotiated our wedding date? 
 - Yeah.

485
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,560
I thought she was there for Evergreen.

486
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,120
But it was just a coincidence.

487
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,140
Regarding this matter, you should not worry about it.

488
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,860
Just leave it to me.

489
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,350
I'll use the restroom.

490
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,670
<i> Hello, Ms. Yan?</i>

491
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,740
Help me check on someone.

492
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,230
Hello, lady. Would you like some tea?

493
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,490
This place was rented not long ago, right?

494
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,820
Han was never generous.

495
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,150
Don't you think it's not worth it to be his mistress?

496
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,290
I'm not planning on being with him for my whole life.

497
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,660
As long as we're happy now, I'm okay.

498
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,250
Well, he's obviously got a lot of experience.

499
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,670
He chose someone like you,

500
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,040
so he can easily get away with it when he's at home

501
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,050
You're very generous indeed, sister.

502
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,730
Knowing who he truly is, you still got married with him.

503
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,150
Well, he begged me to, crying,

504
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,170
saying that he will change. I don't know about that,

505
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,860
but he's given me everything he has. He's just having fun once in a while.

506
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,180
We took this photo when we were in the Aegeans.

507
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,230
I heard that you like the Aegeans a lot too, sister.

508
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,810
Did he take you there?

509
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,230
I don't think he will have any chance to take you on a trip any more.

510
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,490
Sheng Zhening!

511
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,760
You said one thing and did another. You played dirty.

512
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,170
- How can you still pretend like a decent man? 
 - What are you doing?

513
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,880
Go away.

514
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,340
Anan.

515
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,840
Mr. Chen, I don't understand what you're saying.

516
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,780
You're still pretending.

517
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,620
You promised not to tell my wife. But now she knows it all.

518
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,490
Okay. Even if it wasn't you, it would have been that stupid woman by your side.

519
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,900
Watch your mouth.

520
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,120
We'll settle it all in once, the old and the new.

521
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,910
Wait for my lawyer's letter.

522
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,650
Security!

523
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,190
Send him out.

524
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,330
We'll wait and see.

525
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,230
Han always said he was busy,

526
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,500
and that he had no time to take me on a trip.

527
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,960
But I didn't know until today

528
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,700
that when I was sick at home, he took someone else to the Aegeans.

529
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,950
I've said it ten million times that it was my dream.

530
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,570
But he did it with another woman.

531
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,070
Miss Yan, I understand your feeling right now.

532
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,720
I feel that I'm just like a joke.

533
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,910
I've forgiven him once and again,

534
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,970
I thought he would live a life with me.

535
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,340
But now I've finally seen it through.

536
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,700
If

537
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,360
there's anything I can help you with, I'll definitely try my best.

538
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,290
I think I can help you

539
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,630
with Evergreen.

540
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,260
Really?

541
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,000
That would be great.

542
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,810
As a matter of fact, I've always been curious

543
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,460
about who exactly is the one going against Evergreen.

544
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,770
And who is the one behind all this?

545
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,870
I remember that a woman

546
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,970
a woman came to us and asked us to agree to your terms.

547
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,250
She said that if we cooperate,

548
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,860
we can get a considerable amount of reward.

549
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,890
<i> Hello. I'm here on behalf of Lihe Capital. </i>

550
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,470
<i> I hope you can agree to this. </i>

551
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,930
<i> Thank you. </i>

552
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,640
<i> I hope this can be a successful collaboration. </i>

553
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,130
Who gave money to this woman?

554
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,110
Han mentioned it before.

555
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,580
I think it was...

556
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,740
Lihe Capital. I've tried to persuade him.

557
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,420
I told him not to get involved.

558
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,650
But he wouldn't listen.

559
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,990
Mrs Han.

560
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,560
I don't care why you and Mr. Han did this,

561
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
or who asked you to do so.

562
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,230
If there's anything, please talk to me. It has nothing to do with her.

563
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,770
Don't get it wrong. She's here to help us.

564
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,410
I told you he cares about you. See?

565
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,070
Well, please tell Han Chao

566
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,120
that if he wants to take it to the court,

567
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,460
I'll definitely be standing by Evergreen's side.

568
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,630
Understood.

569
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,800
<i> [Worth or Not] </i>

570
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,980
Miss Han told me that

571
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,310
it was Lihe Capital behind all this.

572
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,630
Is there any enmity between Evergreen and Lihe Capital?

573
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,440
I heard people say

574
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,540
that Lihe Capital is planning on acquiring Evergreen.

575
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,330
Now it seems that they've started their action.

576
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,470
Hey. Don't worry about it.

577
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,690
In business relationships, these are not unusual.

578
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:55,640
What's more, Mrs Han has agreed to record a video statement for us. Anything else,

579
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,380
let's just leave it to Evergreen's PR department.

580
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,920
Okay.

581
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:05,000
Oh, I almost forgot. I need to visit my mom.

582
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,700
I'll drive you there.

583
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,010
- What's so funny? 
 - Nothing.

584
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,340
It feels like you've really become my driver.

585
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,020
Let's go.

586
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,640
Here we are.

587
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,270
Thank you, GM Sheng, for driving me here.

588
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,320
You've done such a big favor for Evergreen, I should be the one saying thank you.

589
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,030
You're welcome. See you!

590
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,910
Wait. Wait.

591
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,500
Wait.

592
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,760
Since you're here,

593
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,480
why don't you have some barbecue with us?
