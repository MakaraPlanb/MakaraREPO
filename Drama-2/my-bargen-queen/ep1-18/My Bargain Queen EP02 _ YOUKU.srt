00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,320
I will answer the phone.

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,910
Go ahead.

5
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,870
Hello, dear.

6
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,470
You arrived?

7
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,910
I'm on the second floor.

8
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,270
Okay, I'm upstairs.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,040
Dear, I am here.

10
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,870
From now on,

11
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
I will go

12
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,350
wherever you go.

13
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,590
Listen carefully.

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,430
I'm not a stalker.

15
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,350
I won't keep you.

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,070
If you take another step,

17
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,430
I will give up on you.

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,870
Even if you come back and beg me,

19
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,920
I won't change my mind.

20
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,350
He Zhijun.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,920
[Xia Qian, sorry! I can't get engaged to you]

22
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,870
Ms. Xia.

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,680
My fiancé came to pick me up.

24
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,120
Let me introduce.

25
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,840
He Zhijun.

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,320
Sorry for being late.

27
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,230
Hello.

28
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,040
I am He Zhijun.

29
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,960
Ms. Xia, what's wrong with you?

30
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,630
I don't know.

31
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,350
I just…

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,150
My eyes

33
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,870
are allergic.

34
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:43,870
Sorry.

35
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,590
Ms. Ning Meng.

36
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,560
I have to go.

37
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,720
Qian.

38
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,070
Qian.

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,310
Sorry.

40
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,030
Sorry. Sorry.

41
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,190
Qian.

42
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,560
Here you are.

43
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,400
Qian.

44
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,160
Sit there.

45
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,880
Are you okay?

46
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,120
All right.

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,600
Okay.

48
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,880
I am feeling better.

49
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,750
Slow down.

50
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,470
Shuangshuang.

51
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,720
I still don't understand.

52
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
Think about it.

53
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,840
Tell me what happened

54
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,680
to He Zhijun?

55
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,720
Exactly.

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,440
Do you think he is terminally ill?

57
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,560
This…

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,440
He may have secret sorrow.

59
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,510
Something happened?

60
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,030
Something happened?

61
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,790
No way.

62
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,720
Maybe it's like

63
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,000
what we presumed.

64
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,120
At that time,

65
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,560
I didn't give him the opportunity
and time to explain.

66
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,400
He…

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,840
He was pissed away.

68
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,190
If he wanted to explain,

69
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,840
he would have explained it long ago.

70
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,350
No.

71
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,190
Forget it.

72
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,960
Just forget him.

73
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,750
Such a man is not worthy
of your love.

74
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,510
He deserves it.

75
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,030
Let me tell you the truth.

76
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,160
He Zhijun

77
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,630
isn't that kind of person.

78
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,910
I swear.

79
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
He Zhijun isn't such a person.

80
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,720
I know him well.

81
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,030
Do you know that?

82
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,600
He looked back at me.

83
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,310
He looked at me.

84
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,400
He wanted to say something.

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,720
I didn't give him time.

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,680
Then he left.

87
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,400
He will come back.

88
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,880
But Shuangshuang,

89
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,000
why did I…

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
Why did I

91
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,470
say that?

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
I told him that

93
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,190
even if

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,560
he comes back,

95
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,310
I won't

96
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,310
change my mind.

97
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,190
Just give up on him.

98
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,510
I want him.

99
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,030
Just give up on him.

100
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,510
I want him.

101
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,910
- Forget him.
- No.

102
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,840
What are you doing?

103
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,790
You think that

104
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,400
I will get drunk because
of He Zhijun?

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,440
I just

106
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,190
hadn't expected it

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
to be like this

108
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,400
when we two met again.

109
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,030
Then what will you do next?

110
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,190
What a coincidence.

111
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
Could it be deliberately arranged

112
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,750
by Ning Meng?

113
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,120
No way.

114
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,750
I feel that

115
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,470
she didn't know about it before.

116
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,880
How did He Zhijun react
to seeing you?

117
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,560
He doesn't know it, either?

118
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,560
Director Qin contributed a lot

119
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,310
to Lihe Capital's acquisition

120
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,680
of 3% of Mr. Lin's shares.

121
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,440
No.

122
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,400
I forgot that

123
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,960
I should call you
Vice General Manager Qin now.

124
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,750
I sent you to Evergreen six years ago.

125
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,160
At that time, I knew that

126
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
with your ability,

127
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,350
you would definitely be
in this position.

128
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,790
Thanks to Mr. Xue for helping.

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,470
Whether Lihe Capital

130
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,230
can acquire Evergreen in the end

131
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,680
depends on Mr. Qin.

132
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,630
Sorry, I will answer the call.

133
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,840
Hello, Meng.

134
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,630
What's up?

135
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,880
Did you upset your brother again?

136
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,360
Well.

137
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,600
Come to my office first.

138
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,750
I'll be back later.

139
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,190
See you later.

140
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,870
Sorry, Mr. Xue.

141
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,919
Sheng Zhening's sister
is looking for me.

142
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,630
I'm going back.

143
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,800
I didn't expect you

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,600
to get along well

145
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,920
with the brother and sister
of Sheng family.

146
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,960
Hebo.

147
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,870
It is not easy for you to get
to where you are today.

148
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,510
Don't act impetuously.

149
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
Don't worry. I got it.

150
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,750
What do you mean?

151
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,110
Why are you transferring money to me?

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,920
Let's pool the money

153
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,800
back to Ning Meng.

154
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,110
We won't take this order.

155
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,750
Shuangshuang.

156
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Listen, you don't have to do that.

157
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,720
I have money now.

158
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,310
Don't tell me you have money.

159
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,400
I found out that

160
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,670
you sold your own car.

161
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,600
We have to make money,

162
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,750
but you don't have to suffer.

163
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,510
What's more,

164
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,430
I can support you

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
anyway.

166
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,430
Why are you laughing?
I mean it.

167
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,670
Thank you.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,750
Don't talk about this between us.

169
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,510
Don't push yourself so far.

170
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,840
I am not pushing myself.

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,160
I really want to take this order.

172
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,040
No.

173
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,310
It's not because of money.

174
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,160
I am determined to change

175
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,310
because of He Zhijun's escape
from marriage.

176
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,310
In such a difficult situation,

177
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,310
I forced myself to start a company.

178
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,840
We have paid a lot

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,670
over the years.

180
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,360
We took all orders

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,310
to make Worth Or Not what it is now.

182
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,070
This is the dream of all of us.

183
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,190
Why should we give up the order

184
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,360
as soon as He Zhijun appears?

185
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,870
And he is not important

186
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,670
to me anymore.

187
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,670
Not important?

188
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,990
Do you really think so?

189
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,070
I am the one who knows best

190
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,920
how painful you were

191
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,550
after He Zhijun left you.

192
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,480
You were not like yourself anymore.

193
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,550
You worked so hard

194
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,720
every day

195
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,960
in order not to miss him.

196
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,870
I don't want you to be like that again.

197
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,110
Now He Zhijun is back.

198
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,110
I am so afraid that
you will be the same again.

199
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,400
Shuangshuang.

200
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,110
It is exactly because He Zhijun is back.

201
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,190
I saw him today.

202
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,670
I really understand it.

203
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,160
It's been two years.

204
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,840
He has his own life.

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,990
I also have mine.

206
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,310
The two of us are no longer important

207
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,280
in each other's world.

208
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,310
Indeed.

209
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,110
It is ridiculous for me

210
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,110
to check the wedding schedule

211
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,480
for my ex-boyfriend.

212
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
What can I do?

213
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,160
It just happened.

214
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,040
I have to fix it.

215
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
If I break the contract

216
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,430
and refuse this order now,

217
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,280
it seems that I cannot forget him.

218
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,630
So this must be done.

219
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,400
We have to take the order

220
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,360
and complete it well.

221
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,630
Come on.

222
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,670
Drink with me.

223
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,670
Let's work hard together.

224
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,040
Why are you so free today?

225
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,040
Of course because I miss you.

226
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,430
Miss me?

227
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,870
You are so busy falling in love

228
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,990
that you don't have time to miss me.

229
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,280
Just get to the point.

230
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,040
Nothing can be hidden

231
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,430
from Hebo.

232
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,400
Hebo.

233
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,720
I am getting married.

234
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
Just at Evergreen Hotel.

235
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,840
Doesn't your brother disapprove

236
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,990
of you getting married so soon?

237
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,070
Did you convince him
in such a short time?

238
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,600
How come?

239
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
You know

240
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
my brother's temper.

241
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,550
I secretly found a bargainer

242
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,160
to negotiate the schedule.

243
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,280
We will sign the contract tomorrow.

244
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,870
It turns out that
you hired the bargainer.

245
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,600
If your brother knows,

246
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,840
he will be pissed off.

247
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,070
I know.

248
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,110
So I beg you

249
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,400
to make a pitch for me

250
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,670
by then.

251
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,750
Hebo.

252
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,160
All right. Got it.

253
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,670
Got it.

254
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,630
Hebo, you are the best!

255
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,040
Take a seat.

256
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,040
You should

257
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
talk to your brother more
when you have time.

258
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,160
He is not unreasonable.

259
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,400
He just cares too much about you

260
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,280
and is worried about you
being treated bad.

261
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,840
I see.

262
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,430
I will find time

263
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,800
to have a good chat with him.

264
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,240
By the way, I almost forgot.

265
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,240
What's this?

266
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Congratulations on your promotion.

267
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,040
You blew money again.

268
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,160
No!

269
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,510
I know you don't like me
to blow money.

270
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,430
I handmade this myself.

271
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,240
Is it nice?

272
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,430
You handmade it yourself?

273
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes.

274
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,600
Hebo, do you like it?

275
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,310
Yes.

276
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,110
That's great.

277
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,870
I am going back.

278
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,550
Zhijun is waiting for me at home.

279
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,190
I am leaving.

280
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,510
Hebo, bye.

281
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,190
Be careful.

282
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,920
Assistant An.

283
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,160
I have reached Evergreen.

284
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
The person in charge of Xinyuan
Technology hasn't arrived yet.

285
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,920
You could wait in the conference room.

286
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,190
All right.

287
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,670
I see.

288
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,480
Xia Qian.

289
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,070
What's wrong?

290
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,550
Can we talk?

291
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,600
He Zhijun.

292
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,720
I still have something to do.

293
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,430
Tell me directly what's up.

294
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:45,960
I hope you can terminate

295
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
your order with Meng.

296
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
You should go to your fiancée

297
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,240
instead of me

298
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,840
for this.

299
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,430
She doesn't know about it yet.

300
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,600
I don't want her to know,

301
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,430
nor do I plan to tell her.

302
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,600
So you left our engagement banquet

303
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,990
because of Ning Meng?

304
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,840
It has nothing to do with her.

305
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,510
On the day of the engagement,

306
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,110
I found out that
I didn't love you anymore.

307
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,160
I couldn't force myself

308
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,310
to be with you.

309
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,310
You found that you didn't love me
on the day of the engagement.

310
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,240
You found out quite early.

311
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,920
Xia Qian.

312
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,990
Don't be so sarcastic, okay?

313
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,280
There is no rule that

314
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,630
you can only love one person
in your life.

315
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,480
I have known you for so long.

316
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,670
For the first time,

317
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,990
I found you pretty free and easy.

318
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,720
I know you need money recently.

319
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,600
There are 100 thousand yuan
in this card.

320
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,400
I hope you can give up

321
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,240
your current job.

322
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,800
Mengmeng doesn't know
what happened between us.

323
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,360
We haven't seen each other for two years.

324
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,070
It's not that long.

325
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
You forgot what I am like?

326
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,990
I am poor and lack of money now.

327
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,070
But I am not so pitiful

328
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,280
to ask for your money.

329
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,920
Don't worry.
Let me make myself clear.

330
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,190
I won't tell Ning Meng

331
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,280
what happened between us.

332
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,960
If possible,

333
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,750
I hope I have never had

334
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,990
any anything to do with you.

335
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,040
Just keep the hush money.

336
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,160
I don't need it.

337
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,400
Anything else?

338
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,840
As long as you can
terminate this cooperation,

339
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,550
I can meet

340
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,550
all your requirements.

341
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,480
This is my compensation

342
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,840
for your previous emotional damage.

343
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,400
Damage? Compensation?

344
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,190
How can you compensate?

345
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,280
Who do you think you are?

346
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,550
And the matter between us

347
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,280
is over to me.

348
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,280
Anything else?

349
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,110
Xia Qian.

350
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,519
[Xia]

351
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,390
Brother.

352
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,550
This is my boyfriend Zhijun.

353
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,360
Hello.

354
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,120
I am He Zhijun.

355
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,520
Thanks.

356
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,360
Did you just hear us talking?

357
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,600
I'm sad now

358
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,310
not because I still like him,

359
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
but because I can't accept

360
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
the truth that he left me.

361
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,960
Do you know how far did he go?

362
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,760
Two years ago, he ran away

363
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,240
from our engagement banquet.

364
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,120
Why did he run away?

365
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,030
I thought about this for two years.

366
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,430
I even imagined

367
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
maybe he was terminally ill

368
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,910
and there was no cure.

369
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,840
He was afraid that
I would be sorrowful.

370
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,960
But the reality

371
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,550
is so cruel.

372
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,310
He just
didn't like me anymore.

373
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,790
Yet it doesn't matter.

374
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,760
Anyway, I don't care about it.

375
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,840
I'm sorry for

376
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,720
telling you all these

377
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,000
and wasting your time.

378
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,840
I used your handkerchief.

379
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,430
I'll wash it and give it back
to you tomorrow.

380
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,030
Hold on.

381
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,640
Ms. Xia.

382
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,120
The agent is in the meeting room.

383
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,910
Where are you?

384
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,550
Hold on, I am on my way.

385
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,520
Okay, see you later.

386
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,120
I have something urgent.

387
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,840
I have to go.

388
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,030
Thank you.

389
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,190
I will give you the handkerchief
back tomorrow.

390
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,840
Hello.

391
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,760
Hello, brother.

392
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,640
Are you free tonight?

393
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,150
I want to have dinner

394
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,520
and chat with you.

395
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,120
I also have something to tell you.

396
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,670
Great!

397
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,070
See you later.

398
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,910
Brother.

399
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,390
You bought me so much
delicious food.

400
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,070
I will cook first.

401
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,790
Let's eat and talk later.

402
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,960
So delicious.

403
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,070
All my favorite.

404
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,310
Take a seat.

405
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,430
I have something to tell you.

406
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,760
Zhijun.

407
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,790
Come in.

408
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,960
My brother cooked many delicious dishes.

409
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,480
Brother.

410
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,840
Zhening.

411
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,840
There is one more dish.

412
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,720
Take a seat first.

413
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
My brother is of slow type.

414
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,720
It takes time.

415
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,430
Okay.

416
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,240
Sit down.

417
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,000
Brother, I told you before that

418
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,790
Zhijun is excellent.

419
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,910
He is the best and youngest psychologist

420
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,720
in their clinic.

421
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,310
And he is very gentle

422
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,670
and considerate.

423
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,760
Everyone's jealous of me

424
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,390
for finding the best man

425
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,120
in one go.

426
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,030
Meng.

427
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,390
You are exaggerating.

428
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,270
It would be nice if I let you
get along with my brother earlier.

429
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,360
In this case, he will know
how nice you are.

430
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm stuffed.

431
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,880
I will leave you alone.

432
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,600
My brother is good at cooking fish.

433
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,960
Eat more.

434
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,030
Okay.

435
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,190
Eat more.

436
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,360
Please do stay.

437
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,240
No.

438
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,150
Zhijun.

439
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,190
My brother isn't like this usually.

440
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,720
Don't be angry.

441
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,640
Never mind.

442
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,240
If I had such a

443
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,520
cute younger sister,

444
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,600
I would also be unhappy

445
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,640
when his boyfriend came home.

446
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,960
I'll take you downstairs.

447
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,150
Not necessary.

448
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,960
I am leaving.

449
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,030
Be careful.

450
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,360
Brother.

451
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,670
Why are you pulling a long face?

452
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,390
What's wrong with Zhijun?

453
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,790
Did you hire Xia Qian

454
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,910
to check the wedding schedule?

455
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,150
You know

456
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,240
I don't want you
to get married so early.

457
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,430
So

458
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,240
you want to cut first and play later?

459
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,390
I just want to marry him immediately.

460
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
How long have you been in love?

461
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,600
Do you know him well?

462
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,190
Why not?

463
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,310
When I first saw him,

464
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,360
I thought he was

465
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
the man I wanted to marry the most

466
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,760
in my life.

467
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
This is an intuition.

468
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,790
You don't understand.

469
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,640
You are carried away by love.

470
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,310
I just love him.

471
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,840
I just want to marry him,

472
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,030
even if I am carried away.

473
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,790
Mr. Sheng.

474
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Are you overreacting?

475
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,270
I think Mr. He loves
Ms. Ning Meng very much.

476
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,720
How long can love last?

477
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,150
Whether a man

478
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,360
can keep his marriage

479
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,720
depends on whether he is responsible.

480
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,360
He Zhijun dumped his fiancée

481
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,840
for love at the engagement banquet.

482
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,030
He may get rid of Meng

483
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,880
for other love

484
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,720
in the future.

485
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,310
How can I trust Meng

486
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
to such an

487
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,550
irresponsible man?

488
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,520
Exactly.

489
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,840
What about Ms. Xia?

490
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,640
She bargained all the orders

491
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,600
we need for us.

492
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,390
And I made an appointment with her

493
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,310
to sign the contract for Hall 8
tomorrow morning.

494
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The contract cannot be signed?

495
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,670
Tell me why.

496
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,190
I have my reasons.

497
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,390
I don't need to explain to you.

498
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,600
By the way,

499
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,270
this is all your reward

500
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,520
for bargaining for Evergreen.

501
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,790
I don't need money.

502
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,640
I want the wedding schedule in May.

503
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,910
Then we have nothing to talk about.

504
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,270
You broke a promise.

505
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,030
Understand?

506
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,600
I have something else to do.

507
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
If there is nothing else,

508
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,390
please leave.

509
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,390
I will let An An

510
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,270
transfer the money to your account.

511
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,390
Mr. Sheng.

512
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,070
I just saw Ms. Xia in the garden.

513
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,520
She seems to be waiting for someone.

514
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,240
I used your handkerchief.

515
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
I'll wash it

516
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,760
and give it back to you tomorrow.

517
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,120
It's hot outside.

518
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,600
Would she have heat stroke?

519
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,520
Is it hot today?

520
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,550
38 degrees.

521
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,960
There is a small hole in the handkerchief.

522
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,120
So I embroidered a blue daze

523
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,600
on my own .

524
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,070
Hope you don't mind.

525
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,150
The flowers are growing well.

526
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,790
My words are correct.

527
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,070
I have an uncle

528
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,480
who does gardening.

529
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,520
I learned some before.

530
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,270
I am not good
at planting other flowers.

531
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
But I also prefer blue daze.

532
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,030
So I know a bit more.

533
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,480
Your hand.

534
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,640
Wipe it.

535
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,190
The juice of blue daze is poisonous.

536
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,520
You have a wound on your hand.

537
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,000
Wipe this area.

538
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,390
Or your skin is prone to allergies.

539
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,030
Why do you keep silent?

540
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,190
Take this.

541
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,240
You can use it later.

542
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,840
Al right. I will leave you alone.

543
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,840
Be careful.

544
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,390
Hello, An An.

545
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,000
Come to my office.

546
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,760
Sheng Zhening has no spirit of contract.

547
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,960
Not only does he lack the spirit
of contract,

548
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,310
but he is also ungrateful

549
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,030
and dishonest.

550
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,600
Qian did so much research

551
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,670
for this order.

552
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,430
He just refused

553
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,430
with a word.

554
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
What can we do?

555
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,840
[An An]

556
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,040
[An An]

557
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,270
It's An An.

558
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,880
What's up?

559
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,910
Ms. Xia.

560
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
Mr. Sheng considered

561
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,270
your situation.

562
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,520
We now have a plan.

563
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,840
You give up the wedding schedule.

564
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,760
In exchange,

565
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,270
we give you another

566
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,390
big bargaining project.

567
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,190
Our company

568
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,000
is group buying cars recently.

569
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,390
Could you…

570
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,790
No way. I'm not interested.

571
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,720
Ms. Xia.

572
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,480
Hello.

573
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,640
Hello.

574
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,960
She

575
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,150
hung up.

576
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,600
So weird.

Wait.

578
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,600
What did he say?

579
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,190
He said that

580
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,270
in exchange,

581
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,360
he would give me an order

582
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,150
for a group buying of cars.

583
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,030
Group buying?

584
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,030
Cars?

585
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes.

586
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,000
We have never received

587
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,150
an order to buy cars.

588
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,030
After this business,

00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,120
we will

What's wrong with you?

592
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,790
How could you give way?

593
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,840
We don't need a handout.

594
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,880
Understand?

595
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,240
We can't take that?

596
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,430
Then what to do?

597
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,480
Should we ask
for the wedding schedule?

598
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,640
Yes.

599
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,240
Of course we should.

600
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,880
This schedule was promised to me

601
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,190
by Sheng Zhening.

602
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,550
Since he broke his promise now,

603
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,390
I will go for it myself.

604
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,240
How?

605
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,840
No idea.

606
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,030
Like you never said.

607
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,030

608
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,520
the list of hotel's schedules

609
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,880
in May,

610
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,360
we may be able to find

611
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,270
people who would change
their wedding dates.

612
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,120
The key is to get the list first.

614
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,310

Before,

642
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,480
I felt that Ms. Xia

643
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,600
didn't really want to take the case
of car group buying.

644
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,480

649
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,640
a satisfactory reward.
