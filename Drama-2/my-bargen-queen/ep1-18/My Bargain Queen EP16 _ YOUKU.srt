4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,550
It feels kind of strange

5
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,630
that there are no other people.

6
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,110
It's not that high.

7
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,520
Zhening.

8
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
Since we have booked the whole park,

9
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,520
can we get an annual card?

10
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,320
Can you get more annual cards?

11
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,960
It's still not enough.

12
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,270
Maybe another set of half-year cards.

13
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,470
Or

14
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,720
two-year cards?

15
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
And...

16
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,030
More than two...

17
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
It's getting late. Go to sleep.

18
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,800
You should also rest earlier.

19
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,440
And also,

20
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,720
it's better not to let Ning Meng

21
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,390
know about us for now.

22
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,200

23
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,670
Honey.

24
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,480
Have some breakfast before you go to work.

25
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,200
Okay.

26
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,110
Honey.

27
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,200
I won't go to the hospital
to send food for you anymore.

28
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,830
I will get up early every day
and make breakfast for you.

29
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,440
Is it all right?

30
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,550
Yes. Thank you, honey.

31
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,000
Look.

32
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,510
Isn't this heart-shaped egg cute?

33
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,480
- It's cute.
- There is a little smiley face on it.

34
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,550
Very cute.

35
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Why are you smirking at?

36
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,510
Nothing.

37
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,600
I just feel

38
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,270
I'm very happy now.

39
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,790
So do I.

40
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,160
Go ahead and eat.

41
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,200
I want to watch you eat.

No need to send the sofa, the washing machine

43
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,640

What about the clothes for Miss Xia?

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,110
Send one over first.

00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,760
Where did you buy it?

51
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,350

52
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,950

53

the board meeting today?

61
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,350
Mr. Gao.

62
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,440
When did you come back?

63
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,720
I've only been abroad for a few months.

64
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,000
We've had a new general manager
when I came back.

65
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,950
Mr. Gao, you were abroad.

66
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,320
It's natural that you are not clear about

67
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,920
Evergreen's personnel changes.

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,830

I remember we invited them

73
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,830
on the 25th anniversary celebration.

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,830
Why are they not on

76
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
We have more reasons

77
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,040
to invite them over
for the 30th anniversary celebration.

78
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,670
Mr. Gao, what do you mean?

79
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,760
You've been trying to stir up trouble
since you came.

80
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,390
Nothing.

81
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,440
I just think the 30th anniversary

82
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
is too important

83
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,550
to be held without Mr. Sheng.

84
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,200
If Mr. Sheng doesn't come back,

85
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,160
the Housekeeping Dept. won't cooperate.

86
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,830
Since Mr. Gao insists it,

87
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
I will invite Mr. Sheng back.

88
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,510
Come on.

89
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,160
Let's continue the discussion.

90
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,600
Mr. Gao is back.

91
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,350
He wants you to go back to Evergreen

92
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,230
to host the 30th Anniversary.

93
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,390
He also said that if you don't go back,

94
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,110
the Housekeeping Dept. won't cooperate.

95
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,440
What did Mr. Qin say?

96
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,200
Mr. Qin also told the shareholders

97
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,350
that he wants you back.

98
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,080

Although

105
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,590
we are a couple now,

106
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,470
we still should keep the professional
and the personal separate.

107
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I'll deduct your salary

108

109

Okay.

Next time...

111
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
There is no next time.

112
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,880

114
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,590
Sir, are you looking for me?

115
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,320
There is an opportunity for
further education now.

[Philip Psychological Clinic Application form
for further education]

117
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,710
Further education?

118
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,710
Well, it's going to be
a little different this time.

119
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,350
The medical plan
of the Philip Psychological Clinic we work with

120
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,590
is based on face-to-face interviews

121
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,710
and supplemented by drug control.

122
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,710
This is what you are studying now.

123
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,350
It's a rare opportunity.

124
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,550
We only have one place.

125
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,910
There are few candidates.

126
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,790
But,

127
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,000
you're my favorite.

128
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,200
Thanks, Sir.

129
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,910
I've been interested in this clinic.

130
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,670
Their therapists are relatively mature.

131
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,790
Although the treatment
is relatively conservative,

132
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,320
the patient's recovery rate is very high.

133
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,670
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

134
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,400
Don't thank me.

135
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,910
You should thank yourself for your efforts.

136
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,320
You flattered me.

137
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,910
This clinic provides the best counseling

138
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,000
in the world.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,520
My seniors and I all want to go there.

140
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,230
Therefore,

141
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,110
it's still a fierce competition.

142
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,150
This candidate needs not only to be skilled,

143
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,110
but also to have comprehensive qualities
in all aspects.

144
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,960
I'll take everything into consideration.

145
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,230
Thanks, Sir.

146
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,520
Keep working hard.

147
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,200
Yes.

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,350
Take care, Sir.

149
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,640
We are going to

150
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,840
invite many old customers
to the anniversary celebration.

151
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,110
These old customers

152
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,880
have been working with Evergreen

153
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,960
since the time of Senior Sheng.

154
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,470
If you are not there,

155
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,880
they may have suspicions.

156
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,520
Moreover,

157
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,640
you've been holding
all the anniversary celebrations before.

158
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,200
You are more experienced.

159
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,150
You've rested for a long time.

160
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,350
Shouldn't you come back?

161
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,520
I see.

162
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,440
Thank you for doing so much

163
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,400
while I'm not around.

164
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,880
It's what I should do.

165
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
By the way,

166
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,350
don't assign me

167
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,960
any specific duties

168
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,000
when I'm back this time.

169
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,840
I only come back to assist you in your work.

170
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,790
It's up to you.

171
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,080
Hello.

172
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,470
Zening.

173
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,150
Are you coming back for dinner?

174
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,840
Yes.

175
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
All right, I'll wait for you.

176
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,320
Okay, I'll be back soon.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,710
Are you in love?

178
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,150
Go back now.

179
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,840
Don't keep her waiting.

180
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,960
We haven't paid the bill yet.

181
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,840
As before.

182
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,030
Okay.

183
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,230
Charlie?

184
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,230
What's wrong?

185
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,200
The last few times I saw you wearing a ring,

186
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,230
but the ring is gone today.

187
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
I guess you broke up.

188
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,840
I just saw him staring at his phone
and giggling.

189
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,670
I guess they didn't break up.

190
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,910
I lost the ring.

191
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
I ordered a new one
and it hasn't arrived yet.

192
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,280
Mr. Sheng won.

193
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,520
Put the drinks on my tab.

194
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:13,880
No problem.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,550
All right.

196
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,230
See you.

197
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,960
Here are all the dishes.

198
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,280
Why did Mr. Qin ask you out?

199
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,710
I'm going back to Evergreen.

200
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,710
You scared me.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,280
I thought something bad happened.

202
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,080
I can't work with you anymore.

203
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,400
It's a good thing to go back to Evergreen.

204
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,230
How to say that,

205
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,520
if love between the both sides
can last for age,

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
why need they stay together night and day?

207
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,320
Right?

208
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Don't you have any hard feelings at all?

209
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,200
Why? I'm not a kid.

210
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,230
Come on.

211
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,400
Have this.

212
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,590
Eat it.

213
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,320
After Mr. Sheng fell in love,

214
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
he did change a lot.

215
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,030
You were the one guessed better before.

216
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
What's your situation now?

217
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,470
I had

218
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
a feeling that you are interested in someone.

219
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,760
Feelings,

220
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,960
the harder
you try to suppress it,

221
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,000
the stronger it fights back.

222
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,710
Sanity doesn't work.

223
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,200
Why don't you drink with me?

224
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,320
Okay.

225
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,840
Come on.

226
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,440
How is it?

227
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,230
Is it too tight or too loose?

228
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,200
It's perfect.

229
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,400
Why are you looking at me?

230
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,960
I want to kiss you.

231
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,840
You are about to be late for work.

232
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
We will talk when you come back tonight.

233
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,790
How is it?

234
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,080
Honestly,

235
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
after spending a lot of time with you,

236
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,520
I almost forgot

237
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,790
you are the general manager of Evergreen.

238
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,670
You only need to remember

239
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,840
that I'm your boyfriend.

240
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,670
I'm leaving.

241
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,550
By the way,

242
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,200
I won't be back for dinner.

243
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,670
Put the dishes in the sink
after you finish eating.

244
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,520
I'll wash them.

245
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,150
Got it.

246
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,760
Bye.

247
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,880
Sir.

248
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
I already had the cake ready for you.

249
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,670
How much is it?

250
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,440
How could I charge you?

251
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,150
You even gave my cake to your friends.

252
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,400
It's basically free promotion.

253
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,670
I should thank you.

254
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,760
I really think it's delicious.

255
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,710
You use great ingredients

256
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,150
and it tastes

257
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,520
really different.

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,000
I just followed the tutorial

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,320
and made the cake based on my feelings.

260
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,470
I guess it's because
I was picky when I was a kid.

261
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,710
So I'm pretty good

262
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,910
at baking.

263
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,710
How did He find such a good wife

264
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,590
like you?

265
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,150
He is a man who works all day.

266
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,590
Zhijun is only clumsy of speech.

267
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,080
I have to trouble you to take care of him.

268
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,470
He is competent.

269
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,440
The hospital has the intention
to cultivate him.

270
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,880
I was being conservative
when I talked to him.

271
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,320
Rest assured,

272
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,230
he will have the opportunity

273
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,710
to study abroad this time.

274
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,320
Study abroad?

275
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,110
What are you doing?

276
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,320
Qian.

277
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,160
I have something to ask you.

278
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,470
Go ahead.

279
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,560
Are you really dating Sheng Zhening now?

280
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,280
Yes.

281
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,950
Didn't you say he is high maintenance,

282
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,680
unreasonable,

283
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,640
and has no spirit of contract?

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,110
What do you like about him?

285
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,920
Did I say that?

286
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,560
Why is your memory so bad?

287
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,350
I can't remember that.

288
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,349
I didn't notice how good he is

289
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,709
at that time.

290
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,710
You need to be at the banquet hall at 8:30,

291
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,160
the shareholders' meeting is at 9:30,

292
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,760
And the meeting with Mingcheng Group
is at 11:00.

293
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,000
The Food & Beverage Dept.
will determine the menu

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,880
of the celebration at 2:00 in the afternoon.

295
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,000
Bring the meeting with
the Food & Beverage Dept. to 1:00 p.m..

296
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,000
But it takes at least one hour

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,310
to go back from Mingcheng Group to the hotel.

298
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,310
Your lunch...

299
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,830
I'll have something on the road.

300
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,590
Okay.

301
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,800
The period of time

302
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,830
from 11:00 pm to 2:00 am the next day

303
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,470
is...

304
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,710
Live commerce?

305
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,000
This is the famous anchor Lie'er.

306
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,760
Lie'er?

307
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Well,

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,710
last week,

309
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,000
a lives commerce company talked to me.

310
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
They often need to negotiate prices

311
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,190
with the suppliers.

312
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,070
The lower the price is,

313
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,040
the more people will buy the product.

314
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,520
They need to find the right balance.

315
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,430
So they want to work with us.

316
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,800
Actually, I'm quite interested in

317
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,040
the mode of live streaming.

318
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,710
So I consulted them.

319
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,000
They also said

320
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,110
that if we are interested in

321
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,950
working with them,

322
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,000
we can sign a contract to have a try.

323
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,070
What do you two think?

324
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,230
I think it's pretty good.

325
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,160
You just watched it for such a short time,

326
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,280
and you think it's good?

327
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,110
You know what,

328
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,640
bargaining with the suppliers

329
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,800
is our strength.

330
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,710
Now there is just one more procedure.

331
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,520
We only need to sell the discounted goods.

332
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,590
With one more procedure,

333
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,520
we can get more commission

334
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,830
and make more money.

335
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,160
I thought about it.

336
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,160
Our strength lies in bargaining,

337
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,040
but we are not good at selling.

338
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,880
That's why we may not

339
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,800
be able to make the money.

340
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,470
We can learn if we don't know how to do it.

341
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Then let's try it.

342
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,520
Okay.

343
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,190
Let's try it.

344
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,710
Therefore, we want to shoot

345
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,160
a short promotional video
with Mr. Sheng as the main character

346
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,880
to let the public know more about
the leaders of Evergreen

347
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,560
and our hotel culture.

348
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,710
It's not a good proposal.

349
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,470
What Evergreen has achieved

350
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,710
is the result of joint efforts of all people.

351
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,430
I think

352
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
we should shoot a video
about some good employees

353
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,950
and the stories of Evergreen

354
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,000
and its old customers

355
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,310
and their blessings.

356
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,470
Sincerity matters the most.

357
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,920
Understood.

358
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,600
[Sheng Zhening What are you doing?]

359
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,400
What are you doing?

360
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:26,279
[Xia Qian I'm eating.]

361
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,040
I'm eating.

362
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,190
Have you eaten?

363
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,040
How is your work? Are you tired?

364
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,950
I already ate.

365
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,110
Don't worry about me.

366
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,310
Mr. Sheng.

367
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,760
The red wine for the celebration has arrived.

368
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,590
When will you be back?

369
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,560
Has the invitation been designed?

370
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,190
I forgot about it.

371
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,310
I'll get someone to do it right away.

372
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,950
Has the theme of the promo set?

373
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,190
Yes.

374
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,950
We will discuss it in the meeting tomorrow.

375
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,560
Time is running out.

376
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,800
We need to work overtime tonight.

377
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,950
Got it.

378
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,000
Honey, you're back.

379
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,680
You haven't eaten yet, right?

380
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,040
I'll cook something for you.

381
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,880
Meng.

382
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,920
Sit down.

383
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,710
I need to talk to you.

384
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,110
The president talked to me today.

385
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,190
He said you told him

386
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,800
we are going to have a baby this year,

387
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,830
so he gave the opportunity of studying abroad

388
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,880
to other doctors.

389
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,070
I do have such an idea.

390
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,310
Well, we've been married for some time.

391
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,920
It's time to have a baby.

392
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,160
Don't you think so?

393
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,350
Do you know how rare the opportunity is

394
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,400
to study abroad?

395
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,710
Since I started to work,

396
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,190
it's the only chance I've got.

397
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,070
Zhijun.

398
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,070
I don't want to leave you.

399
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,880
I don't want you to go abroad.

400
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,680
Don't be angry, okay?

401
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,880
studying abroad is just for work.

402
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,160
I'm not leaving you.

403
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,400
Can you stop living in

404
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,590
in your own judgment?

405
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,070
Do you know

406
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,800
how important the job is to me?

407
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,000
But you promised

408
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,430
you will spend more time with me.

409
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,040
Yes.

410
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,710
I'm tightly tied to you.

411
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,920
Where can I go?

412
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,070
Honey, I was wrong.

413
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,470
I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong.

414
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,040
I will text the president tomorrow

415
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,830
and tell him we are not going to
have a baby now

416
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,070
and you can study abroad.

417
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,590
No.

418
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll send him a message now, okay?

419
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,160
No need.

420
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,920
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

421
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm fine.

422
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,400
Something came up at the hotel.

423
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,230
I can't have breakfast with you.

424
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,000
Sorry.

425
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,110
Be careful.

426
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,310
Thank you, An An.

427
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,110
You're welcome.

428
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,280
By the way,

429
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,560
what do you suddenly

430
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,830
send Mr. Sheng's luggage back?

431
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,920
He has been too tired recently.

432
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,000
It takes forty minutes

433
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,310
to drive from my house to the hotel.

434
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,710
His commute is about two hours.

435
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,280
Now he moves back,

436
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,350
he can use the time to have a good rest.

437
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,920
Miss Xia, you are thoughtful indeed.

438
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,710
But have you

439
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,000
discussed it with Mr. Sheng?

440
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,950
I know you did it for my good.

441
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,190
But...

442
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,160
There is no but.

443
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,430
It's not negotiable.

444
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,920
Sheng Zhening.

445
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,190
You must obey me unconditionally this time.

446
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
That's a lot of luggage.

447
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,350
You should have waited for me to pack it.

448
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,710
Okay, you are the boss.

449
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,350
I see.

450
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,590
Did you bring the luggage back?

451
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,280
I thought Miss Xia has discussed it with you.

452
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,640
I'm innocent.

453
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,070
I want a review

454
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,950
and I'll deduct your bonus for two months.

455
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,800
Wait.

456
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,430
She didn't discuss it with you?

457
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,040
I thought she told you...

458
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,760
I...

459
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,040
What do you think about the live streaming?

460
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,400
No problem.

461
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,430
We can try to work together.

462
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,920
Do you have time in the afternoon?

463
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,520
This afternoon?

464
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,430
Yes.

465
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,230
[Tian Tai Xuan]
How about meeting you at your company

466
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,760
[Tian Tai Xuan]
at two o'clock in the afternoon?

467
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,640
Okay, see you this afternoon.

468
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,350
Sorry.

469
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,280
Can we meet at Evergreen Hotel

470
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,000
this afternoon?

471
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,830
No problem.

472
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,560
Okay.

473
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,520
I have read the contract.

474
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
There is no problem,

475
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,000
but we still need to confirm with

476
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,710
our legal department.

477
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,760
Hope we can cooperate as soon as possible.

478
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,560
Okay.

479
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,520
When the project is launched,

480
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,760
we will give you all-round support
from the preliminary preparation

481
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,710
to the tech support in later stage,

482
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,880
and we will send professionals

483
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,680
to collaborate with you.

484
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,230
That would be great.

485
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,520
It can save a lot of

486
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
preparation time.

487
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,470
And help you to get ready to go live
as soon as possible.

488
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,070
Yes.

489
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,280
Contact us if you have any questions.

490
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,560
Well,

491
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,070
we are just waiting to sign the contract.

492
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,680
Okay.

493
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,400
Happy to work with you.

494
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,070
Okay.

495
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,070
Let's talk on the phone if anything happens.

496
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,760
Okay, bye.

497
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,560
Hello.

498
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,800
An An.

499
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,190
Is Mr. Sheng at the hotel now?

500
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,230
Yes.

501
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,710
Where is he exactly?

502
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,070
I don't know where he is exactly.

503
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,280
I'm outside now.

504
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,640
I'll be back to the hotel later.

505
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,000
But according to his schedule,

506
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,190
Mr. Sheng should be in the restaurant

507
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,070
discussing with the chef about the menu now.

508
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,800
What's wrong? Miss Xia?

509
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,280
Are you looking for Mr. Sheng?

510
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,880
Yes.

511
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,070
I need to talk to him.

512
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,560
All right, I'll leave you to your work.

513
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,520
Bye.

514
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,070
I want to use the anniversary celebration

515
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,070
to advertise Building No. 2.

516
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,000
Building No. 2 will finish
the renovation soon.

517
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,160
Let's give our guests a warm-up.

518
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,320
[Sheng Zhening Come to my room.]

519
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,230
Come to my room.

520
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,070
I miss you.

521
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,400
I know you are very busy.

522
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,680
I didn't mean to come here

523
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,430
to bother you.

524
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,190
I miss you, too.

525
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,470
Why aren't you answering the phone?

526
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,070
It's probably about the meeting
with the Marketing Dept.

527
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,880
It's okay.

528
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,310
Don't you need to answer it?

529
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,950
What's wrong with your forehead?

530
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,560
I sleepwalked last night

531
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,280
and hit somewhere accidentally.

532
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,310
I should move back.

533
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,470
I'm worried about you

534
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,310
living there alone.

535
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,560
Mr. Sheng.

536
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,800
The Marketing Dept. wants me to ask you

537
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,190
when the meeting will start

538
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,880
so they can prepare in advance.

539
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,560
Do you have a specific time?

540
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,280
Give me ten minutes.

541
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,950
Mr. Sheng will be there in a while.

542
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,760
Is Miss Xia also there?

543
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,230
I'll just tell them to cancel the meeting.

544
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,190
Cancel it.

545
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,470
Change it to tomorrow.

546
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,800
It can't be canceled.

547
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,280
Mr. Sheng will be there right now.

548
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,190
Who has the final say in your family?

549
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,280
Okay, just wait for a second.

550
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,560
Are you sure just a second?

551
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,070
Yes.

552
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,710
Okay.

553
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,520
She is important indeed.

554
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,560
I'm leaving then.

555
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,160
Let me hold you for a while.

556
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Just for ten seconds.

557
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,070
Okay.

558
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,230
You are the boss.

559
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,350
Is he still working?

560
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,110
The kitten is sick.

561
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,040
Sorry.

562
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,880
the number you dialed

563
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,160
is not answered for the moment.

564
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,230
Please...

565
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,590
You are just barking up hairballs.

566
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,230
I thought you were sick.

567
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,110
Little buddy.

568
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,070
You can't let anything happen to you.

569
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
I think your owner may not be able to

570
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,070
care about you for the time being,

571
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,160
but you must stay strong.

572
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,830
It's not easy to be his cat.

573
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,110
Sorry for your suffering.

574
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,560
It really scared me.

575
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,640
He Bo.

576
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,350
I heard

577
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,950
that you got Sheng Zhening back
to Evergreen.

578
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,430
Yes.

579
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,350
The old shareholder of Evergreen,
Mr. Gao, is back.

580
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,040
He asked for it.

581
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,230
He is still respected in Evergreen.

582
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,710
I don't think I should go against him.

583
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,310
Moreover,

584
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,350
Sheng Zhening should be there

585
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,590
for the 30th Anniversary celebration
of Evergreen.

586
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,710
The Mr. Qin I know

587
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,950
is not such a passive man.

588
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,680
[Mr. Xue]
The power failure in Building No. 2,

589
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,470
[Mr. Xue]
the reviewer being trapped in elevator,

590
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,430
the comparison budget being changed

591
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,160
and leading Sheng Zhening to buy
large quantities of

592
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,710
African logs with termite infestation.

593
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,710
You used to be

594
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,559
very decisive about these things.

595
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,950
By the way,

596
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,230
how is it going

597
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,000
[Mr. Xue]
with Mr. Gao?

598
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Do you need me to step in?

599
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,629
No need.

600
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,949
I have a plan.

601
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,600
It's easy to

602
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,390
shut Mr. Gao up.

603
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,190
What I want is his stocks.

604
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,320
Well, good.

605
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,870
He Bo.

606
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,120
I need to remind you.

607
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,559
Don't go easy on Sheng Zhening

608
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,909
just because

609
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:40,629
he gave up his position

610
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,630
as general manager to you.

611
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,670
Don't forget what I told you before.

612
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,670
Sheng Zhening is still

613
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,360
one of Evergreen's biggest shareholders.

614
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,840
It's a piece of cake for him

615
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,470
to kick you out of your place now.

616
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,429
As long as Lihe Capital

617
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,669
acquires Evergreen,

618
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,760
gives you shares,

619
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,040
and call on the entire board to support you,

620
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
only by then,

621
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,560
you can rest easy on the seat

622
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,840
as the general manager.

623
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,520
I see, Mr. Xue.

624
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,280
I'll hang up.

625
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,150
I'll let you know if I have any news.

626
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,190
Watch it.

627
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,950
Sorry. Sorry.

628
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,190
Are you blind?

629
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,630
Our company will bargain with
the suppliers of the materials

630
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,520
for the renovation of Building No.2

631
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,120
of Evergreen Hotel.

632
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,560
I'm working so hard now

633
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,470
to save money for your hotel.

634
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,710
Why didn't I think of

635
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,080
the risk of termite when I made

636
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,390
the comparison budget?

637
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
They probably wouldn't have bought the wood

638
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,560
if I had mentioned it.

639
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm supposed to be very sensitive

640
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,470
to these details.

641
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,280
[The Man]

642
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,519
[The Man]

643
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,760
Hello.

644
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Hello, Shuangshuang.

645
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,150
Have you been to my home today?

646
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,320
You left your bag here.

647
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,230
I noticed

648
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,560
that the kitten barfed at noon.

649
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,120
I called you but the line was busy.

650
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,630
So I went to your house to feed the kitten.

651
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
It just barfed up hairballs.

652
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,320
It's no big deal.

653
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,870
I left my bag at your place.

654
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,950
I've been looking for it for a while.

655
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,150
Is there anything important in your bag?

656
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,710
Do you need me to send it to you now?

657
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,710
No, it's okay.

658
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,430
There is nothing important in there.

659
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,800
You can use the flash delivery tomorrow.

660
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
I'm busy now.

661
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,040
I'll hang up.

662
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,800
Why did you buy me this watch?

663
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,230
Your horrible habit

664
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,470
of sleepwalking is really

665
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,870
hard to understand.

666
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,150
What if one day

667
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,470
you sleepwalk

668
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,390
to the street

669
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,430
and get hit by a car?

670
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,950
This watch has a GPS function.

671
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,670
In this case,

672
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,670
I'll know if you are sleepwalking at night.

673
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,760
You are being dramatic?

674
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,670
Don't underestimate this watch.

675
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,000
It can do a lot of things.

676
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,120
It can make and answer phone calls.

677
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
If your phone runs out of power someday,

678
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,040
you can use it to call me.

679
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,470
I can also find you through it.

680
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,670
Double insurance.

681
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,320
Okay, okay.

682
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,840
Your watch isn't pretty at all.

683
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,870
Don't say that!

684
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,800
Mind your words.

685
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,630
To be honest, it's not pretty.

686
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,360
He doesn't know anything.

687
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,670
The watch is very cute.

688
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,760
Everything looks good on you.

689
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,430
I also think it's cute.

690
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,190
Men are the best liars.

691
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,710
Aren't you a man, too?

692
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,230
I'm different from him.

693
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,670
What's the difference?

694
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,430
I...

695
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,360
He is different.

696
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,910
What's going on with him today?

697
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,840
He is weird.

698
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,230
I guess

699
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,000
he got poisoned.

700
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,760
Thanks.

701
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,430
You're welcome.

702
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,950
Lie'er is so cool.

703
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,360
She is the goddess of my dreams.

704
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,360
It's going to be on fire

705
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,230
if we can invite her over.

706
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,120
If we can invite her over,

707
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,670
then my dream will come true, right?

708
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,600
Only in your dream.

709
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,120
Look.

710
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,150
You learned it pretty fast.

711
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,040
- You are dancing like her.
- Come in.

712
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,080
Look.

713
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,670
She really should see the way you dance.

714
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,520
Your dream comes true.

715
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,600
Am I dreaming?

716
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,430
Why do you stop?

717
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,430
You were dancing well.

718
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,630
Be serious.

719
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,430
Are you dreaming? Does it hurt?

720
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,670
Kind of.

721
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
This little buddy is so funny.

722
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,600
Don't praise him.

723
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,360
Come on, let me introduce them to you.

724
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,230
These are our partners

725
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,760
who came to support us

726
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,000
in the new project.

727
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,870
Lie'er and Ai.

728
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,080
Hello.

729
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,760
Let's welcome them.

730
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,470
Welcome. Welcome.

731
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't need to introduce Lie'er anymore.

732
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,950
Everyone knows her.

733
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,560
She is a very experienced

734
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,080
good anchor.

735
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,870
She will guide us
in the first few live streamings

736
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,600
as a guest this time.

737
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,800
This is Ai,

738
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,230
also a very good selection manager.

739
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,470
Anyway, if we have any questions

740
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,320
when we do live streaming,

741
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,520
we can ask them for advice.

742
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,560
Don't be so formal.

743
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,520
I'm nervous.

744
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,520
Just ask us

745
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,560
if you have any questions.

746
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

747
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,710
I'll treat you to dinner

748
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,280
for the welcome party tonight.

749
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,040
I bought a contour stick

750
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,280
in your studio yesterday.

751
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,760
Really?

752
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,120
Yeah.

753
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,800
It's a great gift for your girlfriend.

754
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,760
I don't have one now.
I just prepare in advance.

755
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,280
Prepare in advance.

756
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,870
You're so funny.

757
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,320
Qian.

758
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,470
What's wrong?

759
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,080
You guys talk first.

760
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,840
Okay.

761
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,630
Ai, this is Xiaoyan.

762
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,320
-Qian
-What's the matter?

763
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,390
I can't go tonight.

764
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,040
I'm not feeling well.

765
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,870
You guys have fun.

766
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,320
You are not feeling well?

767
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,760
Are you okay?

768
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,630
Do you need to go to the hospital?

769
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,230
No.

770
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,150
I didn't sleep well these days.

771
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,230
I'm having a headache.

772
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,230
I kind of caught a cold.

773
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,760
Alright.

774
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,800
We got you.

775
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,560
Have some good rest now.

776
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,670
I'll go to work.

777
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,760
Qian.

778
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,600
I think I've been

779
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,630
not doing well recently.

780
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,760
I affected your work.

781
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,000
Sorry.

782
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,670
What's there to apologize?

783
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,840
We all have bad days at work.

784
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,560
We are a team.

785
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,520
We share the good things

786
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,280
and the bad things together.

787
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,080
What's wrong with you today?

788
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Is there something on your mind?

789
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,150
No.

790
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,560
I'm just not feeling well.

791
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,950
Don't worry.

792
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,280
Go to work.

793
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,800
Mr. Qin, are you looking for me?

794
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,040
Send the package for me.

795
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,950
Okay, where to send it?

796
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,600
To...

797
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,470
Forget it. You don't need to do it.

798
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,320
Okay.

799
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,280
You.

800
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,950
Yes. I'm talking about you.

801
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,870
Did you do something wrong

802
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,870
and she doesn't want to see you?

803
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,470
Or do you become ugly

804
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,000
and she doesn't like you anymore?

805
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,910
Why doesn't she

806
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,470
come to see us?

807
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,670
I think

808
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,040
she doesn't want to see us anymore.

809
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,840
If she doesn't want to come,

810
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,800
do you want to see her?

811
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,470
Do you?

812
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,190
Cheer up.

813
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,910
Do you?

814
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,390
If you don't want to see her,

815
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,470
I'll ask her out myself.

816
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,230
Don't blame me.

817
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,000
I'll treat you to dinner

818
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,950
and give you your bag.

819
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,080
The same old place.

820
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,080
I'll see you then.
