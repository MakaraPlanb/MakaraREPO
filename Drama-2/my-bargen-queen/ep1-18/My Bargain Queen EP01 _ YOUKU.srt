I just said hello.

How could someone as arrogant

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
as him recognize me?

I was afraid that the water
would splash on you.

Even so,

the business related to Evergreen

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,920
Hello, Ms. Xia.

196
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,400
Hello.

197
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,600
This way, please.

198
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,190
I am so sorry.

199
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,160
This matter needs to be negotiated

200
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,280
with General Manager Sheng.

201
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,630
No need to be so troublesome.

202
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,430
This is a schedule issue.

203
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,480
Manager.

204
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,720
I know

205
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
your schedule for May

206
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,430
has expired.

207
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,920
But I checked.

208
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,190
On May 15th,

209
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,960
the banquet hall No. 8

210
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,870
will be vacant.

211
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,960
We arranged for the decoration
of it that day.

212
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,360
So it was not booked out.

213
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,960
I want to discuss with you

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
if you can postpone the decoration

215
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
of it until next month.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
I am willing to buy the day

217
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
of May 15th at double the price.

218
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,400
Sorry.

219
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,360
I really can't make a decision.

220
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,310
This requires Mr. Sheng's consent.

221
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,110
The hotel is so big

222
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,160
Where can I find him?

223
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,070
Sorry.

224
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,840
Excuse me.

225
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,870
Why her again?

226
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,800
The blue daze cannot be exposed
to the sun all the time.

227
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,310
It wilted off

228
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,480
after drying out all morning.

229
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,960
You don't need to water.

230
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,160
It's like this because it is exposed
to the sun,

231
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,510
not because of lack of water.

232
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,360
Really?

233
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,840
Why didn't I tell that?

234
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,310
Did you not add base fertilizer?

235
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,040
Base fertilizer is very important
for blue daze.

236
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,400
I didn't expect that she knew a lot.

237
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,870
I would like to ask

238
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,430
if you know

239
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,870
where Mr. Sheng is?

240
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,190
Why is she looking for me?

241
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,630
I will ask An An to find it out.

242
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,360
How could a gardener know?

243
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,630
All right. Please go ahead.

244
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,360
Bear it in mind.

245
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,870
At 11 o'clock in the morning,

246
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,040
you need to assist Mr. Sheng

247
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,430
to review and evaluate

248
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,190
the personnel of all departments.

249
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,160
Today you also need to

250
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,870
determine Evergreen's new PR plan.

251
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,240
Got it.

252
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,480
Arrange a meeting at two o'clock
in the afternoon.

253
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,310
Let the directors of all departments

254
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,510
discuss the hotel's purchase budget

255
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,750
for the next quarter.

256
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,430
Director.

257
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,550
You just came back
from a business trip.

258
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,720
Don't you need to take a break?

259
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,600
Not necessary.

260
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,190
Just inform them.

261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,670
Hebo.

262
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,110
Zhening.

263
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,480
Hard work for you.

264
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,070
Nothing.

265
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,630
I brought a bottle of wine back.

266
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,040
Go to my office.

267
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,550
Okay.

268
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,110
Wrong way.

269
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,990
Your office is not there.

270
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,510
Come on.

271
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,400
Where are you taking me?

272
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,630
The board of directors meeting
the day before yesterday

273
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,750
Decided to appoint you as the deputy
general manager of Evergreen.

274
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
I wanted to surprise you.

275
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,400
So I asked the personnel department
to conceal it.

276
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,840
How about it?

277
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,920
Is Vice General Manager Qin satisfied?

278
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Thank you for your consideration.

279
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,670
By the way, Hebo.

280
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,670
Join the next board of directors meeting.

281
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,070
In the future,

282
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,070
we have to fight together.

283
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,360
The board of directors
meets frequently recently.

284
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,840
Anything happened?

285
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,870
Not a big deal.

286
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,040
I am leaving.

287
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,190
Take some food.

288
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,480
- Thank you.
- Hold on.

289
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,750
Are you really planning to

290
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,870
wait for Sheng Zhening
in Evergreen?

291
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,310
Otherwise, how can we cooperate with him?

292
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,800
I thought you would use your radar

293
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
and search for Sheng Zhening around.

294
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,400
I didn't expect you to

295
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,430
use such ordinary moves
as man-marking.

296
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,550
The most common is the most effective.

297
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,550
Understand?

298
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,070
Bravo.

299
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,360
She is here again today.

300
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,760
Let the security staff in the lobby
keep an eye on her.

301
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,070
Don't influence other guests.

302
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,310
Mr. Sheng.

303
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,910
I just asked the reception.

304
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,000
This fangirl

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,670
is asking for your whereabouts.

306
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,030
I think since the last kiss…

307
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,390
Since what happened last time,

308
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,480
this fangirl

309
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
couldn't help falling in love with you.

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,520
She inquired about the hotel.

311
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,310
She should be going
to pester you completely.

312
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,670
But she is not to blame.

313
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,030
Mr. Sheng

314
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,070
is so charming.

315
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,270
We will come in through the
basement in the future.

316
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,120
I don't want to meet her again.

317
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,760
Got it.

318
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,150
Is it Manager Wang in the lobby?

319
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,360
Hello, madam.

320
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Madam.

321
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,790
Hello.

322
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,030
What's wrong?

323
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,030
Well.

324
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,960
General Manager Sheng

325
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,840
usually lives in hotel.

326
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,520
It's so late,

327
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,840
he must have rested.

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,190
He wouldn't pass by the lobby.

329
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,190
So don't wait

330
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,520
at night from now on.

331
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,120
I waited so long.

332
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,000
Why did you just tell me?

333
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,390
Sorry, madam.

334
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,270
I got it.

335
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,600
Thank you.

336
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,550
You are welcome.

337
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,790
Financial news today.

338
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,520
Domestic financial giant Lihe Capital

339
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,840
is about to enter the hotel industry.

340
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,480
Major hotels in Jinhai City

341
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,430
will encounter an economic storm.

342
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,000
As the largest high-end

343
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,600
hotel platform in Jinhai City,

344
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,390
Evergreen will be the center
of this storm.

345
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,000
Recently, I heard news that

346
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,120
Lihe Capital is going to acquire Evergreen.

347
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,000
What do you think?

348
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,670
As far as I know,

349
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,880
Lihe Capital is very domineering.

350
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
No matter who they acquire,

351
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,640
they will offer two conditions.

352
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,430
For those actively accept mergers
and acquisitions,

353
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,480
a price will be offered.

354
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
For those who think

355
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,430
they are a hostile takeover

356
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,880
and stubbornly resist,

357
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,000
it will be another price.

358
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,150
There would be a huge difference

359
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,150
between the two prices.

360
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,030
So I think

361
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
we should contact each other formally.

362
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,760
Know both ourselves and our adversaries.

363
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,000
And prepare ourselves for both eventualities.

364
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,760
If we really

365
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,030
get acquired in the end,

366
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,390
at least we can get a good price

367
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,390
for Evergreen.

368
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,760
All shareholders.

369
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,120
Each of you

370
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,310
has a material in front of you.

371
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,360
This is the material of Evergreen's

372
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,120
current quarter's turnover

373
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,310
and listing evaluation.

374
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,520
Please take a look.

375
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,270
Evergreen's performance in recent years
has been good.

376
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,910
Mr. Sheng has been

377
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,960
busy preparing for the listing.

378
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,310
In fact, I think Evergreen's future

379
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,310
is very advantageous.

380
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,550
There is no need

381
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,030
to talk about mergers and acquisitions
at this moment.

382
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,760
Yes.

383
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,360

574
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,790
I'll give you a reply in two days.

575
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,480
Okay.

576
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,720
Then I am leaving.

577
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,600
Are you okay?

578
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,790
Nothing.

579
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,190
I just sprained the ankle downstairs.

580
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,430
Hold on.

581
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,240
An An.

582
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,150
Give her a ride.

583
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,150
Ms. Xia, come with me.

584
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,790
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

585
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,070
This bidding plan

586
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,390
is quite interesting.

587
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,910
She has clear and definite minds.

588
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,030
She compared some rigid requirements
of the hotel

589
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,190
with the functions of the products,

590
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,790
and eliminated some high-priced

591
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,190
but flashy products.

592
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,190
Her way of dealing with problems

593
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,120
is indeed much more flexible
than our purchasing department.

594
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,790
I think it's good too.

595
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,840
Shall we hire her?

596
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,520
Anyway we need such talents.

597
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,880
She has her own company.

598
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,310
You showed me this plan

599
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,790
just for me to comment?

600
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,390
Right.

601
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,960
I am going to give her a try

602
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,360
on the hardware equipment order in Hall 8.

603
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,520
See if this bidding plan

604
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,030
is just an armchair strategist.

605
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,600
Mom.

606
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,720
Go to bed early when you finish working.

607
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,520
I am leaving.

608
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,430
Okay.

609
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,390
Hold on.

610
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,910
Take that.

611
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,790
Take it back.

612
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,670
What are you doing?

613
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,720
I have money.

614
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,720
Stop pretending.

615
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,120
I know your situation well.

616
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,520
You sold the car last month.

617
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,150
Tell me.

618
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,240
What are you going to sell this month?

619
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,600
After I sold the car,

620
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,880
I walked every day. That's good.

621
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
Exercise and stay healthy.

622
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,190
Don't keep up appearances.

623
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,390
Just take it.

624
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,070
By the way,

625
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,190
I am not blaming you.

626
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,120
[Liping BBQ]
You are a girl.

627
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,150
Why do you

628
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,880
start a bargaining company

629
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,430
and be a bargainer?

630
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,000
Every time relatives and neighbors

631
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,480
ask me about your work,

632
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,670
I never

633
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,270
made myself clearly.

634
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,390
All right, come on.

635
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,030
Explain it clearly to me today.

636
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,120
What's your job?

637
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,880
Go ahead.

638
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,030
Let me explain to you.

639
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,600
For example, this kabob.

640
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,670
You sell others for five yuan.

641
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,720
But you have to sell me for three yuan.

642
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,840
And you should give me
a bunch of potato chips.

643
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,840
Wait.

644
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,270
Sell you for three yuan and

645
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,910
give you a bunch of potato chips?

646
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,600
Why?

647
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
You are not my relative.

648
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,550
By my ability.

649
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,270
The job of a bargainer
is to do the hardest thing

650
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,310
with the least amount of money.

651
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,150
It's okay.

652
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,360
If one day I can't hang on anymore,

653
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,670
I will inherit your business.

654
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,720
I will carry forward

655
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,600
Liping BBQ.

656
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,030
Put your hands down.

657
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,030
When can you be serious?

658
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,150
When can you get married?

659
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,000
Qian.

660
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,640
Uncle Hu.

661
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,760
Take this supper home.

662
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,270
I am starving.

663
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,360
I will take it back to eat.

664
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,790
Okay.

665
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,910
Mom, I am leaving.

666
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,670
Thank you, uncle Hu.

667
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,190
Take your time.
Mom, I am leaving.

668
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,150
My gosh.

669
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,150
You are really nice to him.

670
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:19,760
Look at you!

671
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,240
Let's clean up.

672
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Look at her.

673
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,840
Mr. Sheng.

674
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,000
Ms. Xia is here.

675
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,640
Mr. Sheng.

676
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,910
I just came

677
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,720
to see

678
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,600
how Ms. Xia bargains.

679
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,520
Will I affect your performance?

680
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,720
Of course not.

681
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,000
Mr. Sheng, don't worry.

682
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,070
Ms. Xia.

683
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,190
I really can't give you

684
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,960
the price you said.

685
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,350
This new media projection device

686
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,870
adds the function of Bluetooth,

687
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,190
which is quite convenient.

688
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,430
Think about it again.

689
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,320
Manager Ma.

690
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,670
Then I'll get to the point.

691
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,669
The Bluetooth function of your device

692
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,870
is useless.

693
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,760
Why do you set up Bluetooth?

694
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,109
It is to facilitate the connection
of external speakers.

695
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,909
But the Bluetooth function of your device

696
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:25,999
is so unstable that

697
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
it will often disconnect automatically.

698
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,520
Many consumers

699
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,870
reported this issue

700
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,280
in your product comment section.

701
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,590
I don't know if you saw it.

702
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,429
Well…

703
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,430
As far as I know,

704
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,960
in about three months,

705
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
you will launch a new screening product.

706
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,320
The new product will increase
by 15,000 lumens,

707
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,150
but the price won't increase much.

708
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,040
Buying new products

709
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,870
is a common psychology of consumers.

710
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,590
At that time, you are bound
to sell at a lower price.

711
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,520
The price I offer you now

712
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,870
should be higher than

713
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,910
the reduced price.

714
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,110
Mr. Sheng.

715
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,800
Don't make it hard for me.

716
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,670
Evergreen is such a big company.

717
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,720
You don't need to care
about this little money.

718
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,040
Manager Ma.

719
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,150
Not exactly.

720
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,150
What do you mean?

721
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,720
Evergreen earns every penny

722
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,590
on its own.

723
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,080
Evergreen is a consumer.

724
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Consumers have the right

725
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,960
to buy what they want

726
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,240
at a reasonable price.

727
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,040
Right?

728
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,910
Forget it.

729
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,000
Mr. Sheng.

730
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,150
Since we've made things hard for Manager Ma,

731
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,760
let's think about it again.

732
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,280
There's still time.

733
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,560
We can buy it then.

734
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,000
Forget it.

735
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,480
All right.

736
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,560
I will sell it to Evergreen

737
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,480
at the price Ms. Xia said.

738
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,830
This is the cheapest price

739
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,800
I have ever sold.

740
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,670
Never tell anyone else.

741
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,190
Manager Ma.

742
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,280
You can be assured.

743
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,240
We will absolutely keep it confidential.

744
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,560
Well, Mr. Sheng.

745
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,480
I am leaving.

746
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,870
Mr. Sheng.

747
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,080
Done.

748
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,280
Well done, Ms. Xia.

749
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,830
The Purchasing Department didn't confirm

750
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,150
after a long period of negotiation.

751
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,150
You solved it in less than half an hour.

752
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,320
It's nothing.

753
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,870
Bargaining is a psychological

754
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,910
and information warfare.

755
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,760
After knowing other party's ace,

756
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,000
everything will be quite simple.

757
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,760
Mr. Sheng.

758
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,040
I wrote it all down.

759
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,430
Mr. Sheng.

760
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,110
Are there two more orders?

761
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,350
As long as I can reduce the price,

762
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,040
the schedule for May will
be given to me?

763
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,350
Yes.

764
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,590
Get the contract ready.

765
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,480
Wait for my good news.

766
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,000
Just here.

767
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,110
What do you think?

768
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,910
Not bad.

769
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,110
Okay.

770
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,560
Well.

771
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,390
Sign over there.

772
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,350
Confirm it.

773
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:40,870
Okay.

774
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,590
Done.

775
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,430
Ms. Xia has already got the orders

776
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,630
for the projection equipment

777
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,560
and the fresh air system.

778
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,190
The price is much lower than expected.

779
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,430
She saved us a lot of money.

780
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,960
Why didn't she have lunch
in the restaurant?

781
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,480
Maybe it's to save money.

782
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,560
And Ms. Xia made an appointment

783
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,590
with Xinyuan Technology at two o'clock
in the afternoon.

784
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,560
She will hold a meeting

785
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,110
with their agents for our company.

786
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,720
Maybe she is also

787
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,760
trying to save time.

788
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,150
Arrange something for her.

789
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,870
Ms. Xia.

790
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,960
This is your staff meal.

791
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,040
Staff meal?

792
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,670
What do you mean?

793
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,430
Mr. Sheng said that

794
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,390
you are now an employee of Evergreen.

795
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,520
So you should have staff meal.

796
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,000
Don't you try it?

797
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,720
Okay, thank you.

798
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,190
Evergreen's staff meal

799
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,430
is really rich.

800
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,870
Of course not.

801
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,830
This is what Mr. Sheng ordered.

802
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,800
Thank Mr. Sheng for me.

803
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,560
Take your time.

804
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,280
Yes, it went well today.

805
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Tomorrow I will go
to Xinyuan Technology

806
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,320
to negotiate with the person in charge.

807
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,670
The contract should

808
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,560
be signed.

809
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,870
In this case,

810
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,870
Ning Meng's contract

811
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,110
should be settled the day after tomorrow.

812
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
In order to complete this order,

813
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,280
you have to bargain two more orders

814
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,110
for Evergreen for free.

815
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,590
You did two more pieces of work

816
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,560
for only one.

817
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,280
You paid too much.

818
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,430
It's fine.

819
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,560
If I can solve Ning Meng's schedule,

820
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,110
it's a good deed.

821
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,830
Ms. Xia.

822
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,560
You are really amazing.

823
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,040
Not at all.

824
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,960
I think

825
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I am lucky.

826
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,150
It just so happens that Evergreen
has a bargaining demand.

827
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,320
Otherwise, it won't go so smoothly.

828
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,190
That's also because of your ability.

829
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,190
Ms. Xia.

830
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,910
I really thank you very much.

831
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,830
Actually, my family

832
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,390
doesn't support my marriage.

833
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,280
Only you have been helping me.

834
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,320
And I can feel that

835
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,350
you are not purely for work,

836
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,760
but really want to organize

837
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,350
an ideal wedding in Evergreen for me.

838
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,280
In fact,

839
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,040
to be honest,

840
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,720
you

841
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,430
remind me of

842
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,720
my engagement back then.

843
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,720
Of course I hope you can be happy.

844
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,430
Engagement?

845
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,960
Were you engaged in Evergreen too?

846
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,590
Yes.

847
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,960
What happened later?

848
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,560
Later…

849
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
The engagement was canceled.

850
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,560
That jerk

851
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,960
just vanished.

852
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,240
I never found him again.

853
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
Really?

854
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,390
What a jerk.

855
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:51,960
Yes.

856
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,110
Ms. Xia.

857
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:53,800
Leaving you

858
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,240
is his biggest loss.

859
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,670
I will answer the phone.

860
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,320
Go ahead.

861
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,280
Hello, dear.

862
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,870
You arrived?

863
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,280
I'm on the second floor.

864
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,630
Okay, I'm upstairs.

865
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,520
