[My Bargain Queen]

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
You also keep the secret

4
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,230
about the cat for me.

5
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,230
We are friends.

6
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,190
We should help each other.

7
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,550
What's the matter?

8
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,280
Actually…

9
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,430
Actually…

10
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm a spy!

11
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,760
What kinda spy?

12
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,630
A commercial espionage.

13
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,920
I don't know that Qin Hebo at all.

14
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,150
I lied before.

15
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,920
I'm doing this

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,960
because I want to steal something

17
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,680
from him.

18
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,040
Steal what?

19
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,710
You have to swear that you won't tell.

20
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,960
I swear.

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,840
Your hotel's wedding list for May.

22
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,480
That's it?

23
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,790
Well… That's confidential information!

24
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,070
How come you can stay so calm?

25
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,960
Then let me tell you a secret in return.

26
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,230
I'm also a spy, actually.

27
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,790
What do you mean?

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,350
My purpose

29
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,230
is to take over the entire Evergreen Hotel.

30
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,710
I'm not joking with you.

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,990
Neither am I.

32
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,960
Forget it.

33
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,840
Forget that I said anything.

34
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,430
Life is not easy.

35
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,840
If only you could understand me.

36
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,040
Okay.

37
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,200
I see. It's alright.

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,710
Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,630
Okay.

40
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,480
The agent has an emergency

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,200
and needs to reschedule.

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,840
Let's eat.

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,480
Okay.

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
In that case,

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,790
you can get him drunk and try

46
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,400
to trick him to tell you the password

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,430
while he's unconscious.

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,790
Mr. Sheng.

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,070
Would you like to have a drink with me?

50
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,750
What did you say?

51
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,600
It's just a suggestion.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,630
Don't take it seriously.

53
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,230
No drinking during business hours.

54
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,000
Got it?

55
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,280
You didn't drink.

56
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,630
Why are you drunk-walking?

57
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,310
What are you doing?

58
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,910
I feel dizzy.

59
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,280
Are you sick or what?

60
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
Let me help you over.

61
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,960
Excuse me.

62
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,350
What is it?

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,070
Don't… Don't touch it.

64
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,910
You are burning up!

65
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,910
You have a fever of 39 degrees.

66
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,310
You must have got it from An An.

67
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,960
The cooling patch

68
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
will make you feel better.

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,680
The medicine is here.

70
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,840
Don't forget to take it later.

71
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,280
But you didn't eat much for dinner.

72
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,680
Taking medicine on an empty stomach
would make you feel worse.

73
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,630
You can't hear me anyway.

74
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,510
Sheng Zhening!

75
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,190
Sheng Zhening!

76
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,880
Wake up!

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,230
I made some green bean soup for you.

78
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,880
Have some.

79
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,440
No. No…

80
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,840
I don't want it.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
I don't like sweet stuff.

82
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,790
Don't like sweet stuff.

83
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Listen to me.

84
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,230
I didn't put sugar

85
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,230
in the soup.

86
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,720
And this soup is very effective

87
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,910
in curing fever.

88
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,960
I always ate this instead of taking medicine

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,750
when I was sick before.

90
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,030
Trust me!

91
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,880
You want me to feed you?

92
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,190
What?

93
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,470
Your hands are dirty.

94
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
Sir.

95
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,680
I've washed my hands!

96
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,000
I washed three times!

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,070
Three times! Three times!

98
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,720
Come on.

99
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,600
I need you to work with me.

100
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm doing physical cooling for you.

101
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,549
It'll make you feel better.

102
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,799
Thank you!

103
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,190
Did I hurt you?

104
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,110
He.

105
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,430
Mr. Lu.

106
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,400
What's up?

107
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,630
We just had a meeting.

108
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,630
The meeting decided

109
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,870
that two of my patients

110
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,480
will be transferred to you next week.

111
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,280
Why is that?

112
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,160
Based on their initial evaluation,

113
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,510
your treatment plan

114
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,750
should be more suitable than mine.

115
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,430
He, you…

116
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,670
It's okay.

117
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,870
He.

118
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,110
What's wrong?

119
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,190
You look like something's bothering you.

120
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,240
Noting.

121
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,720
The condition of my last patient
is quite complicated.

122
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,040
I'm still trying to figure out a solution.

123
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,800
I heard you'd get married.

124
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,870
Is the wedding date settled?

125
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,400
Soon.

126
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,510
You are getting married at such a young age.

127
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,600
Over time you'll understand

128
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,630
what burden of love means.

129
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,550
Mr. Lu,

130
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,800
stop making fun of me.

131
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,920
Okay, I'll let you get back to work.

132
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,550
See you later.

133
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,800
Okay.

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,670
Looking forward to attend your wedding!

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,750
See you, Mr. Lu.

136
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,600
Mr. Sheng,

137
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,400
do you feel better?

138
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,990
You've recovered?

139
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,310
The fever is gone?

140
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,870
I'm fully recovered.

141
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,990
Where is she?

142
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,630
Ms. Xia took care of you the whole night.

143
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,800
I let her go back and rest.

144
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,550
Okay.

145
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,550
This is the green bean soup
that Ms. Xia cooked for you.

146
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,070
Alright.

147
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,400
You haven't talked to her

148
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,160
about that thing, have you?

149
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,510
What thing?

150
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,110
You mean to turn her down?

151
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,430
I haven't yet.

152
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,550
Then don't mention it for now.

153
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,960
Mr. Sheng, are you going to…

154
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,920
Until we get back!

155
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
Otherwise, it'd be too awkward

156
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,800
when we see each other.

157
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
Ms. Xia said

158
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
you can't drink coffee when you are sick.

159
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,240
Then I'll drink

160
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,190
milk for breakfast from now on.

161
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,310
Okay.

162
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,400
You can leave now.

163
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:43,870
Hello?

164
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,160
Ms. Ning Meng.

165
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,550
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you

166
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,040
that there's nothing I can do

167
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,190
about the schedule thing.

168
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,750
Ms. Xia, please don't say that.

169
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,920
You are my only hope!

170
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,670
I understand,

171
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,990
and I do feel for you.

172
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,280
But please know

173
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,800
that since I agreed to help you

174
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,960
I'd do everything I can do make it.

175
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,990
I had to give up because there's absolutely

176
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,190
nothing else I can do.

177
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,630
I'm really sorry.

178
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,670
I will refund you for the order.

179
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,990
Ms. Xia.

180
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,160
I remember that you told me

181
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,510
you could also work from the angle

182
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,510
of the wedding list for May.

183
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,920
I've tried.

184
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,190
But Sheng Zhening's computer
is password-protected.

185
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,840
I couldn't get access to his files.

186
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,070
Ms. Xia.

187
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,990
I may know the password to his computer.

188
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,630
How do you know?

189
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,310
Ms. Xia,

190
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,960
it's a long story.

191
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,480
I can tell you when we meet.

192
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,990
I'll go find you right now.

193
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,430
Okay. See you later.

194
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,840
You are saying
Sheng Zhening is your brother?

195
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,990
He broke the contract

196
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,840
because he found out I was your client.

197
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,600
Hold on!

198
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,920
Are you guys trying to screw with me?

199
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,870
Ms. Xia,

200
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,480
I didn't mean that!

201
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,510
Then why didn't you tell me the truth?

202
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,960
If I did,

203
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,480
would you still take my order?

204
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,510
Of course not!

205
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,070
I…

206
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,400
Let me make this clear.

207
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,310
This problem is between you
and your brother.

208
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,870
You need to solve it yourselves.

209
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,400
It's not my place to get involved.

210
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,920
I know I put you in a difficult position.

211
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,360
Ms. Xia,

212
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,840
I really want to hold this wedding.

213
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
I'm sure that if my brother is willing

214
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,400
to take some time to understand

215
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
the relationship between Zhijun and me,

216
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,990
he wouldn't stop us.

217
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,190
But I don't know

218
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,040
why he wouldn't listen

219
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
to my explanation this time.

220
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,480
And I know my brother very well.

221
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,070
As long as he makes up his mind,

222
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,360
no one can change it whatsoever.

223
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,480
Ms. Xia,

224
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,190
if you refuse to help me,

225
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,110
I really don't know

226
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,430
what to do now.

227
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,360
So, is…

228
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,920
is your boyfriend…

229
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,190
really that good?

230
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,070
You must marry him?

231
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,600
He was there for me when I went

232
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,600
through the darkest time in my life.

233
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,990
I wouldn't

234
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,510
be who I am without him.

235
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,960
On the day of the engagement,

236
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,630
I found out that
I didn't love you anymore.

237
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,800
I couldn't force myself

238
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,960
to be with you.

239
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,960
You found that you didn't love me
on the day of the engagement.

There is no rule that

242
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,240
you can only love one person
in your life.

243
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,800
Love can change.

244
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,040
I mean

245
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,480
what if he doesn't love you anymore?

246
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,510
It's good enough to know

247
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,800
he loves me right now.

248
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,070
Ms. Xia, you said that. Remember?

249
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,480
Besides, didn't you feel the same

250
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
when you decided to get engaged?

251
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,750
Yes.

252
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm sorry, Ms. Xia!

253
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,430
I…

254
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,550
It's alright.

255
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,160
Are you sure you want me

00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,870
to the get list from your brother's computer?

257

Ms. Xia, you are going to help me?

258
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,920
To be exact,

259
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,550
we are just proceeding

260
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,750

Ms. Xia,

262
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,360
I know you are the best!

263
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,510
Like a saint, right?

264
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,870
I don't want to be that way, though.

265
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,800
The password to my brother's computer

266
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,480
is the initials of Lan Xing Hua (blue daze),

followed by 0821.

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
You mean blue daze?

269
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,670
Blue daze was my mom's favorite flower

270
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,990
when she was alive.

271
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,480
There are still some kept in the garden

273
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,360
My brother would go tend them

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,600

is set in memory of our mom.

I brought your laundry for today.

286
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,790
Why did you bring the handkerchief?

287
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,360
What's wrong with the handkerchief?

288
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,150
Nothing.

289
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,840
You can leave now.

290
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,190
I'll put it on your bed.

291
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,310
There is a small hole in the handkerchief.

292
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,790
So I embroidered a blue daze

293
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,310
on my own.

294
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,790

The blue daze cannot be exposed
to the sun all the time.

It wilted off

after drying out all morning.

301
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,960
You don't need to water.

302
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,240
It's like this because it is exposed
to the sun,

303
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,600
not because of lack of water.

304
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,520

There's a popular beach in the neighborhood.

Have you opened it recently?

Then you can search it

383
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,480
through the function “Open Recent Files.”

384
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,790
There should be a record

385
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,720

Someone touched my computer.

00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,910
But…

569
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,670
when we talk to them,

570
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
we need to offer a little compensation.

571
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,720
As long as they let me take their spot,

572
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,560
I can even pay for their wedding!

573
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,000
Okay. I got you.

574
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,350
Then I'll go get ready.

575
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,110
Ms. Xia, thank you!

576
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,150
No worries. It's my job.

577
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,110
Thanks!

578
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,080
Rest assured.

579
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm leaving now.

580
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,520
I'll see you later.

581
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,390
This is the information

582
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,960
and the list of our wedding clients

583
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,720
in May.

584
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,720
With these many clients,

585
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,390
Ms. Xia wouldn't talk to all of them, right?

586
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,430
I don't think so.

587
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,150
That'd be a huge waste of time.

588
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,830
I bet she'll pick the client that can

589
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,960
most likely be convinced

590
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,590
and nail it down.

591
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,830
Can we try this couple who'll get married

592
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,430
on May 5?

593
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,720
No way.

594
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,560
Why?

595
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,040
Obviously this couple

596
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,150
are our regular clients.

597
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,870
The groom's graduation banquet

598
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,110
and his sister's wedding banquet

599
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,590
were all held in our hotel.

600
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,190
You can tell that Evergreen

601
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,110
is very special to them.

602
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,110
How about the couple
who'll get married on May 25?

603
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,630
They are just office workers

604
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,000
and not well-off.

605
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,190
Can they be convinced?

606
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,110
They can't either.

607
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,830
Even though this couple

608
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,350
aren't well-off,

609
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,480
they first met at Evergreen Hotel,

610
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
which to them is the place
where they fell in love with.

611
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,320
They can't be convinced at all.

612
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,040
The couple who'll get married
on May 8 might work.

613
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,670
“It's a couple's wedding

614
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,040
or two families' wedding?”

615
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,560
My dream of Aegean Sea

616
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,960
destination wedding fell apart!

617
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,520
Though the bride
wanted a destination wedding,

618
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,080
the groom had booked the hotel.

619
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,000
Apparently they've made their choice.

620
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,110
They shouldn't be convinced by Ms. Xia.

621
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,870
Xia Qian is quite talented

622
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,110
when it comes to this.

623
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,630
We can't underestimate her.

624
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,590
It's an important matter.

625
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,190
Can we persuade them?

626
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,520
Just because it's an important matter,

627
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,520
you have more reason to follow your heart.
