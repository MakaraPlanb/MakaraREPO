Ladies and gentlemen, please look at the big screen.

8
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,320
Isn't that the video from two years ago?

<i>What is happening?</i>

10
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,760
Why is everyone laughing at me?

11
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,070
Why is this happening at my wedding?

12
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,990
Have them exchange the rings.

13
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,440
Will the couple please exchange the rings?

14
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,960
Xia Qian is your ex-girlfriend?

15
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,880
Yes.

16
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,160
Then why didn't you tell me before?

17
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,350
End the ceremony.

18
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:03,160
I officially announce that the ceremony of Ning Meng and He Zhijuan is over.

19
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,560
Ning Meng.

20
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,730
When we first met Xia Qian,

21
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,070
why didn't you explain things clearly?

22
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,710
I had already broken up. It didn't matter.

23
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,000
I thought you would overthink it, so I didn't tell you.

24
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,600
Mengmeng, don't let your imagination run wild.

25
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,510
It is all in the past! I have already decided to be with you.

26
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,950
So, I will wholeheartedly care for you. Please believe in me.

27
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,360
Are you genuine with me?

28
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,860
Of course, I am being sincere. What are you talking about?

29
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,610
I called a driver to take you guys home.

30
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,650
Who put the video on? Did Xia Qian put it on?

31
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,830
It shouldn't be her.

32
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,040
Why isn't it her?

33
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,610
Mengmeng, think about it.

34
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,070
She is also a victim. Why would she hurt herself?

35
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,970
I don't mean to suspect her,

36
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,210
but I really can't think of anyone else who would do such a thing.

37
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,740
I really just wanted to have a perfect, complete wedding with Zhijuan and receive everyone's blessing.

38
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,550
It is just a small, little wish.

39
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,120
Mengmeng,

40
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,620
I will definitely investigate this matter.

41
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,710
Director Xue, why didn't you warn me beforehand?

42
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,640
I'm not interrogating you,

43
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,140
but you doing this makes me feel passive.

44
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,320
You were an important guest at GM Sheng's sister's wedding. It would have been hard for you to do it.

45
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,700
Besides, you are not the only person I have at Evergreen.

46
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,300
I don't need you to go through all my plans.

47
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,780
What gossip is this?

48
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,700
I didn't want to know about the gossip but it is about someone I know.

49
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,840
Mu Xiaoyan, what's wrong?

50
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,210
N-Nothing.

51
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,600
Bring it to me, let me see.

52
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,300
No, I misread it.

53
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,470
Ow, my eyes hurt.

54
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,120
Sister Qian, you didn't do it, right?

55
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,320
Are you crazy? Do you think I would do this?

56
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,940
What do they mean by "ex ruins wedding"?

57
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,920
Why would I ruin it? How come they didn't write that I helped arrange the wedding?

58
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,690
Does the media even have a heart?

59
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,560
They're crazy!

60
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,280
Sister Qian, where are you going?

61
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,970
Evergreen.

62
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,720

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,630

66
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,100

68
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,240
There isn't much else, the rest are just copies.

69
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,280
It seems like their target was Evergreen.

70
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,030
I don't mean that.

71
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,460
It just that we don't know how things will develop.

72
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,270
- But— 
 - I know

73
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,630
the situation with the video has nothing to do with you.

74
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,950
You are also a victim.

75
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,000
The video at the wedding reception was clearly planned,

76
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,930
I think they were targeting Evergreen.

77
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,180
Don't worry about it. I will investigate this matter.

78
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,550
No,

79
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,990
I don't care who did or why they did it, but they provoked me.

80
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,470
I also want to investigate. I want to find this person myself.

81
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,560
Fine.

82
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,100
How is Ning Meng?

83
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,680
Mr. He already sent her home.

84
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,210
But after experiencing that at her wedding, it must be hard for her.

85

<i>[Broadcasting Room]</i>

86
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,830
It seems like it isn't the woman who broadcasted the video.

87
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,650
That means the video must have been switched out beforehand.

88
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,510
I already sent out people to investigate.

89
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,300
Once they find something, they will immediately tell me.

90
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,610
What if we change our way of thinking?

91
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,790
Like, where did this video of He Zhijuan and I come from?

92
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,830
Would you guys keep a video from two years ago?

93
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,970
We would have definitely deleted it.

94
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,880
I am just afraid that someone used trick to retrieve it.

95
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,490
I also deleted it.

96
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,650
He Zhijuan also wouldn't do such a thing at his own wedding.

97
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,120
Then what about people who had access to this video two years ago?

98
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,050
We keep record of all workers who handle

99
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,790
events that are held in the banquet hall.

100
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,340
Let's go check.

101
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,010
Okay.

102
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,540
Follow me.

103
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,300
Sorry I'm late.

104
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,420
Today is my last day at Evergreen.

105
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,010
I was busy packing things up.

106
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,490
By the way, have you received your salary?

107
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,380
Yes. Thank you.

108
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,280
You've asked me to come here. What is it?

109
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,850
My sister is having a bad day today.

110
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,290
I wanted to help her, but I had no idea what to do.

111
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,860
I thought that since you and her are both girls, maybe I can ask you for some advice.

112
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,090
What can I do to make her feel better?

113
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,490
- You're talking about Ning Meng, right? 
 - Yes.

114
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,210
To make a girl happy, you should use different approaches

115
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,900
for different girls. What works for me might not work for her.

116
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,960
I mean,

117
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,280
boys and girls think differently.

118
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,460
Boys are trying to solve the problems.

119
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,830
When a girl encounters a problem and thinks about it,

120
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,890
she doesn't necessarily want to solve the problem.

121
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,590
She wants to find consolation.

122
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,960
She wants someone to listen to her.

123
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,590
Just try to make her laugh.

124
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,950
Make her laugh?

125
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,400
Yes.

126
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,290
Any progress?

127
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,300
What's wrong?

128
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,620
I'm okay. I have hypoglycemia. I'll just need some rest.

129
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,530
Sit.

130
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,260
Don't move too fast.

131
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,110
I'll be fine.

132
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,780
Just one moment.

133
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,370
Hello, Anan.

134
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,520
Send some candies over to the archives room.

135
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,790
GM Sheng, I can't do it now. I'm in the middle of something else.

136
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,360
It'll take at least 20 minutes for me to get there.

137
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,420
OK.

138
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,700
Little girl.

139
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,940
Your lollipop...

140
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,480
Can I have one?

141
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,010
Sure.

142
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,120
Big brother, you look so handsome.

143
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,060
Here's the lollipop for you.

144
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,410
Thank you.

145
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,250
Let's go. Say goodbye to big brother.

146
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,360
Bye, big brother!

147
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,850
Bye bye.

148
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,570
Here. Eat this.

149
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,170
Thank you.

150
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,790
Such a lovely lollipop!

151
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,930
Did you rob it from a kid?

152
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,360
Of course not.

153
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,390
I'm just kidding.

154
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,910
Thanks.

155
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,130
Sheng Zhening!

156
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,130
I found it!

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,910
<i> [Client: He Zhijun, Xia Qian] </i>

158
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,100
<i> [Manager: Chen Kang] </i>

159
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,180
It's getting late today.

160
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,340
I'll ask Anan to look for Chen Kang's profile and call you tomorrow morning.

161
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,110
OK. I'll be on my way then.

162
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,820
OK.

163
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,130
Brother Hebo, what are you doing?

164
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm doing a magic trick.

165
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,980
This is a book of magic.

166
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,790
You can draw your favorite animal in it, and I'll make it alive.

167
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,410
- Really? 
 - Have I ever lied to you?

168
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,980
Here, draw it.

169
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,800
But I have to make it clear, you can't draw a dinosaur.

170
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,290
I can't make a dinosaur alive for you.

171
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,210
What are you drawing?

172
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,300
You'll know pretty soon.

173
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,620
Done!

174
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,410
A rabbit!

175
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,160
Good!

176
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,320
I'll close the book.

177
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,210
Let me cast a magic spell, and I'll turn the rabbit into a real one.

178
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,760
OK?

179
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,120
Three, two,

180
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,630
one. Here we go!

181
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,060
The rabbit...

182
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,880
I... I've cast the wrong spell.

183
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll do it again.

184
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,530
Three!

185
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,230
Two!

186
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,860
- One! 
 - Mengmeng!

187
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,130
- Why is there a rabbit in our house? 
 - Wow!

188
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,330
How cute is that!

189
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,850
Look at that!

190
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,890
What a cute little rabbit!

191
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,950
It looks just like you!

192
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,570
- Really? 
 - Yeah! You both got single-fold eyelid!

193
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,460
Long eyelashes, and a little bit of mustache!

194
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,480
Brother Hebo, I know you're trying to make me happy.

195
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,930
Thank you, Brother Hebo. I'm fine.

196
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,230
What happened in the past, just let it pass.

197
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,570
The most important thing is to live in the moment.

198
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,780
See, I've got your smile back with a magic trick.

199
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,640
I‘ve been too busy at the hospital these days.

200
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,110
I'll take a few days off when I'm done,

201
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,480
and we can have a honeymoon trip.

202
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,610
I have an idea,

203
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,270
Don't cook dinner tonight.

204
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,190
We can eat out. I'll come home early and we'll go together.

205
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,390
Great.

206
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,800
I'll go to work.

207
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,300
Anan.

208
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,190
You can wait for us here.

209
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,610
This should be it.

210
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,350
Is there anybody home?

211
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,040
I don't think so.

212
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,190
He's not here. Can't get through him on the phone either.

213
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,720
What do we do?

214
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,380
Are you looking for someone?

215
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,480
I'd like to ask if Chen Kang lives here.

216
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,230
You're here to collect debts from him too?

217
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,350
We're here...

218
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,610
That's exactly right! You are correct.

219
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,670
He's driven me crazy! I'm just a migrant worker.

220
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,940
I loaned all my money to Chen Kang.

221
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,230
But now I can't find him anywhere, and he's not picking up his phone.

222
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,670
This is my brother.

223
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,720
The doctor says he needs to be hospitalized right away. He can't hold it any longer.

224
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,460
See? You're so ill! Why don't you listen to me and go to the hospital!

225
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,210
No offense meant, young lady, but

226
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,240
how could you lend money to someone like Chen Kang!

227
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,440
But let me tell you the truth. To escape from his debt collectors,

228
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,420
Chen Kang doesn't really stay here.

229
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,100
He lives in the apartment that his father-in-law left him.

230
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,020
Oh. He's living in his father-in-law's place.

231
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,350
That's why!

232
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,970
Well, can you let us have the address please?

233
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,790
But... If I tell you, you should not let anybody know that I'm the one who said it.

234
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,030
OK. No problem.

235
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,630
The adress is No. 208

236
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,300
Kangfu Road, Xiqing District.

237
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,090
- OK. Shall we go there? 
 - OK.

238
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,550
Thank you, thank you. Let's go.

239
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,460
We should go right away. We shouldn't hold it up.

240
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,980
You're too unwell. Let's go.

241
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,320
Hello?

242
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,790
<i> I'm Chen Kang's neighbor upstairs. </i>

243
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,170
<i> Someone was asking about Chen Kang's address. </i>

244
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,590
A man and a woman. The woman was fair skinned,

245
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,310
and the man was quite handsome.

246
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,440
Did you give them the address?

247
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,680
Yes.

248
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,630
OK. I'll transfer the money to you.

249
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,130
Vice GM Qin.

250
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,760
Sheng Zhening and Xia Qian are on their way to find Chen Kang. Should we interfere?

251
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,350
Since Mr. Xue believes that not everything has to go through me,

252
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,980
we should give him a reminder and let him know

253
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,050
what will happen if any Evergreen related matter does not go through me.

254
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,780
I need you to do something for me.

255
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,230
Coming!

256
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,640
- Who are you? 
 - Hello.

257
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,250
Are you Mrs. Chen, the wife of Chen Kang?

258
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,050
- That's me. 
 - We're his colleagues.

259
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,180
He hasn't shown up at work since yesterday, and we couldn't get through his phone number.

260
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,470
We were worried. Is he at home?

261
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,160
I can't find him either. He hasn't been back for a long time.

262
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,500
And I don't want to have anything to do with him now.

263
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,710
Please go back.

264
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,470
Well...

265
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,130
Let's go downstairs first.

266
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,470
How did it go? Any update?

267
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,640
Nothing.

268
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,490
Maybe we should go back first,

269
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,620
and then figure out some other ways.

270
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,500
I think Chen Kang's wife is very suspicious.

271
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,070
There was a big wedding photo hanging on the wall.

272
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,720
If she didn't want anything to do with Chen Kang,

273
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,560
Why would she put the photo in such a prominent place?

274
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,330
And when she closed the door, I saw on the shoe rack

275
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,200
that there were a pair of men's shoes.

276
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,620
If Chen Kang hasn't been back for a long time, she would have put them away.

277
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,190
Why would she put them on the shoe rack?

278
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,940
That's true.

279
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,980
You're good at this, Miss Xia.

280
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,690
Maybe we should wait here. I think Chen Kang will come back.

281
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,060
OK.

282
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,870
Then you guys can wait here, I'll wait at the crossing. I'll let you know if there's any update.

283
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,850
Let's take a seat.

284
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,190
There are so many mosquitos!

285
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,960
- Hey! 
 -

286
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,890
I saw a mosquito!

287
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,340
Don't move.

288
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,000
I was not taking advantage of you.

289
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,590
I... I'm a bit hungry. I'll go get some food.

290
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,430
Waiter, check please.

291
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,140
Here's your bill.

292
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,070
The internet signal's so weak here.

293
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,170
You can use our Wi-Fi here.

294
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,120
I'll pay.

295
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,150
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

296
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,290
Why did your phone automatically connected to the Wi-Fi here?

297
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,000
Have you been here before?

298
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,060
Oh, I was here with my colleague.

299
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,280
Your colleague?

300
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,350
This place isn't close to the hospital you work at. Which colleague were you here with?

301
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,780
You didn't come here with Xia Qian, did you?

302
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,640
This place is so close to Worth or Not.

303
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,020
How could I have been here with her? You got it wrong.

304
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,740
If it's not her,

305
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,420
can you call your colleague to prove it to me?

306
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,680
I... I was here with Director Lu.

307
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,250
I don't think it's a good idea to call him just for that.

308
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,210
<i> [Director Lu] </i>

309
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,250
Hello, He.

310
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,490
Director Lu.

311
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,490
Well... Last week after we did the lecture at the university,

312
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,980
we had lunch at Xiangyu Restaurant, right?

313
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,370
<i> Yeah. And you paid for it. Anything wrong? </i>

314
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,260
No. Not really.

315
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,220
Haha, I see. Your wife's checking on you, right?

316
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,180
You were with me indeed. You can assure her.

317
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,760
OK. Thank you, Director Lu.

318
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm sorry, darling. I thought too much. I do trust you.

319
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,050
Shall we go?

320
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,550
Sure.

321
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,000
I bought some food. See if you'd like anything.

322
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,180
Why were you gone so long? I saw many food stalls by the road.

323
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,490
I thought you wouldn't eat street snacks.

324
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,070
Come with me.

325
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,410
He's back?

326
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,280
- He saw me! 
 - Stay right here!

327
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,820
Stop!

328
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,790
Chen Kang! Stop!

329
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,310
Don't run!

330
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,580
Xia Qian!

331
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,900
Are you okay?

332
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,200
- He ran away! 
 - Hey!

333
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,620
I told you to stay right there! Why did you ran?

334
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,710
Hey! I was helping you chase him!

335
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,270
Look! He's running away!

336
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,680
You're not helping at all! What if you got hit by a car?

337
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,160
Why are you yelling at me?

338
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,700
What's wrong with me trying to help?

339
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,190
And I'm not your subordinate.

340
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,660
Why do I have to listen to everything you say?

341
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,990
- I'll send you home. 
 - Leave me alone!

342
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,550
What's wrong?

343
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,740
Run!

344
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,010
I barely took a bite of the food!

345
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
Now you can run nowhere!

346
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
Hello, Anan.

347
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,630
GM Sheng. I've got Chen Kang.

348
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,930
Nobody's paying me, and nobody asked me to do it.

349
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,610
I'm just dissatisfied about Evergreen.

350
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,190
Last year I almost got a promotion,

351
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,270
and they canceled it just because I was late for work.

352
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,900
I've had enough. I just want to see you become a laughing stock.

353
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,740
Leave.

354
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,160
Do you believe in what he said?

355
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,660
He sounded so affirmative when he said

356
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,430
that nobody asked him to do so, it made me believe even more

357
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,610
that there must be someone who arranged it beforehand.

358
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,020
- Then... 
 - If that's the case, I'll have to go with it

359
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,530
and pretend to believe in him in order not to alert the enemy.

360
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,530
And we should make a management plan

361
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,270
We must strengthen the cyber security management of the hotel.

362
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,880
- I'll do it right away. 
 - Okay.

363
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,700
<i> I heard that Chen Kang was caught, and Sheng Zhening is talking to the press.</i>

364
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,930
Yeah, but don't worry about it. I've got it covered.

365
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,960
<i> Chen Kang won't say a word about it. </i>

366
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,150
<i> But Mr. Xue. I've been working for Evergreen for six years. </i>

367
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,680
Sheng Zhening's business strategy and style,

368
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,650
I believe you can't find anyone who know it better than me.

369
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,550
<i> So in the future, please leave anything related to Evergreen to me. </i>

370
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,990
OK. Thank you.

371
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,710
I should have been more careful when I dealt with it.

372
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,420
Thanks.

373
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,390
<i> [Sheng Zhening: Have you gone to bed?]</i>

374
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,230
<i> [Sheng Zhening: Have you gone to bed?]</i>

375
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,340
<i> [Sheng Zhening: I failed to retain myself today.]</i>

376

377
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,080
<i> I failed to retain myself today. I shouldn't have blamed you. I'm sorry. </i>

378
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,550
Mengmeng. What's on your mind?

379
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,460
Darling, I think this is all my fault.

380
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,710
If I didn't ask Xia Qian

381
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,100
to be my bargainer,

382
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,720
My brother and Evergreen wouldn't have gotten into trouble.

383
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,100
And the whole world wouldn't know

384
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,410
that Xia Qian is your ex-girlfriend.

385
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,420
I would never have known what happened

386
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,280
between you and her.

387
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,610
And our wedding would have gone well.

388
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,080
Mengmeng.

389
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,800
See, we've held our wedding.

390
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,340
And we're living a happy life.

391
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,660
How about going on a trip this weekend?

392
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,800
Relax yourself and get your mind out of it.

393
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,780
Darling, do you think I'm useless?

394
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,810
Of course not!

395
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,220
Don't worry. Your brother's got to have a way

396
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,270
to deal with what happened to Evergreen.

397
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,970
There, there.

398
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,750
Why are you here at my place so early in the morning?

399
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,690
I thought you were signing the contract today.

400
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,100
Yeah. Is there anything you need from me?

401
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,500
I'll drive you there.

402
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,460
You got hurt because you were trying to help Evergreen.

403
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,110
I should be responsible for that.

404
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,980
So I'll be your driver these days

405
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,140
to apologize.

406
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,030
What? You didn't say it loud enough, I didn't hear it.

407
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,420
I was very rude yesterday. I'm sorry.

408
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,560
Well, I wouldn't be pissed off just because of something so trivial.

409
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,560
And I was a bit too impulsive yesterday, too.

410
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,900
I know that you've been bothered a lot these days because of Ning Meng.

411
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,220
In the future, if there's anything I can help with, just speak up.

412
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,090
I'm not bothered. It's my job.

413
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,820
Thank you so much for saying that. But having GM Sheng as my driver,

414
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,070
that's too much of a privilege for me.

415
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,670
You don't have to do this. I'll go inside.

416
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,820
He's so nice to you. Why did you refuse?

417
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,400
Now that Ning Meng's contract is over,

418
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,620
I have nothing else to do with Sheng Zhening. There's no need to get too close.

419
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,160
I thought you two can have a little spark of love

420
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,740
after you've been working together these days.

421
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,720
With Sheng Zhening?

422
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,990
Right? You do!

423
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,160
It's impossible.

424
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,750
How is that impossible?

425
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,250
The hero and heroine of romance dramas all have a love-hate relationship.

426
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,790
Just like you and GM Sheng.

427
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,120
Have you been watching too many dramas these days?

428
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,590
I actually ship you guys.

429
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,490
Ship us? You like it?

430
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,390
Can you stop mixing TV dramas with reality?

431
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,120
Sheng Zhening and I... I've never thought about it.

432
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,260
We're living in two different worlds.

433
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,080
We have different personalities, work environments, and ideas. Everything's different.

434
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,090
Fate was off its track for a while, but now it's back on track.

435
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,160
We've got a trouble! We've got a trouble!

436
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,150
- What's wrong? 
 - Evergreen's got into trouble.

437
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,680
<i> My wife and I were planning to get married at Evergreen Hotel on May 8th,</i>

438
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,190
<i> we paid the deposit, but then it was canceled. </i>

439
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,590
<i> That date was given to the sister of Evergreen's GM. </i>

440
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,520
<i> The wedding was very important to my wife. </i>

441
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,760
<i> They sacrificed their customer's right in order to host a wedding event for their family.</i>

442
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,860
<i> We must get it back. </i>

443
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,920
Han Chao is lying.

444
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,930
Of course! He agreed to transfer the reservation himself.

445
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,330
What do we do now? It's got something to do with us too.

446
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,460
The PR department is dealing with it, but the video online is still going viral.

447
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,620
And there were a lot of negative comments about Evergreen.

448
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,390
Find Han Chao's reservation transfer agreement.

449
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,030
OK.

450
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,460
Look for Han Chao's reservation transfer agreement.

451
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,850
The agreement is missing.

452
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,410
We've dealt with the agreement and left no evidence.

453
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,290
She Zhening can't explain for himself.

454
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,690
This incident won't have a huge impact on Evergreen judging from its nature.

455
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,890
But we still have to make a fuss.

456
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,700
Don't let the topic cool down.

457
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,420
Mr Yu has always been hesitant,

458
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,960
and if he sees all these negative comments about Evergreen, he'll definitely hesitate.

459
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,660
Ask Mr. Xue to talk to him soon

460
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,940
and see if there's any possibility of transferring the shares.

461
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,830
OK.

462
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,800
Anything you need me to do on Evergreen's side?
