00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,080
Your luggage.

5
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,540
Thank you, Assistant An.

6
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,490
You're welcome.

7
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,080
By the way, can you tell me which room GM Sheng is staying in?

8
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,760
It would be a lot more convenient for work so we can communicate.

9
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,590
GM Sheng is in room 09, at the end of the hallway.

10
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,390
But, Miss Xia, GM Sheng likes it quiet.

11
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,600
He doesn't like to be disturbed. If you need anything, you can just contact me.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,450
I understand.

13
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,730
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing, it's just a cold.

14
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,860
- Then, I won't bother you anymore 
 - Okay.

15
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,630
What information do you have on Qin Hebo?

16
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,020
Qin Hebo, 41 years old, single. It is that he is very strict with his subordinates.

17
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,440
Very serious and mysterious.

18
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,560
That's it? Are you kidding me?

19
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,280
I really couldn't find anything else.

20
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,810
How am I supposed to find him with that information?

21
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,730
I still need to wash two big plates of potatoes.

22
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,260
I will leave first. Bye bye.

23
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,200
Good luck.

24
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,990
41 years old, single...

25
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,100
Hey, a kitten.

26
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,880
Where did this kitten come from?

27
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,830
What is your name, little kitten?

28
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,960
Who's your owner? Are you hungry?

29
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,460
Is this your cat?

30
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,820
Our hotel has a rule that the employees are not allowed to keep any pets.

31
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,950
You know that, don't you?

32
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,490
So you don't know who I am?

33
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,510
I don't.

34
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,330
Then can you keep this secret for me?

35
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,290
I think it's possible.

36
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,920
But, I have a request.

37
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,380
A request?

38
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,620
In the future, can I come pet the cat?

39
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,830
Don't worry, I won't come just to pet it,

40
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,420
I can also bring it food.

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,650
Okay.

42
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,860
This should be a tabby cat, right?

43
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,140
When I found it, it was really sick.

44
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,390
It must have gotten sick after being abandoned by its owner.

45
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,110
Then it must have cost quite a bit to take it to the vet..

46
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,400
Money isn't important, after all it is a life.

47
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,320
Little cat, you should thank this nice man.

48
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,210
He saved you. You are quite kind.

49
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,970
This is the first time someone has calls me kind.

50
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,990
Why? That means they don't understand you.

51
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,590
I think you are a good person.

52
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,290
You haven't know me for very long, how can you say that I am a good person?

53
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,330
What does a person being good or bad have to do with how long you've known them?

54
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,470
Instead you should base it upon intuition, my intuition is very accurate.

55
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,630
If your intuition is that accurate,

56
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,320
then guess what I do at the company.

57
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,060
You are a driver, right?

58
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,700
Driver? Yes, how did you know?

59
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,460
The suit and your hair gel.

60
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,450
If you aren't a boss, then you are a driver.

61
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,340
A boss wouldn't be on the roof sneaking around feeding a kittens, right?

62
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,160
Yes, that's quite accurate.

63
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,790
My intuition.

64
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,060
I haven't introduced myself. I'm Fu Shuangshuang.

65
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,730
What about you?

66
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,600
My last name is Qin.

67
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,630
Like the Vice General Manager?
Yes.

68
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,100
It is a shame that one rides cars

69
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,470
and the other drives cars.

70
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,300
That's why they say God is unfair.

71
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,430
It's okay. You are such a good person.

72
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,170
Right. They will be taking roll, I'll be late.

73
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,790
I need to go, bye bye!

74

75
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,330

76
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,330
How are things going with Sheng Zhening?

77
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,640
I just got settled in last night.

78
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,610
They gave me a pretty big room.

79
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,590
In terms of work, I mainly communicate with Assistant An.

80
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,500
I think... Sheng Zhening is not very approachable.

81
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,590
He's your largest client now.

82
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,430
<i>It's normal for you to take the initiative a little bit. Don't always talk about work stuff.</i>

83
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,980
Fu Shuangshuang, whose friend are you? You are asking me to take initiative?

84
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,820
<i>For example, take initiative and bring him food or ask for advice relating to work.</i>

85
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,300
<i> Things between you two will then naturally become closer.</i>

86
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,590
Will that really work?

87
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,200
Just try it. I need to go now, let's talk later.

88
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,430
Me take the initiative?

89
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,100
<i>I can't take the initiative.</i>

90
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,290

Miss Xia

92
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,330
- Hello 
 - Are you looking for GM Sheng?

93
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,700
Yes, I prepared some fruits

94
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,230
and wanted to deliver it to GM Sheng.

95
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,280
Our GM left for a meeting, he may not come back until later.

96
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,630
Oh, is that so. That's perfect,

97
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,670
I can just drop it off.

98
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,460
Why don't you give it to me? When he comes back, I will deliver it to him.

99
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,960
Sure.

100
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,830
- Sure. Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

101
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,660
I met a driver today

102
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,050
I may be able to learn more about Qin Hebo from him.

103
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,610
What did you learn?

104
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,480
- Nothing 
 - Don't stop!

105

Here, here, here.

106
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,930
Do you think Sheng Zhening will give her a hard time now that she is with him?

107
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,260
Qianqian is very experienced. To her, Sheng Zhening is a small case.

108
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,880
Instead of worrying about her,

109
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,890
you should be figuring out how to do the guest list for the wedding in May.

110
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,290
It's been ten minutes, come on.

111
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,190
Over here, hurry up.

112
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,740
Oh no, my blankets are still outside drying. I saw that the weather report said it's going to hail.

113
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,510
I have to hurry home and take in my blankets.

114
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,260
My shoulders.

115
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,050
Here's the information about some of our company's medium and high-end car models,

116
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,280

 - No need.

I hope you can focus your time and energy on the car purchasing assignment.

Has Anan told you that our company has a standard for the performance of the cars?

No.

125

Okay.

I don't mean to blame you, but why did you drink so much alcohol

when you knew you had  a fever? That'll make you feel worse for sure.

I'll put the cooling patches in the fridge. Don't forget to change it.

but I assume he can eat dinner all by himself?

Then... just a few things to let you know.

176
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,720
I've asked the waiter to take your clothes away to be dry cleaned. They'll send it back to you tomorrow.

177
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,080
I've bought some snacks and put them in the fridge.

178
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,940
You can eat them if you're hungry. And there's fresh orange juice too.

179
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,060
The juice is rich in vitamin C and you should drink more.

180
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,540
And the cooling patches. I put them on your bedstand. Don't forget to change them.

181
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,390
Okay?

182
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,190
Thank you so much for doing all this, Miss Xia.

183
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,050
No problem at all.

184
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,720
If there's nothing else, I'll leave you to enjoy your dinner.

185
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,380
Okay.

186
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,890
Miss Xia.

187
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,660
What is it?

188
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,860
Can I... ask you for a favor?

189
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,260
I'm sure it's something I can help with. Go ahead.

190
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,160
Can you help look after GM Sheng for a while for me?

191
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,620
GM Sheng is so finicky. Are you sure I can handle it?

192
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,960
No problem at all.

193
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,920
I'll tell you about what to keep in mind. I'm sure you'll be fine.

194
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,290
I don't mind doing it. But what if GM Sheng is not happy?

195
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,630
We'll tell him later. I'll deal with what comes afterwards.

196
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,730
Cool. That sounds like a plan.

197
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,060
That's great! If you become Sheng Zhening's assistant,

198
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,280
You'll have more opportunities to approach him.

199
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,960
Of course!

200
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,900
That's what I thought, and that's why I agreed.

201
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Don't be impatient. Take it slow.

202
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,690
Will do.

203
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,120
How should I iron it?

204
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,990
Anan, are you feeling better?

205
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,690
It's me.

206
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,760
Right, I've prepared breakfast for you.

207
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,720
Anan said that you only have coffee and don't eat anything for breakfast.

208
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,070
But that's not good for your stomach.

209
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,600
I've prepared some warm milk and fried eggs for you.

210
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,130
It's over there.

211
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,650
<i> [GM Sheng]</i>

212
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,230
- Hello, GM Sheng. 
 - Hello?

213
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,460
Why is she in my room?

214
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,720
<i> The doctor says I have a bad flu.</i>

215
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,950
I'm afraid I won't be able to look after you this week.

216
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,990
<i> But you must have an assistant by your side. </i>

217
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,030
<i> So I've asked Miss Xia to fill in for me. </i>

218
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,720
<i> She's very considerate. I'm sure she'll take good care of you. </i>

219
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,320
You know that I don't like strangers in my room.

220
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,790
<i> Miss Xia is not a stranger, is she? </i>

221
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,170
GM Sheng, I'm getting a headache again. I need to take some medicine.

222
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,990
I'm hanging up.

223
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,560
GM Sheng, I've ironed the collar, sleeves

224
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,270
and the placket of your shirt.

225
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,360
I can assure you that there are no wrinkles left.

226
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,190
And I've wiped the table with disinfectant.

227
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,930
I've also wiped the green leaves on your table with clean water. Report over.

228
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,290
I got it.

229
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,760
Why aren't you eating?

230
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,100
Is it because it's too hot today?

231
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,640
Hey, do you happen to know the driver

232
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,690
of Qin Hebo, the vice general manager?

233
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,630
Yes.

234
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,360
Can you introduce us to each other? I want to meet him.

235
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,150
I think you're trying to meet

236
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,750
Qin Hebo instead of his driver.

237
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,260
You've been fishing for information on Qin Hebo's.

238
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,950
Are you plotting anything against him?

239
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,520
I'm just a cleaning lady. How can I be plotting against him?

240
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,020
Then why do you care about him so much?

241
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,870
What, does he owe you money?

242
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,890
I mean, he's a Vice General Manager, I don't think he would do that

243
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,520
I'll tell you the truth.

244
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,240
What Qin Hebo owes me...

245
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,230
is a debt of love.

246
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,090
A debt of love?

247
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,590
It was my first day

248
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,690
working in this hotel. I wasn't skilled at my work,

249
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,120
so the headwaiter asked me to do the night shift as a punishment.

250
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,630
I was cleaning the corridor,

251
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,770
and when I was about to enter the last room,

252
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,550
I saw Vice GM Qin suddenly appear in the elevator.

253
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,960
<i> What are you doing?</i>

254
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,470
<i> Hello, Vice GM Qin. I've got the night shift today.</i>

255
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,160
<i> I've got a night shift as well.</i>

256
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,730
<i> Hey, come to work with me.</i>

257
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,410
<i> Wait, no, no. I can't. I'm really on a night shift.</i>

258
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,740
<i> - No... wait... 
- I'm on a night shift too.</i>

259
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,540
<i> I've got cleaning to do. Hey, wait. No.</i>

260
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,840
<i> I can't. I've got cleaning to do!</i>

261
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,370
<i> Please don't... Help!</i>

262
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,700
So he grabbed my arm and dragged me into his office.

263
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,760
After he dragged me into his office,

264
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,240
he took out a bottle of liquor all of a sudden.

265
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,260
<i> Why... why are you crying?</i>

266
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,190
<i> Pour me some liquor.</i>

267
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,760
<i> Go on.  More. More.</i>

268
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,760
<i> That one is for you.</i>

269
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,410
<i> Cheers.</i>

270
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,870
It was late into the night,  and we were alone in the room

271
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,770
I was so scared!

272
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,070
But then I realized

273
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,560
that he was already drunk;. He'd pass out after drinking more,

274
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,270
I can run away after he loses his consciousness.

275
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,140
So I drank some liquor with him.

276
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,410
As a result, he started to

277
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,480
confess his feelings to me.

278
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,890
He cried and laughed.

279
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,580
It made me realize that

280
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,800
he's just as lonely and empty just like the rest of us.

281
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,420
The liquor couldn't intoxicate him, but he intoxicated him with his feelings.

282
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,320
Then...what happens afterwards?

283
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,100
Then...

284
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,150
<i> Help me...take off the jacket.</i>

285
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,050
<i> Oh my.</i>

286
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,710
<i> Pour some liquor for me.</i>

287
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,160
<i> Let's do a cross-cup cheer.</i>

288
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,990
What happened afterwards was horrible.

289
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,120
- It was just horrible. 
 - Sounds horrible indeed.

290
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,620
Then the next morning I realized, oh my gosh,

291
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,430
I've made a big mistake.

292
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,180
But Qin said to me

293
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,000
that it was just a beautiful misunderstanding.

294
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,780
It sounds like a terrible misunderstanding to me!

295
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,290
Anyway, this Qin sounds like a playboy.

296
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,870
It's exactly the fact that he's a heartless playboy

297
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,570
that made it difficult for me to move on.

298
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,780
So you've beenaking around for his whereabouts

299
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,110
- just because you want an answer?  
 - Yes.

300
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,740
Hello?

301
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,090
Okay. I'll be right there.

302
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,070
As drivers, we work in shifts.

303
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,500
Next time if I get to drive for Qin Hebo, I'll give him a bumpy ride for sure

304
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,400
and take revenge for you.

305
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,980
Foolish!

306
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,180
Foolish!

307
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,050
How silly is she!

308
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,510
I can't help laughing.

309
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,700
<i> [Sheng Zhening] </i>

310
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,140
Help me look into a cleaner girl named Fu Shuangshuang in the Housekeeping Department.

311
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,950
Is something wrong with her?

312
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,080
Do you like the food?

313
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,170
- Hello? 
 - Shuangshuang.

314
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,700
Are you making any progress over there?

315
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,180
Mu Xiaoyan's headwaiter has given him a lot of work.

316
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,250
<i> I'm doing pretty well, </i>

317
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,610
<i> it's just that we haven't made any progress with the guest  list yet. </i>

318
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,850
I'm making some progress over here.

319
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,630
I've become Sheng Zhening's assistant, and I have access to his laptop now.

320
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,660
But there's a password to it.

321
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,700
I can't unlock it. I can't get the file in it.

322
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,940
What? The password...

323
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,820
I think people like to use their birthdays or important anniversaries for their passwords,

324
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,930
<i> or stuff they like. </i>

325
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,850
<i> Why don't you try with those? </i>

326
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,350
<i> You might get it right. </i>

327
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,260
- I think you're right. 
 <i> - Okay. </i>

328
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,270
Little kitten.

329
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,730
How do I get it?

330
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,060
Are you feeling better?

331
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,690
- Much better. 
 - That's good.

332
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,880
Miss Xia.

333
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,350
You're not just looking after GM Sheng, but also me.

334
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,770
You're working quite hard. Thank you so much.

335
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,470
Why are you thanking me? We're friends.

336
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,110
We should take care of each other.

337
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
Mr. Anan

338
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,140
To better look after GM Sheng,

339
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,070
I have some questions for you that I must ask.

340
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,210
Sure. Go ahead.

341
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,160
Tell me, when is GM Sheng's birthday?

342
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,850
September 6th. He's a Virgo.

No.

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,030
I'm serious. You know Miss Xia has been asking a lot of questions about you.

408
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,830
She said it would be helpful to being a good assistant.

409
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,120
But the questions had nothing to do with taking care of you.

410
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,440
They sound like questions that your admirer would ask.

411
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,460
And she asked about your room number when we first arrived.

421
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,240

422
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,940
