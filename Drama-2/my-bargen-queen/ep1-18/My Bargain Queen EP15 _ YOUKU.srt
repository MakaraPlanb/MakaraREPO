00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,960
Do you see that?

196
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,470
Worth Or Not.

197
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
My boss lives here.

198
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,110
I'm here to send something to my boss.

199
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,150
Don't be ridiculous.

200
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,280
Our Sister Qian lives here.

201
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,280
Your Sister Qian?

202
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

203
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,670
You shouldn't call her that.

204
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,110
I think Miss Xia

205
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,440
is Mr. Sheng's girlfriend now.

206
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,590
What?

207
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,470
Iceland.

208
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,000
Maldives.

209
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,680
Hokkaido.

210
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,280
Where do you want to go?

211
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,109
Isn't it normal
that he can't change the habit

212
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,279
he had been developing for years?

213
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,039
It can easily hurt his pride

214
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,040
to blame him angrily.

215
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,350
It's more likely to hurt your relationship.

216
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,880
All of them.

217
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,760
These places are all great.

218
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,830
But I've been too busy at work.

219
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,190
I really don't have time.

220
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,070
Let's talk about traveling later.

221
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,470
You don't have to worry about work.

222
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,640
I have finished the report

223
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,280
and sent it to the client for confirmation.

224
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,470
They'll pay the final payment tomorrow.

225
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,830
Mu Xiaoyan and the others

226
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,280
will finish the rest of the work.

227
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,160
So,

228
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,110
where do you want to go?

229
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,880
I...

230
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,400
I want to go to the amusement park.

231
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,880
The amusement park?

232
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,800
There is an amusement park near our home.

233
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,680
I really want to go there.

234
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,590
Okay.

235
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's go to the amusement park tomorrow.

236
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,110
Tomorrow?

237
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,830
Hold on.

238
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,590
It's the peak season now.

239
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,560
Tickets are 30% more expensive than usual,

240
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,000
and there are too many people.

241
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,310
Even we go,

242
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,400
there aren't many facilities we can play.

243
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,430
It's not worth it.

244
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,190
Let's wait for a few days.

245
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,400
Honey, you're back.

246
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,190
Honey.

247
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,190
I prepared a lot of

248
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,710
your favorite fruit.

249
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,560
Have some.

250
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,470
No.

251
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,310
Just have some.

252
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,520
Meng.

253
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,830
Sit down.

254
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,920
I want to talk to you.

255
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,920
What's wrong?

256
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,430
Well,

257
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,470
I don't want you to go to
my hospital too often.

258
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,760
I think it's my workplace.

259
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,070
I don't want my colleagues

260
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,640
to think of me as someone who

261
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,520
mixes my life with my work.

262
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,040
I just want to take care of you.

263
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,160
Am I wrong?

264
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

265
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,760
Meng, you are not wrong.

266
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,070
But you send me food every day

267
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,000
and you give cakes to the nurses.

268
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,310
It will affect our working relationships.

269
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,310
And also,

270
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,430
you sent flowers to my office that day.

271
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,470
You know,

272
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,160
if any patient is allergic to flowers

273
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,230
or has an emotional reaction to flowers,

274
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,230
it'll be my dereliction of duty as a doctor.

275
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,800
Sorry.

276
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,310
I didn't think so much about it.

277
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,760
Meng, I know.

278
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,800
If you want me to stay with you,

279
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,640
I can get off work earlier.

280
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,160
I can pick you up,

281
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,880
and we can eat out.

282
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,230
Or we can buy something and cook at home.

283
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,710
Then we can go to see a movie

284
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,590
and go shopping.

285
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,470
Whatever you want.

286
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,280
Honey.

287
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,830
Do you not love me anymore?

288
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
How come?

289
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,190
Do you think I'm annoying?

290
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,560
Meng.

291
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,470
Then why are you making so many excuses

292
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,830
to stop me from going to the hospital?

293
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you fall in love with someone else?

294
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,280
Is it that beautiful nurse, Xiaotong?

295
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,760
No. It has nothing to do with Xiaotong.

296
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,190
Is there any new nurse?

297
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,560
Meng.

298
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't be such a baby, okay?

299
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Why do you always think of others

300
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,640
as imaginary enemies?

301
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,310
I told you,

302
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,470
we are just colleagues.

303
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,950
Stop filling your head with
these foolish thoughts.

304
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,640
At first,

305
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,520
I did go to

306
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,920
the hospital

307
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,680
just to bring you food.

308
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,880
But I saw those nurses

309
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,760
spend more time with you every day

310
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,800
than I do,

311
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,160
I got scared.

312
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,430
I'm afraid you will be taken away from me.

313
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,680
Meng.

314
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,680
Meng.

315
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,430
I am not an object.

316
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,710
It's not like they can take me away from you

317
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,710
as they want.

318
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,110
I love you.

319
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,830
I will always be by your side.

320
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,230
No one can take me away from you.

321
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,310
But I am...

322
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,230
There's no but.

323
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,160
Meng.

324
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,640
Xiaotong was transferred away.

325
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,430
You are not behind this, right?

326
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,040
I really didn't.

327
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
I really didn't

328
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,400
ask the president to transfer Xiaotong away.

329
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,830
Meng.

330
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,680
How do you know

331
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,230
it's the president who transferred her away?

332
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,040
Because the president
did come to the cake shop,

333
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,430
and I told him

334
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,430
that I think Xiaotong likes you.

335
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,430
But I really didn't

336
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,710
ask the president to transfer her away.

337
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,950
I believe you.

338
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,070
But,

339
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,430
I'm afraid my colleagues in the hospital
would get the wrong idea.

340
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,880
Well, Meng.

341
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,160
Come to the hospital with me tomorrow.

342
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,800
Why are you still drinking?

343
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,760
Stop drinking.

344
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,110
You get drunk too easily.

345
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,950
It's your fault.

346
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,350
You helped Sheng Zhening
to take away my girlfriend from me.

347
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,800
Give my girlfriend back to me.

348
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,590
Give my girlfriend back to me.

349
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,190
Give Qian back to me.

350
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,400
Where can I get you a girlfriend?

351
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,350
Wake up.

352
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,280
[The Man
The surveillance camera has been installed.]

353
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
The surveillance camera has been installed.

354
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,310
You can watch the live video

355
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,830
on TP-LINK.

356
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,920
I want to see the cat,

357
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,070
not the person.

358
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,040
You're awake.

359
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,470
Why are you in my house?

360
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,950
It's my house

361
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,070
Why am I in your house?

362
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,880
Where are my clothes?

363
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,280
I washed them.

364
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,280
You got drunk yesterday and threw up.

365
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,160
I can't leave you on the street.

366
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,040
Put them on

367
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,070
and come have breakfast.

368
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,110
I have to go to work later.

369
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,400
Go ahead and eat.

370
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,560
Have some milk

371
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,400
in case you have a stomach ache.

372
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,760
Thanks.

373
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,920
Your clothes are on the balcony.

374
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,190
Collect them when they're dry.

375
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,190
Thanks.

376
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,110
What's wrong with your neck?

377
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,040
Someone got drunk yesterday

378
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,920
and grabbed my collar tightly,

379
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,880
asking me to give back
his girlfriend in tears.

380
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,830
I got drunk yesterday.

381
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,880
Sorry.

382
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,520
It's okay.

383
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,520
I've read it.

384
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,430
Take it back.

385
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,800
You don't need it anymore?

386
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,760
Okay.

387
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,830
If you fall for another girl again,

388
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,430
just tell me.

389
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,920
I'll help you get her.

390
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,070
You'll help me?

391
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,350
What's wrong?

392
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,640
My dating skills are much better than yours.

393
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,040
I've read the 36 books on the art of love.

394
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,400
Do you think

395
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,640
I need your help?

396
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,110
Since Mr. Sheng and Xia Qian

397
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,040
started dating,

398
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
I've been reading at least three books
about love every day.

399
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,920
Till now,

400
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,560
I have read at least 180 books.

401
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
You started to prepare at the last moment.

402
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,230
Better late than never.

403
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,560
You...

404
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,920
Aunt.

405
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,590
Xia Qian asked me to send you
the rheumatic stickers.

406
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,710
Okay, put them there.

407
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,230
Okay.

408
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,430
Have a seat.

409
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,040
Leave it alone.

410
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,680
I'll do it later.

411
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,470
It's okay.

412
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,680
Drink

413
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
whatever you want.

414
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,350
Okay.

415
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,880
Sister, are you busy?

416
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,680
What a special guest.

417
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,400
What brought you here?

418
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,800
I miss you.

419
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,430
You are so busy.

420
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,350
Come on.

421
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,160
Let me tell you a good news.

422
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,160
Ting is getting married.

423
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,830
That's great.

424
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,160
Congratulations.

425
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,800
Thanks.

426
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,560
Is it still the guy from her college?

427
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
She split up with that poor boy
a long time ago.

428
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,110
Ting's boyfriend

429
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,880
is an executive

430
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,800
who has a house and a car in the city.

431
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,040
Finally, I don't

432
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,830
need to worry about Ting anymore.

433
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,470
It's good. It's good.

434
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,560
Qian won't

435
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,640
just settle with
that little assistant, right?

436
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,830
Sheng is good.

437
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,160
What's good about him?

438
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
As the saying goes,

439
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,760
man struggles upwards,

440
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,680
water flows downwards.

441
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,880
Qian can't just find

442
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,950
an assistant to be her boyfriend.

443
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,880
I don't expect Xia Qian
to be rich and wealthy,

444
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,000
I just hope

445
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,950
she can live a peaceful life.

446
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,760
Nothing goes well for a destitute couple.

447
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,160
Yes.

448
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,640
Sister.

449
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,800
You will understand it one day.

450
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,400
Yeah, yeah.

451
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
I should leave.

452
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,920
- Come to visit us.
- By the way,

453
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,760
I will take Ting and her boyfriend here

454
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,430
for dinner tonight.

455
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,110
Cook a few dishes.

456
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,950
Just a casual dinner.

457
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,400
You can meet my son-in-law.

458
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,040
Okay, take care.

459
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,920
Just leave it there.

460
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,520
Aunt, are you okay?

461
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
I guess I've been standing for too long.

462
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,230
No big deal.

463
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,950
Don't make dinner tonight.

464
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,640
Let's eat out.

465
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,230
Okay.

466
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,760
The hotel is good.

467
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,040
Why didn't you hold your wedding here?

468
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,800
Mom.

469
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
Do you know how much it takes

470
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,190
to hold a wedding at Evergreen?

471
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,160
Let me put it this way,

472
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,680
even you have the money now,
you still can't book it.

473
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,160
It's all booked up this year.

474
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,190
How much money

475
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,000
does the hotel owner earn in a month?

476
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,110
Isn't it just a casual dinner?

477
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,040
Why do you have to take us to Evergreen?

478
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,800
I'm familiar to this place.

479
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,560
Look.

480
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,350
Just cook something at home.

481
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,000
Why are you so generous?

482
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,640
The young people have no idea to save money.

483
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,520
Yes, Aunt.

484
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,040
We don't save money.

485
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,160
Since you care about us so much,

486
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,560
why don't you ask my cousin
to pay for dinner?

487
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,070
Look at you.

488
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,710
How can the host

489
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,350
ask the guest to pay the pill?

490
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,350
Xia Qian.

491
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Go ahead and eat.

492
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,310
Here are all the dishes.

493
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,110
Please enjoy.

494
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,070
- Thank you.
- Thank you

495
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,040
Why did you order so many dishes?

496
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,590
Wei.

497
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,950
Manager.

498
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,040
I heard that Mr. Sheng is eating inside.

499
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,560
Yes.

500
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,110
I saw Mr. Sheng in there.

501
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,350
Are you sure it's him?

502
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
It can't be wrong.

503
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,950
Who are those people he treats to dinner?

504
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,070
I don't know.

505
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,310
Anyway, whoever eats with Mr. Sheng

506
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,350
is definitely important.

507
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,230
Go to work.

508
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,640
Okay.

509
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:30,920
Sheng.

510
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,160
I'm straightforward.

511
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,880
Don't take it personally.

512
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,310
Men

513
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,310
should be self-motivated.

514
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,710
You can't just

515
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,880
work at Qian's company

516
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,110
to be her assistant.

517
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,110
Chen,

518
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,310
is your company still hiring?

519
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,040
Recommend your cousin.

520
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,110
Go ahead.

521
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,760
So which school did you graduate from?

522
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,830
Our company

523
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,640
only hires 985 and 211 college graduates.

524
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,880
Don't bother.

525
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,280
It's no trouble at all. We are family.

526
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,230
Well, sheng,

527
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,160
which school did you graduate from?

528
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,880
I studied abroad.

529
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,760
A returnee?

530
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,830
I heard that

531
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,190
the universities abroad

532
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,110
are fun for the Chinese.

533
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,470
I think the diploma there

534
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,350
is not as good as
the second-tier universities here.

535
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,760
Right?

536
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,470
Aunt.

537
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,310
Actually, he...

538
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,000
Can't you just eat?

539
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,470
Sister.

540
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,830
I'm just asking.

541
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,640
There are so many delicious foods, just eat.

542
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,470
Excuse me.

543
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,310
No need.

544
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,230
We are family.

545
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,160
We don't need to drink.

546
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,280
This is specially prepared for
Mr. Sheng

547
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,430
and his distinguished guests.

548
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,470
Mr...

549
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,560
Mr. Sheng.

550
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,520
Mr. Sheng?

551
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,710
Is it okay?

552
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,590
Okay.

553
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,880
He is Mr. Sheng?

554
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,830
Who is he?

555
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,520
Sister.

556
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
You are so lucky.

557
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,350
Look how great your son-in-law is.

558
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,710
Sheng.

559
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,830
Qian's cousin has been

560
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,190
thinking about changing her job.

561
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,470
Is Evergreen

562
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,310
hiring any manager?

563
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,350
You can recommend your cousin.

564
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,520
Sheng has resigned from Evergreen.

565
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,520
He is Xia Qian's assistant now.

566
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,070
I think the dinner is finished.

567
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,880
Let's go.

568
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,040
We won't be able to catch the bus later.

569
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,280
Aunt.

570
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,160
I'll send you back.

571
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,310
Sister.

572
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,520
Are you leaving now?

573
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,590
