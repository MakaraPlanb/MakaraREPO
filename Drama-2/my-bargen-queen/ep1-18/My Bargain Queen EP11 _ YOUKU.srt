[My Bargain Queen]

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,520
[Worth Or Not]

4
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,457
[Are you busy lately? You haven't been home.]

5
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,160
[I fed the cat for you. Don't worry.]

6
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,880
Shuang.

7
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,720
I feel something is wrong

8
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,270
with Qian today.

9
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,520
Nothing strange.

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Why are you hiding your phone?

11
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,600
No.

12
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,720
Are you in love?

13
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,630
No.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,190
I'm busy with work.

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,270
Really?

17
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,030
Don't bother me.

18
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,670
Mind your own business.

19
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,190
Do you loaf on the job
when Qian is out?

20
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,910
I am going to tell her.

21
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,910
All right.

22
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,600
I will record it.

23
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,800
Didn't you sleep at Miss Xia's house
last night?

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
What happened to your forehead?

25
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,000
The budget has seriously overrun.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,520
I will ask the Procurement Dept.

27
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,670
to make a new budget.

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,160
Brother.

29
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Where are you living now?

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,390
I want to see you.

31
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,030
I didn't see you the last time

32
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,600
I went to Evergreen Hotel.

33
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,110
I also failed

34
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,670
to help with the renovation

35
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,000
of the Building No.2.

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,800
Meng.

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,670
You don't need to worry about me.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,750
It's very convenient for me

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,520
to live in a friend's house now.

40
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,960
Take care of yourself.

41
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,470
I'm going to have a meeting.

42
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,440
I will talk to you later.

43
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,960
Okay, take care of yourself.

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Meng.

45
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,360
Zhijun.

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,110
Why do you prepare so many fruits?

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,880
I prepared

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,240
everything you like.

49
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,270
Take a try.

50
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,000
But I have eaten it in the hospital.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,910
But I prepared for a long time.

52
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,360
Just take a try.

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,910
Have a kiwi first.

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,470
So sweet.

55
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,200
Zhijun.

56
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,550
I always want to help.

57
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,480
But no one seems to need me.

58
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,320
Meng, come here.

59
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,790
It is bad for your health

60
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,790
to think so much every day.

61
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,070
Would you like
to find something you like

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,390
or find a job?

63
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,790
When your life is fulfilled,

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,070
you won't think about it.

65
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,790
Sheng Zhening.

66
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,230
Hurry up and take a shower.

67
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
I will take a shower after you.

68
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,040
Got it.

69
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,040
Two yuan off

70
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,390
for the floor.

71
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
How about wood?

72
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,110
I can only cut down the price
by 50 cents at most.

73
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,790
All right.

74
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,320
A discount will do.

75
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,880
Every penny counts.

76
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,350
Shuangshuang.

77
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,510
You and Mu Xiaoyan

78
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,200
should go to learn about
the wall paint tomorrow.

79
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,230
See how much discount is available.

80
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

81
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,950
All right, I have to go.

82
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,640
Although we have done

83
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,200
cases of  decoration materials,

84
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,510
the cases of mine

85
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,950
are at most two or three million.

86
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,480
I have never done a case

87
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,390
of tens of millions like this.

88
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,480
I am totally uncertain.

89
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,350
Essentially there is no difference.

90
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,390
It's just that the scale is larger.

91
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,390
The larger the quantity,

92
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,920
the more room for bargaining.

93
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,830
This is easier to operate

94
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,950
than those small cases.

95
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,640
It makes sense, but…

96
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,510
Stop being humble.

97
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
You did a good job

98
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,040
in the car group buying case.

99
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,230
Right, Miss Xia.

100
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,640
Just take it.

101
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,830
Did you take it?

102
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,480
What's your decision?

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Such a big project.

104
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Right!

105
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,640
What can I do?

106
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,670
- Didn't you take it?
- Didn't you take it?

107
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,550
Look how anxious you are.

108
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,320
Such a big project.

109
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,150
So much money.

110
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,320
How could I not take it?

111
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,790
We would make a fortune!

112
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,400
We would make a fortune!

113
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Listen!

114
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,550
Stop all the cases

115
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,200
we are holding now.

116
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
Our main focus is

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,790
on the decoration
of Evergreen's Building No.2.

118
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,840
Copy that.

119
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
I think

120
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,440
we have a very close relationship

121
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,230
with Evergreen recently.

122
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,200
Although the previous case

123
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
was full of crises,

124
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
in the end we still made a fortune.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Good things are a long time in coming.

126
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,840
We have money!

127
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,710
It's your treat.

128
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,910
I am leaving.

129
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you sure he signed to

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,790
that bargaining company of Worth Or Not?

131
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,840
Yes.

132
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,080
They have signed the contract.

133
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,200
Fu Shuangshuang is from

134
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
Worth Or Not, right?

135
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,150
Can we take advantage of her?

136
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,590
I have my own arrangements.

137
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,910
Leave me.

138
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,350
Okay.

139
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,670
Are you busy lately?

140
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
You haven't been home.

141
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,710
I fed the cat for you.

142
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,960
Don't worry.

143
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,800
[Qin Hebo: I am just back from a business trip.
Thank you for take caring of the kitten these days.]

144
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,350
I am just back from a business trip.

145
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you for take caring
of the kitten these days.

146
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,080
You can't keep a cat like this.

147
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,910
If you do care about it…

148
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,590
You are welcome.

149
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,280
You are so indifferent

150
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,280
because I didn't reply
to your messages in time,

151
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,960
and you are angry?

152
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,150
You are so indifferent

153
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,960
because I didn't reply
to your messages in time,

154
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,790
and you are angry?

155
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,470
No.

156
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,550
Then you must be angry.

157
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,000
Let me make up.

158
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm not angry.

159
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,760
You don't have to compensate.

160
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,080
I am going to sleep.

161
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,350
What's that?

162
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,670
You seem to be happy.

163
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,670
I am asking you.

164
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,670
I'm counting money.

165
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,840
No wonder you are so happy.

166
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,230
What is your budget for wood flooring?

167
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,400
I made a price list.

168
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,150
Take a look.

169
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,590
It's okay.

170
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,590
Did you take a closer look?

171
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,760
Why are you here?

172
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,080
I happened to be passing by,

173
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,150
so I brought you something.

174
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,280
Come on.

175
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,710
I brought you some snacks.

176
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,030
I know that

177
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,200
I didn't reply to your message in time,

178
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,200
so you are angry.

179
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,520
I solemnly apologize to you.

180
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,030
Here.

181
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm really not angry.

182
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,150
I just think you are

183
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,550
irresponsible to your cat.

184
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,030
I

185
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,640
was busy on business trips

186
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,400
these few days.

187
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,960
But I told the cleaner

188
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,520
to take care of it.

189
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,590
I didn't expect her to be so careless.

190
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,550
I…

191
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,840
I swear

192
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,400
it won't happen again in the future.

193
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,840
If you are busy, tell me in advance.

194
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,280
I can take care of it for you.

195
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,590
Really?

196
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,030
Great.

197
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:16,840
Well.

198
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,590
It won't happen again in the future.

199
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,790
I will tell you in advance

200
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,150
next time.

201
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,520
Then I will forgive you

202
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,550
on behalf of your cat.

203
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,710
Well.

204
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,670
Then I will treat you something

205
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,030
on behalf of my cat.

206
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,440
So generous.

207
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,790
Take a look.

208
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,280
There are three layers.

209
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,200
Then I will eat it.

210
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,670
So delicious.

211
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,520
Eat more.

212
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,910
It's time

213
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,760
for bed.

214
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,320
I can't.

215
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,400
The price of the beddings

216
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,320
hasn't been sorted yet.

217
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,080
What are you doing?

218
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,150
As your employer,

219
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,400
I now order you

220
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,910
to go to bed immediately.

221
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,200
Rejection.

222
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,710
I will fire you.

223
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,110
Then I, as your landlord,

224
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,280
have the right to drive you out.

225
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,790
Get out.

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,670
Take a shower and go to bed.

227
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,840
You can't grab it.

228
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,280
You can't control me.

229
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,960
It's late.

230
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,320
Should you rest early?

231
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,150
You have been working at the computer

232
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,200
ever since you finished eating.

233
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,200
What are you up to?

234
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,150
For Evergreen.

235
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,470
Evergreen?

236
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,110
The Building No.2 of Evergreen Hotel
needs to be renovated.

237
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,080
Our company will bargain

238
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,710
for the decoration materials.

239
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,590
I work so hard now

240
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,440
to save money for your hotel.

241
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,910
Am I doing a good job?

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,670
Not bad.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,230
Material price and bidding are both clear.

244
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,710
I am good at it.

245
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,470
You should go back and rest.

246
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,590
The kitten is still

247
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,760
at home alone.

248
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,110
Right.

249
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,960
Well.

250
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,400
After you finish working,

251
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,230
let's eat together.

252
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,320
Sure.

253
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,350
I am leaving.

254
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Bye.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,840
Go to bed early.

256
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,430
Open the door.

257
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,760
Who's that?

258
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,760
Your mom.

259
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,350
Mom.

260
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,280
Why did it take so long?

261
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,040
Open the door.

262
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,310
What are you doing?

263
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,230
Sheng Zhening.

264
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,040
What?

265
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,590
Get up.

266
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,710
My mom is at the door.

267
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,760
Open the door.

268
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,710
Look at you.

269
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,400
Open the door.

270
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,110
What are you doing?

271
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,070
Mom.

272
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,560
Why are you here?

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,350
To bring you breakfast.

274
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,040
Just give it to me.

275
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,110
I'm going downstairs to work.

276
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,350
Why didn't you let me in just now?

277
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,350
I was cleaning up.

278
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,470
Do you have any

279
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,190
unpresentable secrets?

280
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,640
Of course not.

281
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,520
I was cleaning up.

282
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,950
The room is a mess.

283
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm afraid you'd be upset.

284
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,710
Really?

285
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
You know everything

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,560
about me.

287
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,760
Come on.

288
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,800
I have a lot to do.

289
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm going downstairs.

290
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,640
Very soon.

291
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
Did you brush your teeth?

292
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,830
Yes.

293
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,760
I brushed my teeth when I got up.

294
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,880
Explain it.

295
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,950
What's going on?

296
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,710
Say it.

297
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,280
Fu Shuangshuang

298
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,350
stayed at my home several days ago.

299
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,590
I didn't have time to clean up.

300
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,230
Fu Shuangshuang lived here?

301
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,710
Yes.

302
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,950
Look at her.

303
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,590
She lived here

304
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,920
without cleaning up for you.

305
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,680
It's just a hand's turn.

306
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,800
That's it.

307
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,070
All right.

308
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,110
I am leaving.

309
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,350
Eat breakfast before it gets cold.

310
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,880
If it weren't for you to come to me,

311
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
I would have finished early.

312
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,560
All right, just hurry up.

313
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
All right, just go back.

314
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,160
I am leaving.

315
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,640
I am not seeing you off.

316
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,760
Just go. I am in a hurry.

317
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,070
Look at you.

318
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
I got it.

319
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,950
The bed is still warm.

320
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,950
Get out.

321
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,070
My mom left.

322
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,830
Sheng.

323
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,800
Are you progressing

324
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,520
way too fast?

325
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,190
Mom.

326
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,800
We just live together.

327
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,310
We haven't slept together yet.

328
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,760
Shut up.

329
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,310
Sheng.

330
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,070
Take a seat.

331
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,590
Move your hand.

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,680
You haven't fallen in love
several days ago.

333
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,280
Why do you live together

334
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,950
out of sudden?

335
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,160
After my unremitting efforts,

336
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Qian was moved by my sincerity.

337
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,800
Right?

338
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,470
Yes.

339
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,190
I see.

340
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,280
Look at you.

341
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
It's not that I disapprove

342
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,950
of you two dating.

343
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,040
Is it necessary to hide this situation
from me?

344
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,070
Mom.

345
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,920
I didn't mean to hide from you.

346
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,400
We have just been in love
for a few days.

347
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,040
I haven't had time to tell you.

348
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,350
Next time when something happens,

349
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,710
you have to report to me in advance.

350
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,710
Engagement, marriage

351
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,680
and childbirth

352
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,160
are all major events in life.

353
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,040
Understand?

354
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,520
Yes.

355
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,680
You keep

356
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,430
talking alone.

357
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,470
He is going to work.

358
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,430
I am leaving.

359
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,520
Sit down.

360
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,430
Sit here.

361
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,230
I will see him off.

362
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,230
Okay.

363
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,950
Let's go.

364
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,560
I am leaving, aunt.

365
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,470
Come often.

366
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,830
We are leaving.

367
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,190
We are leaving, mom.

368
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,190
Well…

369
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,590
What to do later?

370
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,040
What else?

371
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,310
I just told my mom.

372
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,680
Let's continue to pretend.

373
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,520
Then…

374
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
In order to express my gratitude
for your cooperation,

375
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,160
I will waive the rent for you.

376
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,830
Wait.

377
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,400
How long shall we pretend?

378
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,800
How do I know?

379
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,110
Maybe someday

380
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,190
I would suddenly meet my true love.

381
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,350
Then I could dump you.

382
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,830
Why can't I dump you?

383
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,350
Why do you dump me?

384
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,430
Your character setting is that

385
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,110
you actively pursued me.

386
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,800
You were in hot pursuit, so I agreed.

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,350
You are the spoony one.

388
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,560
So I can only be the ungrateful one.

389
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,070
Well.

390
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,230
Maybe my infatuation
and single-mindedness

391
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,520
are only an act.

392
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,430
I am actually a liar.

393
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,560
I may play with your feelings

394
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,400
and dump you.

395
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,190
Why would you play with my feelings?

396
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,310
You can't.

397
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,070
That's a deal.

398
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,950
Only I can dump you.

399
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,760
I will be the bad girl.

400
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,880
It must feel nice
to dump you.

401
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,590
Get in the car.

402
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,880
Bye.

403
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,760
Come on.

404
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,230
Why are you bringing me here?

405
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,310
Do you want to eat cake?

406
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,430
Hold on.

407
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,560
Does it look good?

408
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,430
Do I look like a pastry chef?

409
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,590
To be honest,

410
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,590
it's quite nice.

411
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,470
You do look like a pastry chef.

412
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,040
Darling.

413
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,310
You always wanted me

414
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,640
to find a job.

415
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,710
Then I won't

416
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,920
have a bee in my head.

417
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,190
So

418
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,680
I rented

419
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,640
this cake shop.

420
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,310
It is right opposite your hospital.

421
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,280
I can commute with you every day.

422
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:28,880
Darling.

423
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,830
Am I very thoughtful?

424
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,160
But, Meng,

425
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,710
opening a store is not easy.

426
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,640
You made up your mind in a second.

427
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,070
Can you stick to it?

428
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,830
Darling, don't worry.

429
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,110
I always like to

430
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,160
make desserts.

431
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,000
I believe

432
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,710
I can do this very well.

433
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,160
Okay.

434
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,560
I communicated with all of you before.

435
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,590
You all expressed

436
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,040
your satisfaction with our price.

437
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,640
I asked you here today

438
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,070
because I want to talk to you

439
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,920
about discounts.

440
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,110
Next are my thoughts.

441
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,110
You checked the unit price
of our company over the years.

442
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,560
This is the lowest price

443
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
our company can afford.

444
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,230
Right.

445
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,190
Or we will lose money.

446
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,950
I got it.

447
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,400
Let me finish.

448
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,710
Actually I asked you here today

449
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,190
for your interests.

450
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,710
If you agree,

451
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,070
after the completion
of Evergreen's Building No.2,

452
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,350
you can place your own

453
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,470
building materials advertisements

454
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
in Evergreen's toilets, elevators, corridors,

455
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,830
and other places.

456
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,350
You know Evergreen Hotel well.

457
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,560
There is a large guest flow.

458
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,400
You can imagine the benefits of advertising.

459
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,680
Anyway, I think

460
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,400
this is a win-win project.

461
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,950
You can also think about it.

462
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,040
Actually it's reasonable.

463
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,040
Yes.

464
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,070
Finally done.

465
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,600
[Fu Shuangshuang:
I'm done, let's come out for dinner]

466
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm done.

467
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,760
Let's come out for dinner.

468
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,070
Okay, the same place.

469
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,710
Sure.

470
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,520
Are you tired today?

471
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,560
I'm fine.

472
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,590
Easy.

473
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,430
What shall we eat later?

474
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,470
Darling.

475
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm here to pick you up.

476
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,190
Okay.

477
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,830
I will leave you alone.

478
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,350
I am leaving.

479
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,400
Meng.

480
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,880
Why are you here? It's so late.

481
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,880
Did you forget it?

482
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,430
My cake shop was just closed.

483
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,110
We can go to and get off work

484
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,880
together in the future.

485
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,430
So romantic.

486
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,160
What do you think?

487
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,110
Let's go.

488
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Cheers.

489
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,310
You are in a good mood today.

490
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,230
For sure.

491
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,760
I finally finished my work.

492
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,110
So beautiful.

493
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,470
I'll drink more with you.

494
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,190
Okay.

495
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,830
Finished another bottle.

496
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,800
Excuse me.

497
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,830
More sake please.

498
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,470
Cheers.

499
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,680
Eat something.

500
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,920
You…

501
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,880
Why are you watching me?

502
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,680
Eat.

503
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,560
We really eat a lot.

504
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,520
Let's eat.

505
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:03,950
I am hungry.

506
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,280
Some more.

507
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,160
Ten more here.

508
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,400
Ten more here.

509
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,830
Come on.

510
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,590
Two more dishes.

511
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,680
Take your time.

512
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,710
Hurry up.

513
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,040
It will be alright soon. Eat first.

514
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,310
Dear.

515
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,350
I want to eat fish eyes.

516
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,560
He is a guest.

517
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,430
Leave it to him.

518
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,470
Mom.

519
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,230
Thank you, aunt.

520
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,950
Come on. Eat this.

521
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,950
Eat more.

522
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay.

523
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,640
I'm not full yet.

524
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,680
More rice.

525
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,160
Sure.

526
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,190
Here you are, dear.

527
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,110
Thank you.

528
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,280
You are welcome, dear.

529
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,920
Here you are, dear.

530
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,710
Open your mouth.

531
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,950
I want it, too.

532
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,710
Well.

533
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,760
There is one more person here.

534
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,880
Aunt, help yourself.

535
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,040
I want more.

536
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,160
This meal

537
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,230
was so awkward.

538
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
Why did he leave the wallet here?

539
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,310
Clean it up.

540
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,950
Mom.

541
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,470
What are you looking at?

542
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,800
Give it to me.

543
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,310
Give it to me.

544
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,000
Give me my photo.

545
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,590
I gave it to Sheng.

546
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,760
You gave it to him?

547
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,280
Yes.

548
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,070
What's wrong with you?

549
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,310
Are you selling your daughter?

550
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,760
Congratulations, you got it.

551
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,350
Let me go. It's his.

552
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,560
I have to barbecue.

553
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,710
Look at you.

554
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
How could you be like this?

555
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,640
All right. Just take it.

556
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,590
Take this photo away.

557
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,190
So cruel.

558
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,190
Besides,

559
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,880
my mother is very satisfied with you now.

560
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,160
She can't wait for me

561
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,230
to marry you right now.

562
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,160
Can you do something annoying

563
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,560
and keep a distance from my mom

564
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,190
so that she may hate you?

565
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,710
So that when I dump you,

566
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,680
she won't hate me.

567
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,520
My character is a spoony man.

568
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,800
What are you doing?

569
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,400
Nothing.

570
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,950
I didn't hide in the cabinet
on purpose.

571
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,470
What are you doing?

572
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,000
Give me the picture you hid
in your wallet.

573
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,830
I hid it.

574
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,070
I know you hid it.

575
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,830
Where is it?

576
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,950
What I can tell you is that

577
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,160
you will never find it all your life.

578
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,430
That is my photo.

579
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,920
Aunt gave it to me.

580
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
It's mine now.

581
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,310
Tell me.

582
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Why do you want my photo?

583
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,430
It's none of your business.

584
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,710
You just want to make fun of me.

585
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,160
Won't you leave?

586
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,920
You'd like to watch me sleep?

587
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,430
Go ahead.

588
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,149
Just leave.

589
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,229
Let's wait and see.

590
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,079
I'll get it back sooner or later.

591
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,710
Xiaoyan.

592
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,800
What are you thinking about?

593
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,870
I found out that Qian

594
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,870
sent a strange man into the car
a few days ago.

595
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,840
Is there any relationship between them?

596
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,950
It should be a customer.

597
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,150
Don't think too much.

598
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,910
All right.

599
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,800
I will keep an eye on it.

600
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,150
Don't lie to me.

601
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,470
I have a question for you.

602
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,000
Well.

603
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,360
A man

604
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,360
cooks porridge for you

605
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,760
after your hangover.

606
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,950
And he told you the password
of his house.

607
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,470
He often invites you
to dinner and drinks.

608
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Tell me.

609
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,910
Does he like you?

610
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,910
Someone is pursuing you?

611
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,320
Not me.

612
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,800
It's a friend of mine.

613
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,630
She asked me.

614
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,430
Then your friend

615
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,630
must be a love idiot.

616
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,910
There are only two situations

617
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,840
when a man is willing

618
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,870
to do this for her.

619
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Which two situations?

620
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,000
One, he likes her.

621
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,150
What about the other?

622
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,470
They are

623
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,600
long-lost siblings.

624
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,910
What do you think

625
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,870
my friend should do?

626
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,760
If I were your friend,

627
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,150
I would take the initiative

628
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,560
to show more feelings.

629
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,710
How?

630
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,560
Mr. Sheng.

631
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,630
Something's up.

632
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,190
What happened?

633
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,040
It rained heavily in the south.

634
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,910
Our truck carrying wooden floors and tiles

635
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,280
was overturned by a mudslide.

636
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,630
Fortunately, no one was injured.

637
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,120
But we lost a few carts

638
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,870
of wood and tiles.

639
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,280
Have you applied for insurance?

640
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,870
I did contact them.

641
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,040
But they don't compensate
for various reasons.

642
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,360
Even if it is compensated,

643
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,710
only ten percent at most.

644
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,320
Do we need to go to court?

645
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,910
It will be too late

646
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
when the lawsuit is over.

647
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,040
Buy wooden floors and tiles again.

648
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,470
The construction period cannot be delayed.

649
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,040
Got it.

650
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,800
How many carts
of wooden floors and tiles

651
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,320
did he lose in total?

652
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,430
Four in total.

653
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,360
His budget is already tight.

654
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,000
He shouldn't last long.

655
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,760
Mr. Qin, are you convenient?

656
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,560
Mr. Song.

657
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,360
Please take a seat.

658
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't you have three million?

659
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,630
Anyway, you are a member of the board.

660
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,080
The completion of Building No.2

661
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,910
is also beneficial to you.

662
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,630
Okay, understood.

663
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,600
Well.

664
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,390
I already know about

665
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,600
wooden floors and tiles.

666
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,360
Is your budget tight now?

667
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,320
Let's do this.

668
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,120
I will find a way

669
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,280
to further lower the price of some materials.

670
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,190
It can't be lower.

671
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,630
If so,

672
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,760
the quality of the material
will be reduced.

673
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,950
I don't want this.

674
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,080
What about the funds next?

675
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,360
Don't worry.

676
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,470
I will find a way.

677
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,470
But it can't happen again.

678
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,000
Not only me,

679
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,840
but several other shareholders

680
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,190
oppose Mr. Sheng's

681
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,360
renovation this time.

682
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
He is young after all.

683
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,760
He tends to act impetuously.

684
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,560
We had a discussion.

685
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,520
It is best for you

686
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,520
to be the general manager.

687
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,910
If you are also willing to,

688
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,910
we can work with several
other shareholders

689
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,280
to achieve this as soon as possible.

690
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,560
Don't have any worries.

691
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,470
We only need to persuade

692
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,630
those shareholders
around Sheng Zhening.

693
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,120
It's not difficult.

694
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
The key is whether you are willing to.

695
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,150
Give me some time

696
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,190
to think about it.

697
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,320
Think about it.

698
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,950
Reply to me as soon as possible.

699
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,910
And then we could move on.

700
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,080
Got it.

701
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,390
Bye, Mr. Song.

702
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,710
Mr. Qin.

703
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,950
What's your opinion?

704
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,600
Of course it's good
to be the general manager.

705
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,040
But only the support

706
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,840
of these small shareholders isn't enough.

707
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,760
The key lies in Sheng Zhening.

708
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,800
[Fu Shuangshuang]

709
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,600
Hello.

710
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,760
Hello.

711
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,040
Thank you for taking me home

712
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,360
and preparing breakfast for me.

713
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,390
Never mind.

714
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,320
Are you free tonight?

715
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,950
Watch a movie with me.

716
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,560
Watch a movie?

717
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,000
You treated me dinner.

718
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,230
So it's my treat this time.

719
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,710
All right.

720
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,390
I will pick you up after work.

721
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,120
Okay, go to work.

722
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,150
I won't bother you.

723
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,190
Bye.

724
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,120
Mr. Qin.

725
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,800
Does Fu Shuangshuang like you?

726
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,430
I don't think

727
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,520
you need to contact her more.

728
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,470
No.

729
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,470
This part is comedy.

730
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,360
The scary part is not here yet.

731
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,800
No.

732
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,150
Horror movies are generally like this.

733
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,630
You may laugh now.

734
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,630
But you will cry soon.

735
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,040
I have to take precautions.

736
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,080
Well.

737
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,390
If you are really so scared,

738
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,430
why do you have to watch it?

739
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,870
I…

740
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,080
Maybe it's because I have not watched it
for too long.

741
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,630
Aren't you afraid now?

742
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,800
Let me buy you something to drink.

743
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,080
Sure.

744
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,280
What can I do for you?

745
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,710
We need…

746
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,910
Anything will do.

747
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,280
Two Coca-Cola.

748
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,910
Now there is a couple event.

749
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,320
If you take a photo

750
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,520
and put it on the photo wall,

751
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,840
drinks and popcorn

752
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,800
could be free.

753
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,760
What do you think?

754
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,760
Sorry, you misunderstood.

755
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,080
We are not a couple.

756
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,560
