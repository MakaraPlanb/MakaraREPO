4
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,030
- Excuse me, I have to answer a call. 
 - Sure.

5
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,470
- Hello, hubby.

6
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,850
You're here?

7
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,910
I'm upstairs.

8
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,330
Okay. I'll be there right away.

9
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,120
Hubby, I'm here!

10
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,690
<i>Starting today,</i>

11
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,680
<i>wherever you go,</i>

12
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
<i>I will go there too!</i>

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,830
<i>Listen carefully, </i>

14
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,170
<i>I'm not the type to pester,</i>

15
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,540
<i>and I will not persuade you to stay. But if you take one more step today,</i>

16
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,570
<i>one step, I will dump you.</i>

17
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,550
<i>Even if you come back to me begging, I will not take you back.</i>

18
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,440
<i>He Zhijuan!</i>

19
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,780
<i>[Xia Qian, I'm sorry! I cannot get engaged to you.</i>

20
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,690
Miss Xia, my fiancé is here to pick me up.

21
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,040
Let me introduce you guys, He Zhijuan.

22
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,680
Sorry for arriving late.

23
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,100
Hello, I am He Zhijuan.

24
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,840
What's wrong, Miss Xia?

25
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
I don't know. It's just...

26
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,400
just that my eyes are allergic.

27
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,640
Sorry, Miss Ning Meng, I have to go.

28
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,790
Qianqian.

29
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,790
Qianqian.

30
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,890
- I'm so sorry 
 - I'm sorry.

31
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,730
- Qianqian. 
 - You arrived?

32
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,300
Qianqian.

33
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,030
Sit down.

34
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,760
Are you okay?

35
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,260
<i>That's enough.</i>

36
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,170
<i>Are you okay?</i>

37
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,080
<i>I feel much better.</i>

38
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,470
- <i>Slow down, slow down.</i> 
 - <i>Shuangshuang,</i>

39
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,880
<i>I still don't understand.</i>

40
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,160
<i>Help me come up with a reason,</i>

41
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,690
<i>what do you think is wrong with He Zhijuan?</i>

42
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,740
- <i>Exactly.</i> 
 - <i>Do you think he was diagnosed with a terminal illness?</i>

43
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,410
<i>He must have his own reasons.</i>

44
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,880
<i>Something bad happened?</i>

45
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,700
<i>Something bad really did happen.</i>

46
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,420
<i>No no no.</i>

47
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,210
<i>I think it must be like how we discussed.</i>

48
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,770
<i>At the time,</i>

49
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,840
<i>I didn't give him the opportunity and time to explain.</i>

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,280
<i>He must have left in anger.</i>

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,760
<i>If he wanted to explain, he would have already explained, right?</i>

52
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,860
<i>No? Never mind.</i>

53
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,360
<i>Forget him, a man like him doesn't deserve your love.</i>

54
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
<i>He's worth it.</i>

55
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,800
<i>Let me tell you the truth, He Zhijuan is not that type of person.</i>

56
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,230
<i>I swear, He Zhijuan is not that type of person.</i>

57
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,840
<i>I know him really well.</i>

58
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,210
<i>Did you know at the time he looked back at me?</i>

59
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,750
<i>He looked at me. He wanted to say something.</i>

60
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,420
<i>But I didn't give him time, so he left.</i>

61
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,500
<i>He will come back.</i>

62
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,910
<i>But Shuangshuang,</i>

63
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,130
<i>at the time... </i>

64
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,750
<i>at the time...</i>

65
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,720
<i>why did I say those words?</i>

66
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,560
<i>I told him, if</i>

67
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,740
<i>he comes back,</i>

68
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,820
<i>I will dump him.</i>

69
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,700
- <i>Don't take him back. We don't want him. 
 - I want him.</i>

70
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,910
<i>Yes, don't take him back.</i>

71
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,360
<i>- I want him, I want him, I want him. 
 - Don't think about him.</i>

72
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,940
What are you doing?

73
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,770
You aren't thinking I am going to get drunk because of He Zhijuan, right?

74
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,340
I... just really never expected that

75
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,490
we would meet again like that.

76
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,930
What will you do next?

77
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,930
That's such a coincidence.

78
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,960
Do you think Ning Meng planned it on purpose?

79
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,730
I don't think so.

80
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,510
It felt like Ning Meng didn't know.

81
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,690
How did He Zhijuan react when he saw you? You can't say that he didn't know.

82
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,480
Lihe Capital has obtained 3% of Director Lin's shares.

83
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,860
Thank you for your work, Director Qin.

84
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,020
Oh, wait. I should call you Vice GM Qin now.

85
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,830
Six years ago, I brought you to Evergreen.

86
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,490
I knew already at the time, with your ability,

87
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,190
you would be able to earn that position.

88
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,830
It would not have been possible without the help of Director Xue.

89
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,850
Whether or not Lihe Capital will be able to acquire Evergreen,

90
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,820
all depends on Vice GM Qin.

91
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,640
Please excuse me. I need to take this call.

92
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,840
Hello Mengmeng.

93
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,460
What's wrong? Is your brother mad at you again?

94
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,940
Come to my office, I will be there shortly.

95
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,210
See you in a bit.

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm sorry Director Xue, Sheng Zhening's sister is looking for me. I will head back first.

97
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,880
I did not realize that you get along quite well with both  brother and sister of the Sheng family.

98
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,990
Hebo,

99
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,580
it wasn't easy for you to get to this position, don't let your emotions lead you astray.

100
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,400
Don't worry, I know what to do.

101
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,140
<i>[Alipay]</i>

102
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,610
What does this mean? Why did you transfer money to me?

103
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,020
We'll pool our money together to refund Ning Meng. Let's not take this case.

104
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,680
Shuangshuang, let me tell you. That's really not necessary. I have money.

105
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,350
Don't tell me you have money.

106
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,760
I already heard you sold your car.

107
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,380
Yes, money needs to be made. But you shouldn't make it so hard on yourself.

108
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,600
Besides, no matter what happens, I can support you financially.

109
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,020
Why are you smiling? I'm being serious.

110
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,360
Thank you.

111
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,900
There is no need to say that between us. Please don't burden yourself.

112
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,990
I am not burdened, I just really want to take this case.

113
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,820
And it's not because of money.

114
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,690
It's because, after He Zhijuan ran away from the engagement, I wanted to change.

115
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,130
Under those tough circumstances, I forced myself to start my own company.

116
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,720
We've worked really hard these past few years. We took all cases,

117
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,580
to make "Worth or Not" today.

118
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,290
This is our dream. Why should we let go of the case because of He Zhijuan?

119
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,840
Besides, he isn't important to me anymore.

120
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,990
Not important? Is that really how you feel?

121
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,890
I am the person who understands the most about how much you suffered when He Zhijuan left you.

122
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,170
You became a different person. Just to not think about him, you threw yourself into work. You worked like crazy.

123
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,970
I don't want you to be like that again. Now that He Zhijuan is back,

124
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,690
I am afraid you will become that person again.

125
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,020
Shuangshuang, just because He Zhijuan is back,

126
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,280
I've seen him and now I understand.

127
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,600
It's been two years. He has his own life, I have my own.

128
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,220
We are not important to each other anymore.

129
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,670
It's true,

130
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,760
helping my ex-boyfriend schedule his wedding is ridiculous.

131
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,170
But what can I do? This ridiculous situation happened and I need to fix it.

132
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,460
If I break the contract and not take this case,

133
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,900
it would mean that I have not forgotten him.

134
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,830
So, we must take it. We must finish it beautifully.

135
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,930
Come on, let's drink.

136
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,690
Let's work hard.

137
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,140
What brings you here today?

138
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,390
I miss Brother Hebo, of course.

139
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,000
Miss me?

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,090
I thought you are busy dating and don't have time to miss me.

141
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,990
Just tell me. What is it?

142
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,530
Looks like I can't hide anything from you, Brother Hebo.

143
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,880
Brother Hebo. I'm getting married. At the Evergreen Hotel.

144
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,750
I thought your brother doesn't want you to get married so early.

145
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,120
You've talked him into it already?

146
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,310
Of course not! You know my brother.

147
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,140
I've hired a bargainer in secret to secure a spot for me.

148
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,010
I'm signing the contract tomorrow.

149
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,740
- So you're the one who hired the bargainer? 
 - Yes.

150
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,860
Your brother will be pissed off if he knows about it!

151
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,390
I know! So I'm counting on you, Brother Hebo, to say something nice for me.

152
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,780
Please, Brother Hebo.

153
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,670
Okay, okay. I got it.

154
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,050
You're the best, Brother Hebo!

155
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,350
Come, have a seat.

156
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,550
You should talk to your brother more often.

157
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,020
He's not unreasonable. He cares too much about you, and he is afraid that you will be hurt.

158
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,920
I know. I'll find a time to have a good chat with him.

159
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,430
- Oh, I almost forgot. 
 - What?

160
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,970
Congratulations on your promotion, Brother Hebo!

161
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,160
You’ve been blowing your money again?

162
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
Not at all! I know Brother Hebo doesn't like it when I spend frivolously.

163
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
I've made them by myself. Do they look nice?

164
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,500
- Really? Did you really make them by yourself? 
 - Yeah.

165
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,680
Do you like them, Brother Hebo?

166
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,700
Yes.

167
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm glad you like them!

168
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,450
I'll be heading home. Zhijuan is waiting for me at home.

169
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,350
See you. Bye!

170
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,300
- Take care. 
 - Will do.

171
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,790
Assistant An, I've arrived at Evergreen.

172
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,390
The representative of Xinyuan Technology has not arrived yet. Maybe you can wait for him in the meeting room.

173
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,330
Is that the case?

174
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay, I got it.

175
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,570
Xia Qian.

176
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,640
What's up?

177
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
Can we talk?

178
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,580
He Zhijuan.

179
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,240
I've got other stuff to deal with.

180
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,380
Just say what you want.

181
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,180
I hope that you can terminate Mengmeng's order with you.

182
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,690
About this...

183
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,760
you should talk to your fiancée, not me.

184
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,110
She doesn't know about it. And I don't want her to know.

185
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,960
I wasn't planning on telling her about it.

186
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,340
So you ran away from our engagement ceremony

187
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,030
because of Ning Meng?

188
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,610
It had nothing to do with her. I just realized on that day that I didn't love you anymore.

189
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,290
I couldn't force myself to be with you.

190
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,960
You realized that you didn't love me on the engagement day?

191
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
You realized it pretty early.

192
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,660
Xia Qian, can you not be sarcastic?

193
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,880
There's no such rule that I can only love one person in my life.

194
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,880
I've known you for such a long time,

195
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,070
and this is the first time I've realized that you've taken things so easy.

196
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,690
I know you need money these days. There's ¥100,000 in this card.

197
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,890
I want you to give up your job.

198
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,240
Mengmeng doesn't know anything about us yet.

199
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
We haven't met in two years, but I don't think that's a long time.

200
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,380
You forgot who I am?

201
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,330
It's true that I'm poor and I need money.

202
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,440
But I'm not that pathetic to take money from you!

203
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,460
I repeat. Rest assured,

204
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,190
I won't tell Ning Meng what happened between us.

205
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,130
If it's possible, I wish I never had anything to do with you.

206
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,220
Just take your hush money back. I don't need it.

207
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,460
Anything else?

208
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,980
If you can terminate this contract,

209
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,200
I'll satisfy whatever requests you make.

210
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,650
Think of it as my compensation for hurting you emotionally.

211
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,010
Compensation for hurting me? How?

212
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,180
Who do you think you are?

213
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,330
And I’m over what happened between us a long time ago.

214
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,250
Anything else?

215
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,180
Xia Qian.

216
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,580
<i> [Xia Qian] </i>

217
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,860
<i>Brother, this is my boyfriend Zhijuan.</i>

218
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,510
<i>Nice to meet you, I'm He Zhijuan.</i>

219
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,550
Thank you.

220
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,520
Did you hear what we were talking about?

221
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,790
I'm feeling sad now,

222
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,270
not because I'm still in love with him.

223
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,750
It's because it's hard for me to accept the truth of why he left me.

224
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,140
Do you know how overboard he went?

225
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,490
Two years ago, he ran away

226
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,620
from our engagement ceremony.

227
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,480
Why would he run away?

228
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,240
I've been thinking about it for two years.

229
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,880
I was even thinking if he's got some terminal disease,

230
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,210
and couldn't be cured, and he left me because he was afraid I'd be sad.

231
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,800
But in the end, this is what the truth is.

232
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,840
He just didn't like me anymore.

233
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,190
But it's okay.

234
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,030
I don't care about it anymore now.

235
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm so sorry.

236
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,580
I've said so much nonsense to you.

237
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,480
Sorry for wasting your time.

238
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,530
I've been using this handkerchief. I'll wash it and give it back to you tomorrow.

239
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,720
Excuse me.

240
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,110
Miss Xia, the agent is waiting in the meeting room. Where are you?

241
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,660
Oh. Just a moment, I'll be right there.

242
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Okay. See you soon.

243
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,360
I've got something urgent to deal with. I'll be on my way.

244
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,480
Thank you. I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

245
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,950
- Hello? 
 <i> - Hello, Brother. </i>

246
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,780
<i> Are you free tonight?</i>

247
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,580
I want to invite you over for dinner and... have a chat with you.

248
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,890
I need to talk to you too.

249
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,180
That's great. I'll see you tonight!

250
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,460
Brother! You've brought so much delicious food for me!

251
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,090
I'll make dinner first, and then we can eat and talk together.

252
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,630
That's delicious! These are all my favorites!

253
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,810
Have a seat.

254
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,280
I need to talk to you about something.

255
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,970
Zhijuan! Come on in!

256
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,070
My brother made a lot of delicious food for us!

257
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,010
Brother.

258
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,860
Brother Zhening.

259
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,780
There's one more dish. You guys can sit first.

260
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,150
My brother is slow to warm up. It'll get better.

261
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,640
- Okay. 
 - Have a seat.

262
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,140
Brother, I've mentioned to you before

263
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,710
that Zhijuan is super good.

264
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,270
He's the best and the youngest psychiatrist in his clinic.

265
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,960
And he's very gentle and considerate.

266
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,950
Everyone is envious of me.

267
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,370
They said I've found the perfect man for myself the first time.

268
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,900
Mengmeng, you're overstating it.

269
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,320
I should have let you meet with my brother earlier.

270
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,450
He'd know how great you are.

271
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,900
I'm full, enjoy the meal you two.

272
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,030
The fish my brother made is really delicious. Have some more.

273
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,400
Eat more.

274
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,340
- You don't have to see me out. 
 - I do!

275
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,300
Zhijuan, my brother is not like that usually.

276
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,880
Please don't be mad.

277
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,420
It's okay. If I had a sister as lovely as you,

278
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,490
I'd be unhappy if she brings her boyfriend home.

279
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,400
I'll go downstairs with you.

280
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,140
It's okay.

281
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,280
- I'll be leaving now. 
 - Take care!

282
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,770
Brother, why are you putting on a long face?

283
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,930
What's wrong with Zhijuan?

284
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,790
Are you the one who hired Xia Qian

285
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,070
to get the wedding reservation?

286
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,740
You know that I don't want you to get married so early.

287
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,940
So you're thinking to act first and ask later?

288
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,890
I just want to get married with him right away!

289
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,590
How long have you guys been dating? Do you really know him?

290
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,250
How would I not?

291
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,450
When I saw him, at the first sight,

292
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,070
I decided that he's the one I'd like to marry in my life.

293
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,640
It's an instinct. You don't get it.

294
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,110
I think you're infatuated.

295
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,060
I just love him. I just want to marry him.

296
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,900
Even if I'm infatuated, I'd still be willing to do that.

297
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,720
GM Sheng, you might be overreacting.

298
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,340
I think Mr. He loves Miss Ning Meng a lot.

299
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,050
How long does love last?

300
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,780
To see if a man

301
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,540
can hold onto his marriage,

302
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,660
we have to see if he's responsible.

303
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,290
If He Zhijuan can run away

304
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,120
from his engagement ceremony because of love,

305
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,140
he could be leaving Mengmeng for someone else.

306
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,570
How can I be rest assured if Mengmeng is married to

307
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,570
a man like him with no sense of responsibility?

308
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,900
Makes sense.

309
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,030
Then what do we do about Miss Xia?

310
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,770
She's bargained down all the orders we need.

311
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,390
And I've made an appointment with her to sign the reservation contract for Banquet Hall 8 tomorrow.

312
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,640
We can't sign the contract?

313
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,970
Tell me why.

314
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,880
I have my own reasons and I don't have to explain it to you.

315
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,430
By the way, here's all your reward

316
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,650
for bargaining for Evergreen.

317
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,310
I don't want money. I want the reservation for the wedding in May.

318
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,370
Then there's nothing for us to discuss.

319
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,050
You've gone back on your words, do you know?

320
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:07,260
I've got other work to do. If you don't have anything else, I may ask you to leave.

321
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,280
I'll ask Anan to transfer the money to your bank account!

322
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,420
GM Sheng.

323
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,650
I saw Miss Xia waiting for someone in the garden.

324
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,360
<i>I've been using it.</i>

325
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,920
<i>I'll wash it and give it back to you tomorrow.</i>

326
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,660
It's such a hot day. I hope she doesn't get a heatstroke.

327
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,680
- Is it hot today? 
 - Yeah.

328
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,710
38 degrees celsius.

329
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,210
<i>I found a tiny hole in the handkerchief</i>

330
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,870
<i>and decided to embroider a blue daze flower for you.</i>

331
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,380
<i>I hope you don't mind.</i>

332
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,930
<i>It's growing well. See, I was right.</i>

333
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,640
<i>It's because I have an uncle who's also a gardener.</i>

334
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,980
<i>I learned a bit from him before.</i>

335
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,460
<i>I don't know how to take care of other flowers, but I really like blue daze.</i>

336
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,850
<i>That's why I know more about it.</i>

337
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,650
<i>Your hand!</i>

338
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,710
<i>Wipe it.</i>

339
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,590
<i>The juice of blue daze is poisonous. You have a wound on your hand.</i>

340
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,540
<i>Wipe it here or you might suffer from skin allergy.</i>

341
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,930
<i>Why are you not talking at all?</i>

342
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,240
<i>Take this pack of tissues with you. You can use it later.</i>

<i>I won't be bothering you. Take care.</i>

344
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,900
Hello, Anan.

345
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,020
Come to my office.

346
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,230
Sheng Zhening has no spirit of contract at all!

347
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,870
It's not only the spirit of contract,

348
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,320
he commits treachery and goes back on his word!

349
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,890
Sister Qian did so much research just for this order,

350
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,500
and he just said no like that!

351
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,980
What do we do?

352
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,110
<i> [Anan] </i>

353
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,600
- What now? 
 - Hello, Miss Xia.

354
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,900
GM Sheng had thought about your situation.

355
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,990
We have a plan for you.

356
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,110
If you give up on the wedding reservation,

357
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,940
<i> as an exchange, </i>

358
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,740
<i> we'll give you another big bargaining order. </i>

359
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,090
Our company is planning on bulk-buying cars.

360
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,860
- Maybe you can... 
 - I can't. Not interested.

361
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,920
Miss Xia.

362
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,650
Hello?

363
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,790
Hello?

364
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,270
She hung up.

365
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,820
What a weird man!

366
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,320
Wait... what did he say?

367
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,590
I can't believe he said

368
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,310
that as an exchange they would give me a car bulk-buying order.

369
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,800
- Buying cars? 
 - Yeah.

370
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,550
We've never had a car bargaining order before.

371
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,490
If we make it this time,

372
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,970
we'll have... we'll have nothing to worry about in the future!

373
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,540
Do you only care about money?

374
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,110
Don't be such a loser! We can't take "food handed out in contempt".
<i>(T/N: Chinese idiom for 'not to be pitied')</i>

375
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,810
Don't you understand?

376
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,380
We can't take it.

377
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,930
Then what do we do?

378
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,010
Do we still want the wedding reservation?

379
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,170
Yes. We have to get it.

380
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,860
Sheng Zhening promised to make the reservation for me.

381
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,710
Since he went back on his word and won't give it to me, I'll have to get it by myself.

382
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,880
- How? 
 - Don't know.

383
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,300
You basically said nothing.

384
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,990
If...

385
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,830
If we can get the hotel reservation list for May,

386
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,270
does that mean we can potentially find someone who will change their wedding date?

387
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,250
But the key is that we need to get the list first.

388
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,940
We're not spies.

389
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,080
I've got a plan.

390
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,540
This is your first day at work. Your probation is three months.

391
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,220
If you want to stay at Evergreen,

392
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,190
you have to stay alert.

393
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,580
- Is that clear? 
 - Yes!

394
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,750
Good. Get to your work.

<i>[Xia Qian]</i>

397
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,430
Miss Xia, now that you've signed the contract,

398
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,730
I assume you've agreed to give up on the wedding reservation?

399
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,520
It's over and we're partners now.

400
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,590
Yeah, sure. All the best to our collaboration.

401
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Is there...

402
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,540
Do you have any concerns?

403
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,970
No.

404
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,520
We've signed the contract.

405
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,120
I'll do my best to do whatever I've promised you, GM Sheng.

406
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,470
Anything else? I'll be on my way if there's nothing else.

407
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,830
Just a moment. I have a little bit of doubt.

408
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,560
Before, I felt that

409
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,050
you were not so willing to take on the car bargaining order, but why all of a sudden...?

410
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,500
For money's sake. Who doesn't like money?

411
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,930
And people should be flexible.

412
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,520
Evergreen will give you a satisfactory reward for sure.

413
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,600
Thank you, GM Sheng.

414
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,480
This copy is yours.

415
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,280
I have a very busy schedule these days,

416
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,100
and I'm not sure when I'll be available. For the car bargaining,

417
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,900
we might need you to show up anytime—

418
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,840
No problem. 24/7, anytime you need.

419
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,390
Good.

420
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,170
Bye.

421
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,630
It's signed, the car bargaining contract with Sheng Zhening.

422
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,230
So the next step for me is to see

423
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,430
if there's a chance to get the reservation list for May from him.

424
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,940
What about you two? Report to me.

425
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,090
I've been washing dishes for a whole day and have no time to search for information at all. I can't even

426
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,360
stand up straight. I regret doing this.

427
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,930
Maybe we should terminate the plan.

428
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,840
No way! I thought you were proud of yourself when you first came up with the plan.

429
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,590
How can you go back on your word?

430
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,290
Who would expect that being a spy is so tiring?

431
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,830
I've got something.

432
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,790
I heard from my colleague who is in charge of the banquet halls

433
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,390
that the Evergreen wedding reservation materials

434
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,100
will be eventually submitted to two people.

435
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,250
One is the General Manager, Sheng Zhening.

436
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,470
The other is the Vice General Manager, I think it's Qin something Bo.

437
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,710
That's an important piece of info.

438
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,470
I'll be dealing with Sheng Zhening from today on.

439
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,610
You two can deal with the Qin something Bo.

Miss Xia, come over to Evergreen now.

443
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,950
We need to go on a business trip.

444
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,930
What business trip? It's midnight. Are you out of your mind?

<i> [Sheng Zhening] </i>

446
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,180
GM Sheng.

447
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,810
<i> I'm so sorry.</i>

448
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,650
No no no no no.

449
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,210
I'm leaving now. Thirty minutes.

450
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,840
No, twenty minutes. I'll be right there.

451
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,270
I'm right here! Oops!

452
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,380
I'm fine! You don't have to help me with it.

453
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,940
I'll be right there!

454
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,100
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.

00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,260

00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,530
GM Sheng.

457
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,440
I didn't know that you work so hard.

458
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,560
Going on a business trip so late at night,

459
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,100
and driving by yourself. Where's Assistant An?

460
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,670
I've arranged for him to deal with some other business.

461
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,000
Well, if you're tired, I can drive.

462
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,200
It's okay, I can drive by myself.

463
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,270
GM Sheng, where are we going?

464
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,580
Evergreen has a new business hotel.

465
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,620
The purpose of the trip is to

466
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,300
make arrangements for the soft opening of the hotel,

467
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,310
and finish the car bulk-buying order at the same time.

468
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,680
It'll take some time. You can have a rest if you're tired.

469
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,850
I'm okay. I'm not tired.

470
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,050
Are we here?

471
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,840
Have you arranged the rooms for us?

472
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,920
Yes.

473
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,450
Take her to her room for some rest then.

474
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,750
Miss Xia, shall I take you to your room?

475
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,590
Okay.

476
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,720
Your luggage.
