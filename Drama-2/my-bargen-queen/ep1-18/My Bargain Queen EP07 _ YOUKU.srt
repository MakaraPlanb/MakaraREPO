00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,360
Who's that?

8
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,670
Who got this video played?

9
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,600
Who made this video? And who's that girl?

10
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,830
Do you know what it means?

11
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,160
No one said anything about it.

12
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,110
This is so uncalled for!

13
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,160
What about our Ning Meng?

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,720
This is the video from two years ago!

15
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
What's going on?

16
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,960
Why are they laughing at me?

17
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,910
Why would this thing

18
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,030
happen in my wedding?

19
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,720
Let them exchange rings.

20
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,360
Okay.

21
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,470
The couple will now exchange rings!

22
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,960
Xia Qian is your ex-girlfriend?

23
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes.

24
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,160
Why didn't you tell me that?

25
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,470
End the ceremony.

26
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,190

30
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,270
Why didn't you

31
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,550
tell me the truth

32
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,230
when we first

33
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,830
met Xia Qian together?

34
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,720
We broke up long time ago.

35
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,790
There's nothing between us anymore.

36
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,600
I didn't want you to worry.

37
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,950
So, I've been keeping it from you.

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,720

39
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,830
Please don't think too much!

40
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,830
It's all in the past.

41
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,000
I've decided to be with you,

42
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,950
and I'll love you with my whole heart!

43
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,880
Please trust me!

44
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,110
Are you serious about marrying me?

45
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,600
Of course I am!

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,920
What are you talking about?

47
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,670
I got a driver,

48
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,200
who'll take you home to rest.

49
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,040
Who played that video?

50
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,510
Was it Xia Qian?

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,670
I don't think it was her.

52
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,000
Why are you so sure?

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,670
Meng.

54
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,000
Think about it.

55
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,670
She's also a victim.

56
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,160
Why would she do such thing to herself?

57
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,550
I didn't mean to suspect her.

58
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,000
I just can't think of anyone else

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,040
who would do something like that!

60
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,390
All I wanted was a lovely,

61
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,270
perfect wedding with Zhijun,

62
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,110
and to receive everybody's best wishes.

63
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,390
Even a small, simple wish like that…

64
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,200
Meng,

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
I promise

66
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,950
I'll find out who did that.

67
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,200
Mr. Xue,

68
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,880
why didn't you give me a heads-up?

69
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
I don't mean to offend you,

70
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,550
but what you did

71
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,790
puts me in a really difficult position!

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,440

73
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,950
to the wedding of Sheng Zhening's sister.

74
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,440
You'd be reluctant to do it.

75
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,070
Besides,

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,070
you are not the only contact
I have in Evergreen;

77

What kinda dirt is that?

79
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,640
Can't believe

80
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,230
it's related to the people I know!

83
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,760
Nothing.

89
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,640
did you really do that?

90
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,920
Are you crazy?

91
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,070
Do you think I would?

What does that mean?

93
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,920
Why would I ruin it?

94
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,350
Why didn't they mention that I was

95
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,480
the one who made the wedding happen?

96
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,480

97
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,390
Do those we-media have any conscience?

98

112
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,229

that you had nothing to do with the video.

119

You are also a victim.

120
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,400
Apparently someone

121
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,910
arranged it on purpose.

127
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,960

128
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
he's got me involved.

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll also investigate

Looks like it's not the girl
who played the video.

138
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,520
So the video must have been replaced.

139
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,030
I've sent people to look into it.

140
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
They'll let me know
if they find out anything.

141

Let's look at it from a different angle.

142
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,670
For instance,

143
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,910
where did they

144
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,840
get this video?

145
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,350
Do you usually keep the videos
from two years ago?

146
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,960
They'd usually be deleted by now.

147
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,790
I'm afraid someone recovered it

148
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,640
with some sort of technique.

149
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,110

in his own wedding.

152
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,280
What about the people
who had access to the video back then?

153
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,880
We keep a record

This is my last day
working in Evergreen.

161
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,960
It took me some time to pack.

162
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,550
So…

163
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,400
have you got your paycheck?

164
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,280

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,080
Thank you!

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,080
Why… Why do you want to see me?

167
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,760
I have a younger sister,

168
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,760
who's feeling down today.

169
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,710
I want to comfort her,

170
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,640
but I'm not sure how.

171
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Since you are also a girl,

172
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,150
I'm thinking maybe you can

173
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,030
give me some ideas.

174
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,280
You are talking about Ning Meng, right?

175
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,790
Comforting a girl…

176
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,320
Every girl has her own personality,

177
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,670
so you need to adopt different ways.

178
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,760
My way may not work on her.

179
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,230
Boys' way of thinking

180
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,840
can be very different

181
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
from that of girls'.

182
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,640
Boys tend to solve

183
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,350
the problems quickly,

184
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,440
but when girls are faced

185
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
with a problem,

186
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,400
they may not expect to solve it,

187
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,960
instead, they want to be comforted,

188
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,880
and have someone

189
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
to talk to.

190
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,520
Anyway, you should do
whatever you can to cheer her up.

191
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,440

Mr. Sheng,

I'm sorry,

205

but I'm still outside for business.

206
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,350
It'd take me at least 20 minutes to get back.

You “robbed” a kid, didn't you?

224
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,400
I did not.

225
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,400

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,950
We can't get a hold of him,

384
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,350
and we are quite concerned.

385
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Is he home?

386
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
I don't know where he is either.

387
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,040
He hasn't been home for a long time.

388
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,280
Plus, I don't  want to have

389
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,470
anything to do with him.

390
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,680
Please go back.

391
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,160
Well…

392
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,110
Let's go.

393
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,760
How was it?

394
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,800
Got anything?

395
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,310
Nothing.

396
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,190
Let's go back first.

397
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,400
We can figure out something else.

398
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,190
I think Chen Kang's wife was lying.

399
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
There's a huge

400
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,830
wedding picture on the wall.

401
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,640
If it's really like she said that she didn't

402
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,430
want to have anything to do with him,

403
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,760
why would she still

404
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,950
hang the picture on the wall?

405
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,430
Besides, when she closed the door,

406
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,680
I noticed that there was a pair
of man's shoes on the rack.

407
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,000
If Chen Kang hasn't been home for long,

408
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,310
his shoes should've been put away.

409
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,520
But why are they still

410
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,680
put on the shoe rack?

411
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,880
Makes sense!

412
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,000
Good for you, Miss Xia!

413
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,160
How about we wait here?

414
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,590
I think Chen Kang will be back.

415
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,070
Okay.

416
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,950
Then you two wait here.

417
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,190
I'll go wait at the entrance of the street.

418
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,710
I'll give you a heads up if he's back.

419
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,920
Let's take a seat.

420
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
So many mosquitos!

421
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,760
It's a mosquito!

422
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,280
Don't move!

423
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,070
I wasn't trying to take advantage of you!

424
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,070
I… I'm a little hungry.

425
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,310
I'll go buy some food.

426
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,310
Excuse me. Check, please!

427
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,000
Here's your bill.

428
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,000
The signal is bad here.

429
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,230
You can use our Wi-Fi.

430
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,000
Let me.

431
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,310
Done. Thanks!

432
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,160
Thank you!

433
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,470
How come your phone connected

434
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,830
to their Wi-Fi automatically?

435
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,310
You've been here before?

436
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,430
I came here once with my coworker.

437
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,520
With your coworker?

438
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,230
Your hospital is very far from here.

439
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,070
Which coworker did you come here with?

440
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,560
You came here with Xia Qian, didn't you?

441
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,560
This place is so close to Worth Or Not.

442
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,190
I didn't come here with Xia Qian.

443
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,880
You misunderstood.

444
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,310
If you didn't come here with Xia Qian,

445
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,400
could you call that coworker right now

446
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,680
to prove it?

447
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,400
Actually it was Director Lu.

448
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't think it's proper to call him

449
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,280
for something like this.

450
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,240
[Director Lu]

451
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,920
Hello? He.

452
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,950
Director Lu.

453
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,160
Well…

454
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,160
After the lecture at the
medical school last week,

455
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,710
we had a meal at
Xiangyu Restaurant, right?

456
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,560
Yes.

457
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,880
And you paid for it.

458
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,520
What is it?

459
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,110
Oh, nothing.

460
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:55,950
I see!

461
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,070
He,

462
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,190
you've been questioned, right?

463
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,070
It was me. Tell her to relax.

464
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,640
Okay.

465
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,710
Thank you, Director Lu.

466
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,520
Honey, sorry I wronged you!

467
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,310
I do trust you!

468
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,830
Then let's go.

469
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,350
Okay!

470
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,000
Come on.

471
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,000
I bought some food.

472
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,000
See what you'd like.

473
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,110
Why did it take you so long?

474
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,000
I see there are many
food stands on the street.

475
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,520
But you don't eat street food, do you?

476
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,110
Come here!

477
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,430
Is he back?

478
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,640
He saw me!

479
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,280
Stay here!

480
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,760
Stop!

481
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,110
Chen Kang!

482
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,800
Stop!

483
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,160
Don't run!

484
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,430
Xia Qian!

485
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,590
Are you okay?

486
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,640
He ran away!

487
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,310
I told you to stay there!

488
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,280
Why did you come over?

489
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,190
But

490
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,830
I was helping you to catch him!

491
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,190
See!

492
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,230
He's gone!

493
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,110
You were helping me?

494
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,470
You were just causing trouble!

495
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,230
What if you were hit?

496
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,000
Why are you yelling at me?

497
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,310
I wanted to help! What's wrong with that?

498
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm not your subordinate anyway!

499
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
Why must I listen to you?

500
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,280
Let me take you home!

501
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,430
I don't need you.

502
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,560
What's the matter?

503
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,640
Tried to run, huh?

504
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,950
I just bought the grilled noodles!

505
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,280
How dare you run?

506
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,040
Hello? An An.

507
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,590
Mr. Sheng,

508
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,280
I caught Chen Kang.

509
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,110
No one gave me money

510
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,280
or asked me to do it.

511
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm just pissed off with Evergreen.

512
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,110
I was supposed to be promoted last year.

513
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,680
But I got disqualified just because

514
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,070
I was late for work.

515
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,040
I'm so tired of it!

516
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,920
I want you to be humiliated!

517
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,590
Take him out.

518
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,040
Do you believe what Chen Kang said?

519
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,590
Since he was so determined

520
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,040
to take full responsibility for it,

521
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,400
I'm convinced even more

522
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,040
that someone plotted the whole thing.

523
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,070
Then…

524
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,160
In that case,

525
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,560
we'll just have to play along

526
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,040
and pretend that we believe him

527
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,520
in case we accidentally alert the enemy.

528
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,160
One more thing,

529
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,110
draft out a management plan.

530
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,040
We've got to strengthen the management

531
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,350
of our hotel's cyber security.

532
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,230
I'll arrange it right now.

533
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,000
Go ahead.

534
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,000
[Mr. Xue]
I heard Chen Kang was arrested, and

535
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,880
[Mr. Xue]
Sheng Zhening has contacted the media.

536
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,280
That's right.

537
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,680
But don't worry.

538
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,950
I've got everything under control.

539
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,400
He wouldn't give away anything.

540
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,430
Good.

541
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,760
But, Mr. Xue,

542
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,830
I worked in Evergreen for six years;

543
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,760
I don't think you can find

544
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
anyone else who knows

545
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,760
Sheng Zhening's business strategies

546
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,950
and style of doing things better than I do.

547
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,070
So, I suggest you continue to let me

548
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,950
take care of Evergreen's matters.

549
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,920
Okay. Thanks!

550
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,230
I didn't think through this matter.

551
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,400
Thank you for your help!

552
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,230
Are you asleep?

553
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
I lost my temper today.

554
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

555
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,920
Sorry!

556
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,950
Meng.

557
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,430
What are you thinking, sitting here alone?

558
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,400
Honey.

559
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,400
I think it's all my fault.

560
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,950
What's wrong?

561
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,280
If I hadn't asked Xia Qian

562
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,430
to haggle for me,

563
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,040
my brother and his hotel
wouldn't have been in trouble,

564
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,760
and no one would've found out

565
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,310
that Xia Qian was your ex-girlfriend,

566
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,230
neither would I have found out

567
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,800
your past with her,

568
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,560
and we could've had a lovely wedding.

569
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,000
Meng.

570
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,590
Look.

571
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,590
Our wedding was already held.

572
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,710
And we are having a happy life together.

573
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,880
How about this?

574
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,430
Let's go relax and have some fun

575
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,350
this weekend.

576
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,680
Don't think about those things anymore!

577
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,310
Honey.

578
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,310
Will you think I'm useless?

579
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,230
How come?

580
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,710
Stop worrying.

581
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Your brother will

582
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,350
find a way to solve the problem.

583
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,920
It'll be fine.

584
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,360
Why did you come

585
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,909
to my apartment this early?

586
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,840
You will sign the contract today, right?

587
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,280
Yes.

588
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,039
Why? You have something to say?

589
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,430
Let me give you a ride.

590
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,630
You got injured

591
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,760
when you tried to help Evergreen.

592
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,470
I should be responsible for that.

593
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,630
So I'll be your driver

594
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,870
for a few days.

595
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,190
Consider it my way of saying sorry.

596
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,430
What?

597
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,040
You were speaking quietly.

598
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
I didn't quite hear you.

599
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,230
I shouldn't have yelled

600
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,120
at you last night.

601
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,430
I'm sorry!

602
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,760
I wouldn't get upset for such

603
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,560
a small matter.

604
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,320
And I admit that I was

605
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,390
being reckless last night.

606
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,670
I know you suffered

607
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,710
a lot these days

608
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,840
for helping Ning Meng.

609
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,600
Anyway,

610
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,430
just let me know if you need

611
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,040
any help in the future.

612
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,430
“Suffer” is an overstatement.

613
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,760
I was just doing my job.

614
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,390
Thank you for your nice gesture,

615
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,190
but I don't think it's proper

616
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,320
to let you be my driver.

617
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,040
So, you can leave now.

618
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,630
I'm going back.

619
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
He wants to do something nice for you.

620
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,910
Why did you refuse?

621
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,950
The wedding incident is over now.

622
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,360
Sheng Zhening and I
no longer work together.

623
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,630
So, there's no need to remain in contact.

624
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I thought

625
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,910
there'd be some sparks between you two

626
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,320
after spending all this time together.

627
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,670
Between him and me?

628
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,710
I'm right, aren't I?

629
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,910
Impossible!

630
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,600
Why is it impossible?

631
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,190
Listen.

632
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,150
Quarrelsome couples are always like that!

633
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,190
Just like those stereotype idol dramas.

634
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,670
It's the same as you and Mr. Sheng.

635
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,840
Watch too much TV, huh?

636
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,360
I'm shipping you and Mr. Sheng.

637
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,430
Shipping?

638
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,910
You like him?

639
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,230
Could you not mix the drama plots

640
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,870
with realities?

641
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,080
Sheng Zhening and me, I don't think so.

642
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,150
We are from two different worlds,

643
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,320
and we have different personalities,

644
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,560
different working environments,

645
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,360
different thoughts, different everything.

646
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,320
The fate led us on the wrong track before,

647
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,560
and now we are back on track.

648
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,230
Bad news! Bad news!

649
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,710
Bad news!

650
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,910
What's the matter?

651
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,870
Something happened to Evergreen!

652
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,230
[Evergreen Hotel Broke Contract]
My fiancée and I were supposed
to get married on May 8.

653
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,230
We booked Evergreen Hotel.

654
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,870
But our wedding got canceled

655
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,910
after we paid the deposit.

656
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,230
And our spot was taken

657
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,670
by the sister of Evergreen's GM.

658
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,910
The wedding is very important

659
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,430
to my fiancée.

660
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,710
Evergreen totally broke its contract

661
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,630
with us for the GM's sister's wedding.

662
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,150
Therefore, we must seek justice.

663
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,910
Han Chao is lying!

664
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,560
He is!

665
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,600
He agreed to reschedule himself!

666
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,910
What should we do now?

667
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,280
It's relevant to us.

668
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,000
The PR Dept. has started taking care of it,

669
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,150
but the video spread out

670
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,280
on the Internet quickly.

671
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,910
And there are already many

672
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,360
negative comments about Evergreen.

673
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,870
Find the Agreement of Rescheduling
that Han Chao signed.

674
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,040
Okay.

675
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,360
Please find the Agreement
of Rescheduling signed by Han Chao.

676
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,670
The agreement is missing!

677
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,320
I've taken care of the agreement.

678
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,150
Without evidence,

679
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,120
Sheng Zhening has no way to deny it.

680
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,280
This thing per se wouldn't

681
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,360
have much impact on Evergreen.

682
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,390
Although, we need to make
the public voice louder.

683
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,430
Do not let it stop!

684
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,910
Mr. Yu is a fence-sitter.

685
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,320
He will change his mind when he see
those negative comments

686
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,670
about Evergreen.

687
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,910
Ask Mr. Xue to take this chance
to approach him,

688
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
and see if it's possible to convince him
to transfer the shares.

689
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,430
Okay.
