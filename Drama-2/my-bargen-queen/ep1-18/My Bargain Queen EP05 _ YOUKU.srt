Why did you send so many things?

123

They are not available to buy.

128
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,239
You should eat seasonal vegetables,

130

You always say that
you are starting a business.

146

You didn't make a lot of money.

147
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,510
You might as well come back

148

and learn to run business from me.

149
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,750

Here you are.

167
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,240
Spray it.

168
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,070

Come on here.

171
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,600
Don't sleep.

172
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,800
Give me my

173
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,310
floral water.

174
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,430
Can you stop moving?

175
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:00,960
No way.

176
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,840
I like this.

177
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,160
I really admire you.

178

You have a warm nest.

179
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,510
Someone feeds you every day.

180
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,840
You don't have to pay rent

181
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,040
or look for a job,

182
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,630
let alone be forced
to go back to hometown

183
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,040
to find a boyfriend.

184
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,800
How happy you are.

Cheers.

186
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,840
Did you break up?

187
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,160
Drinking is not necessarily
because of broken love.

188
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:49,990
Cheesy!

189
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,840
You are drinking alone on the rooftop.

190
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,240
If you didn't break up,

191
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,240
did you encounter a setback

192
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,240
in your career and is lost?

193
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,990
Wandering in a big city

194
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,750
makes me inevitably helpless.

195
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,870
Have you started a business?

196
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,190
Yes.

197
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,190
My asset used to be over 100 million,

198
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,190
but I went bankrupt.

199
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,750
Over 100 million?

200
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,800
I don't believe it.

201
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,870
You must be bragging.

202
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
It doesn't matter
whether it's true or not.

203
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,310
As long as you smile.

204
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,800
Save it.

205
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,870
Stop drinking this.

206
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,310
Follow me.

207
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,720
Where are we going?

208
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,190
You old hand.

209
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,840
You know quite a lot.

210
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,550
Wait.

211
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,670
Where is this?

212
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,800
[Vice General Manager's Office]
Vice General Manager.

213
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,310
Qin Hebo's office.

214
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,310
How do you know the password?

215
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,670
I saw him open the door once.

216
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,550
And I remembered the password.

217
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
You old hand.

218
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,160
You really get a nerve.

219
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,630
Take a look.

220
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,630
What are you doing?

221
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,400
Drinking.

222
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,240
We will be found out.

223
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,310
Relax.

224
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,750
No one knows Qin Hebo's whereabouts

225
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,990
better than me.

226
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,550
He is on a business trip.

227
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,510
Good for you.

228
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,750
Come on.

229
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,750
Have a drink.

230
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,960
You will

231
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,360
lose your job sooner or later.

232
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,990
You are so bold.

233
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,840
Then drink it back.

234
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,360
Cheers.

235
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,480
Nice wine.

236
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,840
Want more?

237
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,630
Cheers.

238
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,840
Ms. Xia.

239
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,040
Good morning.

240
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,360
I just got up.

241
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,510
Bye.

242
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,310
I almost remembered.

243
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,160
Let me check.

244
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,430
Turn left after going out of the village.

245
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,990
Go straight ahead.

246
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,920
Just walk down the hill

247
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,630
and that's it, right?

248
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,670
Yes.

249
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,070
Thank you, sir.

250
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,990
Thank you for your care.
You are welcome.

251
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,600
I am leaving.

252
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,400
The road uphill is slippery.
Be careful.

253
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,240
Okay, thank you.

254
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:02,870
Okay.

255
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,840
What are you doing?

256
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,720
What are you doing?

257
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,840
Let go.

258
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,790
Stay away from me.

259
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,190
Why did you pull me?

260
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,640
Why did you drag me?

261
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
Ms. Xia, aren't you shameless?

262
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,550
Isn't it?

263
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,670
How to get out?

264
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,190
In this case,

265
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,070
the two of us have to cooperate.

266
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,240
You…

267
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,670
You carry me.

268
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,960
I'll go up first.

269
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,030
Then I will pull you up.

270
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,760
How did you come up with this idea?

271
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,480
Why should I carry you?

272
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,600
Or what?

273
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,150
Of course I go up first.

274
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,240
Let's do this.

275
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,240
Rock-paper-scissors.

276
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,960
The loser carries.

277
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,070
Okay.

278
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,640
Come on.

279
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,790
Come on.

280
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,670
Ready.

281
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,640
Rock-paper-scissors.

282
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,150
Go.

283
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,270
Where should I carry you?

284
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,840
Over there.

285
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,600
Come on.

286
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,550
Laugh again.

287
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,480
Come on.

288
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,310
Forget it.

289
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,240
You go up first.

290
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,000
Let me do this.

291
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,000
Okay.

292
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,390
Here you are.

293
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,520
Just carry me here.

294
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,550
Hold on.

295
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,310
What are you doing?

296
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,880
Are you ready?

297
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,880
Stand up.

298
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,760
Get on.

299
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,880
Be careful.

300
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,030
Come on.

301
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,270
I'm working hard.

302
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,600
Wait a moment.

303
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,190
Come on.

304
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,030
So high.

305
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,600
Wait.

306
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,960
Mr. Sheng.

307
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,270
Catch me.

308
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
I can't stretch anymore.

309
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,960
Show your sincerity.

310
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,600
This is my greatest sincerity.

311
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
I'm about to fall.

312
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,520
Work hard.

313
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,760
You see the reality.

314
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,600
I really did my best.

315
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,070
Sorry.

316
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,120
What do you mean?

317
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,720
Well.

318
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,000
I will ask others for help.

319
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,720
Wait for me to come back.

320
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,720
Take care.

321
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,720
Take care.

322
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,310
Young man.

323
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,030
How did you fall?

324
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,550
Brother!

325
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,430
Sir.

326
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,960
Excuse me.

327
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,640
Is Mr. Han here?

328
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,360
He is upstairs.

329
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,070
Upstairs.

330
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,600
Thanks.

331
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,910
Ms. Xia.

332
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,880
I am a businessman.

333
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,240
I have a lot of acquaintances.

334
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,670
I can't do a destination wedding.

335
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,120
And we have already notified
our relatives and friends.

336
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,480
How could we just simply cancel it?

337
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,670
Mr. Han.

338
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,270
I didn't say you should cancel it.

339
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,640
I mean

340
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,600
you can

341
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,760
postpone the date.

342
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,240
Don't you want to hold a wedding
in Evergreen?

343
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,760
Evergreen has never been relocated

344
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,480
for decades.

345
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
But luxury liner is completely different.

346
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,790
It waits for no one.

347
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,070
Take a look.

348
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,550
It waits for no one

349
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,120
A destination wedding

350
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,000
is your wife's dream.

351
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,600
Speaking a vow under the stars
of the Aegean Sea

352
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,430
is much more meaningful than

353
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,030
in front of relatives.

354
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,880
I know.

355
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,070
But…

356
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,270
Stop it.

357
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,550
Dreams are the most precious.

358
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,910
I mean it.

359
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,240
Luxury liner is only one chance.

360
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,480
Now or never.

361
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:43,910
I…

362
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,550
You!

363
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,310
Hello, Mr. Han.

364
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,640
This is my business card.

365
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,760
I am the general manager of Evergreen.

366

[Sheng Zhening, General Manager of Evergreen Hotel]
My name is Sheng Zhening.

367
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,430
If you continue to choose

368
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,240
to hold your wedding in Evergreen,

369
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,520
I will pay for

370
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,480
all the wedding expenses.

371
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,640
I was so close.

372
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,790
So close.

373
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,390
Don't be discouraged.

374
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,910
It's not yet May.

375
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,600
Let's try others.

376
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,600
No more chance.

377
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,670
So

378
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,960
you want a destination wedding more?

379
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,790
We can travel

380
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,390
at any time.

381
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,910
After I ship the goods,

382
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,390
I will take you

383
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,150
to the Aegean Sea.

384
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,430
But you say that every year.

385
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,270
I am

386
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,150
just busy.

387
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,550
Hello.

388
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,840
Is that Ms. Xia?

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,600
This is Han Chao.

390
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,880
Is the wedding transfer agreement
you mentioned last time

391
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,120
still valid?

392
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,670
Of course.

393
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,030
Is it convenient for you
to sign it now?

394
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,670
Yes.

395
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,390
So convenient.

396
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,120
Wait for me.

397
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,270
I will go to your house now.

398
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,670
OK, see you later.

399
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,360
Okay.

400
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,150
Hello, Xia.

401
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,430
Meng.

402
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,790
The transfer agreement was signed.

403
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,190
I am waiting for you
at Evergreen Hotel.

404
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,790
Let's go through the handover procedures.

405
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,840
Really? Great!

406
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,790
Xia,

407
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,430
my husband and I will go over here.

408
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,790
Wait for us.

409
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,720
Sure.

410
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,430
What's up?

411
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,480
I just want to inform you that

412
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,720
Evergreen Hotel will go out of business

413
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,640
on May 8th.

414
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,720
Sheng Zhening.

415
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,000
Do you have principles?

416
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,760
What about your so-called rules?

417
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,030
Listen.

418
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,390
This is called breach of contract.

419
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,600
I can sue you.

420
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,670
Even if Evergreen closes,

421
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,390
I won't let Ning Meng hold the wedding.

422
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,720
Why?

423
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,360
Do you have to make it hard
for Ning Meng?

424
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,310
She is your sister.

425
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,720
Because He Zhijun is a jerk.

426
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,910
I can't just watch

427
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,270
my own sister

428
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,640
make the wrong choice.

429
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,390
Hello.

430
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,480
Is that Mr. Sheng?

431
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,640
Your sister had a car accident.

432
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,550
Come here quickly.

433
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,640
How is my sister?

434
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,310
Relax, she's okay.

435
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,840
Ning Meng was just frightened.

436
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,670
She is asleep now.

437
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,790
Her boyfriend was hurt more seriously.

438
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,190
There are multiple abrasions
on his arm.

439
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,520
But it's fine.

440
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,360
Where is she?

441
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Ward 305.

442
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,880
Okay, thank you.

443
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,520
Doctor.

444
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,720
Where is the driver who caused the accident?

445
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,760
Why are you still here?

446
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,480
I'm waiting for you.

447
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
I want to show you something.

448
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,240
It was He Zhijun who saved Ning Meng.

449
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,190
Although he is not a good person,

450
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,720
he does love Ning Meng.

451
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,150
Does your arm still hurt?

452
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,520
I am fine.

453
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,600
I should be fine in a few days.

454
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,720
Since you are fine,

455
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,790
hurry up and

456
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,960
prepare for the wedding on the 8th.

457
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,480
Zhening.

458
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,360
You agreed?

459
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,430
I was opposed to Meng

460
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,670
getting married so early.

461
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,270
But after what happened today,

462
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,390
I can tell that

463
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,430
your love for her is true.

464
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,150
Meng

465
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,600
is sometimes very willful.

466
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,190
Once she gets angry,

467
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,720
it's hard to coax her.

468
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,480
But she is very serious and

469
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,720
responsible for relationship.

470
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,430
Once she likes you,

471
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,520
she will give you her heart.

472
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,910
I can tell that

473
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,840
she really loves you.

474
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,390
And you love her, too.

475
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,030
So I sincerely wish you happiness.

476
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,670
Thank you, Zhening.

477
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,070
But before I entrust Meng to you,

478
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,000
you have to promise me two things.

479
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,670
Go ahead.

480
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,550
You should be very clear
about Meng's condition.

481
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,310
No matter what happens in the future,

482
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,960
you should care about her feelings

483
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
and prevent her from being hurt.

484
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,880
Okay.

485
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,550
And Xia Qian.

486
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,910
I already know the relationship

487
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,190
between you and Xia Qian.

488
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,120
Never let Meng

489
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,070
know about this.

490
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,360
So please stay away from Xia Qian.

491
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,150
This is better

492
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
for you, Meng,

493
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:42,880
and for Xia Qian.

494
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,360
I see, Zhening.

495
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,030
I will definitely do it.

496
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,670
Okay, take care of your injuries.

497
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,430
Take a good rest.

498
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,880
Zhening.

499
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,760
Thank you.

500
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,520
I will take good care of Meng.

501
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,150
How do you feel?

502
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,960
Are you still dizzy?

503
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,760
Brother, how is Zhijun?

504
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,960
He is fine.

505
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,190
It's just a slight scratch.

506
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
No, I have to see him.

507
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,520
No.

508
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,430
Take care of yourself first.

509
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,840
But he…

510
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,790
How can you get married

511
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,790
if you're not recovered?

512
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
Brother, you approve of our marriage?

513
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,000
As long as you don't regret.

514
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,310
I hope for nothing else

515
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,720
but your happiness.

516
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:17,720
Brother.

517
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,480
Lie down.

518
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,320
[Hebo]

519
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,880
Hello.

520
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,270
I just went to the hospital
to visit Meng.

521
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,520
She is very happy.

522
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,360
She said you agreed.

523
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,760
Yes.

524
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,390
What's wrong?

525
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,190
Your voice seems unhappy.

526
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,150
I do feel uncomfortable.

527
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,760
Well.

528
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,800
Let's drink at usual place.

529
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,320
Okay, wait for me.

530
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,280
Here is the wine.

531
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,870
As usual.

532
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,389
I will greet the guests first.

533
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,959
This way.

534
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,960
What's wrong with you?

535
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,960
Do you regret

536
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,110
letting her get married?

537
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,670
Marriage is good.

538
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,280
Why are you unhappy?

539
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,000
No idea.

540
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,240
It's an indescribable feeling.

541
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,760
Do you feel frustrated?

542
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,040
Excited, reluctant,

543
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,870
happy and sad.

544
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,040
All kinds of emotions
surged up all at once.

545
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,320
It doesn't feel like your sister
is going to get married,

546
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,830
but your daughter.

547
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,590
You just care too much about Meng.

548
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,800
You have to know that

549
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,080
she is no longer the little girl

550
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,630
who followed you all the time.

551
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,800
You can no longer discipline her
like a child.

552
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,080
She is not as fragile as you think.

553
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,110
Exactly.

554
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,430
Meng is already 22 years old.

555
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,390
She's grown up and mature now.

556
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,390
She can choose the life she wants.

557
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
She can also be responsible
for her choice.

558
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,150
You have to believe her.

559
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,000
Besides,

560
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,720
with a brother like you,

561
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,350
how could she be wronged?

562
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,830
You are right.

563
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,320
In my opinion,

564
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,110
in terms of relationship,

565
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,560
you, as an elder brother,

566
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,240
have to learn from your sister.

567
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,760
You are not young.

568
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,560
Should you also consider

569
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,720
your marriage?

570
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,350
We are talking about Meng.

571
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,760
Why am I involved?

572
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Moreover,

573
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,190
you are also single.

574
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,720
Why should I be in a hurry?

575
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,480
In the worst case,
we are both single.

576
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,590
Stop it.

577
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,670
Don't have anything to do with me.

578
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,830
I don't want to be single.

579
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,560
Cheers.

580
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,320
Cheers.

581
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,430
This is the wedding transfer contract

582
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,430
of Mr. and Mrs. Han.

583
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,520
Please confirm it.

584
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,000
[Sheng Zhening]

585
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,670
Well,

586
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
the wedding schedule on 8th is over.

587
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,520
I am leaving.

588
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,720
Ms. Xia.

589
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,670
Are you considering going on with

590
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,590
the car group buying case?

591
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,040
You want me to continue?

592
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,720
In fact,

593
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
you did more than half

594
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,960
of the work of car group buying.

595
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,630
The Procurement Dept.
has been unable to negotiate

596
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,830
the pricing you want.

597
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,000
Manager Sun told me

598
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,430
about your strong ability

599
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,040
and wants you to continue.

600
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
The remuneration is the same
as we agreed before.

601
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,800
What do you think?

602
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,520
Okay.

603
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,000
I will take that.

604
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,000
I am leaving.

605
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,000
Why can't the Procurement Dept.

606
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,830
even deal with the car group buying case?

607
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,760
Manager Sun even wanted Ms. Xia
to continue?

608
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,190
I got it.

609
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,040
Are you deliberately

610
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,110
giving the case to Ms. Xia?

611
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,080
You have nothing else to do?

612
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,110
Manager Sun.

613
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Ms. Xia.

614
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Thank you.

615
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,630
I took the car group buying case.

616
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,520
Thank you for recommending me
to Mr. Sheng.

617
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,190
Mr. Sheng handed you

618
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,110
the car group buying case?

619
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,150
Yes.

620
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,320
Don't you know about it?

621
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
Maybe Mr. Sheng was so busy

622
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,870
that forgot to tell me.

623
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,320
Since the last time

624
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,430
I saw you bargaining,

625
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,350
I have been studying how to bargain.

626
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,630
I even bought two books.

627
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,280
I didn't expect Mr. Sheng

628
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,520
to hand over the case to you.

629
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,670
But it's okay.

630
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,190
After all you are professional.

631
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,240
It should be more assured for him

632
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,590
to leave it to you.

633
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,520
Ms. Xia.

634
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,720
I have to go.

635
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,150
Okay.

636
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,670
Zhijun.

637
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,630
Doesn't the wedding need to be postponed?

638
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,960
Your hand injury
is not completely healed yet.

639
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,110
Holding a wedding in Evergreen
in May

640
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,480
is what you have always been
longing for.

641
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,240
I said I will do it for you.

642
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,320
Zhijun.

643
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,590
Now in this world,

644
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,800
except my brother,

645
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,760
no one treats me better than you.

646
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,590
I am so lucky to meet you.

647
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,190
I will hold the most perfect wedding

648
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,430
and let the whole world know that
I am married to you.

649
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,830
Okay, it's all up to you.

650
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,000
Let's go.

651
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
We agreed to

652
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,000
take wedding photos in the afternoon.

653
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,150
Let's go.

654
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,000
Stop.

655
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,670
From today

656
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,150
I will learn to take care of you.

657
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,430
Let's go.

658
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,040
So heavy.

659
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,150
Manager Sun didn't recommend me at all.

660
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,910
Then why did Sheng Zheling say that?

661
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,430
He was making an excuse.

662
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,320
Think about it.

663
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,350
Sheng Zhening is the boss
of Evergreen.

664
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,720
He wants to give you an order,

665
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,870
but because of his ego,

666
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,870
he can't say it directly.

667
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,110
So he took Manager Sun as an excuse.

668
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,040
Why does he insist on

669
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,960
handing over the order

670
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,240
of car group buying to me?

671
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,110
It must be because he did something wrong

672
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,560
and feels guilty,

673
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,670
so he wants to make up for you.
