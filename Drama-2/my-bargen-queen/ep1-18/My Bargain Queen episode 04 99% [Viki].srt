<i>[Episode 4]</i>

4
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,200
Well...you kept the cat secret for me as well.

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,140
Friends help each other.

6
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
What's wrong?

7
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,560
In fact...

8
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,590
To be honest...

9
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,370
I'm a spy.

10
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,350
What spy?

11
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,570
A corporate spy.

12
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,020
I don't even recognize Qin Hebo.

13
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,920
I made it all up.

14
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,710
My goal is to actually

15
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,180
steal something from him.

16
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,540
Steal what?

17
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,690
You have to swear you won't tell anyone else.

18
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,010
I swear.

19
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,940
Your hotel's May wedding guest list.

20
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,540
That's it?

21
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,160
This is such a big secret.

22
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,310
Why don't you have any reaction?

23
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,080
Then, why don't I tell you a secret?

24
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,230
I am also a spy.

25
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,840
What spy?

26
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,860
My goal is to take over the entire Evergreen Hotel.

27
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,780
I'm not joking with you.

28
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,040
I am also not joking with you.

29
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,970
Forget it. Just take it as if I never said anything.

30
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,010
Meow.

31
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,630
I have so many hardships.

32
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,910
As long as you can hear me that's enough.

33
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,010
Okay, I understand. It's fine.

34
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,740
You go ahead. It's okay.

35
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,980
Something just came up with the agent and they can't come. Let's eat.

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,450
Okay.

37
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,100
<i>If you really can't, then get him drunk </i>

38
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,540
<i>and when he is unconscious, trick him into giving you the password.</i>

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,130
GM Sheng,

40
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,070
why don't we drink?

41
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,670
What did you say?

42
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,970
It was just a suggestion.

43
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,780
Don't take it too seriously.

44
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,950
During work hours, you can't drink wine. Understand?

45
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,930
Didn't you not drink?

46
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,750
Why are you dizzy?

47
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,390
What are you doing?

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,960
I have a headache.

49
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,410
Are you okay?

50
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,190
I can help guide you over there.

51
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,050
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,450
What is this?

53
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,850
Don't, don't touch it.

54
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,230
You have a fever.

55
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,610
It is a high fever, 39℃.

56
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,040
It must have spread from Anan. I put this on so you will feel better.

57
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,280
The medicine is right here. Remember to take it.

58
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,250
You didn't eat anything for dinner.

59
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,390
If you take medicine on an empty stomach you will feel uncomfortable.

60
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,730
You can't even hear me if I say anything.

61
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,930
Sheng Zhening?

62
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,060
Sheng Zhening?

63
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,280
Wake up, drink some of this mung bean soup I made.

64
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,770
I don't like sweets.

65
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't like sweets?

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,990
Let me tell you,

67
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,740
this mung bean soup doesn't have sugar.

68
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,120
But this is the best food to break your fever.

69
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,200
When I was little I used to drink this, I didn't need medicine.

70
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
Listen to me and just drink it.

71
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,040
You want me to feed you?

72
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,940
What are you doing?

73
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,760
Your hands are dirty.

74
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,490
Brother,

75
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,810
I washed them.

76
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,280
I washed them three times. Three times. Three times.

77
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,460
Oh.

78
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,180
You need to work with me.

79
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,810
I am using a physical cooling method. It will make you feel a lot better.

80
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,910
Thank you.

81
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,400
Do you not feel well?

82
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,220
Xiaohe,

83
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,560
Director Lu, you're looking for me?

84
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,880
I just attended a meeting and they decided

85
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,690
starting next week, two of my patients will be transferred to you.

86
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,770
What's wrong?

87
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,740
According to the initial tests, your methods may be more suitable than mine.

88
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,020
Xiaohe, your...

89
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,300
It's fine.

90
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,630
Xiaohe, what's wrong? You seem absent-minded.

91
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,950
Oh, no.

92
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,150
My last patient's condition is a bit complicated and I am still figuring out the solution.

93
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh.

94
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,770
I heard that you are getting married soon. Have you guys set the date yet?

95
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,400
Almost.

96
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,580
You are getting married pretty young.

97
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,990
Soon you will understand what a sweet burden is.

98
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,060
Director Lu, don't joke around.

99
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,840
Okay, I won't bother you anymore. I'll head out.

100
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,850
I can't wait to drink and celebrate with you at your wedding.

101
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,290
Take care, Director Lu.

102
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,540
GM Sheng, you're ok?

103
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,810
You've recovered? The fever is gone?

104
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,110
Already totally recovered.

105
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,640
Where is she?

106
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,230
Sister Xia took care of you all night so I told her to go get some rest.

107
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,590
Good

108
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,970
Sister Xia sent over some green bean soup.

109
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,050
Got it.

110
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,880
That thing...did you tell her?

111
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,590
What thing?

112
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,710
You mean the thing about turning her down?

113
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,430
I didn't tell her.

114
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,560
Don't tell her yet.

115
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,930
Mr. Sheng, are you...

116
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,920
I'll tell her when I get back.

117
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,030
If I accidentally see her again, it's awkward.

118
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,590
Oh.

119
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,940
Sister Xia said since you're sick, you can't drink coffee.

120
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,810
In the future, just change coffee to milk.

121
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,920
Okay

122
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,370
You can go.

123
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,410
Hello? Ms. Ning Meng?

124
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,880
I have situation.

125
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,060
For the schedule thing,

126
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,410
I really can't help.

127
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,960
Sister Xia, don't say that. You're my only hope.

128
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,800
I know and can understand your situation.

129
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,170
But you must understand my situation, I already promised you and would do everything I can to help.

130
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,060
If I really had a choice, I wouldn't let it go.

131
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,990
I'm sorry.

132
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,140
Also, I will refund your order.

133
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,410
Sister Xia, I remember you said before

134
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,210
Isn't there also an option regarding the May wedding list?

135
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,410
I've tried already.

136
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,960
I don't have Sheng Zhening's computer password so I can't see the documents.

137
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,220
Sister Xia...I may know his password.

138
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,750
How do you know it?

139
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,610
Sister Xia....

140
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,820
It's a long explanation. Let's meet up and I'll explain.

141
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,780
I'll go to your place.

142
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,370
Ok, I'll wait for you.

143
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,310
You said Sheng Zhening is your brother?

144
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,040
Previously, he got angry because I hired you.

145
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,910
Wait...

146
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,270
Are you guys messing with me?

147
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,190
Sister Xia, I'm really not.

148
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,700
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

149
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,500
If I told you, would you have accepted this contract?

150
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,540
Absolutely not.

151
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,940
This is your family's problem so solve it yourselves.

152
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,760
Isn't it inappropriate for an outsider like me to be involved?

153
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,900
I know I put you in a hard spot.

154
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,360
Sister Xia, I really want to have this wedding.

155
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,550
I believe that if my brother spent time to understand me and Zhijun's relationship,

156
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,120
he wouldn't refuse my request.

157
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,470
But I don't know why, this time he just won't listen to anything I say.

158
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,710
I also understand his temper.

159
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,960
If he makes a decision, it doesn't matter what anyone says.

160
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,510
Sister Xia, if you can't help me, I really don't know what to do.

161
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,420
Then your...

162
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,050
boyfriend...

163
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,200
is he really that great that you won't marry anyone else?

164
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:06,130
When I was at my lowest point

165
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,700
he was the one who helped me through it.

166
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,310
Without him,

167
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,630
I wouldn't be who I am today.

168
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,430
<i>That day, I realized I didn't love you.</i>

169
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,140
<i>I don't want to force us to be together</i>

170
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,320
<i>The day of the engagement you decided you didn't love me anymore?</i>

171
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,760
<i>Xia Qian, there's no rule that we have to love one person forever</i>

172
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,910
Love can change

173
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,160
What I mean is...

174
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,600
what if he doesn't love you in the future?

175
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,740
As long as he loves me now, it's enough.

176
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,220
Sister Xia, you said before

177
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,930
when you got engaged

178
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,330
didn't you feel the same as me?

179
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,150
Yes

180
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,020
Sorry, Sister Xia, I...

181
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,780
Don't worry.

182
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,080
You're sure you want me

183
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,770
to get the list from your brother's computer.

184
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,170
Sister Xia, you're willing to help me?

185
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,070
Well not necessarily. I'm just continuing to honor the contract we signed.

186
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,570
Sister Xia, I know you're the best!

187
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,420
Like a saint?

188
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,180
I also don't want to be like this.

189
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,100
My brother's password is

190
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,360
frangipani plus 0821

191
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,110
What? You said frangipani?

192
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,170
Frangipani was my mother's favorite flower.

193
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,040
Now Evergreen Hotel's garden has some as well.

194
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,400
When my brother has time, he'll go care for them.

195
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,370
8-21 is my mother's birthday.

196
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,920
This password is to remember our mother.

197
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,790
Got it.

198
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
Then...

199
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,510
for the list, I'll try my best to come up with a plan.

200
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,610
I'll leave it to you then, Sister Xia.

201
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,590
Mr. Sheng, here are you clothes for today.

202
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,630
Why did you bring that handkerchief?

203
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,570
Is there something wrong with it?

204
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,130
Nothing, go ahead.

205
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,400
I'll put it on your bed.

206
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,960
I found there's a hole on this handkerchief,

207
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,690
so I embroidered a blue flower.

208
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,960
Hope you don't mind.

Frangipani was my mother's favorite flower.

213
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,550
This frangipani can't be constantly under the sun.

214
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,780
It's wilted because it's been under the sun all day.

215
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,840
Don't water it!

216
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,710
It's wilted because it's under the sun, not because it's dry.

217
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,650
Thank you.

Hello, Sister Xia, what's up?

220
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,550
Ms. Meng, I'm sorry, I can't complete the task.

221
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,680
Why?

222
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,670
It's too hard to explain in a few words.

I'll tell you once I'm back from my business trip, okay?

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,940
Don't be too sad.

227
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,450
I'll go talk to your brother.

Over our time together...

229
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,400
I feel like he understands these sentiments.

230
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,930
I know. Thank you, Sister Xia.

231
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,600
I've rescheduled with the car agent for tomorrow morning.

232
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,300
Did you let Ms. Xia know?

233
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,600
Don't worry, I let her know.

234
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,800
Ms. Xia has been busy recently with work.

235
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,900
She's quite dedicated.

236
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,900
Is there anything fun to do in the area?

237
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,500
Nearby, there's a popular beach with nice views.

238
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Ok,

239
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,400
let's give her half a day of to rest.

240
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,300
Should I get Ms. Xia a driver?

241
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
I will need to go out later.

242
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,800
It should be on the way. Ask her if she wants to ride with me?

243
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,300
Ok.

244
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,600
-Anan 
 -Ms. Xia

245
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,200
Quickly change into your prettiest dress.

246
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
What's going on?

247
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,070
You've been working hard these past couple of days.

248
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,200
GM Sheng wants to give you half a day off.

249
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,230
There's a popular beach nearby

250
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,600
and GM Sheng will be in the area for business.

251
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,000
He wants to know if you want to visit. He can give you a ride?

252
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm not really in the mood to go. It's too much trouble.

253
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,800
What do you mean trouble? It's no trouble.

254
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,100
Also, GM Sheng personally told me to ask you.

255
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
He did?

256
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
Ok, then I'll go.

257
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,300
It just so happens that I also need to discuss something with GM Sheng.

258
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,300
Then, let's meet at 4pm by the hotel entrance.

259
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,500
Just look for GM Sheng.

260
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,000
Ok.

261
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,100
Ms. Jia, GM Sheng's business today

262
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,200
is not that time sensitive.

263
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
You can ask GM Sheng to join you in the park to relax.

264
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
What are you trying to say?

265
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,100
Like chat or something.

266
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,200
I wont disturb you any longer.

267
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,100
GM Sheng, Ms. Xia agreed to go.

268
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,600
Ok.

269
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,360
What's wrong?

270
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,000
The Sales Department sent me a document.

271
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
I can't find it anymore.

272
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,500
-Did you open it recently? 
 -Yes.

273
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,800
Then you can use the "Recently Opened Files" function to find it.

274
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,900
If you opened it, there should be a record.

275
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,300
Found it.

277
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,500

278
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,600
Is there something wrong?

279
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,400
Someone's touched my laptop.

280
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,800
It shows that

281
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,600
this file has been opened today at 10:13am.

282
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,800
I wasn't in the room at the time.

283
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,300
There's no way.

284
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,400
I'm the only other person who has access to the room.

285
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,600
Could it be Ms. Xia?

286
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
Get the security gaurds

287
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,600
to give me the surveillance video of my doorway.

288
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
Ok.

289
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,400
repaid kindness with wrongdoing?

290
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,040
I can't believe it really is Ms. Xia.

291
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,700
Looks like she didn't give up on May wedding list stuff.

292
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,600
The group car buying project is just a cover up.

293
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,600
So she only asked about your personal details to get the password.

294
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
I thought she really liked you.

295
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,000
GM Sheng

296
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,900
Did you do this on purpose?

297
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,800
-Yes 
 - Tell me, what did I do wrong?

298
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,400
You know in your heart what you did.

299
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,300
You really went all out to get my computer password.

300
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,800
You found out.

301
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Actually, I came out because I wanted to talk to you about this.

302
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes, I found out.

303
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What do you want to say?

304
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,700
Say that I got you a job

305
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,200
and you repaid kindness with wrongdoing?

306
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
What do you mean repaid kindness with wrongdoing?

307
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
I came out with you for certain reasons.

308
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,330
But it's not as malicious as you make it out to be.

309
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
You are being unreasonable.

310
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,800
Me, unreasonable?

311
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,600
I think you are the one who is unreasonable.

312
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,500
Who puts in this much effort to organize a wedding for her ex-boyfriend?

313
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,400
What are you trying to prove? That you are over him?

314
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,200
I think you became psychlogically twisted after being dumped.

315
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,380
You've crossed the line, Sheng Zhening.

316
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,000

I'm definitely going to get this contract done.

OK.

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,970
Hello?

335
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,900
GM Sheng. Miss Xia has suddenly decided to leave the hotel.

336
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,460
I've tried everything I could, but couldn't change her mind.

337
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,120
She's returned?

338
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,520
Yes, she has just returned. She was soaking wet.

339
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,980
I thought you went to the beachside together. What happened?

340
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,320
OK. I'll be right back.

341
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,870
OK.

342
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,760
Good for you! How did you get the list?

343
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,350
It's a secret.

344
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,140
A secret? I don't even need you to tell me about it.

345
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,950
You must have colluded with Qin Hebo's driver, and asked him to steal it for you.

346
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,530
You know it too well!

347
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,260
I can see you're truly a commercial spy now.

348
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,870
Of course! It's called acumen.

349
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,160
Tell me. How much money do you want?

350
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,300
Don't talk about money. It hurts our friendship.

351
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,900
How about this. You owe me one this time.

352
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,730
Maybe I'll need your help sometime in the future.

353
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,080
I can't believe you're so generous!

354
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,200
Something's not right. You must be up to something.

355
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,980
I'm up to nothing.

356
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,740
I'm doing it for you as a friend.

357
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,060
You can't be having a crush on me, right?

358
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,700
Don't think about it, I'm telling you!

359
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,050
I'm very realistic. I'm not interested in an old driver.

360
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,370
I don't want to disappoint you.

361
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,410
Yeah, right.

362
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,950
You've barely recovered. You shouldn't have walked in the rain.

363
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,180
Please don't get yourself sick again.

364
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,910
Did she say anything before she left?

365
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,150
Here's a document that Miss Xia put together for the car purchasing project.

366
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,900
She compared Evergreen's car orders in the past five years,

367
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,400
and did some research on the car agent we're working with.

368
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,280
She found out that Manager Xu in our produrement department has been doing something fishy.

369
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,510
He's been colluding with the agent and accepting kickbacks from our orders.

370
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,390
I think we've lost at least one million Yuan because of this.

371
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,230
What do we do?

372
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,730
Stick to the rules. Submit all the evidence and relevant documents to the authorities.

373
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,360
And I actually don't think Miss Xia looks like a bad person.

374
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,720
She's smart and hardworking.

375
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,960
It doesn't look like she's here just to steal things from you.

376
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,740
I'm tired. You can go now.

377
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,790
<i> [Liping Barbecue] </i>

378
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,390
I don't have to go to work at Evergreen tomorrow!

379
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,190
<i> I'm going on a business trip for a few days and won't be back until next week.</i>

380
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,860
<i> Can you take care of the cat for me? </i>

381
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,370
Shuang, when are you resigning?

382
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,030
I'll...do it next week.

383
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,470
What?

384
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,430
Why have you become so passionate about being a cleaner?

385
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,530
No, I'm waiting to receive

386
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,070
my salary next week.

387
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,750
Right.

388
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,120
<i> [Sure.] </i>

389
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,380
Qian! Where are you going?

390
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,290
- The skewers are ready. 
 - What's wrong with her?

391
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,090
I don't know.

392
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,330
<i> Don't take it off! </i>

393
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,790
<i> You're having a fever. </i>

394
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,590
<i> You're at a high temperature of 39°C. </i>

395
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,890
What?

396
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,900
<i>Your hands are dirty.</i>

397
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,790
<i>You need to work with me.</i>

398
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,530
<i>I am using a physical cooling method.</i>

399
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,350
<i>It will make you feel a lot better.</i>

400
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,730
Miss Xia, you've changed your mind?

401
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,060
Yes. I've got Evergreen's wedding list for May.

402
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,590
But we may need to promise them compensation when we negotiate.

403
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,790
As long as they're willing to change their wedding date,

404
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,960
I can even pay for their whole wedding!

405
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,920
OK, I understand. I'll make some preparations.

406
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,690
Thank you, Miss Xia.

407
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,430
No problem. It's my job.

408
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,200
I'll count on you for it.

409
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,730
I’ll be on my way then.

410
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,530
I'll see you then.

411
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,760
This is the list of couples who are wedding in our hotel in May, and their information.

412
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,220
There are so many couples. Do you think Miss Xia will talk to each one of them?

413
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,570
I don't think so.

414
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,320
It will be very ineffective.

415
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,560
She will definitely find the couples that are most likely to be persuaded.

416
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,730
And make a critical hit.

417
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,790
How about this couple who booked for a wedding on May 5th?

418
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,620
- Impossible. 
 - Why?

419
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,190
We can tell that the couple who booked for May 5th are Evergreen's old customers.

420
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,620
The broom's graduation dinner and his sister's wedding were both held at Evergreen.

421
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,190
Obviously, Evergreen Hotel means a lot to them.

422
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,260
What about the couple who booked for May 25th?

423
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,110
They both work office jobs, and they don't make a lot of money.

424
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,060
- Do you think they'll be turned around? 
 - Nor will they.

425
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,400
The couple who booked for May 25 may not be rich,

426
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,590
but they met each other at Evergreen Hotel.

427
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,490
Evergreen Hotel witnessed their love. It's impossible.

428
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,460
The couple who booked for May 8th might change their mind.

429
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,190
"Is the wedding ceremony about the two of us, or about the two families?"

430
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,400
"I always dreamed about taking a wedding trip to the Aegean, but my dream didn't come true."

431
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,100
Although the bride wants a wedding trip, they've decided to have the ceremony at our hotel.

432
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,090
I'm sure they've thought it through.

433
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,270
I don't think Miss Xia would be able to turn them around.

434
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,840
Xia Qian is very talented in this regard. We should not underestimate her.

435
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,170
It's such an important event. Can we persuade her?

436
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,100
It's exactly because it's such an important event, that she should follow her heart.

437
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,730
Wait! Wait!

438
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,660
Sheng...

439
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,460
You have no shame.

440
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,600
You too.
