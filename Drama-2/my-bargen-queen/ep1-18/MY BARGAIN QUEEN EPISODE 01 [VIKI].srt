Sheng Zhening.

10
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,910
Do we know each other?

11
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,620
Who doesn't know you? I'm just saying hello.

12
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,300

00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,760
- What are you doing?! 
 - What are you doing?

18
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,490
What am I doing? Why were you holding me? 
 <i>[Evergreen Hotel]</i>

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,520
I saw a car passing by just now. I was afraid that the water would splash on you.

20
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,540
Even if the water was going to splash me, you can't...

21
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,070
You can't be like this!

22
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,790
- Crazy. 
 - You are crazy!

23
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,730
GM Sheng, do you know that girl?

24
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,920
I have to meet so many people every day. Do I have to know everyone?

25
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,730
Not exactly.

26
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,970
I just think that girl...

27
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,190
is a little different.

28
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,090
- What happened today... 
 - Got it!

29
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,780
Nobody else needs to know.

30
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,860
GM Sheng,

31
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,800
was that...

32
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,640
your first kiss?

33
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,650
I said the wrong thing.

34
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,940
Sorry. I spoke out of turn.

35
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,080
You don't need to come and get your bonus for this month.

36
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,320
Got it.

37
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,190
GM Sheng, there's a document you need to sign.

<i>[Sheng Zhening]</i>

39
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,890
President Sun will arrive later. They asked for a comprehensive inspection

of the conference venue and the hotel's catering.

41
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,460
This is the first time that Evergreen will hold a hotel culture summit forum.

42
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,300
I want to personally take President Sun to experience Evergreen's service quality.

The world is so big. Why did you two run into each other again?

45
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,940
Did he really not remember you?

46
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,970
I don't need him to remember me.

47
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,020
Don't mention him to me.

48
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,260
- It's bad luck. 
 - Right. It's bad luck.

49
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,010
But I think that you should make good use of our bargainer's advantage.

50
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,270
Bargain with him,

51
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,130
and teach him a lesson.

52
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,790
Don't.

53
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,320
I don't want to get involved with Evergreen ever again in my life.

54
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,390
- Sister Qian! 
 - What's up? Be quiet.

55
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,030
There's an important customer.

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,660
Hold on!

00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,030
Let me walk in front.

59
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,320
My name is Ning Meng.

60
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,060
Hello, hello. My name is Xia Qian.

61
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,350
Ms. Ning, I just introduced myself. I'm Xia Qian, the person-in-charge.

62
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,340
This is Mu Xiaoyan. That's Fu Shuangshuang.

63
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,970
The three of us are bargainers of "Worth Or Not."

64
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,120
This is my first time, I have come into contact with bargainers.

65
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,760
Many people say the same thing.

66
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,120
To introduce us in the simplest way,

67
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,190
you can directly think of us, as intermediaries.

68
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,910
We use the most reasonable price, to buy what customers want most.

69
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,000
Then we charge a small service fee. It's a win-win situation.

70
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,690
Well... What can we do for you, Ms. Ning?

71
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,660
I have a marriage in May. I want you to

72
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,690
make the reservation for the hotel banquet hall.

73
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,910
That's absolutely possible.

74
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,850
At the same time, we can promise to get the best price for you.

75
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,150
I don't need a discount. I just need to get it scheduled.

76
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,200
Rich woman.

77
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,210
Then... may I ask which hotel you want to schedule?

78
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,490
Evergreen Hotel.

79
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,390
I can pay the deposit first. Is 50,000 Yuan enough?

80
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,270
If I can have the hotel scheduled, it's fine if I need to pay more.

81
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,890
<i>He Zhijuan! Don't leave!</i>

82
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,960
<i>Stop there!</i>

83
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,630
<i>Let me ask you...</i>

84
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,240
<i>What did you mean by the message you sent me?</i>

85
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,840
<i>What do you mean "you can't marry me"?</i>

86
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,160
<i>Tell me.</i>

87
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,120
<i>Listen carefully</i>

88
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,530
<i>I'm not the type to pester you,</i>

89
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,560
<i>and I won't try to persuade you.</i>

90
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,390
<i>If you dare take one step forward, just one step, I will give you up.</i>

91
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,300
<i>Even if you come back to me begging, I will not take you back.</i>

92
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,270
<i>He Zhijuan!</i>

93
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,250
<i>He Zhijuan!</i>

94
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,010
Ms. Ning, it is now the middle of April.

95
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,220
The time is very tight.

96
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,120
Evergreen Hotel should be all booked up for May by now.

97
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,150
Then, can you consider changing to another hotel?

98
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,690
The Evergreen Hotel holds special meaning to me.

99
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,440
Only the Evergreen can witness my husband and my happiness.

100
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,090
I understand.

101
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,100
But the time is very tight.

102
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,810
So, it will not be easy for us. We need to think it over.

103
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,980
Okay. Thank you.

104
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,760
<i> Seems like being a bargainer is a big business. </i>

105
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,630
<i> You're such a dreamer. </i>

106
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,440
<i> We all need to have a dream. </i>

107
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,320
<i> What if it comes true some day? </i>

108
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,080
<i> Miss Xia, it's time to pay the apartment rent for this month. </i>

109
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,720
<i> [Xia Qian]</i>

110
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,670
Hello?

111
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,500
Ms. Ning Meng, I'd be happy to take on this job.

112
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,920
That's great!

113
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,830
<i> But I have one request from you. </i>

114
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,390
You need to transfer the deposit to me tonight.

115
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,130
<i>[Worth or Not]</i>

116
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,570
Wow! I thought we wouldn't receive our salary this month.

117
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,510
You don't have to do it.

118
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,120
I've thought it through.

119
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,570
How can we refuse all the Evergreen-related business just because I have a problem with Sheng Zhening?

120
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,210
We'll be hindering ourselves!

121
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,130
And our company is still growing.

122
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,300
Every case is an opportunity to grow. We have to grasp it.

123
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,540
- Agree! 
 - Well, if you're okay with it, then I agree.

124
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,460
We'll be mainly talking to the sales department of Evergreen Hotel to book the banquet hall.

125
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,610
We won't have anything to do with Sheng Zhening.

126
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,510
Hello, Miss Xia.

127
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,620
- Hello. 
 - This way, please.

128
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,280
I'm so sorry, but we have to talk to our general manager, GM Sheng, regarding this matter.

129
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,790
This doesn't need to be that complicated, does it?

130
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,850
It's just a reservation.

131
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,690
Sir, I know that most of your banquet halls are fully booked for May.

132
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,040
But I've done some research,

133
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,770
Banquet Hall No.8 has not been reserved for May 15.

134
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,460
We've arranged for re-decoration in  Banquet Hall 8 that day.

135
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,350
That's why it's not reserved.

136
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,580
Can we discuss this?

137
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,560
If you postpone the redecoration of Banquet Hall 8 until next month,

138
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,570
I'd be willing to pay double the price to reserve it for May 15.

139
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,640
<i> I'm so sorry.</i>

140
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,430
<i> I can't make that decision.</i>

141
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,440
<i>This requires GM Sheng's approval</i>

142
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,090
<i>Such a big hotel! Where can I find him?</i>

143
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,920
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

144
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,560
<i> Why is it her again? </i>

145
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,310
The blue daze flower can't be kept in the sun.

146
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,630
It's wilted because it's been in the sun all morning.

147
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,730
There's no need to water it!

148
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,580
It's withered because of the sun, not because it's too dry.

149
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,690
<i> Is it? How come I can't tell. </i>

150
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,030
Did you not add any base fertilizers at all?

151
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,700
The base fertilizer is really important to the blue daze.

152
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,920
<i> Didn't expect she would know so much. </i>

153
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,140
Can I ask you something? Do you happen to have any idea where GM Sheng is?

154
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,960
<i> Why is she looking for me? </i>

155
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,550
<i> I'll have to ask Anan to check on her. </i>

156
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,650
How would a gardener have known?

157
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,370
All right, I'll leave you to your work. Don't forget about the blue daze!

158
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,580
At 11:00 a.m., you need to assist GM Sheng along with other department heads and HR

159
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,200
for employee evaluations. And you need to confirm

160
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,520
the new plan for Evergreen.

161
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,820
Got it. Schedule a meeting for me at 2:00 p.m.

162
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,710
I'd like to see the head of the departments to discuss

163
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,860
the hotel's purchasing budget for next season.

164
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,800
Director, you just came back from a business trip. Don't you need to take a rest?

165
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm good. Just send the meeting invite.

166
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,690
Brother Hebo!

167
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,490
Zhening.

168
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,550
You must be tired after the business trip.

169
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,380
That's my job.

170
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,030
I've brought a bottle of wine for you. Why don't you come over to my office and have a chat?

171
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,250
Sure. Wait!

172
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,480
That's not the right direction. Your office isn't that way. Come.

173
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,940
Where are we going?

174
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,500
The board of directors decided to have a meeting today

175
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,730
to appoint you as the Vice General Manager of Evergreen.

176
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,520
I wanted to give you a surprise.

177
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,320
So I asked the HR Department not to say anything.

178
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,020
How's this?

179
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,850
Is Vice General Manager Qin happy with his new office?

180
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,750
Thank you so much for doing this.

181
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,870
Hey, Brother Hebo. You should join us

182
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,960
in the next board meeting.

183
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,720
We must fight together

184
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,630
in board meetings.

185
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,640
The board of directors is having a lot of meetings these days. Is something wrong?

186
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,720
There's nothing big.

187
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,930
<i> I'm leaving.</i>

188
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,270
<i>Take some food with you.</i>

189
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,830
- Thank you. 
 - I'll be right back.

190
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,910
<i> Are you really planning on waiting for Sheng Zhening at Evergreen?</i>

191
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,770
<i> What else can I do if I want to negotiate with him?</i>

192
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,980
<i> I thought you would be using your “radar” to search for him. </i>

193
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,620
<i> I didn't expect you would just take the easy approach of waiting for him in the lobby.</i>

194
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,990
<i> The easiest way is the most effective.</i>

195
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,520
<i> Do you understand?</i>

196
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,070
<i> Superb.</i>

197
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,150
She's here again.

198
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,060
Ask the security guards in the lobby to keep an eye on her. Do not let her interfere with other guests.

199
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,360
GM Sheng.

200
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,750
I've asked the front desk. This stalker girl has been asking around about you everywhere.

201
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,870
I think that since the last kiss...

202
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,910
Since what happened last time. this stalker girl has been obsessively in love with you.

203
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,560
Now she's been nosing around in the hotel,

204
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,470
I think she‘s going to be pestering you a lot.

205
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,860
But that's not her fault. You are so attractive.

206
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,060
We'll use the basement tunnel. I don't want to see her again.

207
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,760
Got it.

208
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,180
Hello? Is this Manager Wang in charge of the lobby?

209
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,020
Hi, Young Lady.

210
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,760
Young Lady.

211
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,180
Hello. What's the matter?

212
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,820
Here's the thing. GM Sheng usually stays in the hotel.

213
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,910
It's getting late, and he must have gone to sleep.

214
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,310
He won't be coming down to the lobby.

215
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,640
I think maybe you should stop waiting for him at night.

216
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,180
I've been waiting for such a long time. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

217
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,410
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,860
I understand. Thank you.

219
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,500
No worries.

220
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,160
<i> Financial news of the day. Finance Giant Lihe Capital is tapping the market of the hotel industry. </i>

221
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,580
<i> It is expected that the hotels in Jinhai City will undergo a financial storm. </i>

222
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,640
<i> Evergreen Hotel, as the biggest high-end hotel brand in Jinhai City, will be at the center of the storm. </i>

223
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,660
I've heard some news that

224
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,080
Lihe Capital is planning to acquire Evergreen.

225
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,930
What do you think?

226
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,890
As far as I know, Lihe Capital is quite dominating.

227
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,770
No matter who they acquire, they'll always have two requirements.

228
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,560
For those companies that agree to be acquired, they'll offer a good price.

229
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,690
But for those who believe that they are doing a hostile takeover

230
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,010
and who would fight with their back against the wall, it's a different price.

231
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,900
These two prices are very different.

232
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,760
So I think we should officially meet with them.

233
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,290
Know our enemies and have two sets of plans.

234
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,320
If the day comes that they have to acquire us, then at least

235
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,290
we can fight for a good price for Evergreen.

236
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,510
Shareholders,

237
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,410
there's a document in front of you.

238
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,050
You all have a copy.

239
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,260
It includes Evergreen's quarterly revenue

240
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,460
and pre-IPO assessment report.

241
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,370
In the past few years, Evergreen has always performed well.

242
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,300
GM Sheng has been busy preparing for the IPO.

243
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,480
Honestly, I think Evergreen's got a really good prospect.

244
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,690
- At this point in time, why should we be discussing being acquired? 
 - I agree.

245
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,420
We should look at the long-term goal.

246
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,300
I don't agree either. If new investors come in,

247
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,940
the quality of Evergreen's service cannot be guaranteed.

248
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,500
It will harm Evergreen's good reputation that we've built over the years.

249
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,320
Since everyone is so confident,

250
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,400
there's more reason for me to bring Evergreen to a better future.

251
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,300
Then we'll leave the discussion about being acquired. Meeting adjourned.

252
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
<i>- Okay. 
 - We'll leave it there then.</i>

253
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,610
<i> I've mentioned being acquired to the board as you suggested. But that didn't work out well. </i>

254
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,990
That's fine. We were just trying to see how they would react.

255
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,970
I'll follow up with some other arrangements.

256
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,080
I've still got 3% of the shares.

257
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,900
<i> When do you plan to transfer them, Vice GM Qin? </i>

258
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,490
Don't worry about it. I'll entrust someone to hold the shares.

259
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,590
The price will remain the same as we negotiated earlier.

260
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,380
<i> I'll ask them to deal with it as soon as possible. </i>

261
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,070
Okay, Vice GM Qin.

262
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,020
Thanks, Director Yun.

263
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,390
<i> [Qin Hebo, Vice General Manager] </i>

264
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,420
<i> Ms. Xia, I've reported to GM Sheng. It's not that we don't want to accept the reservation,</i>

265
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,400
<i> but because Banquet Hall 8 is indeed not available for now.</i>

266
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,790
<i> We're upgrading the multimedia equipment, but we haven't agreed to a price with the vendors yet.</i>

267
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,370
<i> That's why re-decoration has been delayed so much.</i>

268
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,910
<i> You've been asking about it every day. But there's really nothing I can do about it.</i>

269
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,170
<i>[The Banquet's Concept]</i>

270
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,530
Sister Qin!

271
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,980
You're here so early!

272
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,770
You're here!

273
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,860
Hey, get some coffee for me, please.

274
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,250
You're doing research on Evergreen again?

275
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,960
You've almost become an expert on Evergreen's history just for the sake of the reservation, haven't you?

276
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,960
What else can I do? I'm almost done.

277
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,150
Clean up for me. I'll go upstairs.

278
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,690
Thank you.

279
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,470
- Oh. 
 - Hey.

280
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,650
You're the love-struck stalker girl!

281
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,090
It's you. The footman!

282
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,620
How could you call me a footman?

283
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,010
- Why do you call me a love-struck girl? 
 - You’ve got some suspicious thoughts on GM Sheng.

284
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,650
What else should I call you other than a stalker?

285
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,920
I have suspicious thoughts on GM Sheng? What do you mean?

286
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,730
You were clinging on to him in the bus station that day,

287
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,200
and you've been blocking the front gate of Evergreen,

288
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,230
asking around about GM Sheng.

289
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,100
What do you want? To be honest,

290
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,500
GM Sheng has a lot of admirers.

291
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,530
But there's no one as obsessive as you

292
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,960
and acting like a stalker.

293
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,270
Well, there's no reason for me to be obsessive and stalking GM Sheng.

294
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,380
But it's true that I've been waiting for GM Sheng.

295
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,340
Hello?

296
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,090
Security?

297
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,040
Young Lady, we asked you to leave.

298
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,090
- Why? 
 - Leave right now.

299
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,740
What did I do? Why do I have to leave?

300
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,260
GM Sheng.

301
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,230
It's a misunderstanding. It's all a misunderstanding

302
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,130
I've invited Miss Xia to come over. She's not a love-struck stalker. It's a misunderstanding.

303
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,100
A misunderstanding?

304
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,830
Do you remember the girl who had a wedding in our hotel two years ago?

305
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,950
Whose fiancé ran away?

306
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,130
And you falsely blamed her for ringing the alarm in our hotel.

307
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,490
<i> GM Sheng,</i>

308
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,650
<i> someone rang the alarm.</i>

309
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,690
<i> He Zhijuan! Stop!</i>

310
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,660
<i> Oops. Sorry! Sorry!</i>

311
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,320
<i> He Zhijuan!</i>

312
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,760
<i> Thank you.</i>

313
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,570
<i> He Zhijuan!</i>

314
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,790
<i> What are you doing?</i>

315
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,560
<i> What are you doing!</i>

316
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,650
<i> You pressed the button for the alarm just now.</i>

317
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,680
<i> All the hotel guests panicked. Please come to the security room with me.</i>

318
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,800
<i> I've got something urgent to deal with!</i>

319
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,240
<i> I saw what happened, the "something urgent."</i>

320
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,350
<i> But who will bear the loss of the hotel?</i>

321
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,250
<i> Who will bear my loss if you stop me right now?</i>

322
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,620
<i> - I'll deal with it when I come back. 
 - Please be cooperative.</i>

323
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,550
<i> Go away!</i>

324
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,110
<i> GM Sheng, the security department got the result.</i>

325
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,910
<i> Nobody pressed the alarm. The alarm rang because of circuit problems.</i>

326
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,540
<i> We blamed the wrong person.</i>

327
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,420
<i> Is she still in the hotel?</i>

328
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,310
<i> She has left already.</i>

329
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,150
It's her?

330
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,700
Yeah. We should ask the security to let her go.

331
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,770
Thank you. Thank you. Bye.

332
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,750
Brothers, will you kindly let me in, please?

333
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,790
I really do have an appointment with GM Sheng.

334
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,990
I've brought all my materials. It's a very important matter.

335
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,920
- Can you just help? 
 - What are you guys doing?

336
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,420
Show some respect!

337
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,180
Miss Xia, I'm sorry. They should have been more thoughtful.

338
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,810
GM Sheng has invited you to come upstairs for a conversation. Shall we go?

339
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,450
Sure.

340
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,580
What happened to your feet?

341
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,520
Are you okay?

342
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.

343
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,490
It's okay.

344
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,560
Would you like anything to drink?

345
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,160
No, I'm good. Thank you, GM Sheng.

346
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,000
I heard from Anan that you were asking to see me

347
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,070
because you want to make a wedding reservation in May?

348
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,880
Yes.

349
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,480
This is my business card.

350
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,270
Here's the thing.

351
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,720
One of my clients wants to get married in your hotel in May.

352
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,640
I know that all the banquet halls are fully booked in May.

353
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,150
But I've also found out that Banquet Hall 8 is not reserved for May 15.

354
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,850
But here's the problem.

355
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,510
Banquet Hall 8 actually

356
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,640
needs renovation. That's why it's not open to the public.

357
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,260
The reason why the renovation has not been finished in Banquet Hall 8,

358
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,230
as I understand, is because you haven't reached an agreement on the price of purchasing equipment with the vendor.

359
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,410
I can provide bargaining service for you for free,

360
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,630
so that you can purchase the equipment as soon as possible,

361
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,260
and that the renovation can be finished as soon as possible.

362
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,630
Here.

363
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,820
This is a price comparison report based on what you need.

364
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,760
Okay. I'll take a look at it later on.

365
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,830
I'll let you know in a few days.

366
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,390
Great.

367
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,680
I'll be on my way then.

368
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,520
Are you okay?

369
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,260
I'm fine. I sprained my ankle downstairs.

370
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,220
Just a moment. Anan!

371
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,150
Give her a lift.

372
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,250
Please come with me, Miss Xia.

373
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,690
Thank you, GM Sheng

374
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,840
<i> [Equipment Price Comparison Report for Banquet Hall 8 at Evergreen Hotel]</i>

375
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,230
This is a very interesting report.

376
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,700
It's logical and well-organized.

377
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,260
She compared the hotel's must-haves with

378
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,490
the functions of the products,

379
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,220
picked out some expensive but not useful products.

380
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,770
She is indeed taking a more flexible approach than our Procurement Department.

381
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,800
I think it's pretty good, too.

382
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,470
Maybe we should hire her. We need someone like her in the Procurement Department.

383
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,050
She's got her own business to run.

384
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,780
You didn't show this to me just for me to give some comments, right?

385
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,670
Makes sense.

386
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,110
I'd like her to take on the equipment orders for Banquet Hall 8.

387
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,980
Let's see if the price comparison report is military tactics on paper. <i>(TN: idiom meaning "knowing what to do but not being able to do it well in real life")</i>

388
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,790
Mom, you should go to bed early after you finish.

389
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,480
- I'm leaving. 
 - Sure.

390
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,320
Hey, wait a moment!

391
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,840
Take this.

392
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,740
Take it back. Why do you give it to me? I've got money.

393
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,000
What money?

394
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,140
You think I have no idea how much money you have?

395
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,420
Last month you even sold your car! Tell me.

396
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,400
What are you planning on selling this month?

397
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,770
I sold my car and I can take a walk every day. Isn't that nice?

398
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,220
Exercise keeps me healthy.

399
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,410
Forget about it! Don't pretend to be rich. Just take it.

400
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,640
Right! I don't mean to blame you,

401
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,220
but there's a lot of jobs that a girl can do.

402
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,870
And you chose to open a "bargaining company"

403
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,050
and become a bargainer. Do you know what the relatives and neighbors are saying?

404
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,400
They asked what your job is exactly,

405
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,310
and I fail to explain it every time!

406
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,810
Well, go ahead.

407
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,970
You have to make it clear to me exactly about what you are doing.

408
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,780
Tell me.

409
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,040
I'll explain it to you.

410
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,180
Look at the meat skewer.

411
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,750
You sell it at 5 yuan to everybody else. But if I'm here, you have to sell it to me at 3 yuan.

412
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,230
And you have to give me a potato skewer for free.

413
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,870
Sell it to you for 3 yuan with a free potato skewer?

414
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,290
Why? You're not their relative.

415
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,100
I earn it with my ability.

416
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,300
A bargainer does the most difficult thing with the least amount of money.

417
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
It's okay. If I can't survive one day,

418
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
I'll take over our family business,

419
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,660
and expand the business of the Liping Barbecue House!

420
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,000
Put down your hand!

421
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,040
When can you start a serious career?

422
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,030
When can you get yourself married?

423
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,910
Qianqian!

424
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,420
Uncle Hu!

425
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,090
This is for you to take home. A late-night snack.

426
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,140
I'm so hungry!

427
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,610
I'll take it home!

428
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,350
I'll be going. Thank you, Uncle Hu!

429
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,180
- Bye. 
 - Bye, Mom!

430
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,170
Oh my god.

431
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,360
You really treat her well.

432
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Let's clean up.

433
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,920
That child...

434
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,080
GM Sheng, Miss Xia is here.

435
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,050
GM Sheng.

436
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,490
I'm here to watch

437
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,910
how you bargain.

438
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,830
I won't hinder your performance, right?

439
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,950
Of course not. GM Sheng, you don't need to worry about it.

440
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,910
Miss Xia, I really can't offer you a price like that.

441
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,900
This multimedia projection equipment has a new Bluetooth function.

442
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,410
It is very convenient.

443
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,420
Please think it over.

444
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,860
Manager Ma, I'll cut to the chase.

445
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,050
The Bluetooth function on your equipment is useless.

446
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,870
What's the point of having Bluetooth?

447
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,210
To make it easy to connect to external speakers.

448
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,930
But the Bluetooth function of your equipment is so unreliable.

449
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,480
It often disconnects automatically. A lot of consumers

450
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,890
have commented on this on your product page.

451
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,470
I don't know if Manager Ma has read that.

452
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,000
As far as I know, in three month's time,

453
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,980
you'll be releasing a new projection product.

454
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,140
The new product has an increased luminous flux of 15,000 lm.

455
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,590
But the price is not going to increase a lot.

456
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,170
Customers would always want to buy newer products instead of older ones.

457
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,220
You will definitely lower the price for this equipment by then.

458
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,690
The price I'm offering right now,

459
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,820
must be higher than what you sell for after the new product is released.

460
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,200
GM Sheng, please don't make it difficult for me.

461
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,070
Evergreen is a big company. There's no need to bargain over such a small amount with me.

462
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,680
Manager Ma,

463
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,330
that's a little out of line now. What do you mean?

464
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,760
Is Evergreen's money not money either? Did it get blown here along with the wind?

465
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
Evergreen is your customer.

466
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,470
Customers have the right to buy what they want at a reasonable price.

467
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,100
Isn't that true?

468
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,290
Nevermind.

469
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,530
GM  Sheng, since Manager Ma is already in a difficult position,

470
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,780
we'll think it over again.

471
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,310
I think we can wait for three months.

472
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,320
We can buy it then as well.

473
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,640
True. I think we can wait for now.

474
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,540
Okay, okay. I'll just make a deal with Evergreen

475
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,690
at the price that Miss Xia offered.

476
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,700
This is the cheapest price I've ever agreed to.

477
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,670
Please don't tell anyone else.

478
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,620
Rest assured, Manager Ma. We'll keep it confidential.

479
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,210
Then I'll be going, GM Sheng.

480
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,730
GM Sheng.

481
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,460
I closed the deal.

482
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,920
Not bad, Miss Xia.

483
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,090
Our Procurement Department has been trying for months but failed

484
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,130
and you nailed it in half an hour.

485
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,110
Well, it's nothing complicated.

486
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,310
Bargaining is a game of mind and information.

487
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,820
It'll be easy as long as you know all their cards.

488
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,750
GM Sheng, I've noted it all down.

489
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,730
GM Sheng, you still have two orders to make.

490
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,730
If I can get a reasonable price for you,

491
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,840
you'll reserve the banquet hall for me in May?

492
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,480
Yes.

493
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,620
Get the contracts ready and wait for the good news!

494
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,480
It's here.

495
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,540
- What do you think? 
 - I think it's great.

496
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,320
Great. Shall we sign our names?

497
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,860
Check and confirm it.

498
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,460
Done!

499
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,420
Miss Xia has successfully gotten us the contracts

500
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,260
for the telecommunication equipment and fresh air system.

501
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,100
The price is much lower than we expected.

502
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,550
She saved a lot of money for us.

503
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,080
Why doesn't she eat in the cafeteria?

504
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,100
Maybe she wants to save money.

505
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,800
And she has a meeting with the sales agent of Xinyuan Technology

506
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,750
at 2:00 p.m., on behalf of our company.

507
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,690
I think she wants to save time, too.

508
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,860
Make some arrangements.

509
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,060
Miss Xia, this is your employee meal.

510
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,560
Employee mean? What's that?

511
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,400
GM Sheng said that you are now an employee of Evergreen.

512
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,480
So, of course, there's an employee meal for you.

513
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,450
Why don't you have a try?

514
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,660
Sure. Thank you?

515
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,800
Such a fancy meal for Evergreen employees.

516
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,190
Of course not.

517
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,610
GM Sheng asked for it.

518
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Say thank you to GM Sheng for me.

519
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,580
Enjoy your meal.

520
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,880
Yeah, it went well today.

521
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,900
I'll be visiting Xinyuan Technology tomorrow

522
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,690
to meet with their director.

523
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,570
I think we can get the contract signed after that.

524
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,110
If that goes well, I think we can get Ning Meng's contract done the day after tomorrow.

525
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,860
You offered two bargain services to Evergreen for free

526
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,570
just to close this one contract.

527
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,570
Losing two, winning one.

528
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,710
<i> Isn't that too much of a sacrifice? </i>

529
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,210
It's okay.

530
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,170
It would be a nice thing to help Ning Meng get the wedding reservation.

531
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,790
Miss Xia, you're amazing!

532
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,170
Well, it's not just my own effort.

533
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,050
I think it's because I'm lucky.

534
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,240
Evergreen just happened to have a need for bargaining services; otherwise, it wouldn't have gone so well.

535
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,510
But that's also because you're such a great bargainer!

536
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,200
I am really grateful to you, Miss Xia.

537
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,540
In fact, none of my family members support me in getting married.

538
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,530
You're the only one who's always helping me,

539
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,380
and I can feel

540
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,460
that you're not just doing this because it's your job.

541
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,400
You really want to help me achieve my dream wedding in Evergreen.

542
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,890
I'll be honest with you,

543
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,100
you remind me of myself back when I got engaged.

544
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,670
Of course, I'd wish you happy.

545
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,880
Engaged?

546
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,130
You got engaged at Evergreen, too?

547
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,880
Yes.

548
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,000
Then, what happened afterward?

549
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,690
Well,

550
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,170
of course it didn't work out.

551
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,620
That bastard...

552
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,140
just disappeared, and I was never able to find him again.

553
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,990
That's crazy!

554
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,250
- What a bastard! 
 - For sure!

555
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,150
Miss Xia, he's so unfortunate to have lost you.

556
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,390
- Excuse me, I have to answer a call. 
 - Sure.

557
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,910
Hello, darling.

558
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,130
You're here!

559
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,220
I'm upstairs.

560
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,720
Okay. I'll be there right away.

561
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,590
Darling! I'm here!
