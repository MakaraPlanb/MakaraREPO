[Liping BBQ]

4
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,360
Stop staring at him.

5
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,270
Didn't you ask me

6
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,590
who Sheng Zhening is?

7
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,150
It's him.

8
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,790
You two...

9
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,119
There is nothing going on between us.

10
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,789
The fact is

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,790
that he has been courting me.

12
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,840
Didn't I talk in sleep before?

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,400
That's because I'm getting
bored with his pursuit.

14
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,990
Really?

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,710
Really.

16
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,680
Why would I lie to you?

17
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,230
Please help yourself.

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,070
Stop looking at him.

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,680
What does he do?

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
Do you know Evergreen Hotel?

21
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,200
Yeah.

22
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,040
It's run by his family.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,710
Wanna know how he made a move on me?

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,590
Take a guess.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
Buy you flowers and bags.

26
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,480
Take you to fancy meals.

27
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,230
Mom.

28
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,150
Where is your imagination?

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
What else could there be?

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,870
In order to take me to Iceland

31
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,680
and see the aurora,

32
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,510
he chartered a yacht.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
But I was too busy

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,120
and too lazy to go.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,710
This one.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,710
What's this?

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,320
A credit card.

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,920
It's unlimited and you can

39
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,790
spend as much money as you want.

40
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,400
But I remember your instructions

41
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,400
that we don't waste a penny of other people.

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,510
I never used it.

43
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,150
Looks at those guys

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,920
you found for me earlier.

45
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,430
He is such an excellent man.

46
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,070
Are they comparable?

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,200
Just don't worry about me,

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,840
okay?

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,990
Okay. Okay.

50
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,960
They are not comparable.

51
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,710
Oh my God.

52
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:40,840
Sheng.

53
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,630
I heard from Xia Qian

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
that you've been courting her
for two months.

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,430
Is that what she told you?

56
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,680
She lied.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,400
- This kid...
- Actually,

58
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,920
I've been courting her

59
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,480
for almost one year.

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,760
But

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,510
you are such an eligible man.

62
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,350
What do you like about our Xia Qian?

63
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,870
You...

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,750
I don't know

65
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,470
what I like about her.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Just saying something.

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,070
She

68
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,560
has a bad temper

69
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,910
and a one-track mind.

70
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,310
She does everything without

71
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,440
thinking about the consequences.

72
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,630
She is like a firecracker

73
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,720
that explodes easily.

74
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,440
She plays petty tricks sometimes.

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,280
Sheng Zhening.

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Don't go too far.

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,400
Aunt,

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,680
isn't that how love looks like?

79
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,000
Sometimes you can't tell

80
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,350
what's wrong,

81
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,600
but

82
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,630
no one else can replace her.

83
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,230
Yes, yes, exactly.

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,680
See.

85
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,560
Come on.

86
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
Time for dinner.

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,230
Here.

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,120
What's wrong?

89
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,790
Did you throw up?

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you not feeling well?

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,470
Well...

92
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,030
Hello.

93
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,720
Hello.

94
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,190
Shuangshuang.

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,720
The kitten doesn't look well.

96
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,120
It doesn't look well?

97
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,310
Is there any symptom?

98
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,000
I think it threw up.

99
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,400
Take it to the pet hospital now.

100
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,350
I'll be right with you.

101
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,510
Okay, okay.

102
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,840
I'll take it to the hospital first.

103
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,190
Thank you for

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,510
what you did just now.

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,790
Thank you so much.

106
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,230
Don't say that.

107
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,470
You did me such a big favor.

108
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
Was I not good enough

109
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,560
just now?

110
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,630
You were too good.

111
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,350
My mom

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,310
will urge me to take you.

113
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,750
Then what?

114
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,790
To ask you to keep playing my boyfriend?

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
Work with me.

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't mess it up.

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,440
There is sunshine in the south facing room.

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,400
The view is good, too.

119
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,230
Honey.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,070
I don't like other rooms.

121
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,440
I just like this one.

122
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,560
Is it okay?

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,120
Anyway,

124
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,960
actually, I think we can do it.

125
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,910
We can do what?

126
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,190
Nothing.

127
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,350
I just want to thank you.

128
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,560
If you need anything,

129
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,030
just tell me.

130
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,720
I can continue to play your boyfriend.

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,470
It doesn't matter to me.

132
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,400
Okay.

133
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,280
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

134
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,840
I will ask you for help

135
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
if I need it.

136
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,470
How is the kitten?

137
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,790
The primary diagnosis is indigestion.

138
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,280
They just gave it a thorough check.

139
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,600
We are still waiting for the report.

140
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,600
Indigestion?

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,880
Well,

142
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,440
is it because you changed its food?

143
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,120
I changed its food?

144
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,230
The cat food I recommended to you last time,

145
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
did you change it all at once?

146
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,560
Well,

147
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,280
am I not supposed to
change the food all at once?

148
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
You should change its food gradually,

149
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,750
adjusting the ratio of the new cat food
and the old cat food

150
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,230
so that it will adapt to it.

151
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
Different cat food varies in

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,070
the protein content and the smell.

153
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,880
The cat will instinctively reject it

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,030
and have physical reaction.

155
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,160
I see.

156
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,190
It's okay.

157
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,160
I'll give you some notice and basic facts

158
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,070
about how to keep a cat.

159
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
It should be fine now.

160
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,070
It's on a drip now.

161
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,670
It may take a while.

162
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,800
Let's go to the sofa and have some rest.

163
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,310
Come on.

164
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,920
I asked you out in the middle of the night.

165
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,870
You must be hungry.

166
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,430
A little bit.

167
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,430
Have a rest here.

168
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,550
I'll buy something for you.

169
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,240
Sheng Zhening.

170
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,280
You...

171
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,720
What?

172
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,400
No.

173
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,750
Give me your hand.

174
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,360
Put it on.

175
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,240
Why?

176
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
You know me.

177
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
My mom urges me to get married every day.

178
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm going crazy.

179
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,040
You have to marry me.

180
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,600
No.

181
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,400
Don't worry.

182
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,360
After you put on the ring,

183
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,240
you will be my man.

184
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,280
I will be responsible for you.

185
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
Get off me. No.

186
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,360
[Mr. Xue]

187
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,110
Something came up in the company.

188
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,240
Please send the kitten to
my house after it's discharged.

189
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,400
The code of the room is

190
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,960
081399.

191
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,240
Mr. Yu has

192
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,430
transferred 2% of his stock

193
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,840
to Lihe Capital.

194
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,840
In this case,

195
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,070
we will have 5% of the stock.

196
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,480
You did a good job this time.

197
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,310
I heard that

198
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,190
a hotel reviewer will check
in building No. 2.

199
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,870
If I remember correctly,

200
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,920
building No. 2 should be an old building.

201
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,070
It has been around for more than 20 years.

202
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,110
The hydro-electric transmission lines
are aging.

203
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,400
It should have been refurbished long ago

204
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,630
if it wasn't for financial constraints.

205
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,480
In this case,

206
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,550
whether Evergreen can maintain five stars

207
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,280
depends on this evaluation.

208
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,070
We can do something about it.

209
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,550
If Evergreen gets less stars
because of building No. 2,

210
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,190
the shareholders might

211
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,360
vote to sell building No. 2.

212
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,670
Sheng Zhening is a nostalgic person.

213
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,550
To sell building No. 2g

214
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,870
is not easy.

215
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,190
Yeah?

216
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
But I heard

217
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,430
that the shareholders are not willing to
spend any more money

218
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,310
to maintain that old building.

219
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,360
Whether to sell building No. 2

220
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,190
or lose the support of the shareholders,

221
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,240
let's wait and see

222
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,510
what Sheng Zhening will choose.

223
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,040
I know it will be hard,

224
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,510
but I am very confident in building No. 2.

225
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,240
Are we really not
going to do something about it?

226
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,040
If we can find the reviewer,

227
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,510
then...

228
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,720
Just follow the normal procedure.

229
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,750
There is a gap again.

230
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Hello, An An.

231
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,430
Hello, Miss Xia.

232
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,510
Is it convenient for you to come to
Evergreen Building No. 2 now?

233
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,720
There is a job opportunity
I want to talk to you.

234
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,160
Okay, no problem.

235
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,990
I have time now.

236
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,430
I'll be there right away.

237
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,160
Can I make one small request

238
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,670
before you come?

239
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
Go ahead. What is it?

240
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,430
It's fine.

241
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,240
Which floor?

242
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,840
Hello.

243
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,240
Hello.

244
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,520
Where are you?

245
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,880
I'm in the company.

246
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,070
What's up?

247
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,000
Nothing.

248
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,960
Bye.

249
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,910
Okay.

250
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,480
Come in.

251
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,150
Mr. Qin.

252
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,910
This is the information of
building No. 2 you want.

253
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,550
Mr. Qin.

254
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,430
The hotel hired a new chef

255
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,550
who is good at making Japanese cuisine.

256
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,640
You have been working hard recently

257
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,760
and not eating well.

258
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,120
Would you like to try it later?

259
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,910
Your job now

260
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,720
is not to study the new chef of
Evergreen's Food & Beverage Dept,

261
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,430
but to find the reviewer as soon as possible.

262
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,240
Sorry, Mr. Qin.

263
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,190
You can leave now.

264
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,670
It's too dangerous.

265
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,190
You know what,

266
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,070
I was so close to

267
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,070
being found out,

268
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,550
but don't worry.

269
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,640
Why are you giving that look?

270
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,480
Didn't you

271
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,150
ask me to dress like this?

272
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,600
I haven't asked you about it, An An.

273
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,670
Did you ask me to dress like this

274
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,070
to hide from Sheng Zhening?

275
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,550
Actually,

276
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,640
it's my personal decision.

277
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,790
Mr. Sheng doesn't know it.

278
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,520
This is information of
Evergreen's previous review.

279
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,310
Take a look.

280
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,760
This is your room card.

281
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,550
Miss Xia, before we

282
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,270
find the hotel reviewer,

283
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,720
we need you to live here.

284
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,430
I'll try.

285
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,360
But you are looking for someone.

286
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,070
Why do you ask me to do it?

287
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,070
I'm not a private detective.

288
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
That's not right.

289
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,150
Based on what I've been seeing
during this time,

290
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,070
I found that you are smart and clever

291
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,190
with strong analytical skills,

292
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,190
and you are competent.

293
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,000
Mainly because I can't afford
a private detective.

294
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,720
Kitty.

295
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,190
I'll put you here first.

296
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,430
Why is it like no one lives here?

297
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
It's so strange.

298
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,310
Do you like your new home?

299
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,480
Isn't this house really big?

300
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,520
It's three floors.

301
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,670
Look.

302
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,960
Do you like this?

303
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,030
Here.

304
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,000
Are you hungry?

305
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,910
Sorry. I thought you were someone else.

306
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,120
Don't go in the chairman's office.

307
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,550
Well, all right, I'll leave right away.

308
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,760
Okay, let's go, Brother.

309
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,600
[Veteran driver]

310
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,640
Tell them that there are some data.

311
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,310
Hello.

312
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,600
Shuangshuang.

313
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,910
You haven't had dinner, right?

314
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,190
Let me take you to dinner.

315
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,720
I know a good Japanese restaurant.

316
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm waiting for your treat.

317
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,030
I'm hungry.

318
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,150
I'll pick you up.

319
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay.

320
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,790
It's Sheng.

321
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,960
How are you here?

322
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,600
Come in.

323
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,310
You've been dreaming of

324
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,670
Xia Qian lately?

325
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,390
She's all in your head?

326
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,880
Yes.

327
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,480
Everyone looks like her?

328
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,120
Oh no, Sheng.

329
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,720
You have lovesickness.

330
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,760
Really?

331
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Of course.

332
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,390
It's definitely what it is.

333
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,600
But you came at a bad time,

334
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,790
Xia Qian is not at home.

335
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,670
She went on a business trip.

336
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,310
A business trip?

337
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah, she went on a business trip.

338
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,150
Didn't she tell you that?

339
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,670
Well.

340
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,670
Since you are here,

341
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,720
let me give you a hand

342
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,880
and help you cheat.

343
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,880
Xia Qian's favorite fruit is cherries.

344
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,000
Right.

345
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,430
She likes matcha ice cream.

346
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,720
She likes corn,

347
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,390
but she doesn't eat corn candy.

348
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,190
When she gets angry,

349
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,880
she likes to clean.

350
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,150
She enjoys watching horror movies,

351
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,390
but

352
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,190
she doesn't dare to sleep alone
after watching it.

353
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,480
And also...

354
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,600
Okay, stop writing.

355
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,910
I will tell you

356
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,760
when I remember more.

357
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,640
Okay.

358
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,520
Since you are here,

359
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,000
I'll just help you out.

360
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,670
Let me give you a bonus.

361
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,390
Come on.

362
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,640
Come over.

363
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,840
Let me show you something good.

364
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,760
Here.

365
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,430
Look.

366
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,840
This is when she was six years old.

367
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,790
This is

368
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,600
when she was in elementary school
wearing a red scarf.

369
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,270
This is

370
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
when she was three months.

371
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,520
And this is

372
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,720
her dad. Don't look at that.

373
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Junior high school, high school
and university.

374
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,030
Look, she changed every year.

375
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,390
This is when she was learning to dance
in the Children's Palace.

376
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,480
Look, she was wearing this.

377
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,190
Pick one for yourself.

378
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,720
Why was she crying in this one?

379
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,190
This is...

380
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,000
It was a Children's Day.

381
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,640
I can't remember which year it is.

382
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,550
One of Xia Qian's good friends got injured

383
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,310
and she asked Xia Qian to dance for her.

384
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,310
Xia Qian promised her,

385
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,670
but she got stage fright.

386
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,310
She got scared.

387
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,670
She was dancing while crying,

388
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,550
crying while dancing,

389
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,310
and I took this picture of her.

390
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,270
Actually, my daughter

391
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,550
has been like this since she was a kid.

392
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,670
She is really stubborn.

393
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,840
Once she makes a promise,

394
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,520
no matter

395
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,390
how much she doesn't like it,

396
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,030
she will do it anyway even in tears.

397
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,120
That's who she is.

398
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,720
Aunt.

399
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,030
I want this one.

400
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,270
No,

401
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,190
not this one.

402
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,760
This is too...

403
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,520
Pick another picture.

404
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,120
It's very cute. I like it.

405
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,600
Okay, okay.

406
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,240
Thanks, Aunt.

407
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,640
The last bite.

408
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,070
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

409
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,670
Bravo.

410
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,000
You are really good.

411
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,960
I've rarely seen a girl

412
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,190
enjoy her food as much as you do.

413
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,520
That's because it's delicious.

414
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,550
By the way,

415
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,190
do you have any other plans later?

416
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,310
No.

417
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,840
If not,

418
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,270
can you please do me a favor?

419
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,840
Well,

420
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,000
how old is she?

421
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,910
She

422
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,640
is about your age.

423
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,190
What about her personality?

424
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,790
Just like you.

425
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,360
Very lively and cheerful,

426
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,390
smiling all day.

427
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,520
What about her skin color?

428
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,910
Her skin color?

429
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,910
She is almost as light-skinned as you.

430
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,960
Are you giving me a gift?

431
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,790
Why would I do that?

432
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,880
No.

433
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,550
I'm joking.

434
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,640
Well,

435
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,760
who is it for then?

436
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,360
a female friend

437
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,640
or a girl you like?

438
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,390
Why do you care so much?

439
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,480
No.

440
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,840
I'm just asking,

441
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,240
so I can pick the right gift for you.

442
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,430
It's for Ning Meng.

443
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,880
Didn't you tell me

444
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,520
to cheer a girl up

445
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,480
is to make her laugh?

446
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,960
Then I'll pick a good gift

447
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,070
for you.

448
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,600
Ning Meng.

449
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,430
By the way,

450
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,430
I almost forgot it.

451
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,270
This is for you.

452
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,720
What's this?

453
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,480
Tips for raising cats.

454
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,310
Is it so much trouble to have a cat?

455
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,790
You wrote a lot

456
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,670
on the paper.

457
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,240
Actually,

458
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,430
it's not that much.

459
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,550
Most importantly,

460
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,120
cats need human companionship.

461
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,070
In the world of cats,

462
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,390
it has no idea

463
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,190
what humans do during the day.

464
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,910
When you go to work in the morning,

465
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,430
it thinks you are hunting for it.

466
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,310
When you get off work at night,

467
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,070
it will rush to you

468
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,600
to smell and see

469
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,480
whether you bring back canned chicken

470
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,670
or canned fish.

471
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,720
But if you haven't been home for a long time,

472
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,600
it will think

473
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,360
you got eaten

474
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,600
while hunting.

475
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,600
Got eaten?

476
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,240
I didn't know you know so much about cats.

477
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,910
I had a cat when I was a kid.

478
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:54,790
But

479
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,390
because

480
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,270
that cat scratched me a lot,

481
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,790
my mom gave it away.

482
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,960
Were you sad

483
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,600
after your mom gave it away?

484
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,600
A little at first.

485
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,880
I really missed it.

486
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,640
After all, I had been keeping it for so long.

487
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,640
But,

488
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,270
I have a cat now.

489
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,550
That's right.

490
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,760
You should come to see it when you have time.

491
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,310
Otherwise it would think

492
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,480
that its owner is eaten.

493
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:24,670
Yes.

494
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,840
We can't let it feel like its two owners

495
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,760
are both eaten.

496
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,240
Two...

497
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,760
Yes, two owners.

498
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:32,720
Right.

499
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,790
I'm home.

500
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,030
I'll go up.

501
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,240
Hold on.

502
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,840
This is the gift for you.

503
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,840
Thanks.

504
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,240
You got me a gift.

505
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,790
I'll open it up there.

506
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,760
Thanks.

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,550

Hebo.

511
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,190
I need to ask you for a favor.

512
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,790
I want to make the vows again

514
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560

wouldn't pay so much attention to the carpet.

523
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,190

The room service

527

I should go to the restaurant to try my luck?

575
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,350
Thanks. Go to take a look.

576
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,910
My dining car is still outside.

577
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,480
I have to go.

578
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,080
Hebo, just say yes.

579
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,000
The love without making vows

580
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
is incomplete.

581
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,000
You don't want my love to be incomplete,

582
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,480
do you?

583
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,190
Why don't you go to ask your brother?

584
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,480
My brother has

585
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,960
way too many rules.

586
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,390
Besides, if I tell him that,

587
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,040
he's going to nagging me for a long time.

588
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,560
I only need the part of making vows.

589
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,190
Just me and Zhijun.

590
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,320
Okay.

591
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,000
I will help you.

592
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,560
I knew it.

593
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,280
You are the best.

594
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,670
Thank you, Hebo.

595
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,830
Have you decided how to do it?

596
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
This is my plan.

597
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,670
You even got a plan?

598
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,590
Of course.

599
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,320
Okay.

600
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,120
[Execution Plan]

601
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,910
I'll ask Emily and the others

602
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,670
to schedule it and book the place
as soon as possible.

603
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,480
Okay?

604
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,000
Thank you, Hebo.

605
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,080
I'll go back and prepare for it.

606
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,520
No hurry.

607
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,560
Have some tea with me.

608
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,670
Besides, I have something for you.

609
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,080
Didn't you already give me a wedding gift?

610
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,520
Who said that you have to get married

611
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,590
to receive gifts?

612
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,720
I'm the happiest person when I get presents.

613
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,800
Thank you, Hebo.

614
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,000
As long as you are happy.

615
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,110
Come on.

616
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,760
Hold on.

617
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,910
Excuse me.

618
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,080
