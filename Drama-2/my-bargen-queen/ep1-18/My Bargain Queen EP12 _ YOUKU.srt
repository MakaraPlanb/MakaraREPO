[My Bargain Queen]

2
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,680
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,550
Have you eaten?

4
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,600
Have more.

5
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,270
Sheng Zhening.

6
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,830
I got to praise you.

7
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,720
When I read that kind of novels before,

8
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
I always think

9
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,160
that the president has nothing to do.

10
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,360
You know,

11
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,670
except for dating the heroine,

12
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,320
what else can he do?

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
But since I met you,

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
I've changed my mind.

15
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,720
It turns out that the president
can also be troubled

16
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,470
and there are things that he can't solve.

17
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,080
Sorry.

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,000
I burst your bubble about the president.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,750
No.

20
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,440
It's great.

21
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,550
I found it very amiable.

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
Amiable?

23
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,360
Yeah.

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,470
In the novel.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
I mean, the character.

26
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,520
This kind of president seems very folksy.

27
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,080
Let's eat.

28
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,270
Have some, too.

29
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,390
I already ate.

30
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
[Mom]

31
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,110
It's my mom.

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,320
Mom.

33
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,030
Qian.

34
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,630
Ask Sheng to go to work later.

35
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,110
I brought you chicken soup.

36
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,360
She is going to bring chicken soup for us.

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,360
Stop eating.

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,440
Well,

39
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,440
you go down first.

40
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,360
Go to the company.

41
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,240
I will leave later.

42
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,800
Why?

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,910
I can have some chicken soup.

44
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,000
Wake up.

45
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,320
Don't you get bored of
acting in front of my mom?

46
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,920
Hurry.

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,230
She talks too much.

48
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,760
Get ready. Stop eating.

49
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,350
No, I want to have chicken soup.

50
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,320
Sheng Zhening!

51
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,510
Qian.

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,440
Are you there?

53
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,320
Qian?

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,070
Mu Xiaoyan.

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,110
I'll take a look.

56
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,230
Qian.

57
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,640
What?

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,510
Qian?

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,440
Are you inside?

60
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,110
What's up?

61
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,230
I'm changing clothes.

62
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm here to send you
the financial statement of this month.

63
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,110
Well,

64
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,000
put it in the office downstairs.

65
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,040
I'll go down and read it later.

66
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,440
Qian.

67
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,830
Are you okay?

68
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,550
Why did I hear a man's voice?

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,440
I'm watching TV series.

70
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,600
All right.

71
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,670
I'll put it downstairs.

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,390
What?

73
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,790
I'll go down first.

74
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,070
Find a chance to go down, got it?

75
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,670
Aunt Liping.

76
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,070
Let me take it for you.

77
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,510
Here. Take it.

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
You came just right.

79
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,040
Come on, come in.

80
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,640
Let me make an introduction.

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,550
He is Sheng.

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,950
Xia Qian's boyfriend,

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,200
the General Manager of Evergreen Hotel.

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,110
Aunt.

85
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,200
Come on, have some chicken soup.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,350
Okay, let's have some soup.

87
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,720
What does Auntie mean?

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,550
You are...

89
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,350
It's fake.

90
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,000
We pretend to be together.

91
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,760
Mu Xiaoyan.

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Anyway,

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
you must keep it a secret for me.

94
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,510
There is no need to live together
since it's fake.

95
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,390
We are not living together.

96
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,320
We only share the apartment.

97
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,040
I don't believe it.

98
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,270
I don't care if you believe it or not.

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,040
Don't say anything in front of my mom

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,880
and don't ask anything.

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,550
It's sweet and delicious.

102
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,720
It's so great.

103
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,320
The chicken soup in our hotel

104
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,920
is no match for this.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,070
Have more if you like it.

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Come on, Xiaoyan.

107
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,790
Have some, too.

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,720
Qian.

109
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,510
Come on, have some.

110
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,160
How is it?

111
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,950
My mom makes the best chicken soup.

112
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,270
Sheng.

113
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,200
I want to ask you,

114
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,070
when are you and Qian

115
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,480
going to have a baby?

116
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,200
I finally explained it.

117
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,390
I told Xiaoyan

118
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,390
that we are pretending to be together.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,070
Why would you explain to him?

120
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,880
Of course I have to explain to him,

121
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,390
so it will be easier for you.

122
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,510
You don't have to avoid him anymore.

123
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,640
I think the fact

124
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,350
that we pretend to be together,

125
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,390
more people know it,

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,040
higher the risk of exposure.

127
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,950
Don't worry.

128
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,550
I talked to him.

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,440
He wouldn't dare.

130
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,510
Just leave.

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,640
You won't be able to catch bus 11 later.

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:32,920
Go.

133
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm leaving.

134
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,110
Hello.

135
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,550
What's wrong?

136
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,350
Something bad happened.

137
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,950
The customs found some pests

138
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,830
in the batch of African logs

139
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,230
we imported.

140
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,040
There are termites, buprestid beetles,

141
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,440
and some seeds of invasive plants.

142
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Did the customs say

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,320
what they will do about it?

144
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,950
They will be in quarantine first.

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,390
The problematic wood
will be destroyed directly.

146
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,200
In this case,

147
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,200
we won't be able to
keep up with the schedule.

148
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,880
My existing funds

149
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,670
are not enough to buy new wood.

150
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,720
Has the renovation of
Evergreen Building No. 2 stopped?

151
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,550
Why didn't I think of

152
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,510
the risk of termite when I made

153
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,230
the comparison budget?

154
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,720
They probably wouldn't have bought the wood

155
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,150
if I had written it down.

156
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,670
It's not your fault.

157
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
That batch of wood was

158
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,670
the most cost-effective choice we had.

159
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,670
Who would have expected such a thing?

160
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,110
But...

161
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm supposed to be very sensitive

162
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
to these details.

163
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,790
I'll be back later today.

164
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,470
Don't wait for me for dinner.

165
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,910
This is a gift for you.

166
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,790
Sorry, you misunderstood.

167
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,110
We are not a couple.

168
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,590
This is my younger sister.

169
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,150
How much have you drunk?

170
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,790
Stop drinking.

171
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,520
Have some razor clams to sober up.

172
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,320
What's wrong? Are you dumped?

173
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,150
Wait.

174
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,440
You are nodding

175
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,520
and then shaking your head.

176
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,440
Are you dumped or not?

177
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
It's a one-sided love. Does it count?

178
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,590
One-sided love...

179
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,590
Sure.

180
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,320
Of course.

181
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,110
So you are dumped, what's the big deal?

182
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,640
You will

183
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,320
find a better girlfriend, right?

184
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,470
Look at Qian.

185
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,960
She found Sheng.

186
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,030
He is good in all aspects.

187
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,790
Qian and Sheng Zhening are a fake couple,

188
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
but love grows over time,

189
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,550
not to mention they are living together now.

190
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
She will be tricked into
being with him one day.

191
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,470
What did you say?

192
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,080
A fake couple?

193
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,150
Qian doesn't let me tell you.

194
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,440
Don't tell her that.

195
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,910
You're back.

196
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,400
How is it going? Is it okay?

197
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,710
It's fine.

198
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,320
What about the renovation?

199
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,640
Can it continue?

200
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,790
Is there any solution?

201
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,080
Don't worry.

202
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,710
It's a piece of cake for me.

203
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,590
Go to rest.

204
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,350
I heard

205
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,000
your conversation with Mr. Song

206
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,150
outside the door that day.

207
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,590
I know you want to be
the general manager of Evergreen.

208
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,670
What do you think?

209
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,400
I can give you the position

210
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,030
of general manager.

211
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,550
When my dad and Meng had a car accident,

212
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,110
it was you who saved Meng.

213
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
During these years,

214
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,760
you've been helping me

215
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,880
become a qualified

216
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,280
hotel manager.

217
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,080
Hebo.

218
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,910
Compared to the position of
Evergreen's general manager,

219
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,030
I think our relationship is more important.

220
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,960
I was just doing what an employee should do.

221
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Honestly,

222
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,550
I've always been grateful to you

223
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,110
over these years.

224
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,640
I didn't rush into

225
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,080
making such a decision.

226
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,440
Objectively,

227
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,440
you are totally up for it.

228
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,110
There is one more thing.

229
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,150
There are termites
on the wood for renovation.

230
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,110
I think you have known it.

231
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,200
My funds

232
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,880
won't be available for a while.

233
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,110
If you become the general manager,

234
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,030
I hope you can convince all shareholders

235
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,150
to renovate Building No. 2.

236
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,960
Is Building No. 2 that important?

237
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,550
Very important.

238
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,790
Is it an attached condition?

239
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,350
It's my request.

240
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,230
Okay, I promise you.

241
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,590
I'll try my best.

242
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,470
Shareholders,

243
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,080
I have one thing to announce.

244
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,110
From today,

245
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,110
I will resign as
general manager of Evergreen.

246
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,760
Mr. Qin will replace me

247
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,840
as the new general manager.

248
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,400
I will serve Evergreen wholeheartedly.

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,910
I hope you can support me.

250
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,320
Next, let's discuss

251
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,590
the plan to renovate Building No. 2.

252
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,840
What?

253
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,840
Are you going to help Sheng Zhening
renovate Building No. 2?

254
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,030
Yes.

255
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,520
The shareholders have agreed.

256
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,400
Why are you doing this?

257
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,840
Whether we can acquire Evergreen

258
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,000
mainly depends on

259
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,520
how many shares we have in Evergreen

260
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,350
and how many shareholders in Evergreen

261
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,640
can accept

262
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,910
Lihe Capital's acquisition.

263
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,110
And also,

264
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,080
Sheng Zhejing is a little impulsive

265
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,590
about renovating Building No. 2,

266
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,590
but in the long run,

267
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,670
I think there is a reason

268
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,640
why he persists in doing it.

269
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,960
Have you decided?

270
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,280
All right.

271
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,550
Just do as you said.

272
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,350
Why are you changing the curtains
for me so suddenly?

273
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,910
Didn't you say

274
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,790
the curtains before

275
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,840
can't blot out light well?

276
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,550
So I changed it for you.

277
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Poor boy.

278
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
You lost your job.

279
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,320
Who knows how long you will stay in my house?

280
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,200
Barring accidents,

281
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
they will invite me back

282
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,080
three months later.

283
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,470
Are you Zhuge Liang?

284
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,710
How are you so sure?

285
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,640
Let's wait and see.

286
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,519
Xia Qian.

287
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,230
Mom.

288
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,590
What's wrong?

289
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,160
You two are not a couple at all.

290
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,880
How do you know it?

291
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
How do I know it?

292
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,470
Mu Xiaoyan told me

293
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,920
that he is fake.

294
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,070
Xia Qian, well done.

295
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm so worried about your marriage.

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,400
You found someone to fool me.

297
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,000
You're even

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,520
living with him now.

299
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,310
Yes.

300
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,280
I lied to you

301
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,040
and I hid it from you before.

302
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,680
But I'm in love with him now!

303
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,070
Sheng Zhening is my boyfriend!

304
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,680
Why were you so impulsive?

305
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,400
How should I face him tomorrow

306
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,110
after I did that?

307
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,000
Stop.

308
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,800
What's wrong?

309
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,800
Don't you have something to say

310
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,680
after what happened last night?

311
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,640
I was forced.

312
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,110
You were forced?

313
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,470
By whom?

314
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,760
My mom.

315
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
All right.

316
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,590
It's my fault.

317
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,280
I was frivolous and rude.

318
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,520
I took advantage of you, okay?

319
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,760
How are you going to make it up to me?

320
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,000
Make it up?

321
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,070
What do you want?

322
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,830
What do you want to do?

323
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,520
Don't go too far.

324
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,760
What are you nervous about?

325
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,310
I'm not nervous.

326
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,190
Do you think

327
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,520
I'm going to kiss you back?

328
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,640
Of course.

329
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,350
Or what?

330
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,430
You suddenly came so close to me.

331
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,040
There is something on your hair.

332
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,760
Well, thanks.

333
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,830
I want to eat well tonight.

334
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,070
That's how you make it up to me.

335
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,350
No problem.

336
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,920
Xia Qian.

337
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,920
Xu Lu.

338
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,470
Why are you here?

339
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,350
I heard from our classmates

340
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,880
that you opened a bargaining company

341
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,880
and it's doing well.

342
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,230
So I came here to take a look.

343
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,400
This is my company.

344
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,830
Well, it's not that easy.

345
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,800
It's hard to start a business.

346
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,710
I can barely make ends meet.

347
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,000
Do you need anything?

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,110
A friend of mine

349
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,640
works for a network technology company.

350
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,680
Their company is moving recently,

351
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,950
and they need to purchase
a new batch of office supplies,

352
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,400
like printers, tables, and chairs,

353
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,710
but the budget is limited.

354
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,310
I'm thinking

355
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,280
that maybe your bargaining company

356
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,590
can help.

357
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,190
Sure, we can.

358
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,920
Thank you very much for coming to me.

359
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,560
If we can work together,

360
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,680
we will go all out.

361
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,760
That would be great.

362
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
I'm just on my way out.

363
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,040
Let's talk while walking.

364
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,590
Okay.

365
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,110
It feels different

366
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,950
to sit in this chair.

367
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,640
How does it feel?

368
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,800
Very tired.

369
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,310
I just realize

370
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,800
that Sheng Zhening may be

371
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,190
way smarter than I thought.

372
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,400
It's not easy for him

373
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,070
to manage Evergreen so well

374
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
at his age.

375
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,040
Mr. Qin.

376
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,230
You just took over
the position of general manager.

377
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,560
You are not used to it yet.

378
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,430
You will do better than Mr. Sheng.

379
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,160
By the way,

380
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,710
the person in charge of
the renovation of Building No. 2

381
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,230
will come to discuss work.

382
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,310
Are we really going to help Sheng Zhening

383
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,280
renovate Building No. 2?

384
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,400
I promised Sheng Zhening

385
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,830
that the renovation of Building No. 2

386
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,070
will proceed smoothly.

387
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
What about lobbying other shareholders

388
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,070
to sell Evergreen shares?

389
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,760
These are two different things.

390
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,040
Just do according to plan.

391
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,830
Okay.

392
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,680
What are you thinking about?

393
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,680
How is your friend

394
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
with that guy?

395
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,070
You are right.

396
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,680
They are long-lost siblings.

397
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,590
Really?

398
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,680
How can you smile?

399
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,880
- I'm about to cry...
- What are you talking about?

400
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,280
Don't gossip during working time.

401
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,760
We were not gossiping.

402
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,470
We got work to do.

403
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,310
We got work to do.

404
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,230
What is it?

405
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,070
It's very urgent.

406
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,880
Listen up.

407
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,710
I need the comparison budget next week.

408
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,070
Okay.

409
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,400
Are you so busy?

410
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,520
Yeah.

411
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,280
The project plan

412
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,590
is due to finish next week,

413
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,400
but the client wants it three days later.

414
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,230
I must work overtime.

415
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,070
Don't worry about me.

416
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,590
Go ahead and eat.

417
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,190
Does your company need

418
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,190
an assistant?

419
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,470
Assistant?

420
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,110
I can't live in your home for free.

421
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,680
I can work as your assistant.

422
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,760
The salary will be used to pay the rent.

423
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,830
How is it?

424
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,680
Who?

425
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,190
You work as my assistant?

426
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
You were the general manager of Evergreen,

427
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,590
but it's different from being an assistant.

428
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,520
It's not at all the same.

429
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,110
Difference in profession
makes one feel worlds apart.

430
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,520
You can't do it.

431
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,950
Why don't you let me try it first?

432
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,560
Okay, let's eat first.

433
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,110
As an assistant,

434
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,880
[Worth Or Not]
you should read the terms of reference

435
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,920
given by Huixin Technology first,

436
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,070
and then get familiar with part of the budget

437
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,880
that Fu Shuangshuang worked out.

438
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,760
This is our meeting room.

439
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,920
If you have more time,

440
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,640
you can find some

441
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,040
cost-effective brands

442
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
of office desk and chair online

443
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,520
according to Huixin Technology's budget

444
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
and make a

445
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,280
very detailed budget comparison report.

446
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,710
I'll send you

447
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,800
the template later.

448
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,040
After you finish these,

449
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,800
you are ready to get off work.

450
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,350
This is

451
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,190
your desk.

452
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,920
Okay.

453
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,160
When can I

454
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,950
see the plan of Huixin Technology?

455
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,280
It's your first day at work.

456
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,110
Reviewing the plan

457
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,590
is my job.

458
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,640
Where are the other people?

459
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,920
They worked all night last night.

460
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
They won't come here today.

461
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,710
They are working at home.

462
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,920
This is your first day at work.

463
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
You don't have to force yourself

464
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,350
or pretend to know everything.

465
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,800
Just ask me if there is anything

466
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,640
you don't understand.

467
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Okay.

468
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,310
Madam.

469
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,070
Don't call me Madam.

470
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,070
It sounds weird.

471
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,560
Just call me Xia Qian.

472
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,160
What's wrong?
Is there anything you don't understand?

473
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,430
I've finished my work.

474
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,160
What should I do next?

475
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,680
That fast?

476
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,400
What about the price comparison report?

477
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,950
Do you finish that, too?

478
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,520
I read

479
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,950
our price comparison report.

480
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,000
Huixin Technology emphasized

481
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,880
that they want environmentally friendly

482
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,680
and hygiene office supplies,

483
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,430
but the carpet we picked

484
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,400
may have high levels of formaldehyde.

485
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,920
Yeah?

486
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,400
Here is all the information
on the carpet supplier.

487
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,560
Two months ago,

488
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,560
a company sued them for
excessive formaldehyde in their carpets.

489
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,040
Although the lawsuit
has not been resolved yet,

490
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,710
I don't think we should take this risk.

491
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,470
Therefore, this company

492
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,280
should be delisted

493
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,520
in the final price comparison.

494
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,110
What should I do next?

495
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,800
I've cleaned the glass

496
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,310
vacuumed the carpet

497
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,430
and watered the flowers.

498
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,640
I also tidied the bookshelf.

499
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,430
What should I do next?

500
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,830
Have some rest.

501
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,110
Why did you cook so many dishes?

502
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,230
There are only two of us.

503
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,470
The flowers look good.

504
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
Honey, do you like it?

505
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,920
I'll get some new flowers
every day from now on.

506
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,280
There is no need to do that.

507
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,230
We are married now.

508
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,400
Isn't it good to make life simple?

509
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,640
We need a little ritual.

510
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,590
It adds color to our life.

511
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,800
We can't live the same life every day.

512
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,710
Eat, sleep, and go to work.

513
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,760
Eat, sleep, and go to work.

514
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,040
How boring is that?

515
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,000
Where did you learn this from?

516
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,680
In the book.

517
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,950
Honey, have more.

518
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,000
Today, I heard from Xiaotong

519
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,760
that you've been so busy at work

520
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,190
that you have no time to eat.

521
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,800
You should eat well at home.

522
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,470
She also told me

523
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,230
that you volunteer
to work overtime every day.

524
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,350
You work harder than them.

525
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,800
Meng.

526
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,310
Do you mean the Xiaotong in my hospital?

527
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,110
How do you know her?

528
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,190
She often comes to my shop
to buy coffee and cakes.

529
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,160
Honey.

530
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,430
I think I made a perfect decision

531
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,920
to open my shop

532
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,190
in front of your hospital.

533
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,800
I can see you more

534
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,710
every day

535
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,430
and help you bond with your colleagues.

536
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,070
How great is that?

537
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,560
Meng.

538
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,230
Actually, I don't want you

539
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,400
to meet my colleagues
in our hospital that often.

540
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,800
We are just colleagues.

541
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,190
There is need to get too close with them.

542
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,070
I'm afraid it might affect

543
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,710
my judgment at work if we get too close.

544
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,160
Honey.

545
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,880
I didn't talk a lot with them.

546
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,070
I just want to

547
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,280
know more about you.

548
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,800
I opened the shop in front of your hospital

549
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,430
so that I can see you more often.

550
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,520
Since we got married,

551
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,920
we've been spending less time together.

552
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,070
I see.

553
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,680
Meng.

554
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,710
From now on, except for work,

555
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,920
I'll spend the rest of the time
with you at home.

556
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,880
Have more.

557
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,520
It took me a while to cook these dishes.

558
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,430
Don't worry, Mr. Sheng.

559
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,640
The renovation of Building No. 2
is going well.

560
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,760
I'm keeping an eye on it for you.

561
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,830
Good.

562
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,110
By the way,

563
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,920
There is one more thing.

564
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,800
What is it?

565
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,950
How to be a good assistant?

566
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,920
Assistant?

567
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,470
Are you working for Miss Xia
as her assistant?

568
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,350
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

569
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,190
Look,

570
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,430
I finished all the work

571
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,710
ahead of time

572
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,920
and I did it really well.

573
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,070
I even

574
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,640
did the work

575
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,350
that's not mine.

576
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,520
Shouldn't the boss

577
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,040
like this kind of assistant?

578
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,430
Mr. Sheng.

579
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,070
Clearly, you've been used to be
a boss since young.

580
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,110
You have no experience of
being a subordinate.

581
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,680
How come?

582
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,230
In addition to

583
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,230
being adequate for the job,
a good subordinate

584
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,000
should also acquire

585
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,110
a necessary skill.

586
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,110
What is it?

587
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,310
Play dumb.

588
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,590
Play dumb?

589
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,590
Yeah.

590
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,470
Think about it,

591
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,230
if you act very smart

592
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,710
in front of your boss,

593
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,920
what will he do?

594
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,640
He will be wary of you

595
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,680
and feel that you might

596
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,190
threaten his status,

597
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,160
so as to alienate you.

598
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,280
This is when you should play dumb properly

599
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,430
to make him feel

600
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,430
you are under his control

601
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
and make him feel safe,

602
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,310
also give him

603
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,160
a sense of accomplishment occasionally

604
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,040
when he instructs you.

605
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,760
You made a lot of mistakes in front of me,

606
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
but you were playing dumb?

607
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,520
I didn't, Mr. Sheng.

608
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,680
I really haven't met your requirements.

609
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,310
Look for yourself.

610
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,400
How did you make the report?

611
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's full of mistakes.

612
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,350
Didn't you finish your work well yesterday?

613
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,710
How did you mess it up today?

614
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,000
It's my first time making a report.

615
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,830
I'm a little rusty.

616
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,110
And I was in a hurry...

617
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,880
I got to criticize you about this.

618
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,190
It's normal to make mistakes

619
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,470
when it's your first time to do it.

620
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,680
It's okay, no problem.

621
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,190
But it is your fault to

622
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,230
put too much emphasis on efficiency.

623
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,430
I'm sorry.

624
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,950
All right. All right.

625
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,880
We all started as rookies.

626
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,520
Now you know your mistakes,

627
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,760
just don't do it again.

628
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,800
How should I make a report then?

629
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,350
Bring your chair here.

630
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,190
I'll teach you.

631
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,040
You are such a headache.

632
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,400
This report is so simple.

633
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,520
Please sit down.

634
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,760
How do I feel that Sheng Zhening

635
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
is really cunning?

636
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,830
He is working hard.

637
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,040
How is that cunning?

638
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,040
I mean,

639
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,800
as a general manager of a hotel,

640
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,000
even he comes down in the world,

641
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,230
at least he should have a place to stay.

642
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,310
Now he is even

643
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,880
working in Worth Or Not.

644
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,520
Wait,

645
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,760
didn't you watch the news?

646
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,470
He is also quite miserable now.

647
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,469
Our Qian

648
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,949
just can't bear to see others suffer.

649
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,670
She is going to help him,

650
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,520
and she won't let him live there for free.

651
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,950
Don't worry.

652
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,390
Qian knows how to protect herself.

653
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
Are you a man?

654
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,389
What are you doing?

655
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,039
Let's arm wrestle.

656
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,279
If I win,

657
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,320
you will listen to me.

658
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,910
It's a battle between man and man.

659
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,040
Dare or not?

660
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
What if I win?

661
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,950
I'll Listen to you.

662
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:39,999
Okay.

663
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,320
Go ahead

664
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,910
and change the water
in the drinking fountain.

665
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,040
The roasted sweet potatoes are done.

666
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,000
It smells so good.

667
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,560
Roasted sweet potatoes.

668
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,600
It smells so good.

669
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,910
Let's eat now.

670
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,630
It's a little hot.

671
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,280
Be careful.

672
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,080
Yeah.

673
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,840
So sweet.

674
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,430
So sweet.

675
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,320
It's roasted so well.

676
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,520
Come here now.

677
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,630
The roasted sweet potato is super delicious.

678
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,630
I left some for you.

679
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,040
No.

680
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,190
I never ate street food.

681
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,840
It's so good.

682
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,670
It's roasted perfectly.

683
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,390
I controlled

684
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,910
the temperature well this time.

685
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,190
I thought about it.

686
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,150
It doesn't hurt to have one.

687
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,430
Here...

688
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,470
I already bit it.

689
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,710
Do you still want it?

690
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,360
Don't be so gross.

691
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:58,910
It's okay.

692
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,800
I'll buy you one later.

693
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,520
It is so sweet.

694
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,760
Have you got the patient records ready

695
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,560
for tomorrow's appointment?

696
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,910
Yes.

697
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,430
There will be two patients tomorrow.

698
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,950
Here are all the medical records.

699
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,630
One of them

700
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,000
was transferred from Director Lu.

701
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,080
I looked at the medical record.

702
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,630
The patient doesn't like

703
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,710
rooms that are too bright.

704
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay.

705
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,120
By the way,

706
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,670
A few patients

707
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,150
have missed their return visit.

708
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,320
Contact them tomorrow.

709
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,190
It's best to make an appointment
for a recent visit.

710
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,080
Okay.

711
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,710
Doctor He.

712
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,000
What day is it today?

713
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,800
Why did you buy such beautiful flowers?

714
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,470
Honey.

715
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,190
During your working days,

716
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,840
the beautiful flowers will
accompany you for me.

717
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,800
Your wife who loves you the most.

718
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,150
How is it, Mr. Wang?

719
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,840
Not so good.

720
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,190
What's the problem?

721
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,430
First, I really don't like

722
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,470
the template of the quotation.

723
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,470
It hurts my eyes.

724
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,080
It's easy to solve, Mr. Wang.

725
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,150
We will change the template
to light green tomorrow.

726
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,800
Then it's the office supplies you chose.

727
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,320
We are a technology company.

728
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,120
The office supplies
should have a sense of tech.

729
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,000
Didn't I send you a reference picture?

730
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,600
We looked at your reference picture.

731
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,190
But we checked it.

732
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,600
The set of desks and chairs you like

733
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,840
is an entry lux.

734
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,910
Your company's budget is limited.

735
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,600
To balance the budget,

736
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,360
we decided to choose
this set of desk and chair

737
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,600
only for the staff

738
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
above the vice general manager.

739
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,360
Can't you buy some knockoffs?

740
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,600
Of course we can't.

741
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,230
The quality is not guaranteed.

742
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,320
There will be safety hazards.

743
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,560
Anyway, I don't really like

744
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,320
the office supplies you chose.

745
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,520
All right.

746
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,430
Let's call it a day.

747
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,150
I have work to do.

748
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,000
Give me a new

749
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,040
comparison budget tomorrow.

750
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,120
Hold on.

751
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,470
Did you say tomorrow?

752
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,870
The whole company is waiting for
new office supplies.

753
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,190
Hurry up.

754
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,120
I won't see you off.

755
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,710
Take care.

756
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,190
Can't we

757
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,870
drop this project?

758
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,470
Why not? We can make some money.

759
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,430
There are worse clients

760
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,150
who don't pay the final payment,

761
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,710
steal the fruits of labor

762
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,560
and terminate the contract.

763
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,560
He's no big deal.

764
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,080
It's okay. You will know later.

765
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,190
Mr. Sheng.

766
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,190
Look up

767
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,360
Huixin Technology for me

768
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,190
and see if they are working

769
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,630
with our hotel in any way.

770
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,840
Okay.

771
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,360
Sheng Zhening.

772
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,080
See how sleepy you are.

773
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,520
You don't have to be there with me.

774
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,600
Go upstairs and have some rest.

775
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,280
How can an employee gets off work
before the boss?

776
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,320
What's wrong?

777
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,230
Are you okay?

778
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,080
I'm fine.

779
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,560
It's hypoglycemia.

780
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,910
I only need a candy.

781
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,280
Have one.

782
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,800
Well,

783
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,080
have some rest upstairs.

784
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,190
Let's go.

785
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,840
Thanks.

786
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,360
No.

787
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,630
I'm still a little dizzy.

788
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,080
I need to sleep for half an hour.

789
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,470
If I don't get up later,

790
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,190
remember to wake me up.

791
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,430
Hello.

792
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,600
How is it?

793
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,600
Huixin Technology

794
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,840
is not working with us.

795
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,520
But I think the owner

796
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,430
is your college classmate.

797
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,230
You both graduated from
Stanford Business School.

798
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,520
He is called...

799
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,630
Zi... Zixuan.

800
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,520
Chen Zixuan?

801
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,670
Right, Chen Zixuan.

802
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,040
