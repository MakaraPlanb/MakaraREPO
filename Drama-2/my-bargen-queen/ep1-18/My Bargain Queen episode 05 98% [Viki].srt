If you are willing to transfer the wedding banquet time slot on the 8th to me,

14
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,640
I can get you a free Aegean Sea luxury liner package.

If you hold your wedding at Evergreen Hotel,

17

We can give you a 50% discount on food.

18
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,920
Dreams cannot be discounted.

This is the situation.

20
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,310
I can't make the final decision. My husband is in charge of organizing the wedding.

21
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,350
He went to an orchard for inspection and won't be back until next week.

22
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,680
How about this.

23
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,340

36

<i>How could I not slow down? Do you not common sense?</i>

Where is this? Why is it so far?

57
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,400
There seems to be people there. Let' us go ask.

58
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,840
Not us. Ask for yourself.

59
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,370

 - Hi.

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,970

did you receive the package Mom sent you?

76
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,490
I got it all. Why did you send so much stuff again?

77
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,070
Didn't I tell you that I can just buy it?

78
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,710
I normally don't cook.

79
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,690
<i>You don't understand, those are organic vegetables. You can't buy them anywhere else. </i>

80
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,660
When you eat vegetables you need to eat seasonal ones so that you get enough nutrients.

81
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,080
Okay, I understand.

82
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,200
You always go out to eat. It is not healthy and you spend a lot of money.

83
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,230
If you were to come home, you would be able to eat the foods you can't eat anywhere else.

84
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,890
Yes, yes, yes. Moms are the best in the world.

85
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,710
If you miss me, you should come back.

86
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,990

87
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,650
For now, I won't go back home.

88
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,220
You always say you're starting a business, starting a business.

89
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,200
<i>But I have yet to seen the money you have made. </i>

90
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,770
Isn't it better to come home and learn how to run a small business from me?

91
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,320
Not only will you have a stable job, you can also find a suitable partner with a nice background.

92
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,370
Um...Mom...the service is not good.

93
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,270

100
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,460
Don't move around.

101
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,880
Outside there are a lot of mosquitos.

102
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,470
I have this, why don't you spray some.

103
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,070
I don't like the smell of floral scented water.

104
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,770
Then what do you like?

105
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,350
Come switch.

106
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,950
Don't fall asleep yet.

107
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,360
My floral water. Help me pick it up.

108
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,360
Could you stop shifting around?

109
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,830
I'm like this.

110
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,140
I'm jealous of you for having a warm nest.

111
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,610
And there's someone feeding you every day.

112
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,540
You don't need to pay rent

113
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,010
or to look for a job.

114
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,380
You don't have to be forced back home

115
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,010
to find a man that your family knows.

116
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,120
Look how happy you are.

117
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,610
Let's drink.

118
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,930
Boy problem?

119
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,320
Who said boy problem is the only reason to drink? So corny!

120
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,270
Drinking alone on the rooftop, if not because of a boy problem,

121
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,520
then did you run into obstacles in your career?

122
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,160
Or work problem?

123
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,560
When you try to make it in a big city, you are bound to be a bit helpless sometimes.

124
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
Have you ever started a business?

125
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,260
I did. I'm a billionair.

126
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,010
A billionaire!

127
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,340
I don't believe you. You must be bluffing.

128
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,320
It's ok. It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

129
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,190
As long as you are laughing.

130
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,890
Stop it.

131
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,290
Stop drinking this.

132
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,860
Let's go. I will take you somewhere.

133
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,770
Where to?

134
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,370
You are experienced.

135
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,760
You know many places.

136
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,670
Where is it?

137
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,120
Deputy General Manager...

138
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,260
Is it Qin Hebo's office?

139
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,240
How come you have the passcode?

140
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,470
I've seen him open it and I memorized it.

141
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,820
You are not only experienced, you are also brave.

142
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,670
Feel free to look around.

143
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,700
What are you doing?

144
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,890
Getting wine.

145
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,600
People will find out about us.

146
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,860
Don't worry.

147
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,140
Nobody knows what Qin Hebo is doing better than I do.

148
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,100
He's...on a business trip.

149
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,450
You are something else.

150
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,820
Cheers.

151
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,940
You will lose your job some day.

152
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,680
So bold of you.

153
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,410
Then let's make it worthwhile.

154
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,030
It's some good wine.

155
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,810
Want some more?

156
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,450
Here.

157
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,580
Good morning, Director Xia.

158
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,300
I just woke up.

159
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,520
Good bye.

160
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,350
I remember it roughly.

161
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,440
After exiting this village, turn left.

162
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,050
Then I keep going straight,

163
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,890
and we are there at the next slop, right?

164
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,300
That's right.

165
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,130
Thank you, Mister! Thank you for taking care of us.

166
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,660
I'm leaving.

167
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,380
The mountain road is slippery. Please be careful.

168
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,660
Ok. Thank you.

169
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,460
-What are you doing?
-Move away.

170
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,630
-What are you doing?
-Move away!

171
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,960
Get away from me.

172
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,510
Phew.

173
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,270
Why did you pull me?

174
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,130
Why did you pull me?

175
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,790
Don't you have any shame, Director Xia?

176
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,560
What about me?

177
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,790
How are we going to get out of here?

178
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,960
The situation

179
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,290
requires us to work together.

180
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,850
You.

181
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,030
You carry me, and I will go up first.

182
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,080
And then I will pull you out.

183
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,230
How did you come up with this thought?

184
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,690
Why am I carrying you?

185
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,090
Or what?

186
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,220
Or I go up first.

187
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,850
How's this. Rock, paper, scissors.

188
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,960
The loser carries the winner.

189
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,190
-Ok. Let's do it.
-Ok. Let's.

190
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,170
Here we go.

191
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,630
Rock, paper, scissors!

192
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,100
Let's go.

193
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,190
Where do I carry you?

194
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,000
Over there.

195
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,710
Xia Qian.

196
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,610
Call me again.

197
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,600
Hurry and get up on me.

198
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,550
Forget it.

199
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,510
I will do it.

200
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,630
Ok. You do it.

201
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,900
You carry me here.

202
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,600
Wait.

203
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,330
What are you doing?

204
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,270
Are you done?

205
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,190
Get up.

206
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,100
Come up.

207
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,150
Are you done?

208
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,550
- Hurry up 
 - I'm trying

209
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,970
Wait a moment.

210
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,030
Hey!

211
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,170
- Hurry up 
 - It's so high.

212
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,780
Wait a moment.

213
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,200
GM Sheng,

214
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,140
grab my hand! I can't come down any further.

215
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,840
Do you have any sincerity?

216
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,690
This is my sincerity, I am about to fall.

217
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,380
Look at the situation now.

218
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,510
I tried my best. I'm sorry.

219
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,020
- What do you mean? 
 - I...I will go find someone. Wait here.

220
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,860
Stay safe.

221
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,860
Be careful.

222
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,430
Hey, young man. How did you fall down there?

223
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,760
Brother!

224
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,280
Mister, I would like to ask,

225
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,530
- is Mr. Han here? 
 - He's upstairs.

226
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,070
Upstairs?

227
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,880
Thank you!

228
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,970
Ms. Xia, I am a businessman.

229
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,710
I have a lot of acquaintances, I cannot do destination weddings.

230
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,140
Plus, we have already contacted our friends and relatives.

231
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,300
How can you just change your mind and cancel it?

232
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,810
Mr. Han, I did not say we will cancel it.

233
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,520
I am just asking if the date could be moved back a bit.

234
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,370
Didn't you want to have the wedding at the Evergreen hotel?

235
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,890
The Evergreen hotel hasn't changed its location for decades.

236
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,410
But a luxury cruise is different, it doesn't wait for people.

237
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,960
Have a look at this.

238
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,170
Look at this. A destination wedding is your wife, Miss Yan's dream.

239
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,830
Saying your vows under the stars in the Aegean Sea

240
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,220
is not less than saying them in front of your relatives.

241
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,220
I understand the reason, but...

242
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,940
There is no but.

243
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,170
Dreams are the most precious.

244
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,820
Really, this opportunity is once in a lifetime.

245
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,920
Hello Mr. Han. This is my business card.

246
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,040
I am the Evergreen's general manager.

247
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,080
My name is Sheng Zhening.

248
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,380
If you decide to keep your reservation for your wedding at the Evergreen,

249
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,710
I will pay

250
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,560
for your wedding expenses.

251
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,940
I was so close. Just by a small small bit.

252
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,430
Don't be discouraged.

253
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,860
It's still not May yet, let's try other couples.

254
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,550
It's hopeless.

255
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,160
So, you still would rather have a destination wedding?

256
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,510
We can have a vacation whenever.

257
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:18,820
After I send out the shipments, we can travel to the Aegean Sea.

258
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,430
But you say that every year.

259
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,150
I...I'm just really busy.

260
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,890
Hello?

261
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,990
Is this Ms. Xia? I am Han Chao.

262
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,120
Is the wedding transfer contract you mentioned still available?

263
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,880
Yes, it's still available.

264
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,680
Then is it convenient to sign it right now?

265
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,480
It's convenient, very convenient.

266
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,650
Give me a moment, I am headed to your house.

267
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,760
Okay, see you in a bit.

268
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,350
Okay.

269
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,710
Hello, Ms. Xia.

270
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,160
Mengmeng, the wedding transfer contract was signed.

271
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,330
I'll be at the Evergreen waiting for you.

272
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,330
We need to finalize the transfer process.

273
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,090
Really? That's amazing.

274
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,770
Then my husband and I will head over right now. Wait for me!

275
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,670
Okay, see you guys soon.

276
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,730
What's wrong?

277
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,880
I just wanted to inform you

278
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,540
that May 8th Evergreen will be closed.

279
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,220
Sheng Zhening, where are your principles? Where are your so-called rules?

280
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,550
Let me tell you, this is a breach of contract. I can sue you.

281
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,620
Even if the Evergreen is closed,

282
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,580
I will not let Ning Meng hold the wedding.

283
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,940
Why?

284
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,370
Why are you going against Ning Meng? She is your biological sister.

285
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,790
Because He Zhijuan is not a good person.

286
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,660
I cannot just sit by and watch my own sister

287
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,800
fall into living hell.

288
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,730
- Hello? 
 - <i>Is this Mr. Sheng?</i>

289
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,710
Your sister was in a car accident. Please come over.

290
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,120
How is my sister?

291
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,080
Don't worry, your sister is fine. Ning Meng just experienced some shock, she is now sleeping.

292
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,900
Her boyfriend's injuries are worse.

293
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,790
His arm has a bunch of abrasions. But it is not something to worry about.

294
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,850
Where are they?

295
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,110
In room 305.

296
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,990
Okay, thank you!

297
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,810
Doctor, where is the driver that caused the accident?

298
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,760
Why haven't you left?

299
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,530
I was waiting for you. I have something I want to show you.

300
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,760
He Zhijuan saved Ning Meng.

301
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,620
Although he isn't much of a good person,

302
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,890
he loves Ning Meng.

303
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,170
Does your arm hurt?

304
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,470
It's fine. It should be better after two days.

305
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,760
Since it is okay,

306
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,730
then you should find time to prepare for your wedding on the 8th of May.

307
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,980
Brother Zhening, you approved?

308
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,590
Originally I was very against Mengmeng getting married so early,

309
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:40,510
but after today's experience. I can see that you are sincere about her.

310
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,180
Mengmeng can sometimes be very stubborn.

311
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,010
Once she is angry, it is hard to coax her.

312
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,570
But she is very sincere and responsible with her feelings.

313
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,100
Once she likes you, she will wholeheartedly love you.

314
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,520
I can see that she truly loves you

315
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,670
and you also love her. So, I genuinely wish you guys happiness.

316
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,160
Thank you, Brother Zhening.

317
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,840
But before I hand Mengmeng to you,

318
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,940
you need to promise me two things.

319
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,010
Say it.

320
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,930
You should be very familiar with Mengmeng's condition.

321
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,460
No matter what happens in the future,

322
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,290
you have to take care of her feelings. Don't let her get hurt.

323
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,620
Okay.

324
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,630
And Xia Qian

325
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,720
I know what happened between you and Xia Qian before.

326
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,040
You must not let Mengmeng know of this.

327
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,600
So please stay away from Xia Qian.

328
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,920
I think this is good for you, for Mengmeng

329
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,910
and for Xiaqian.

330
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,080
I understand, Brother Zhening.

331
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,130
I'll see to it.

332
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,670
OK. Rest well

333
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,340
get better soon.

334
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,920
Brother Zhening.

335
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,120
Thank you.

336
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,430
I'll definitely take care of Mengmeng.

337
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,650
How are you feeling? Do you still have a headache?

338
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,070
Brother, how's Zhijun now?

339
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,550
He's fine.

340
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,610
He's just got some minor scratches.

341
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,880
- I‘ll go visit him. 
 - No.

342
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,950
You shouldn't be running around before you recover.

343
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,990
But...

344
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,700
How can you still be a bride if you don't recover from your injury?

345
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,860
Brother! You've agreed that I can get married!

346
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,010
As long as you won't regret it,

347
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,390
I don't have anything else to ask for. I just want you to be happy.

348
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,850
Brother.

349
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,480
Lie down.

350
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,220
Hello?

351
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,400
I just visited Mengmeng in the hospital. She was very happy.

352
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,390
She said you've agreed to her wedding.

353
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,130
- Yeah. 
 - What's wrong?

354
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,420
You sound a bit upset.

355
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,350
I do feel a little upset.

356
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,250
How about this?

357
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,970
We can meet up in our old place and have a drink.

358
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,240
Cool. I'll be there.

359
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,680
Drinks are here! Your same old favorite.

360
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,990
I'll go take care of the other guests. This way, please.

361
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,750
What's wrong?

362
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,200
Have you regretted saying yes to her wedding?

363
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,100
It's good news that she's getting married. Why are you so depressed?

364
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,260
I don't know. I can't tell.

365
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,200
Are you feeling frustrated? Excited but reluctant to let her go,

366
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,980
happy but sad,

367
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
coming to you at the same time?

368
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,530
You don't look like that your sister's getting married.

369
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,720
It looks like your daughter's getting married.

370
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,980
You care too much about Mengmeng.

371
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,030
You should know that

372
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,050
she's not the little girl running after you anymore.

373
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,250
You shouldn't treat her like a child anymore.

374
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,080
She's not as fragile as you think.

375
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,140
Right.

376
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,390
How time flies. I can't believe she's 22 already.

377
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,290
She has now grown up,

378
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,740
and she can now choose the type of life she wants to live.

379
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:17,260
And she can also be responsible for her choices. You have to trust her.

380
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,360
And she's got a brother like you. Nobody will hurt her.

381
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,850
I think you're right.

382
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,320
I think that when it comes to romantic relationships,

383
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,650
you should really learn from your sister.

384
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,520
You're not young now,

385
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,030
shouldn't you think about it for yourself as well?

386
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,040
I thought we were talking about Mengmeng. Why are we talking about me now?

387
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,930
What's more, Brother Hebo, you're still single as well.

388
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,270
Why do I have to rush?

389
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,730
At the worst, we'll just be two single lads.

390
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,160
No no. Don't say that.

391
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,470
Don't drag me into this.

392
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,590
I don't want to be single for the rest of my life.

393
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,660
This is the wedding transfer agreement for Mr. and Mrs Han.

394
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,530
Please take a look.

395
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,030
<i> Sheng Zhening </i>

396
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,960
- So we're all settled on the May 8th wedding reservation. 
 - Yeah.

397
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,140
I'll be on my way. 
 - Miss Xia.

398
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,760
Would you like to continue working on the car purchasing project?

399
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,630
- You want me to keep working on that project? 
 - As a matter of fact,

400
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,660
you've done most of the work about the car purchasing project.

401
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,940
The procurement department failed to get the price you wanted.

402
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,670
Manager Sun said to me that you've performed so well, and she wanted you to keep working on it.

403
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,730
The compensation will be the same as what we've agreed. What do you think?

404
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,130
Cool. I'll take it.

405
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,990
Bye.

406
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,270
I can't believe our procurement department can't even handle a car purchasing order.

407
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,790
And Manager Sun said that she wants Miss Xia to continue?

408
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,500
I see.

409
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,200
You just want to give her the opportunity.

410
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,020
You've got nothing else to do?

411
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,380
- Manager Sun! 
 - Miss Xia! Hi.

412
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,900
I'd like to say thank you.

413
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,030
I've accepted the car purchasing project.

414
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,490
Thank you for recommending me to GM Sheng.

415
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,620
Well... GM Sheng asked you to take on the car purchasing project?

416
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,320
Yeah.

417
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,400
You're not aware of it, Manager Sun?

418
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,730
Oh, maybe GM Sheng has been to busy to talk to me about it.

419
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,550
I've been learning how to bargain

420
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,410
since the last time I saw you bargain. I've even read two books.

421
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,810
I wasn't expecting that he would still entrust you for it.

422
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,900
But I think that's great,

423
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,250
you're the professional bargainer.

424
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,820
I think he can trust you on this.

425
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,430
I've got to go, Miss Xia. See you.

426
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,060
See you.

427
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,660
Zhijun, are you sure we shouldn't postpone the wedding?

428
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,050
The wound on your hand has not healed yet.

429
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,710
You've always hoped to have a wedding at Evergreen in May.

430
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,620
I promised you that I would make that come true.

431
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,380
Zhijun, except for my brother, there's no one who loves me

432
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,500
more than you do in this world.

433
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,650
I'm so lucky to have met you.

434
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,480
I want the perfect wedding!

435
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,250
I'll let the whole world know that I'm married to you!

436
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,280
Of course. As you wish.

437
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,670
It's time to go. We're taking the wedding photos this afternoon, remember?

438
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,550
Don't touch it!

439
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,300
From today on, I'll learn how to take care of you.

440
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,990
Let's go.

441
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,480
That's heavy.

442
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,960
Manager Sun didn't recommend me at all.

443
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,370
Then why would Sheng Zhening say that?

444
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,480
I think he's finding an excuse.

445
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Think about it. Sheng Zhening is the GM of Evergreen.

446
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,080
He wants to give you the order, but couldn't say it directly because he wants to look good.

447
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,090
That's why he used Manager Sun as an excuse.

448
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,500
Then why did he insist on giving the car purchasing project to me?

449
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,390
It must be that he's done something wrong,

450
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,600
and he wants to make it up for you because he feels guilty.
