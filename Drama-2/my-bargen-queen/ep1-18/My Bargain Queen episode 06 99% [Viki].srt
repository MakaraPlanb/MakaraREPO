4
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,110
Manager Sun didn't recommend me at all.

5
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,120
Then why did Sheng Zhening say that?

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,260
Sheng Zhening is the CEO of Chang Sheng.

7
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,890
He wants to give you the business, but he is too embarrassed to say it out loud,

8
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,910
so he used Manager Sun as an excuse.

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,240
Why did he insist on having me working on the group purchase?

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,710
It must be because he did something wrong and he feels sorry, so he wants to make it up to you.

11
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,810
Why?

12
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,500
What's with the heart?

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,730
No no. I was just saying that if we see it this way, Mr. Sheng

14
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,510
is not a bad person, right?

15
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,570
The water is too hot to drink.

16
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,710
What is it? Is it yours?

17
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,700
It's can food for cats.

18
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,310
You don't have any cats. Why did you buy can food for cats then?

19
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,870
I found a stray cat

20
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,260
at Chang Sheng. I pity it,

21
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,260
so I feet him sometimes.

22
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,850
That's why you didn't quit. You will miss the cat too much.

23
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,790
Sort of.

24
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,070
He must be a cute cat.

25
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,790
Super cute.

26
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,280
Done! Beautiful! Here,

27
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
let's change to another pose.

28
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,650
Another pose. The girl, wave with your fist.

29
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,880
The guy, you jump up.

30
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,130
We want the energy.

31
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,320
Ok ok.

32
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
I will count to three.

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,830
One, two, three. Action!

34
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,290
Beautiful! Let's do it again!

35
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,410
Very good!

36
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,900
One, two, three.

37
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,570
The ones I just took was perfect, very pretty.

38
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,380
Let's change to another pose.

39
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,650
How's carrying you like a princess?

40
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,440
No no no. My darling just hurt his arm...

41
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,890
-Your arm!
-I'm fine.

42
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,370
Very good!

43
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,340
Beautiful!

44
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,290
Let's do another one!

45
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,390
Keep the pose!

46
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,190
You are just dropping off the contract, why dress so formal?

47
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,210
I'm always like this, aren't I?

48
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,940
Other than dropping off the contract,

49
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,900
I want to thank Sheng Zhening in person today.

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,570
He gave us such a big business after all.

51
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,360
Chang Sheng is the best client I've ever seen.

52
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,290
They are good at what they do, they don't have many issues, and they pay fast.

53
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,430
Go ahead. You can do it.

54
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,970
Bye.

55
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,910
Especially when they pay fast.

56
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,530
Miss Xia? Are you looking for Mr. Sheng?

57
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,450
I'm here to drop off the contract for the group purchase.

58
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,500
Mr. Sheng is not here. He's out.

59
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,940
When is he coming back?

60
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,510
I don't know when exactly, but if you really need him, I can give him a call.

61
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,310
There's no need for that. How's this?

62
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,010
I will give you the contract, and you pass it to him.

63
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,870
-Ok.
-I'm going to get going then. Thank you.

64
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,120
Long time no see!

65
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,420
I was going to ask you if you saw the handkerchief I left here for you last time.

66
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,780
Aren't you going to ask why I'm here today?

67
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,070
I'm here to give the contract to Mr. Sheng.

68
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,180
But he's not here, it's not meant to be.

69
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,330
You've been at Chang Sheng for such a long time.

70
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,300
How do you feel about Mr. Sheng?

71
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,980
Have a lot to say, don't you?

72
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,010
Let me give you a paper. Write down everything

73
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,370
you want to say or rant.

74
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,780
Don't be scared.

75
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,120
-What is it?
<i>[Handsome, and he's ok.]</i>

76
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,850
<i>[Handsome, and he's ok.]</i>

77
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,450
Handsome?

78
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,600
He's ok.

79
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,710
Is he ok? I don't think so.

80
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,760
He's so weird. He has OCD or something.

81
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,550
He likes to nitpick anything and always has problems.

82
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,280
And he's so petty and unreasonable.

83
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,690
Forget it.

84
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,540
I was only talking about a small part of him.

85
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,890
But he's a good person in general.

86
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,980
I'm here to thank him

87
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,550
today.

88
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,900
We had some issues before,

89
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,780
and he helped me despite the issues we had between us.

90
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,570
I really want to thank him.

91
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,270
But he's not here. What else can I do? It's not meant to be.

92
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,050
I wonder when am I ever going to see him.

93
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,300
I just hope that everything

94
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,280
goes well for Mr. Sheng.

95
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,890
Healthy and happy every day.

96
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,290
You work so hard, and I wish everything goes well with you, too.Wish you happy and healthy.

97
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,530
Ok? I'm leaving.

98
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,670
Do your thing.

99
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,890
You want to write some more?

100
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,120
<i>Mr. Sheng should be here soon.</i>

101
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,730
<i>He comes to check out the floweres</i>

102
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,960
<i>here every day this time. Please wait.</i>

103
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,560
Really?

104
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,070
Ok. I will wait.

105
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,530
You are here.

106
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,930
Brother Hebo.

107
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,260
I think you aren't as good to me as before.

108
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
I haven't heard from you for days.

109
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,420
You must made a mistake.

110
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,460
You've been on a business trip, but I've been thinking about you.

111
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,990
Please, sit.

112
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,730
I asked you here today

113
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,240
so I can give you your wedding gift.

114
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,190
What is it? Let me see.

115
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,480
Open it.

116
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,830
I found a designer to customize it for you.

117
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,310
Wow, it's so pretty!

118
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,380
Do you like it?

119
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,880
I love it!

120
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,710
I must wear it on my wedding.

121
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,420
So pretty.

122
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,790
Brother Hebo,

123
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,330
I want you and my brother to hold my arms together

124
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,460
and hand me to Zhijuan.

125
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,030
I can't do that. Zhijuan will be jealous.

126
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,320
He won't! He would want it, too.

127
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,630
If you didn't donate your blood to me after the car accident,

128
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,500
I wouldn't be here right now.

129
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,470
I know you and your brother and being nice,

130
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,930
but it's not how it should work.

131
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,030
-But I...
-Be good.

132
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,350
Even though I can't hold your arm with your brother,

133
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,240
I will be there to witness the happy moment.

134
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,160
Ok then.

135
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,960
Where are you going in such a hurry, Mr. Sheng?

136
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,840
What a coincedence. What are you doing here?

137
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,250
What a coincidence! Great,

138
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,810
I was just talking to your gardener.

139
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,610
He was praising you.

140
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,310
-What did he say?
-Handsome.

141
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,860
There's more. He said you are an ok person.

142
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,130
That's it?

143
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,330
What else do you want?

144
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,200
I've told you last time,

145
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
the flower is poisonous. Your skin would get allergic.

146
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,240
<i>Wipe your wound with it.</i>

147
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,010
<i>This flower is poisonous.</i>

148
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,760
<i>Your skin would get allergic.</i>

149
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,910
Last time?

150
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,450
Which time? Why don't I remember you telling me that?

151
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,070
Stop pretending.

152
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,600
Your disguise just dropped.

153
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,170
When?

154
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,420
Not so long ago.

155
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,920
When is that?

156
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,460
When I was going on the business trip with you.

157
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,150
I saw a handkerchief in your room.

158
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,690
Then I realized that you were the gardener.

159
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,410
Wipe your hands. You are getting allergies.

160
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,920
Thank you.

161
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,100
I look forward to meeting you next time.

162
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,050
I'm not finished. I actually want to thank you.

163
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,210
I want to thank you for comforting me here that day.

164
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,620
That's it.

165
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,980
I've told the rest to the gardener. You don't have to know it.

166
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,020
I'm back.

167
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,430
Sister Qian. Did you win the Lottery? You look so happy.

168
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,650
I'm fine.

169
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,690
Didn't you say that you hate going to Chang Sheng?

170
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,750
I was just realized that Sheng Zhening is not at annoying as I thought he is.

171
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,130
Huh?

172
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,000
How could you stop hating him as much?

173
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I...I can't put it in one sentence.

174
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,830
I'm going in.

175
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,220
<i>[Worth]</i>

176
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,720
What's wrong with you? Are you not happy?

177
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,500
Why do I feel like Sheng Zhening is getting closer to Sisiter Qian?

178
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,160
How's that any of your business?

179
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,830
How is it not my business?

180
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,490
Stop moving. Hold your face.

181
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,760
Don't tell me that you love Sister Qian.

182
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,920
What's going on, Mu Xiaoyan?

183
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,090
Mu Xiaoyan?

184
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,920
That's right, I do love her.

185
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
-Really?
-Really.

186
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,610
Actually, I've been having a crush on her since college.

187
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,250
But she was with He Zhijuan, I couldn't say anything.

188
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,350
Until now, I still like her very much.

189
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,170
That's not right. You've been having a crush on her for so long and I've been with you guys all along.

190
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,310
Someone as intuitive as I

191
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,400
didn't even notice it.

192
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,370
I got it. No, I'm not shutting up.

193
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,760
Ok, I won't say a word. I promise.

194
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,820
-Put it here. Is it hot?
-It's fine.

195
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,900
Why couldn't we just order the snacks?

196
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,720
That wouldn't work. I have to make the gifts myself.

197
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,520
Give me the baggie.

198
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,560
-This one?
-Yeah.

199
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,530
-Wait! This one is no good.
-What?

200
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,400
This one has blemishes.

201
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,590
Look, the pattern is not clear.

202
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,320
If you didn't point it out, I wouldn't have noticed.

203
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,720
I want everything to be perfect on our wedding.

204
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,880
You have this one.

205
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,490
-Is it good?
-Yes.

206
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,530
Darling, the rehearsal is tomorrow.

207
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,000
Are you really?

208
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,920
Don't worry.

209
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,640
I want one, too. You fee me.

210
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,560
Is it good?

211
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,390
Why are you still here? I thought you've finished working.

212
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,730
I still have two days before getting paid.

213
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,750
I need to leave after getting my money.

214
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,560
So I have to hold my post until then.

215
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,710
What are you doing here?

216
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,030
Playing with the cat.

217
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,930
I was afraid that he won't have enough food for tonight, so I came to check on him.

218
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,230
I'm done feeding him.

219
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,070
Don't always feed him can food.

220
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,060
How am I going to feed him if he gets picky after you left?

221
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,570
He's so small and still growing. He has to eat good food.

222
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,590
Also,

223
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,010
even if I leave, I will still come back to feed him something nice.

224
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,770
You said it.

225
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,380
Then I should thank you for him.

226
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,890
He loves the stuff I feed him, right?

227
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,210
Are you doing anything tonight?

228
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,650
I will take you out to dinner.

229
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,590
Why are you taking me to dinner all of a sudden?

230
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,920
Because you feed him.

231
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,790
I don't eat cat food.

232
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,950
Don't worry. Cat food is too expensive to you.

233
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,760
I'm still growing.

234
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,380
I can't have food that are too cheap.

235
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,810
Have this.

236
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,030
Over there.

237
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,950
Here.

238
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,690
Hello, would you like to order now?

239
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,240
We will need to take a look at the menu. Here.

240
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,320
It's so expensive here. Don't you know how expensive this place is?

241
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,690
I know, but it's ok to treat myself sometimes.

242
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,870
-But...
-You take a look.

243
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm going to the restroom.

244
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,790
So expensive.

245
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,390
Don't tell me he is bouncing.

246
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,520
Mr. Qin.

247
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,340
When we are getting the check, you say

248
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,290
"Mr. Qin paid for the dinner. Just sign here."

249
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,310
Ok.

250
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,130
Would you like to order, Ms.?

251
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,890
I...I would like a stir-fried vegetable.

252
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,780
A...nuts with spinach.

253
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,880
Can you do plain rice with Yang Zhou fried rice?

254
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,890
Let's get a Yang Zhou fried rice and that's it!

255
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,520
Ok. Here's what you've ordered,

256
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,530
Nuts with spinach, Yang Zhou fried rice and stir-fried vegetable.

257
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,610
That's enough. That's all.

258
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,760
-That's it?
-It's enough.

259
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm on a diet.

260
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,640
You need to have enough energy for your diet.

261
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,920
Let me order something more.

262
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,700
Black truffle with abolone.

263
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,130
Are you sure?

264
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,380
Wine with ribs.

265
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,450
That's enough. We can't finish this much.

266
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,300
It's ok. It's ok.

267
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,830
Ginger with Chinese broccoli.

268
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,290
And lastly, black truffle with seafood.

269
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,160
-Ok.
-That's really enough.

270
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,090
Are you sure?

271
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,190
Ok. Please wait.

272
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,600
Are you crazy? This is so many! Your salary is gone.

273
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,290
To be honest, I did Qin Hebo a favor.

274
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:13,380
He said no matter what I order today, I will be paying for it.

275
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,890
-Really?
-That's why I took you here.

276
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,630
-Why didn't you say so? You are not lying?
-I'm not.

277
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,000
Excuse me, may I have a menu, please?

278
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,390
Since he's paying for it.

279
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,210
I would like some dessert.

280
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,670
I was eyeing them, but I didn't order.

281
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,430
A Snowseductive.

282
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,170
A Lingnan egg tart.

283
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,860
-Two of each.
-Do you want this one?

284
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,410
You've ordered a lot.

285
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:50,220
Let's also get a pitcher of watermelon juice. I will take them to go if it's too much.

286
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,270
Are you still on a diet now?

287
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,860
Not today.

288
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,600
I'm so full.

289
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,400
Here is your receipt,

290
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Mr. Qin said that you just need to sign it.

291
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,240
So, I can just sign Qin Hebo?

292
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay, thank you.

293
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,000
I need to finish this dish, it was the most expensive.

294
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm working so hard.

295
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,000
Well I won't be dieting today.

296
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is also expensive.

297
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,600
These two are the most expensive, and that one is expensive too.

298
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
It's all pretty expensive.

299
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Eat more.

300
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll help you.

301
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,500
I'm a good eater, right?

302
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,800
Quite good.

303
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,000
You are a very good eater.

304
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,900
When I was a kid, I used to eat seven plates at a buffet.

305
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Cheers!

306
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,600
Hello, this is for you.

307
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,400
Okay, thank you.

308
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
You, come over here and help.

309
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
Me?

310
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,800
Later there will be a wedding rehearsal, help with playing the music.

311
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I don't know how to play the music?

312
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,200
It's really simple, just push a button.

313
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,300
- Put this one on first 
 - Then later I will

314
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
- do this one. 
 - Okay.

315
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Okay, I understand.

316
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Hello, Shuangshuang.

317
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,200
I have really bad menstrual cramps, can you bring me medicine?

318
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Okay, I will bring some painkillers.

319
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
Please hurry.

320
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,800
I forgot the USB!

321
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,400
It's okay. Anan said the hotel has some background music.

322
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Why am I so forgetful? How could I forget something so important?

323
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,600
We already contacted them, they should be here soon.

324
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,800
I'll remind you tomorrow.

325
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
GM Sheng, I am so sorry for being late.

326
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,510
Hurry up and get started.

327
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,800
Hello, I am Xiaowang.

328
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,200
Today, Mr. Guo was busy so I am here in his stead.

329
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,600
I am the wedding company's etiquette trainer and I will also be your emcee.

330
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,800
Today, I will help you guys rehearse.

331
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Let's get started.

332
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Okay.

333
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,600
One pill should be enough.

334
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,000
Are you okay?

335
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,500
Shuangshuang, why don't you go back and rest? I can take over for you.

336
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,400
Okay. I was helping with playing the music.

337
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Okay.

338
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,800
Thank you.

339
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,600
Here grab the water and the medicine.

340
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,000
You're so nice.

341
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
Go, go, go. Get some rest.

342
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,000
Is this where the music will be play from?

343
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,100
It's me.

344
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,300
Later I will use this walkie-talkie to signal for you to play the music.

345
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,600
You can just choose any romantic, emotional song.

346
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,300
Wait a moment,

347
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,800
I wanted to ask what type of event is being held today?

348
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
It's a wedding rehearsal.

349
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,600
If I randomly select one, it should be okay, right?

350
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,700
This one.

351
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,600
Mr. Sheng and the bride can now enter.

352
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,800
Your steps should be slow.

353
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,600
The bride should be looking straight ahead and maintaining a smile.

354
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Nice job.

355
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
Your steps could be a bit slower.

356
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800

Make sure you don't trip.

359
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,300
Stop right there.

360
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,600
Mr. Sheng, once you walk the bride there, you can exit off stage.

Who?

371
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,100
It's me.

372
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,900
Let's go, Mengmeng.

373
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Anan.

374
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,700
Brother, I am fine now. Don't worry about me.

375
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,800
It has been so many years,

376
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,400
I did not expect

377
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,600
that you will still be impacted by it.

378
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,220
I have been trying hard to forget about it.

379
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,040
Don't forget about it.

380
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Brother, that car accident had nothing to do with you.

381
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,200
We should not be living

382
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,300
in these painful memories anymore.

383
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,100
Brother, when I had first met Zhijuan

384
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,000
I never thought that

385
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,700
he could bring me out of such a state of despair.

386
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,000
I really feel like I am super lucky.

387
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Forgetting about the past pain, doesn't mean

388
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,700
forgetting about Dad and not missing him.

389
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,400
Brother, promise me.

390
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,400
We should forget about the past

391
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,800
and live our present life happily,

392
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,500
okay?

393
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Okay, I promise you.

394
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh right, that piece today. It was an accident.

395
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,700
Sister Xia would not have know about it. Don't blame her.

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,700
I really...

399
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,600
if I had know it was their wedding rehearsal,

400
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,400
I would not have let you come even if I am dying.

401
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,300
I am sorry.

402
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
I just randomly picked a song.

403
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,400
How did I irritate them?

404
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,000
You are talking about Ningmeng?

405
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,200
No, it's...

406
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,900
forget it. There's no point.

407
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,800
Anyway, I, Xia Qian

408
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,800
have really bad luck at the Evergreen. I don't want to be here again.

409
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm leaving now.

410
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,600
Bad luck?

<i>Sister Xia would not have know about it. Don't blame her.</i>

413
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,850
Xia Qian. Xia Qian.

414
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,200
What's wrong? Something happened?

415
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,000
Today, my attitude was not good. I'm sorry.

416
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:22,000
Well...how's Ning Meng. Is she okay?

417
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,800
She wanted me to come here and apologize.

418
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,500
Today,

419
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,700
it was me who did not control my emotions.

420
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,800
Then, why

421
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,500
did she have such a big reaction to a song?

422
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,900
Because that song

423
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,800
is involved in my father's car accident.

424
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,400
That year, when my father got into the car accident

425
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,200
that song was playing.

426
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,700
After that Ning Meng was diagnosed with a rare disease.

427
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,900
Every time she heard that song,

428
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,300
she remember that horrible memory.

429
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,800
All these years we have been avoiding that song,

430
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,000
afraid she would be impacted.

431
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,400
I had thought that she would be better now.

432
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
I didn't expect that today...

433
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm sorry.

434
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,800
No,

435
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,840
I'm fine.

436
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,200
I just feel like

437
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
at that moment you seemed like a stranger.

438
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,200
I understand now, I'm sorry.

439
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,900
How about this,

440
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,000
to make up, why don't I treat you to a meal?

441
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,100
Okay!

442
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Alright, what do you want to eat? I'll book the restaurant.

443
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,000
No matter how expensive?

444
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Of course. No matter how expensive it is, it's fine.

445
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,900
- Then wait until I rip you off 
 - You can try.

446
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,800
I'll drain all of your money.

447
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,120
You can leave after you're done.

448
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,770
I did submit my resignation letter, but my last day should be the day after tomorrow.

449
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,170
You're not resigning. You're fired!

450
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,200
Fired?

451
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,110
I haven't received my salary yet. I'm not leaving.

452
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,210
Do you know that this is the wedding day of GM Sheng's sister?

453
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,180
You've screwed up such an important event! How could you ask for the salary?

454
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,000
You should feel lucky that I'm not asking you to pay for the damages!

455
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,110
Playing the music was not my job.

456
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,580
You asked me to fill the temporary role.

457
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,690
Why should I take all the blames?

458
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,850
If you say so, then you should take responsibility for it too.

459
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,900
So what if I'm responsible?

460
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,350
Even if it's Evergreen's GM standing in front of me, he can't hold me accountable.

461
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,520
Is that true?

462
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,560
Let's leave here. We should stop talking to him.

463
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,050
Vice GM Qin.

464
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,730
I... I didn't mean what I said.

465
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,430
Vice GM...Qin?

466
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,110
Apologize!

467
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,110
I'm sorry.

468
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,410
I just checked all the toilets of the banquet hall.

469
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:24,080
They are indeed not up to our sanitation standard.

470
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,450
I would go and clean them up right away if I were you.

471
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,860
Huh? Uh, yes. OK.

472
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,940
You...

473
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,860
You...

474
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,600
So you're Qin Hebo himself!

475
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,360
You've been lying to me for such a long time!

476
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,140
I've been lying to you? 
 - You...

477
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,120
It was you who said that you're well acquainted with Qin Hebo.

478
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,430
<i> To be honest, what Qin Hebo owes me... </i>

479
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,060
<i> - is a debt of love. 
 - a debt of love? </i>

480
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,180
And don't forget, you're the one who said I'm an old driver.

481
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,690
How could you say that I've been lying to you?

482
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,650
<i> Suit and tie, mousse on your hair... you're either a boss or a driver!</i>

483
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,730
<i> A boss can't be feeding a stray cat on the rooftop. </i>

484
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,380
<i> Good guess. </i>

485
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,260
<i> Thanks to my instinct.</i>

486
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,930
Well, if I've said anything inappropriate to you during this time,

487
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,520
please don't take it serious. I'm sorry.

488
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,060
What did you say that was inappropriate?

489
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,900
Not really.

490
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,190
Oh, you said that I owe you a debt of love...

491
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,790
No no no. I didn't say that.

492
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,300
I didn't say that!

493
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,100
OK, I'll stop joking around with you!

494
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,330
It's getting dark. Shall we go for dinner?

495
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,060
I'm not hungry. I'll skip dinner.

496
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,080
I have to go.

497
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,370
Then...will you come back to visit the cat?

498
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,690
See?

499
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,130
She's not moving.

500
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,560
Huh? Well...

501
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,890
It's nice to meet you these days, little kitty.

502
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:43,280
But I probably won't be able to visit you very often in the future.

503
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,450
Goodbye.

504
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,500
If you don't come back to feed her, what if I have to go on a business trip?

505
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,030
Then...if he goes on a business trip?

506
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,450
I'll still come back and feed you.

507
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,860
I won't let you starve.

508
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,120
This is so spicy! Why didn't you order anything less spicy?

509
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,970
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

510
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,800
Go ahead.

511
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,390
Why did you decide to become a bargainer in the beginning?

512
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,980
This is an unusual profession.

513
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,950
Of course it is.

514
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,910
Well, the truth is,

515
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,870
I've been raised by my mom since I was a child.

516
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,690
My family wasn't well-off,

517
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,470
and we always wanted to save some money when we shop for things.

518
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,370
At the beginning, I learned to bargain just like the adults.

519
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,770
Then it became a habit of mine.

520
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,890
I find a sense of achievement in bargaining.

521
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,360
After I grew up, I realized that a lot of people need bargaining services.

522
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,020
Some people are afraid to bargain because they are not articulate enough,

523
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,050
and some don't know the product well enough.

524
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,240
That's why I've decided

525
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
that I will use my ability to bargain

526
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,290
to benefit more customers, allowing them to get what they want at the lowest price. That's the story.

527
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,560
Is the food enough for you?

528
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,220
You're not eating?

529
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,800
Well, I've never tried street snacks before.

530
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,190
I'm a bit nervous to try them.

531
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,920
Is that enough for you? I can peel more of them for you.

532
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,990
