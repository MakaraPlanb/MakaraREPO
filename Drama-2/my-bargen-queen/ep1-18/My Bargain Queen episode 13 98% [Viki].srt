4
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,860
Manager Wang, have some water.

5
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,020
Thank you, Miss Xia.

6
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,830
Please take a seat too, Miss Xia.

7
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm good. You can sit.

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,910
Then I'll stand up as well.

9
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,230
Well, I'm really sorry.

10
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,410
We didn't have enough time to finish the proposal.

11
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,070
Can you give me one more day?

12
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,730
There's no need. What you had yesterday was perfectly fine.

13
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,190
I reviewed it carefully after I got back yesterday,

14
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,220
That budget sheet was very detailed and practical.

15
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,020
I'm sorry I didn't read it carefully yesterday.

16
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,960
We'll just purchase the products based on your budget sheet.

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,630
Looking forward to our collaboration.

18
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,400
Yes, yes, looking forward to it.

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,490
- I'll be leaving now. 
 - You're leaving?

20
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,020
- Thank you, thank you. 
 - This way please.

21
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,760
Okay.

22
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,090
- Thank you. 
 -Take care.

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,720
How did it go?

24
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,480
This guy suddenly told me that there's no need to redo it.

25
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,020
The original one is good enough.

26
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,850
- Isn't that great? 
 - Don't you think it's weird?

27
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,750
At least you don't have to put in overtime.

28
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,090
And you don't have to to blame me for not waking you up last night.

29
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,520
Why didn't you wake me up?

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,360
You were sleeping like a rock. How am I supposed to I wake you up?

31
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,580
It was our employees who made trouble for you.

32
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,750
Well, won't you reconsider about holding the shares?

33
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,080
You're the founder of Huixin Technology.

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,370
How's that relevant to me?

35
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,210
You gave me the money to start it up.

36
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,240
If it weren't for the 1,000 dollars and your encouragement,

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,390
I would have given it up and returned to my hometown.

38
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,060
So you're my original shareholder.

39
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,070
I lent the 1,000 dollars to you as your living expenses.

40
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,720
I didn't make any investment.

41
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,060
OK, OK. I'll always keep the 10% shares for you.

42
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,310
Unless my company is out of business, you can take it whenever you want.

43
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,290
You rarely ask people for help.

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,750
This time, is it because of her?

45
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,260
You're doing great as an assistant!

46
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,800
I don't have much time today.

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,230
Let's meet some other time and have a good chat.

48
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,230
Great. See you!

49
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,600
Bye.

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Sheng Zhening! Have you finished your weekly report?

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,950
Almost done.

52
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,160
Isn't that Manager Chen from Huixing Technology?

53
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,290
Who is it?

54
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,940
Chen Zixuan.

55
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,380
- You know each other? 
 - No.

56
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,560
Then what were you talking about if you don't know each other?

57
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,300
He said I was a good assistant.

58
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,960
You're lying.

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,680
<i> I'm sorry, you made a mistake. </i>

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,460
<i> We're not a couple. </i>

61
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,450
<i> She's... She's my little sister. </i>

62
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,090
Xiaoyan, my friend is still in love with that guy.

63
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,930
But he only thinks of her as a sister.

64
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,570
I see.

65
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,530
Then what does she do now?

66
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,970
What else can she do? Go after him.

67
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,790
How? He's thinking of her as a sister.

68
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,620
Let me tell you. It's easier for a girl to approach a guy, than a guy to approach a girl.

69
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,420
And if he thinks of her as a sister, there must be something going on.

70
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,540
It'll work.

71
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,530
Then tell me exactly what she should do.

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,150
Be patient. Take it slow and wait for the opportunity.

73
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,720
Wait for the opportunity?

74
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,230
That's so abstract. Can you make it more specific?

75
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,000
Just show him that she cares about him in an unexpected way.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,230
In an unexpected way...

77
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,530
Five heart-shaped eggs for you.

78
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,160
Isn't it delicious?

79
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,490
- GM Qin. We have problems with the renovation of Building 2. 
 - What happened?

80
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,790
It's not a big deal though. We're short of high-quality eco-friendly paint.

81
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,490
The shareholders think it's too expensive and are not willing to pay for it.

82
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,530
So the construction team is asking if we want to use a cheaper one.

83
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,950
The paint is really important. We can't just use cheaper ones

84
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,920
If the shareholders are not willing to pay,

85
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,920
I'll pay for it myself.

86
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,060
GM Qin, you've put so much effort into helping GM Sheng renovate Building No.2.

87
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,920
The shareholders don't seem happy about it.

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,530
Never mind what they think. Do as I said.

89
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,020
OK.

90
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,690
Xia Qian, my friend told me that he's very satisfied about your work.

91
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,260
I should thank you for recommending my company.

92
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,290
You're welcome.

93
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,090
By the way, Xia Qian. Are you dating anyone now?

94
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,780
Of course not.

95
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,160
That's great!

96
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,130
I have a cousin who's still single. He's very nice.

97
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,800
And he owns a restaurant and a bar. He's also well-off.

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,030
- You guys should meet. 
 -There's really no need to.

99
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,570
Hey, Xia Qian. You see,

100
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,530
I've introduced a business for you and it worked.

101
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,100
Maybe this matchmaking thing could work as well!

102
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,530
You should go meet him.

103
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,000
If he's not the right one for you, you don't have to meet again.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,470
- But if he's not the right one, why should I waste my time... 
 - It's a deal!

105
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,830
- Xu Lu! 
 - Trust me!

106
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,260
I have an eye for it.

107
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,090
It tastes so bitter!

108
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,660
Hi! Can you get me some sugar and cream please? Thanks.

109
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,090
We've ran out of them.

110
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,300
I saw them on the table when I came in.

111
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,230
- Help yourself. 
 - Hey!

112
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,930
Your assistant...

113
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,360
He's just like that. He's got an attitude.

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,430
Try the fish.

115
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,290
<i> [Xu Lu] </i>

116
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,370
- Hi, what's up? 
 - Hello, Xia Qian.

117
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,260
Let's meet at Sunset Bar at 3pm tomorrow afternoon. See you then.

118
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,040
OK. See you tomorrow afternoon.

119
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,830
Where are you meeting?

120
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,330
At a Bar. 3pm tomorrow afternoon.

121
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,120
It's the first time you meet, and you're drinking?

122
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,980
He owns the bar.

123
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,640
We're just meeting there. We don't have to drink.

124
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,340
But...

125
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,200
But... What if you get along,

126
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,660
and are in the mood for drinking?

127
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,080
Why are you suddenly so interested in whether I will drink?

128
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,130
As your assistant, I feel that it is my responsibility to remind you

129
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,000
that drinking is not good for you.

130
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,970
OK.

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,620
Hey, what if he's in the mood and treats me to a good wine?

132
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,980
Shall I drink it or not?

133
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm full.

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,820
You're full already?

135
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Dr. He, there's a new client scheduled for this afternoon.

136
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,390
Right. You need to prepare some assessment forms for me.

137
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,370
Oh, by the way. Please look at this.

138
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,550
I think...

139
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,000
What brings you here?

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,010
Darling, I'm here to have lunch with you.

141
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,050
Dr. He, I'll go back to work.

142
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,040
I've made a lot of food. Why don't you eat with us?

143
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm good, thank you. I'll leave you guys to enjoy your lunch.

144
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,460
Bye.

145
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,460
That's a lot of food!

146
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,730
Of course, I've spent the whole morning preparing for it.

147
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,940
Let me help.

148
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,520
Here.

149
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,360
Darling, I've made all these by myself.

150
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,720
Try them.

151
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,330
It's delicious.

152
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,830
Mengmeng, I thought you were busy at the bakery. You don't have to cook for me every day.

153
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,360
The cafeteria here has really good food.

154
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,250
Why? Don't you like the food I made?

155
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,850
I'll make some other dishes tomorrow.

156
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,330
No, I love it.

157
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,870
You don't want to eat with me?

158
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,620
No.

159
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,170
Mengmeng, that's not true.

160
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm worried about you. I'm afraid you'll be tired.

161
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,510
Here.

162
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,910
This way, please.

163
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,960
Thank you.

164
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,510
Would you like anything to drink?

165
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,650
Well...

166
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,020
I'll have a coffee, please.

167
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,340
Great.

168
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,450
Are you Xiao Yan?

169
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,390
I'm over here!

170
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

171
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,620
- Xu Lu. 
 <i> - Xia Qian! </i>

172
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,370
<i> I'm so sorry. </i>

173
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,480
<i> He took a trip to purchase some stuff today, </i>

174
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,680
and the flight was delayed. He probably can't fly back today.

175
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm so sorry.

176
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,010
<i> I apologize. </i>

177
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,510
Sure, sure. No worries. I'll be leaving then.

178
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,880
Sure, okay. We'll meet some other time.

179
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,730
Great. Talk to you soon.

180
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,770
Hi, please cancel my coffee.

181
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,590
Thank you.

182
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,800
Do you work nearby?

183
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,640
You have hypoglycemia too?

184
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,240
The candy.

185
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll take it as a gift then.

186
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,650
Bye.

187
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,030
GM Qin, you're so early.

188
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,230
We haven't opened yet.

189
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,770
Do me a favor. Same as usual.

190
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,850
Okay.

191
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,680
In a bad mood?

192
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,150
The liquor

193
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,250
can help you relax for a short while.

194
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,730
But when you go out of the gate of my bar,

195
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,820
a lot of things you still have to face them.

196
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,170
What do you think, GM Qin?

197
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,930
You're a bartender, and you're trying to talk your guest out of drinking? Don't you want to make money?

198
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,620
Of course I do.

199
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,280
But I'll look in the long run when you're my guest, GM Qin.

200
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,030
It really makes me curious.

201
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,550
GM Qin, you can have whatever you want.

202
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,850
What could bother you? I'm very curious.

203
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,140
It's nothing serious.

204
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,340
It's just that sometimes you have to be drunk to confide.

205
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,460
I see.

206
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,780
<i> Stop feeding the chicken. Let's have dinner together. </i>

207
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,490
We don't need to write this down?

208
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

209
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,510
I think actually...

210
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,240
Darling.

211
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,740
It's time to get off work. It's getting late.

212
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,880
Dr. He, you can go home first. I'll prepare the documents.

213
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,550
Thank you for your help!

214
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,440
Darling, it's time to go.

215
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,420
Thank you, Xiaotong.

216
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,200
Thank you.

217
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,820
You've treated me to dinner so many times, this time it's my turn.

218
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,720
No, it's my treat.

219
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,220
You've been treating my chicken to food as well.

220
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,430
But the owner of the chicken hasn't eaten yet.

221
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,740
So you'll eat with me.

222
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,640
Is there anything serious you want to talk to me

223
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,020
or you just want to have dinner with me?

224
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,940
Actually, there is one thing I want to talk to you.

225
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,400
I see.

226
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,080
What is it?

227
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,660
Excuse me.

228
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,490
- Thank you. 
 - This is the honey water for you.

229
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,740
The honey water is for you.

230
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,040
For me?

231
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,630
I smell alcohol on you. I assumed you've been drinking with a client?

232
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,420
The honey water will help you sober up. You shouldn't drink alcohol before you eat anything. It's bad for your stomache.

233
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,160
OK.

234
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,130
Right, what is it that you wanted to say?

235
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,440
Well... Right, I wanted to ask you,

236
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,180
the cat's shedding whiskers, is that normal?

237
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,100
Oh, the cat.

238
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,280
It's fine. I used to have a kitten that shed whiskers too.

239
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,830
It's quite normal during puberty. It won't happen when it grows up.

240
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,230
That's good to know.

241
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,590
Well, shall we eat first?

242
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,870
Here, try this.

243
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,370
This is their specialty.

244
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,340
You should try this too.

245
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,390
And this. Try this.

246
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,290
Here.

247
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,910
Wait a moment.

248
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,720
You've got...

249
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,510
Your beard is falling off too?

250
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,540
I'm just joking!

251
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,310
I'll wipe it for you. There's something here. Don't move.

252
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,460
Done.

253
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,390
Have some food.

254
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,840
Okay.

255
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,850
Isn't that delicious?

256
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,110
Yeah.

257
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,950
I didn't see you when I came back to the office this afternoon.

258
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,200
I felt a little unwell, so I came back directly.

259
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,720
What happened? Are you alright?

260
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm alright.

261
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,670
How did the blind date go?

262
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,480
The guy didn't show up. It's rescheduled for tomorrow.

263
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,810
Tomorrow... You have to go again?

264
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,850
I have to.

265
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,870
Based on my blind date experience,

266
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,270
if I want him to stop pestering me, the best way is to tell him directly

267
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,390
that I'm not interested and please don't call again.

268
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,920
Let's eat.

269
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,350
By the way,

270
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,590
The temperature will drop tomorrow. Make sure you wrap up a bit more. Don't catch a cold.

271
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,680
Okay, I will.

272
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,720
Um...

273
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,710
There is something

274
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,370
I've always wanted to tell you.

275
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,630
Maybe now is the time.

276
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,720
What is it?

277
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,980
The first time we met, I was drawn to you.

278
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,130
And I liked you a lot.

279
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,620
So, if you don't mind,

280
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,430
You can be my little sister

281
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,450
and call me "brother".

282
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,410
Don't worry. I'll treat you as my own sister.

283
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,340
Just like Ning Meng.

284
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,470
Ning Meng?

285
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,950
Mhm.

286
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,610
Little sister?

287
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,040
Little sister will do.

288
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,550
Those who are closer get first.

289
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,020
Tell your friend not to feel frustrated.

290
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,460
I think they are making progress.

291
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,100
You think?

292
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,520
Oh.

293
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,300
Where is Qian?

294
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,930
She's on a blind date.

295
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,980
Blind date?

296
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,580
Where?

297
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,420
Tell me!

298
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,850
You look very nice today, Miss Xia.

299
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,370
Thank you.

300
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,240
In fact, there is a person I love.

301
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,350
But she is not from a well-off background.

302
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,140
My family objects to our relationship

303
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,850
and forces me on blind dates.

304
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,440
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,010
I see.

306
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,780
No need to apologize.

307
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,460
In fact, I'm also here to tell you I don't trust blind dates.

308
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,610
Perfect.

309
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,180
So this won't be awkward.

310
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,210
Likewise.

311
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,470
Try our drinks.

312
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,600
You own this bar?

313
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,590
Yes, I do.

314
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,280
Boss, the bartender made a new drink.

315
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,760
You are the guest. You'll be more objective.

316
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,750
See if you'll like it.

317
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,210
OK.

318
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,590
Unique color.

319
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,280
And the taste?

320
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,880
Refreshing, isn't it?

321
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,660
They are on drinking terms?

322
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,520
Maybe she's into him?

323
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,430
Who's drinking?

324
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,170
Check the staff group chat.

325
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,300
Miss Xia,

326
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,610
here is our membership card.

327
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,840
Please come back.

328
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,870
Sure.

329
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,070
We have a lot of young staff.

330
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,570
I'll bring them here.

331
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,320
Please do.

332
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,640
OK. I'll call you then.

333
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,500
No problem.

334
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,880
Then I'll be off.

335
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,750
Sorry to interrupt.

336
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,340
She's my girlfriend.

337
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,940
We had a row today. She ran out.

338
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,490
Mr. Lin. He's my friend, a bit mental.

339
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,310
Sorry about that.

340
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,340
What are you doing?

341
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,410
Sheng Zhening, let go of me.

342
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,660
Let go now.

343
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,830
Ah-yah.

344
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,420
You said you had made it clear with him.

345
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,860
Does it take that long?

346
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,820
And why were you drinking with him?

347
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,170
Well...

348
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,770
What does that have to do with you?

349
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,200
A lot!

350
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,570
Didn't you say

351
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,780
I could ask you if I have questions?

352
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,360
If you keep going out on blind dates, how can I ask?

353
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,550
I just learned how to do statements.

354
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,820
Can't even write a weekly report.

355
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,620
I say,

356
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,660
why can't you invest more time in me?

357
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,900
I'm the boss or you're the boss?

358
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,390
Sheng Zhening!

359
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,270
Come.

360
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,600
Hey!

361
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,190
Let's drink.

362
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,600
Thanks. Today,

363
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,930
you ruined their

364
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,700
blind date for me.

365
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,640
You like Qian, don't you?

366
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,930
So do I.

367
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,630
Here.

368
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,270
Come on.

369
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,580
It's fine.

370
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,110
Drink it.

371
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,450
Mo Xiaoyan drank more. Already got his stomach pumped. 
He's fine now.

372
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,750
Sheng Zhening is OK. Don't worry.

373
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,090
I don't get it. How come they bought adulterated liquor?

374
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,140
Who knows. Cheap, maybe.

375
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,560
Unbelievable.

376
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,370
Um...

377
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,920
I'll stay with Xiaoyan.

378
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,330
You go with Sheng Zhening.

379
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,230
He should be able to walk.

380
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,200
OK.

381
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,180
Hmm...

382
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,500
What a smell.

383
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,980
Sheng Zhening.

384
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,680
Hmm?

385
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,990
Are you OK?

386
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,300
I can take more.

387
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,590
Forget it.

388
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,600
Come.

389
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,380
I'll take you home.

390
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,700
Hey, watch your steps.

391
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,030
Are you OK?

392
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,930
Hang on, stand still.

393
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,370
Don't move. I'll hail a taxi.

394
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,860
No...

395
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,410
No taxi. I feel dizzy.

396
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,190
You feel sick?

397
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,820
Fine, here.

398
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,640
Lean on me.

399
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,190
How much did you drink? You smell so bad.

400
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,770
Be still.

401
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,640
Look at you,

402
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,230
how come you both drank so much?

403
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,750
Can you still walk? Should we get a cab?

404
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,230
I can.

405
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,090
Ah.

406
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,260
I want that.

407
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,740
Want wha...

408
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,090
The baked sweet potato?

409
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,720
Yupp.

410
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,690
Fine.

411
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,620
You stay here. I'll go and get it.

412
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,550
Stand still.

413
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,400
Hmm.

414
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,960
No...

415
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,780
I'm coming, too.

416
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,460
Hi antie.

417
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,150
Stand still.

418
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,580
I'll take one, please.

419
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,360
Hey!

420
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,340
Hand off. It's hot.

421
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,390
What are you doing?

422
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,180
Here.

423
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,050
Thanks.

424
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,890
Sit still.

425
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,500
I'll peel it for you.

426
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,090
Hmm.

427
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,880
Ah!

428
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,590
Hmm?

429
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,720
Does it hurt?

430
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,540
I got burnt.

431
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,680
It's fine.

432
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,640
It's fine.

433
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,810
Wait.

434
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,000
A bit hot. Be careful.

435
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,560
Here.

436
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,070
Take this.

437
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,240
Hey!

438
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,870
Hmm?

439
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,910
Ouch!

440
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,240
I got burnt.

441
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,000
You got burnt?

442
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,890
Blow it for me.

443
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,730
Blow it.

444
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,090
Blow...

445
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,770
Blow...

446
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,280
How can you get burnt without even touching it?

447
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,570
Ouch!

448
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,780
Here.

449
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,280
Yummy!

450
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,060
No more?

451
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,890
Sobered up yet?

452
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,550
No more.

453
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,910
Yeah...

454
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,080
You say that now.

455
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,890
Goodness...

456
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,860
You smell. What are you mumbling?

457
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,960
I like you.

458
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,440
Hmm?

459
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,080
Sleep tight.

460
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,890
I...

461
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,400
What?

462
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,810
I...like...you.

463
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,290
Something on my face?

464
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,830
Nope.

465
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,570
Then why are you staring at me?

466
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,670
Don't you remember what you said last night?

467
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,360
What did I say?

468
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,900
Ah...

469
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,700
When you get drunk,

470
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,710
sometimes...you talk nonsense,

471
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,980
acting strange.

472
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,530
So...

473
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,250
If I offended you in any way,

474
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,480
I didn't mean to.

475
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,710
The alcohol

476
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,310
is to blame

477
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,280
Really?

478
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,720
So...what did I say?

479
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,820
You said you liked

480
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,000
baked sweet potatoes.

481
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,820
I'm really not into street food. But,

482
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,110
baked sweet potato is an exception.

483
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,430
It's delicious.

484
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,930
I offered and you said no.

485
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,260
That friend of yours isn't of high maintenance, is she?

486
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,880
High maintenance?

487
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,640
Probably not.

488
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,880
She has to dress up a bit. Be more feminine.

489
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,120
Then the guy won't see her as a sister.

490
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,130
- You are here.
- Shuangshuang.

491
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,160
He's all yours. Much better now.

492
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,980
So...this is roughly what happened.

493
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,250
Mo Xiaoyan, do you think that guy has feelings for my friend?

494
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,220
What?

495
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,820
How come you and Shuangshuang 
both have a "friend" that I don't know?

496
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,280
I've known you two this long. 
Could there be any of your friends that I don't know?

497
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,210
My high-school mate. You know her.

498
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,840
I think a drunk "I like you" doesn't mean he really likes your friend.

499
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,340
As you said, he didn't call her name.

500
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,830
Therefore, he might refer to someone else. Right?

501
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,140
But what he said, "I like you",

502
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,550
really bothers my friend.

503
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,780
Before, they got along fine.

504
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,340
But ever since,

505
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,240
my friend really feels awkward around him.

506
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,020
No need. Ask her to test him.

507
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,800
How?

508
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,070
Still nothing from her.

509
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,800
I think we should slow down.

510
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,700
Play hard-to-get. Simps end up gaining nothing.

511
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,220
What's a "simp"?

512
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,290
It's not important.

513
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,990
I think we can't just do things without letting her know.

514
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,160
Play cool...when she's used to you. Then...

515
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,610
suddenly you're aloof, 
then she realizes how much you mean to her.

516
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,520
How come suddenly you know so much?

517
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,320
I was expecting those questions from you, boss.

518
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,990
So I read a lot about relationships.

519
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,710
About pre-marriage, post-marriage, sweet love

520
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,860
sweet period, silent treatment...you name it.

521
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,680
I never know you can be this thorough.

522
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,480
Text him. See if he replies immediately.

523
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,810
<i>[22:12]</i>

524
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,270
<i>Are you aleep?</i>

525
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,000
<i>Also, don't text back immediately.</i>

526
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,110
<i>Let her wait at least for half an hour.</i>

527
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,270
<i>[Not yet. You?]</i>

528
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,400
<i>[Not yet. You?]</i>

529
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,200
<i>Not yet. You?</i>

530
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:34,210
<i>Ask him out. See if he's keen.</i>

531
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,470
<i>Wanna go out and buy baked sweet potatoes?</i>

532
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,940
<i>Also, don't revolve your life around her.</i>

533
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,810
<i>She needs to know that you are a busy man.</i>

534
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,150
<i>No. Busy.</i>

535
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,780
<i>[No. Busy.]</i>

536
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,580
Well?

537
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,260
Very aloof. She probably overthinks.

538
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,930
No need to jump to a conclusion.

539
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,240
There's a more direct way.

540
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,130
More direct?

541
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,050
Um... I'm sorry.

542
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,660
Dragging you out this late.

543
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,860
No worries.

544
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,960
It's just a contract. Is drinking really necessary?

545
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,540
I don't like it. But what can I do?

546
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,540
Ah...dizzy.

547
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,220
Can I lean on you for a moment?

548
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,530
Go ahead.

549
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,530
Try close contact.

550
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,860
See if he responds.

551
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,010
Be cool! You must be cool.

552
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,060
Don't let your guard down because of little gestures.

553
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,930
Be cool.

554
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,560
What's wrong?

555
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,700
- I sprained my ankle.
- Can you still walk?

556
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,500
I can't.

557
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:43,060
What now? Can you carry me on your back?

558
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,980
- Huh?
- Carry me.

559
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,170
I'll help you. Here.

560
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,640
Take it slow.

561
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,450
It's not that bad.

562
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,450
Just a slight sprain.

563
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,390
How did I let that happen?

564
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,290
You are getting old.

565
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,950
The road was bumpy.

566
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,620
It's OK.

567
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,370
Take it slow.
