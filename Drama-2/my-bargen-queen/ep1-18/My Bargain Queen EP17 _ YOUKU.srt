[Episode 17]

3
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,120
Let's meet for dinner tonight.

4
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll bring your purse to you.

5
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,310
The old place.

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,190
See you then.

7
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,320
Don't you wanna eat something?

8
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,240
They are all your favorite.

9
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,880
Thank you.

10
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,190
What's wrong?

11
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,110
You are not feeling well?

12
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,000
I got a stomachache.

13
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,320
I don't have any appetite.

14
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Then let me take you to the hospital.

15
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,630
No need.

16
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,080
Listen,

17
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,670
you may think it's not a big problem,

18
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,110
but over time it can lead to one.

19
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,440
I know a gastroenterologist,

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
who's very good.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
Let's go see him right now.

22
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,240
No need!

23
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,520
Don't bother.

24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
Please take the necklace back.

25
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,630
Since you think we can't be together,

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
I have to return the stuff

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,960
you gave to me.

28
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
Otherwise, it'd be inappropriate.

29
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,470
I've got to go now.

30
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,520
I still have things to do.

31
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,320
Shuangshuang!

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,750
It's raining! Let me give you a ride!

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
It's okay. I have an umbrella.

34
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,240
Shuangshuang!

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,110
Shuangshuang!

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,390
Wait! Wait!

37
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
Where's your umbrella?

38
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,080
None of your business.

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,470
Wait! What's wrong?

40
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,440
Nothing's wrong!

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,830
Why are you angry?

42
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,550
I'm not!

43
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,190
Will you leave me alone?

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,320
Qin Hebo,

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,880
haven't you used me enough?

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,910
I overheard your phone call.

47
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,080
Every word of it!

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,800
I was in the kitchen at that time!

49
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,030
So you approached me at the very beginning

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
and cared about me

51
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,320
just because you wanted to use me!

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,670
Then why did you put on such a good act?

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,950
I'd let my guard down 
when people are nice to me!

54
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,720
Why were you so nice to me?

55
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,319
Leave me alone in the future!

56
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,920
Shuangshuang!

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,880
Let go of me!

58
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,440

♪My dear, I'll say goodbye to you♪

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,040
Yes.

61
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,110
I used you.

62
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,270
And I lied to you.

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
But it's true that I like

64
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,350
and care about you!

65
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,440
I still don't know

66
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,550
whether you are lying

67
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,950
or not.

68
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,760
We are so different.

I do like you,

Judging from his conversation on the phone,

80
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,320
he and Mr. Xue should be behind

81
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,320
all the incidents that happened
to Evergreen lately.

82
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,640
What did they talk about exactly?

83
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,040
I think they've worked together for long.

84
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,670
And if I'm right,

85
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,880
his purpose of joining Evergreen

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,550
is to help Mr. Xue of Lihe Captial

87
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,670
to take over Evergreen.

88
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,110
And I think

89
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,640
it's also him who changed

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,230
my budget comparison sheet

91
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,830
so we mistook the African log 
with termite infestation

92
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,270
as the optimal option.

93
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,270
Sorry!

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,040
I'm so sorry!

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,070
You don't have to feel guilty.

96
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,830
You are also a victim.

97
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,670
Shuangshuang.

98
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,110
You must be tired.

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,070
Go take a rest in my room.

100
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,270
Come on.

101
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,640
Mr. Xue.

102
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,390
I think my relation with Lihe Captial

103
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,830
has been exposed.

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,550
It doesn't matter.

105
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,670
We've got what we wanted anyway.

106
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,670
And Sheng Zhening doesn't have any proof.

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,640
Besides, the 30th anniversary of the hotel 
is right in the corner.

108
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,600
I believe

109
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
that he wouldn't stir up trouble

110
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,440
at this point.

111
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,790
I got it.

112
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,390
What's imperative

113
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,270
is to acquire the shares

114
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,270
from the rest of the shareholders.

115
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,670
She's asleep?

116
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,440
Yes.

117
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,230
Under the circumstances,

118
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,070
what are you going to do?

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,270
It'll soon be the 30th anniversary 
of Evergreen.

120
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,920
I can't afford to take any risk

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,040
to put Evergreen's reputation at stake.

122
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,000
It's actually a good thing that we know now

123
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,230
what kind of person he is.

124
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
At least we can be prepared.

125
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,760
The most important thing for now

126
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,320
is to hold a successful 
anniversary celebration.

127
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,550
Good.

128
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,150
This is the seating chart 
for the anniversary celebration.

129
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,710
You will sit with Mr. Qin and the heads

130
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,590
of all departments.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,790
I won't sit

132
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,230
with Mr. Qin this time.

133
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,320
Put me on the table of the shareholders.

134
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,640
Okay, Mr. Sheng.

135
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,670
The Dining Dept. wants to know

136
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,400
if they need

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,080
to prepare a new menu 
for the anniversary celebration.

138
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,910
So, I'm here to ask for your opinion.

139
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,030
I know you are quite busy.

140
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,320
I'll call all the departments 
for a meeting later.

141
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,640
They won't bother you anymore

142
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,150
with the anniversary thing.

143
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
I see.

144
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,280
Have you sent out the invitations?

145
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
The media have received them.

146
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,110
How about the security?

147
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,230
We just hired over 60

148
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,400
security guards from a security company.

149
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,910
And…

150
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,550
where should I

151
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,080
put Miss Xia?

152
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,640
Understood!

153
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
I'll put her next to you.

154
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,710
By the way,

155
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,670
bring me Qin Hebo's work record

156
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,320
during the time I was

157
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,670
absent.

158
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,840
Okay.

159
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,030
The anniversary celebration starts 
at 9:00 a.m.

160
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
I'll go pick you up tomorrow morning at 8.

161

Okay!

162
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,230
How come you got acute gastroenteritis?

163
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,030
The doctor said

164
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,030
I drank expired, cold milk.

165
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,470
Then can you still

166
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,350
take part in the 30th anniversary celebration?

167
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,030
Who is it?

168
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,790

Not important.

but you aren't home.

175

And you are not in the office either.

Oh! I have a meeting with a client today.

177

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,590
I'm so sorry.

192
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,350
I promised that I'd

193
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,520
go with you to the anniversary celebration.

194
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,910
It's alright.

195
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,910
I thought something happened to you.

196
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,840
I was just getting worried.

197
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,280
What's the meeting about?

198
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,350
Nothing special.

199
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,080
I told you before

200
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
that we wanted to do live commerce.

201
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,440
But there's a problem

202
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,590
with our equipment.

203
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,640
Don't worry. I can manage it.

204
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,640
Okay! Okay!

205
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,520
I'm coming!

206
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,320
Do you still have a fever?

207
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,320
Fever?

208
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,400
Who has a fever?

209
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,760
Mu Xiaoyan!

210
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,400
I asked him to fix the projector,

211
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,840
but it just

212
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,710
keeps getting hotter and hotter,

213
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,030
as if it had a high fever!

214
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,000
He's all thumbs!

215
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,640
It's okay.

216
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,550
Don't worry, Zhening.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
My meeting will start soon.

218
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,640
Good luck today!

219
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm hanging up.

220
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm sorry about that.

221
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,670
It's okay.

222
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm just here to tell you

223
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,670
that you'd better have liquid diet
for the next few days,

224
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,910
in case your stomach gets irritated again.

225
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,080
Okay!

226
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,710
Good for you.

227
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
You did very well just now.

228
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,550
Why didn't you tell the truth?

229
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,550
The anniversary celebration

230
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,960
is very important to Zhening.

231
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,880
I don't want to distract him.

232
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,150
Actually, I want both you

233
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,710
and Shuangshuang to join the live streaming.

234
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,790
The three of us all give it a try.

235
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,030
See who got the best reaction.

236
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,590
Me? Are you sure?

237
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,440
Of course!

238
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,910
Then I'll give it a try.

239
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,760
I'm leaving.

240
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,000
You guys chat.

241
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,470
How did you know I was here?

242
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,710
It's a GPS watch.

243
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,000
What did the doctor say?

244
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,110
Nothing serious.

245
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,440
It's just acute gastroenteritis.

246
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,110
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

247
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,440
I wasn't lying on purpose.

248
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,150
I just didn't want you to worry.

249
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,840
Who would've thought it'd become like this?

250
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,110
Do not lie to me if something like this

251
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,640
happens again.

252
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,080
And don't make decisions on your own

253
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,470
without telling me.

254
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,110
Got it?

255
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,150
Yes.

256
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,080
Hello?

257
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,640
Okay.

258
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,400
I see. I'll be there soon.

259
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,110
I'll come check on you

260
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,960
after the celebration.

261
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,320
Go ahead.

262
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,760
They are all waiting for you.

263
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,760
Then I'm leaving.

264
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,150
Okay.

265
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,110
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

266
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,350
Take a good rest.

267
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,030
Can we have

268
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,200
a man-to-man conversation?

269
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,670
It's serious.

270
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,030
What's on your mind?

271
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,640
Why do you like about Qian?

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,960
Why do you like about her?

273
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,440
How do you know?

274
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,280
Since you found out,

275
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,200
I'll just be straight to you.

276
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,670
Yes. I do like her.

277
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,350
And I've liked her for a long time.

278
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,470
I like her because she's an earnest

279
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,840
hard worker

280
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,150
who's smart and always considerate

281
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,320
of others.

282
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,110
Nothing can beat her.

283
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,440
I don't have a particular reason.

284
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,760
I just like her.

285
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,790
No reason?

286
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,000
Which means you can't think of any.

287
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,840
I think you are not into her that much.

288
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,440
I like her because she likes street food,

289
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,880
she sleepwalks,

290
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,590
she tells lies but always

291
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,150
got caught…

292
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,200
Alright! Alright! Stop!

293
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,000
In a word,

294
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,470
I like everything about her.

295
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,229
Is that all?

296
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,710
But I'm with her every day!

297
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,560
I can be of her help at work,

298
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,429
and I can take care of her in life,

299
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,950
just like today!

300
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,159
Don't you feel threatened?

301
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,310
I think it's a good thing that she has

302
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,310
someone to take care of her

303
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,800
when I'm not around.

304
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,350
So, I don't feel threatened.

305
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,880
Anyway,

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,800
thank you!

307
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,760
Thank you for taking care of her for me!

308
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,070
Don't thank me!

309
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,640
I'm not doing it for you.

310
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,710
Listen up.

311
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,400
If you dare hurt Qian,

312
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,830
I won't forgive you!

313
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,400
You can supervise me at any time!

314
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,310
This man-to-man conversation

315
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,680
has to be over now.

316
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,430
I need to go back to work.

317
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,560
Mr. Qin.

318
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
The person in charge of the celebration

319
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,950
is asking when you'll come to the site.

320
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I'll be right there.

321
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,310
Okay.

322
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,920
Emily.

323
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,190
Tell him that I'm not feeling well.

324
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,470
Let them start without me.

325
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,950
Mr. Qin, what happened?

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,920
Sheng Zhening has found out

327
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,190
about my relation with Mr. Xue.

328
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,590
So I don't have to pretend in the future.

329
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,190
Okay. I got it.

330
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,430
Let's give a big hand

331
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,680
to the 30th anniversary of Evergreen Hotel!

332
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,560
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you

333
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,230
for coming to the 30th anniversary 
of Evergreen.

334
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,000
It's a great honor

335
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,950
to have you with us for all this time!

336
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,920
It's your hard work and support

337
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,350
that has got Evergreen to where it is today.

338
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,880
The theme of the celebration is gratitude.

339
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,190
I'd like to extend my gratitude to all of you 
for being with us.

340
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,160
I saw it all!

341
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,760
The anniversary celebration 
was a great success!

342
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,560
I'm proud of you!

343
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,560
Just so you know,

344
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,710
I've checked out of the hospital.

345
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,040
You don't have to pick me up tonight.

346
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,710
Take a good rest.

347
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,430
Got you.

348
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,400
By the way, 
when will your live streaming begin?

349
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,710
Mr. Sheng,

350
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,830
our anniversary celebrationthis time

351
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
has gained positive response from the media.

352
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,310
And they are full of praise for you, too.

353
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,230
Do you know about live streaming?

354
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,400
A little.

355
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,520
I watch it every now and then.

356
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,590
Xia Qian is doing live commerce.

357
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,350
Could you help me register an account?

358
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,830
Sure!

359
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,710
I know you've repaired it once.

360
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,470
But apparently

361
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,880
you didn't do it right!

362
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,230
The pipe is leaking again!

363
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,280
I just tightened it up with a wrench.

364
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,000
When can you come over and fix it?

365
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,430
We'll send someone there

366
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,310
as soon as possible.

367
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,560
As soon as possible?

368
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,070
But,

369
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,800
how soon can it be?

370
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,190
I need a specific time!

371
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,470
Last time you said the same thing,

372
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,560
but I waited for three days!

373
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,400
Tomorrow night, at latest.

374
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,430
I promise someone will be there.

375
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,230
Okay. I'll count on that.

376
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,310
I'll be home tomorrow night.

377
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,430
Please help me fix it!

378
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,430
Alright! No problem!

379
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,160
Okay.

380
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,519
[Meng]

381
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,760
How long has it been?

382
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,590
I'm not sure.

383
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,400
But my stomach ache has lasted 
for quite a while.

384
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,160
You missed the last therapy.

385
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,640
You should know

386
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,190
that the therapy cycle is designed
upon careful evaluation,

387
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,680
especially in your case of 
owning a large client base.

388
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,230
It could

389
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,160
easily cause problems.

390
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,560
I know.

391
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,400
I had to put it off 
due to my wedding last time.

392
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,800
It won't happen again.

393
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,280
Okay.

394
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,110
Now, close your eyes,

395
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,880
and take a deep breath.

396
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,830
Think about the things you've

397
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,230
experienced these days.

398
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,070
You can talk about anything you want.

399
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,230
Actually there's nothing special.

400
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,160
I've always hoped that I could separate

401
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,310
my work from my life.

402
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,880
No matter how much

403
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,310
I'm troubled in life,

404
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,350
as long as I get to work,

405
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,560
I can take my mind off it.

406
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,400
But now, my life and my work

407
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,400
have intertwined with each other.

408
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,640
There's no way to separate them.

409
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
You told me

410
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,400
that you wanted me to find a job.

411
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,110
So

412
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,640
I rent this pastry store, which is

413
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
right across the street from your hospital.

414
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,280
We can come to work 
and go home together in the future!

415
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,880
I don't know

416
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,110
what I can do to change the situation.

417
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,680
So,

418
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,400
it's still because of Ning Meng?

419
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,830
I know she lacks sense of security,

420
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,760
and I know she loves me.

421
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,920
But her way of love

422
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,280
suffocates me.

423
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,110
Xiaotong told me today

424
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,880
that you were so busy at work

425
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,190
that you didn't even have time to eat.

426
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,310
Xiaotong?

427
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,470
The Xiaotong at my hospital?

428
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,590
How did you know her?

429
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,310
you don't have to cook every day 
in the future.

430
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,230
The food in our cafeteria is pretty good.

431
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,430
Is it because you don't like eating with me?

432
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
I heard Xiaotong will be transferred

433
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,070
because Doctor He's wife

434
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,230
caught her sitting with him

435
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,350
and reporting work.

436
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,520
Have you ever thought

437
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
that it could be

438
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,190
your overprotection

439
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,400
that made Ning Meng become like this?

440
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,640
Things have become worse

441
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,400
since our wedding.

442
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,190
I admit that I cared 
about her feelings too much.

443
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,310
I thought everything would be fine

444
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,710
and we'd have a good life

445
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,880
as long as I could make her happy.

446
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
But at the same time,

447
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,560
I do realize it's an unhealthy lifestyle.

448
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,400
In fact, you don't have

449
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,880
any problem at work.

450
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,640
All your stress is coming

451
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,400
from your marriage,

452
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,280
regarding witch, however,

453
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,640
you haven't shared much.

454
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,070
I know I need to talk about it.

455
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,000
But the things between Meng and me

456
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,880
are quite complicated.

457
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,400
This is your therapy record.

458
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,400
Take it.

459
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,880
I also have a backup.

460
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,880
Moreover,

461
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,640
since your stomach ache

462
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
is a physiological reaction

463
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,800
caused by overstressing

464
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,230
and anxiety,

465
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,310
you need to pay attention to it.

466
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,280
No matter how complicated
your relationship with Ning Meng is,

467
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,880
she's after all your wife,

468
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,800
who should be the best listener for you.

469
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,830
Understood.

470
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,880
Thank you!

471
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,400
99% women

472
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,310
out there can't resist

473
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,280
the facial mask!

474
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,190
I've tried this brand.

475
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,160
Look how soft my skin is!

476
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,110
Shuangshuang,

477
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,310
what do you think?

478
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,430
I think

479
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,310
they all have their own advantages.

480
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,640
We have toys and food here.

481
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,280
They are all good in different ways.

482
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,190
The mask Yan just introduced is nice.

483
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,280
Ai, what about you?

484
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I like this robot vacuum cleaner.

485
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,350
It's on a big discount,

486
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,400
which will attract more viewers
to watch our live streaming.

487
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,400
Honestly, my favorite

488
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,880
is this.

489
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,310
It's a story-telling doll.

490
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,280
Why?

491
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,680
I don't think it's special.

492
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,760
Of course it is.

493
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,800
It's not just a doll that tells stories.

494
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,680
The most special part is

495
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,400
that it can imitate parents' voices.

496
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,190
If the parents are too busy at work

497
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,880
to spend time with their child,

498
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,590
they can record their voices with it,

499
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,640
so that the kid can feel their care

500
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,760
and love through this doll.

501
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's a doll

502
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,070
with soul and love!

503
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,070
I feel touched by it.

504
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,560
And what you just said

505
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,590
was also quite moving.

506
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,760
I think it's something

507
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,640
we can definitely use

508
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,760
during the live streaming.

509
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,710
But we need your professional opinion

510
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,040
when it comes to the order of the products.

511
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,710
I wouldn't say I'm professional,

512
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,710
but I can share some

513
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,680
of my personal experience.

514
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,800
Judging from the choice you made,

515
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,190
I think

516
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,070
you put too much subjective thoughts in it.

517
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,520
As a matter of fact, the order

518
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,160
of the products can be very critical.

519
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,680
Usually, we'd start with

520
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
those products with big discounts

521
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,950
and put them on flash sale.

522
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,880
Then we can attract more people

523
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,710
with a lucky draw,

524
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,070
which is like a warm-up.

525
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,680
The night sale usually takes place

526
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,350
from 9:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.,

527
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,040
during which time,

528
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,560
we'd usually get the most viewers,

529
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,680
so we need

530
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,040
to save

531
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,590
the best for last

532
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,560
and strive for the highest 
selling result possible!

533
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,350
Then the order of the products

534
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,070
is settled.

535
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,880
I think it'll work.

536
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,400
Okay.

537
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,680
Mu Xiaoyan.

538
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,590
Skip your meals tomorrow.

539
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,800
Why?

540
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
You'll be in charge of selling the snacks.

541
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,190
The hungrier you are, the more you can eat.

542
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,070
Me again? Why?

543
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm on a diet.

544
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
I'd rather you gain weight than I do.

545
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,710
Straightforward

546
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,070
and ruthless enough!

547
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,880
As long as 
it's considered occupational injury.

548
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,760
And you need to be responsible for that.

549
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,760
Okay. No problem.

550
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,280
I'll buy you a running machine.

551
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,520
Alright.

552
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,070
That's all for today's meeting.

553
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,640
Let's do our best tomorrow!

554
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,040
Let's do it!

555
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,640
Let's do it!

556
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,230
Let's do it!

557
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,190
Lie'er.

558
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,590
Thank you for your professional instructions!

559
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,070
It's all because I'm truly

560
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,830
impressed by your

561
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,710
never-give-up spirit

562
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,880
and your bargaining skills.

563
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
I did invite you for several times.

564
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,310
But after hearing your ideas

565
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,040
and your professional opinions,

566
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
I think it'd even worth it 
if I had to invite you for ten more times!

567
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,800
Let's do our best together!

568
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,760
You bet!

569
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,520
Okay!

570
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,080
[Account Name: My Summer
Real Name: Sheng Zhening]

571
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
This is my account?

572
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,230
What's wrong?

573
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,710
Isn't this name

574
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,110
too obvious?

575
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,040
Is it?

576
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,070
Is it not?

577
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,920
[Account Name: My Summer]
If you think it's too obvious,

578
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,160
I can change it for you.

579
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,830
Forget it. Just leave it.

580
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,000
Take down a few decorative pictures.

581
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,470
Otherwise, it'd look messy.

582
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,710
But an empty wall wouldn't work either.

583
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,000
It'd cause exposure

584
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,800
and make you look pale.

585
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,430
Okay.

586
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,950
This is our main light source.

587
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,350
Put auxiliary lights on each side.

588
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,160
You can turn this on.

589
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,800
That's right.

590
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,950
We can put the ring light here.

591
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,950
I think it's fine.

592
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,830
Turn it up a little.

593
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,350
I'm ready!

594
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,590
Nice!

595
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,190
Do I look okay?

596
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,880
Very nice!

597
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,310
So pretty!

602
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
This is my first live streaming.

603
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,470
I'm a little nervous.

604
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,760
I'm afraid to make a mistake.

605
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,950
Please forgive me if I do.

606
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,680
So, today,

607
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,950

How about we all come here

615
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,160
and say hi to our viewers?

616

and they are all on a big discount.

627

Here are a few items.

a very cute and fun stuff for you.

632
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,430
So,

633
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,590
this is today's highly recommended product,

634
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,950

635
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,590
Those who have kids

636
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,920
will like this product a lot.

637
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,160
We got a message.

638
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,830
“Raccoon 12345” asks

639
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,310
“Is link No. 3 still available?”

640
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,070
I'm sorry.

641
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,590

642
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,800
is completely out of stock.

643

Don't worry if you missed it.

Tomorrow we'll have a bigger surprise

645

for you!

646
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
Just so you know,

647
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,710
at tomorrow's live streaming,

648
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,640
we'll have cosmetics of famous brands 
with 42% off!

649
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,560
Okay.

650
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,680
This's all for today's

651
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,230

If you like our products

653
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,470
and our Worth or Not live streaming,

00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,110
please

655
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,230
click the

656
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,280
“Follow” button

657
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,950
in the upper left corner.

658
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,640
Alright!

659
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,760
Tomorrow night at 8,

660
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
we'll see you here at Worth or Not!

661
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,400
See you then!

662
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,350
I'll unplug this first.

663
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,830
It's great!

664
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,070
Our follower increased dramatically today!

665
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,640
Our pilot living streaming is a big success!

666
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,880
Actually, the reason

667
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,040
we got a big success today

668
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,310
is mostly because

669
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
we got Lie'er here to help.

670
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,710
But, if you look at

671
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,880
the statistics of the backend,

672
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,160
14,333 is the lowest number

673
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,070
of viewers we've got,

674
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,920
and the highest

675
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,760
is 48,987.

676
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,710
It is really high.

677
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,710
Qian, it was your first live streaming.

678
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,040
I think you did very well!

679
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,920
And it takes time to attract

680
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,830
more and more viewers.

681
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,310
We got the highest number of viewers

682
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,350
when Qian introduced how the bear

683
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,880
could imitate people's voice

684
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,040
to tell stories.

685
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,590
And it's also

686
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,560
the best-seller for today.

687
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,280
Which means most of our viewers

688
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,640
are mothers.

689
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,430
So I think

690
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,430
Xia Qian's idea of playing the caring card

691
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,590
is working.

692
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,430
Shuangshuang.

693
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,280
What's with you today?

694
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,520
Why didn't you join us 
in front of the camera?

695
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,190
I couldn't.

696
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,160
I don't know why

697
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,640
but I get very nervous 
in front of the camera!

698
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,070
It's okay.

699
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,950
The first time is always hard.

700
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,590
Just

701
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,640
take your time.

702
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,800
Let's keep up the good work,

703
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,190
okay?

704
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,440
[Sheng Zhening  Are you home yet?]

705
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,000
Are you home yet?

706
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,190
Just got in bed.

707
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,470
Why are you calling?

708
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,920
You'll always be this busy in the future?

709
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,520
I guess.

710
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,710
I've just started,

711
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,950
and I need to improve my sales skills.

712
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,280
By the way,

713
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,280
you are “My Summer,”

714
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,760
aren't you?

715
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,310
No! No way.

716
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,400
An An came up with that name.

717
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,760
I had no idea.

718
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,310
But,

719
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,350
how could he create such a name

720
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,040
without your permission?

721
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,710
I really had no idea.

722
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,280
I'm going to ask him tomorrow

723
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,150
and deduct two months' salaries from him.

724
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,470
Nothing will happen, right?

725
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll hang up now.

726
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,709
Let's go to bed.

727
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,560
Okay.

728
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,600
Goodnight!

729
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,630
Goodnight!

730
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,200
[Worth or Not]

731
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,150
The wine is a new brand.

732
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,630
As long as you can recover the costs,

733
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,520
reducing the price

734
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,800
is quite necessary.

735
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,840
What do you need the most right now?

736
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,760
Good word of mouth, right?

737
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,470
Once you've gained enough market share,

738
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,230
the profits

739
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,470
will surely follow.

740
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,470
I got you, Miss Xia.

741
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,280
But as for the discount,

742
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,430
I have to discuss with the head office.

743
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,190
If we take one step back,

744
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,760
the customers will take one step forward.

745
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,520
Miss Xia signed an agreement

746
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,560
with the mother company.

747
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
She has to reach

748
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
the predetermined sales volume
within a month.

749
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,390
Or else, she'll be fined.

750
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,870
See if there's any

751
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,150
festival coming up.

752
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,470
Festival?

753
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,230
Why are you asking?

754
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,950
Every festival we'd buy

755
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,910
gifts for our employees.

756
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,600
Find a festival and buy something
through Xia Qian's live streaming

757
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,320
and distribute them to the employees
in my own name.

758
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,280
In that case,

759
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,190
she can't reach the sales goal easily.

760
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,280
But it doesn't seem like

761
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,760
there's any important festival coming up.

762
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,120
Check again.

763
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,150
A small one will also do.

764
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,920
[International Day 
for Natural Disaster Reduction]

765
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,670
There's one!

766
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,390
International Day 
for Natural Disaster Reduction

767
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,870
For short, 
International Disaster Reduction Day.

768
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,600
This one.

769
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,760
That's it!

770
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,910
It's a very meaningful day.

771
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,470
Remember,

772
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,040
Xia Qian cannot find out about this!

773
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,630
Hello!

774
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,120
Thank you, dear friends,
for watching my living streaming!

775
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,670
It's a little late.

776
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,280
I'm sorry

777
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,670
that I interrupted your dinner time.

778
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,000
But it's only because

779
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,320
that we have something

780
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,630
on a big discount today!

781
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,280
Right?

782
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,390
The product I brought you today,

783
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,150
as you can see, is this wine.

784
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,150
The price is very reasonable.

785
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,710
No matter you'll drink it yourself,

786
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,800
or give it to your friends as a gift,

787
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
or take it to a party,

788
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,150
this wine will be

789
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,150
your best choice

790
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,230
for those kinds of

791
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,560
occasions.

792
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,520
I've tried this wine.

793
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,470
When you take your first sip,

794
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,280
it tastes slightly sweet.

795
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,870
And it also has moderate fruity taste,

796
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,150
which greatly reduces the bitter sensation.

797
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,520
In a word, this wine is suitable

798
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,760
for all kinds of occasions.

799
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,320
The number of the viewers
surpassed 2,000 today!

800
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,190
It's a breakthrough!

801
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,710
And most of them placed an order!

802
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,800
Then we should make a toast!

803
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,390
Cheers!

804
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,630
I'm just curious

805
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,840
why we got a big increase so quickly.

806
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,230
Because we are doing a good job,

807
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,390
and our products are of good quality

808
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,390
and big discounts!

809
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,800
So, our viewers are increasing while

810
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,120
the news spreading by word of mouth.

811
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,950
Really?

812
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,710
How about this?

813
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,320
To celebrate our viewers surpassing 1,000,

814
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,950
I'll take you out for barbecue!

815
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,280
Yeah!

816
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,120
I can't go.

817
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,600
The Property Management will
send someone to fix my pipe tonight.

818
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,470
I have to go home.

819
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,230
Then go ahead.

820
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,470
This is Qin Hebo's work record

821
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,040
during the time when you were absent.

822
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,910
Anything abnormal?

823
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,600
Everything looks fine.

824
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,320
But there's one thing that's quite strange.

825
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,230
What thing?

826
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,470
When the Building No. 2 was under remolding,

827
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,600
we were short of some paint.

828
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,600
It was Qin Hebo who paid for it.

829
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,710
Anything wrong

830
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,840
with the paint?

831
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,280
That's the strange part.

832
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,280
As it turned out, he didn't do anything

833
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,190
to the paint.

834
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,870
I see.

835
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,800
First, turn it on.

836
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,630
You all know that.

837
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,360
Then put the yam in.

838
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,710
The power is on.

839
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,080
Next, we'll choose a mode.

840
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,870
This all-in-one machine

841
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,670
Has an automatic steam and bake modes.

842
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,600
Press the confirm button,

843
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
and then press start.

844
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,240
[Don't let Mr. Sheng's girlfriend
see these stupid comments]

845
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,760
Mr. Sheng.

846
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,150
I'll talk to the Finance Dept. tomorrow.

847
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,190
I won't take my salary

848
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,190
for the next month.

849
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,320
You must be the first boss ever

850
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,390
who gives the employees gift

851
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,560
on the International Disaster Reduction Day.

852
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,800
I've thought about it.

853
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,230
I think what I did wouldn't

854
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,360
provide you with any practical help.

855
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,710
So, in order to achieve win-win,

856
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,710
I've decided to invest 
in your live streaming.

857
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,430
Invest in my live streaming?

858
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,320
What do you mean?

859
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,760
Don't get me wrong.

860
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,870
I didn't make this decision

861
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,360
because you are my girlfriend.

862
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,230
I'm doing this

863
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,670
only because

864
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,840
of the brighter outlook

865
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,230
of this industry

866
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,080
and your outstanding business skills.

867
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,950
Really?

868
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,520
What if you are not

869
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,910
satisfied with our work?

870
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,080
Rest assured.

871
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,910
I've never lost money

872
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,800
in my investments.

873
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,760
Trust me.

874
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,470
That's what I should say to you.

875
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,390
Hello?

876
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,430
Miss Fu.

877
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,430
Your bathroom is leaking again!

878
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,600
- Could you come back and take a look?
- Oh, I'm sorry!

879
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,430
I'll be right back.

880
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,600
Please wait for me.

881
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,670
Where are you going?

882
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,430
The pipes at my home burst again.

883
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,320
I have to go back.

884
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
The live streaming will start soon.

885
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,600
I'll be back before it starts.

886
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Please tell them for me.

887
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,630
Hurry!

888
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,520
What is going on with your bathroom?

889
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,910
My ceiling is soaking wet!

890
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,670
I have just painted it a few days ago.

891
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,760
I'm telling you, I won't let you off!

892
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,710
I'm so sorry.

893
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,950
I'm only a tenant.

894
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,520
The landlord is abroad.

895
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
The pipes are old.

896
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,470
I think the Property Management
should be partially responsible.

897
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,470
I don't care. I'll only talk to you.

898
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,080
Excuse me for a sec.

899
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:41,910
Hello?

900
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,600
Shuangshuang.

901
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,950
How is it going?

902
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,040
I'm sorry.

903
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,950
It's an emergency.

904
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,520
I'll be right back. I promise!

905
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,360
I still have work to do.

906
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,040
I need to go back.

907
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,280
Can we talk about this later?

908
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
What if you run away?

909
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,470
How about this?

910
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,710
I'll leave my ID card to you.

911
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:01,910
I won't run away.

912
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,630
Okay.

913
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,560
