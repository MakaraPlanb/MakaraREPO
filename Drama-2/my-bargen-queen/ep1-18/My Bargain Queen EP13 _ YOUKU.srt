[Episode 13]

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,760
Mr. Wang,

4
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,190
have some water.

5
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,630
Thank you, Miss Xia!

6
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,550
Miss Xia,

7
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,550
why don't you sit down?

8
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,230
I'm fine.

9
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,190
You please sit.

10
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,950
Well,

11
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,720
then I'll also stand.

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm really sorry,

13
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
but I won't be able to get
the proposal done by today.

14
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,910
Could you please give me one more day?

15
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,880
No need to.

16
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,320
The one you handed in
yesterday was good enough already.

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
I looked it through again after I got back.

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,030
Your budget statement was elaborate

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,110
and reasonable.

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,550
I was being too careless yesterday.

21
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,910
You sure?

22
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,670
Just go ahead and make the purchase
according to your budget statement.

23
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,670
Wish us a pleasant cooperation!

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,110
Okay!

25
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,320
A pleasant cooperation!

26
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,190
I'll take off now.

27
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,160
Already?

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,320
Thank you! Thanks!

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,000
This way, please.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,550
Okay.

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,190
Thank you!

32
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,830
Take care!

33
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,630
How was it going?

34
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,270
He just told me that we don't

35
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,270
have to redo the budget statement.

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,630
The original one is fine.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,830
That's good news, isn't it?

38
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't you think it's strange?

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,320
At least you don't have to work late.

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,030
And you don't have to blame me

41
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,440
for not waking you up last night anymore.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,110
Why didn't you wake me up?

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,550
You were completely out.

44
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,240
How was I supposed to wake you up?

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,000
It's my employee

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
who caused you the trouble.

47
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,550
But won't you consider again

48
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,670
about the investment?

49
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,630
You are the founder
of Huixin Technology.

50
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,110
How's that related to me?

51
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,110
You gave me the seed money.

52
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,830
If it weren't for your 1,000 dollars

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,030
and your encouragement,

54
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,470
I would've given up
and returned home long time ago.

55
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,080
So, you are my very first shareholder.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,190
I lent you that 1,000 dollars

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
as your living expenses.

58
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,470
It wasn't for investment of any kind.

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,520
Alright! Alright!

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,830
I've been saving 10%

61
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,830
of shares for you;

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,270
you can take it anytime you want,

63
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,360
unless my company goes out of business.

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,360
You aren't the type

65
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,750
who'd go out of your way

66
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,550
to ask others for help.

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,630
This time it's because of her, right?

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,160
You are such a qualified assistant!

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,470
I don't have much time today.

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,960
I'll call you and we can

71
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,000
hang out some other time.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,830
Okay.

73
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm leaving.

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,800
Bye.

75
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,030
Sheng Zhening.

76
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,080
Have you finished your weekly report?

77
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,830
Soon.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,670
Isn't that

79
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. Chen of Huixin Technology?

80
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,750
Who?

81
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,190
Chen Zixuan.

82
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,110
You know him?

83
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,070
I don't.

84
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,110
You don't?

85
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,200
Then what were you talking about?

86
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,230
He said I was a qualified assistant.

87
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,950
Lying!

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,550
Sorry, you misunderstood.

89
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,830
She's not my girlfriend.

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,230
She… She's like a younger sister to me.

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,320
Yan.

92
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,550
My friend still can't get over that guy.

93
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,790
But he only sees her as a younger sister.

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,510
Is that so?

95
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,950
What should she do next?

96
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,390
What do you think?

97
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,230
Go after him, of course!

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,550
But how? He only sees her as a sister.

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,550
Listen to me,

100
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,950
a girl going after a guy is much easier

101
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,440
than the other way around.

102
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,720
Especially when a guy sees her as a sister,

103
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,230
there must be something going on.

104
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,110
It'll work.

105
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,550
Then tell me what to do

106
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,350
step by step.

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Don't rush it,

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
instead, take it slow

109
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,510
and find an opportunity.

110
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,920
Find an opportunity?

111
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,270
It's still way too abstract.

112
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,320
Could you be more specific?

113
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Show your care to him when he

114
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,600
least expects it.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,270
When he least expects it…

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,160
Here are five heart-shaped
fried eggs for you.

117
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,230
Are they good?

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,600
Mr. Qin,

119
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,390
something's up with the remolding
of the building No. 2.

120
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,320
What's wrong?

121
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,550
It's not serious,

122
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,160
but we are short of some
high-quality eco-friendly paint.

123
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,320
The shareholders don't wanna pay for it

124
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,320
since it's too expensive.

125
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,320
So the contractor is wondering

126
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,950
if we'd like to replace it with cheaper one.

127
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,550
The paint is very important.

128
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,760
Cheaper paint is not an option.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,670
If the shareholders don't wanna pay for it,

130
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,720
I'll pay for it with my own money.

131
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,600
Mr. Qin,

132
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
the shareholders aren't so happy

133
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,320
about you earnestly helping Mr. Sheng

134
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,200
with the remolding of the building No. 2.

135
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,110
Don't worry about what they think.

136
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,390
Just do as I say.

137
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:03,950
Okay.

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,350
Xia Qian,

139
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
my friend told me

140
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,390
that he's very satisfied with your work.

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,880
I should thank you

142
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,790
for recommending my company.

143
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,000
Not at all.

144
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,070
By the way, Xia Qian,

145
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,160
do you have a boyfriend?

146
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,070
Of course not.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,880
Great!

148
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,760
My cousin is also single.

149
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,070
He's very nice.

150
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,320
He owns a restaurant and a bar,

151
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
and he's good-looking.

152
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,550
I'll introduce you to him.

153
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,830
You don't have to.

154
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,950
- Besides, I…
- Xia Qian,

155
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,390
look,

156
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,510
I've successfully introduced you

157
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,550
a business partner.

158
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,550
Maybe I could be

159
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,880
your matchmaker, too!

160
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,200
Just go and meet him.

161
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,350
If he's not right for you,

162
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,830
no hard feelings at all.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,480
If he's not right for me, what's the point

164
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,270
- of meeting him…
- It's a deal!

165
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,200
- Trust me!
- Xu Lu!

166
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
Just trust me!

167
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,640
It's so bitter!

168
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,830
Excuse me.

169
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,720
Could you get me

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
some cream and sugar?

171
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,440
Thank you!

172
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,510
We are out of it.

173
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,950
I saw some on the table

174
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,350
when I came in.

175
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,230
Help yourself.

176
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,550
You…

177
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Why is your assistant…

178
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,480
He's always like that.

179
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Has quite an attitude.

180
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,350
Try the fish.

181
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,000
[Xu Lu]

182
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,110
Hello? What's up?

183
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,110
Hello? Xia Qian.

184
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,230
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m., Twilight Bar,

185
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,110
I'll see you then.

186
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,880
Got you.

187
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,790
Okay. See you then.

188
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,200
Where will you meet?

189
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,520
A bar.

190
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,590
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

191
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,230
You'll drink on your first

192
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,960
meeting with him?

193
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,110
He owns the bar.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,320
I'll just go there and meet him,

195
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,590
not for drinking.

196
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,280
But…

197
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,760
But…

198
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
what if you get along very well with him

199
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,320
and are suddenly

200
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,590
in the mood

201
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,640
for a drink?

202
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,000
Why do you care so much

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
about whether I'll drink or not?

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,960
As your assistant,

205
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,350
it's my duty and responsibility

206
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,320
to remind you

207
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,910
that drinking is a bad habit.

208
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,080
I see.

209
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,280
But,

210
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,910
what if he's in the mood

211
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,230
for treating me some whisky?

212
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,910
Shall I go for it or not?

213
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,590
I'm full.

214
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,590
You are full already?

215
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,550
Doctor He,

216
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,880
we have a new patient this afternoon.

217
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,280
Yes.

218
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,080
I need you to prepare
some test charts for me.

219
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,200
By the way,

220
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,030
please take a look at this.

221
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,590
It seems…

222
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,440
What brings you here?

223
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,670
Honey,

224
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,030
I'm here to have lunch with you.

225
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,760
Doctor He,

226
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,790
then I'll go back to work.

227
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,550
Okay.

228
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,030
I cooked a lot.

229
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,000
Why don't you eat with us?

230
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,470
It's okay,

231
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,230
but thanks!

232
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm leaving now.

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,520
See you.

234
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,000
Why did you cook this much?

235
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah.

236
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
I cooked for a whole morning.

237
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,030
Let me.

238
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,670
Here.

239
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,710
Honey,

240
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,320
I cooked them all by myself.

241
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
See if you like them.

242
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,840
Yum!

243
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,080
Meng,

244
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,670
since the store is busy,

245
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,520
you don't have to cook for me
every day in the future.

246
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,440
The food in our cafeteria pretty good.

247
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,000
What?

248
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,030
You don't like the dishes I cooked?

249
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,590
Then I'll cook some new ones tomorrow.

250
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,590
It's not that.

251
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,550
I like your food.

252
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,000
Then is it because

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,590
you don't like eating with me?

254
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
No.

255
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,110
Meng,

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,110
you got me wrong.

257
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,150
I just don't want you

258
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,840
to exhaust yourself.

259
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,790
Miss, this way, please.

260
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,000
Thank you!

261
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,590
What would you like to drink?

262
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,760
A cup of coffee, please.

263
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,350
Okay.

264
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,000
Are you Yan?

265
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm here!

266
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:02,880
Sorry!

267
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,280
Xu Lu.

268
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Xia Qian.

269
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,910
I'm really sorry,

270
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,320
but he went out of the town for restocking,

271
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,110
and his fight was late.

272
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,030
He won't be able to come back today.

273
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm so sorry.

274
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,910
My apology!

275
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,150
It's alright!

276
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,520
Don't worry about it!

277
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,320
Then I'm leaving!

278
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,590
Okay!

279
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,470
I'll call you later.

280
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,640
Alright! Bye!

281
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,880
Well…

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,790
Cancel my order, please!

283
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,550
Thank you!

284
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,590
You work around here?

285
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,440
You also got low blood sugar?

286
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,280
The candy.

287
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Then I'll take it as a gift.

288
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,760
See you.

289
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,590
Mr. Qin,

290
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,350
you are so early.

291
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,110
We are not even open yet.

292
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,520
Do me a favor.

293
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,880
As usual.

294
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,960
Okay.

295
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,710
Feel blue?

296
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
The wine

297
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,110
can surely relax you temporarily.

298
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,710
But I think there are

299
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,230
many things that you need

300
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,760
to face head-on when you

301
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,640
walk out of this door.

302
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,070
What do you think, Mr. Qin?

303
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
As a bartender,

304
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
you are talking your customer
out of drinking.

305
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,590
Don't wanna make money anymore?

306
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,830
Of course I do.

307
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,640
But I aim for a long run

308
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,350
when my customer is you, Mr. Qin.

309
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,640
Sometimes I'm really confused.

310
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,880
Tell me, Mr. Qin,

311
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,000
you can get anything you want.

312
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,350
What could possibly bother you?

313
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,710
I'm so curious.

314
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,280
Nothing serious.

315
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,710
It's just that

316
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,280
a drunk mind speaks a sober heart.

317
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,590
Got you.

318
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,400
Stop feeding the chickens.

319
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,560
Let's have dinner together.

320
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,830
I don't have to write this down?

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,350
Actually, I think…

322
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,590
Honey!

323
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,280
- Meng.
- It's time to get off work.

324
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,350
It's late already.

325
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,830
Then, Doctor He,

326
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,950
please go home.

327
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,040
I'll prepare the materials.

328
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,070
Thank you

329
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,920
for your help!

330
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
Honey, time to go home!

331
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,160
Thank you, Xiaotong!

332
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,040
Thanks!

333
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,950
You treat me all the time.

334
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,710
This time it's on me.

335
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,110
It's okay. Let me pay for it.

336
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,470
You already help me

337
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,040
a lot by feeding my chickens,

338
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,520
But the owner of the chickens
hasn't eaten yet.

339
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,640
Then you can eat with me.

340
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,040
You asked me out today for business

341
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,000
or just for a meal?

342
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,800
Actually,

343
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,470
I have something to tell you.

344
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,950
What is it?

345
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,680
Excuse me.

346
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,350
Thank you!

347
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,470
Your honey water.

348
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,680
It's for you.

349
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,230
For me?

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,830
I smelled alcohol on you.

351
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,110
You must have drunk for business.

352
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,110
Honey water will sober you up.

353
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,350
And try not to drink with empty stomach.

354
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,430
It's not good for your health.

355
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,920
Okay.

356
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:36,950
Oh, right.

357
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,000
What were you saying?

358
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh.

359
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,470
I… I wanted to ask you

360
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,520
if I should worry when my cat

361
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,190
sheds whiskers.

362
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,680
Your cat?

363
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,070
It'll be fine.

364
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,800
My cat used to shed whiskers
when it was little.

365
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,560
It's normal for a growing cat.

366
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,920
It'll stop when it's fully grown.

367
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,190
That's a relief, then.

368
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,920
Well…

369
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,920
Let's dig in!

370
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,110
Here.

371
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,280
Try this.

372
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,950
It's the signature dish here.

373
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,920
And this. Have a taste.

374
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,760
Okay.

375
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,830
And also, this.

376
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,160
Taste it!

377
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,400
Here.

378
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,880
Hold on!

379
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,470
Here!

380
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,470
You just shed a whisker, too!

381
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,830
I was teasing you!

382
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,520
Here. Let me clean it for you.

383
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,710
You've got something here.

384
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,950
Don't move.

385
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,280
There you go.

386
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,760
Please eat.

387
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,560
Tasty, huh?

388
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,560
How come I didn't see you this afternoon

389
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,350
when I came back to the office?

390
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,830
I wasn't feeling well,

391
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,110
so I left early.

392
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,000
What happened?

393
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,520
Are you okay?

394
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,190
I'm fine.

395
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,470
How was your blind date?

396
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,920
He didn't make it today.

397
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,520
I'll see him tomorrow.

398
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,590
Again? Tomorrow?

399
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,760
I've got to go.

400
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,560
My previous experience taught me

401
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,310
that the best way

402
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:51,950
of rejecting is

403
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,040
to tell him directly

404
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,350
that I'm not interested

405
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,560
and I don't want to keep in touch.

406
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,110
Let's eat.

407
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,000
By the way,

408
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,520
it'll get cold tomorrow.
Remember to keep warm.

409
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,310
Don't catch a cold.

410
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,830
Got it.

411
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,950
Oh,

412
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,640
here's something

413
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,470
I've always wanted to say to you.

414
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,070
And I think

415
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,830
now it's time to tell you that.

416
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,400
What is it?

417
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,230
Actually, I felt very close to you

418
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,520
and I… I really like you

419
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,040
since I first met you.

420
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,920
If you don't mind,

421
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,710
I want you to be my younger sister.

422
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,400
You can call me big brother.

423
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,520
Don't worry!

424
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,310
I will treat you as my real sister,

425
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,190
like how I treat Ning Meng.

426
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,310
Ning…

427
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,040
Ning Meng?

428
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,470
Younger sister?

429
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,830
Being a younger sister is fine!

430
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,230
It'll give her the access
to getting close to him.

431
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,710
Tell your friend not to be disappointed.

432
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
I think it's a progress
in their relationship!

433
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,880
Really?

434
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,190
Where's Qian?

435
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,230
On a blind date.

436
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,590
A blind date?

437
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,040
Where did she go?

438
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,230
Tell me!

439
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,280
Miss Xia, you look nice today.

440
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,230
Thank you!

441
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,760
In fact, I'm already in love with someone.

442
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,000
But my family object to our relationship

443
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,710
because they think I'm out of her league.

444
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,110
That's why they force me
to go on blind dates.

445
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,470
I'm sorry.

446
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,800
I see.

447
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,230
You don't have to apologize.

448
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,190
Actually, I also wanted to say

449
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,000
how unreliable this kinda date is.

450
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,230
Then it's good.

451
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,710
There are no hard feelings between us.

452
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,760
Likewise.

453
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,880
Please taste the drink.

454
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,310
This bar is yours?

455
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,640
Yes. I opened this bar.

456
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,920
Boss,

457
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,070
the bartender just came up
with a new recipe.

458
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,110
Please give it a try.

459
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,800
Okay. Thanks!

460
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,880
You are my guest.

461
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,400
You'll be more objective than me.

462
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,800
Try it and see if you like it.

463
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,310
Okay.

464
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,560
It's got a unique color.

465
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,230
Taste it.

466
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,070
Do you feel refreshing?

467
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,430
She's drinking?

468
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,070
Is she really into that guy?

469
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,350
Who's drinking?

470
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,920
Check the employee chatting group.

471
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,800
Miss Xia,

472
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,230
this is a membership card of my bar.

473
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,590
Please come here when you have time.

474
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,400
Sure.

475
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,470
I have quite a few

476
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,760
young employees in my company.

477
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,280
I'll bring them here in the future.

478
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,040
Anytime.

479
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,680
Okay.

480
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,520
I'll give you a call in advance.

481
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,230
Okay.

482
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,800
You bet.

483
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,230
If there's nothing else,

484
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,920
I'll take off now.

485
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,040
Sorry to interrupt!

486
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,160
This is my girlfriend.

487
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,760
We had a fight today,

488
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,830
so she ran away.

489
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,680
Mr. Lin,

490
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,590
he's my friend.

491
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,520
He has a mental…

492
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm sorry!

493
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,110
Please excuse us!

494
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,190
What are you doing?

495
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,190
Sheng Zhening.

496
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,190
Let go of me!

497
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,230
Let go.

498
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,950
Didn't you say you'd reject him?

499
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,560
Would it take that long to do it?

500
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,070
And why… why were you drinking?

501
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,110
I…

502
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,640
How's that related to you?

503
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,560
Of course it's related to me!

504
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,310
You said I could go to you

505
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,950
at any time when I have questions.

506
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,680
If you go on a blind date every day,

507
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,680
how am I supposed to find you?

508
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,230
I just learned how to do the statements.

509
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,590
I still don't know how
to write the weekly report.

510
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,760
Why can't you spend

511
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,430
more time on me?

512
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,800
Which one of us is the boss? You or me?

513
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,760
Sheng Zhening.

514
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,230
Come here!

515
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,190
Let's have a drink!

516
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,760
Thank you

517
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,040
for helping me

518
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,880
stop their blind date today!

519
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,800
You like Qian, don't you?

520
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,350
I also like her!

521
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,800
Here. Drink it!

522
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,310
Come on!

523
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,920
Go ahead! It's okay!

524
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,319
[Taijisun Hospital]

525
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,430
Mu Xiaoyan drank too much.

526
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
The doctor has pumped his stomach.

527
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,310
He's fine now.

528
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,310
Sheng Zhening is okay.

529
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,830
Don't worry.

530
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,310
I just don't get it.

531
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,880
How did they get the fake wine?

532
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,520
Who knows?

533
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Must because it's cheap.

534
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,680
I can't believe it!

535
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,520
I'll stay and take care of Yan.

536
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,920
You can take Sheng Zhening home.

537
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,230
I think he can walk.

538
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,070
Okay.

539
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,520
What a strong smell!

540
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,430
Sheng Zhening.

541
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,040
Are you okay?

542
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,190
I can drink more.

543
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,680
Stop drinking!

544
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,400
Now, get up.

545
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,310
I'll take you home.

546
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,470
Here.

547
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,590
Take it slow!

548
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,070
Are you alright?

549
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,350
Hold on!

550
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,160
Stand still!

551
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,400
Don't… Don't move.

552
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,040
I'll hail a cab.

553
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,430
No… No…

554
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,590
No cab.

555
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,350
I feel dizzy.

556
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,110
Don't feel well?

557
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,280
Now, let me help you walk.

558
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,430
Lean against me.

559
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,070
How much did you drink exactly?

560
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,950
You smell so bad!

561
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,880
Be still.

562
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,920
Look at you!

563
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,710
Why did you drink so much

564
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,640
with Mu Xiaoyan?

565
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,880
Can you walk?

566
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,640
Let's take a cab if you can't.

567
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,230
I can.

568
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,640
I want that!

569
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,710
Want what?

570
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,280
You want a roasted yam?

571
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,190
Alright!

572
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
Then stay here.

573
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,560
I'll go buy one for you.

574
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,040
Stand still!

575
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,430
I'll go with you.

576
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,430
Ma'am.

577
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,430
Could you…

578
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,350
Stand still! Don't move!

579
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,280
Could you bag one for me?

580
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,230
Don't touch it!

581
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,070
It's hot!

582
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,160
What are you doing?

583
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,760
Here you go.

584
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,230
- Thank you! Thanks!
- Take care!

585
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,000
Now, sit tight.

586
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll peel the yam for you.

587
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,190
Does it hurt?

588
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:05,950
Let me blow on it for you.

589
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,560
It burnt me.

590
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,310
Okay! I'm fine!

591
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,590
Stop it! I'm okay.

592
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,760
Wait a sec.

593
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,920
It's hot. Careful.

594
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,110
Take this.

595
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:29,830
Sheng Zhening!

596
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,310
It's okay! It's okay!

597
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,830
I got burnt!

598
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,800
You got…

599
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,830
Blow on it for me!

600
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,920
Blow…

601
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,350
Blow…

602
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,640
Blow…

603
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,830
You didn't even touch the yam.

604
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,470
How could you get burnt?

605
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,470
Sit tight!

606
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,160
Tastes good!

607
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,920
Done?

608
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,280
Are you sober yet?

609
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,470
I won't drink anymore.

610
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,430
No more, huh?

611
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,000
Why did you drink that much?

612
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,470
Smells so bad!

613
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,470
What are you murmuring?

614
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,000
I like you!

615
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,950
Goodnight!

616
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,590
I…

617
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,590
What did you say?

618
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,760
I… I like… I like you!

619
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,880
Anything on my face?

620
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,800
Nope.

621
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,710
Then why are you staring?

622
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,560
You don't remember

623
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,430
what you said last night?

624
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,310
What did I say?

625
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,760
When people are drunk,

626
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,470
they'd say

627
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,310
or do something that's against

628
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,880
their intention.

629
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,470
So, if I did something that offended you,

630
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,000
I didn't mean it.

631
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,470
It's all the alcohol's fault.

632
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,119
Really?

633
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,670
Well…

634
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,320
What did I say?

635
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,800
You said you like…

636
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,910
eating roasted yam!

637
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm not a fan

638
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,999
Of the street food.

639
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,150
But roasted yam

640
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,870
is an exception.

641
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,150
It was tasty.

642
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,470
I asked you to eat more but you wouldn't.

643
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,280
That friend of yours

644
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,470
doesn't like to dress up, does she?

645
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,000
Dress up?

646
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,280
I guess.

647
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,230
Tell her to dress up

648
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,470
and be more feminine.

649
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,870
In that case, men will stop

650
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,800
seeing her as a sister.

651
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,390
There you are.

652
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,910
Shuangshuang.

653
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,950
He's yours.

654
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,000
He's much better now.

655
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,430
So that's what happened.

656
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Mu Xiaoyan,

657
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,760
do you think that guy

658
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,000
likes my friend?

659
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,000
What?

660
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,150
How come both you and Shuangshuang

661
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,150
have friends I don't know?

662
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,870
I've known you guys for a long time.

663
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,470
I know all your friends.

664
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
It's one of my high school classmates.

665
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,000
You know her.

666
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,840
I think

667
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,630
the drunk talk “I like you”

668
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,630
doesn't mean he really likes your friend.

669
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,800
As you said,

670
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,280
he didn't even say your friend's name.

671
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,950
So,

672
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,470
he could refer to someone else.

673
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,760
Right?

674
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,360
But his words

675
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,600
“I like you”

676
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,000
really bothers my friend.

677
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,630
They used to get along very well,

678
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,630
but after he said that,

679
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,710
my friend feels awkward

680
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,840
as soon as she sees him.

681
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,000
No need to worry.

682
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,230
You can ask your friend to find a way

683
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,190
to test him.

684
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,600
How?

685
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,600
She still doesn't have any clue.

686
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,470
I think we need to slow down,

687
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,360
and play hard to get.

688
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,470
Otherwise, you'd get nothing

689
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,190
from being a lickspittle.

690
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,470
A lickspittle? What do you mean?

691
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,150
That's not important.

692
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
[Get nothing from being a lickspittle]
I think instead

693
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,470
[Get nothing from being a lickspittle]
of caring about her

694
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,670
without letting her know,

695
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,470
you should try to ignore her
once in a while.

696
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,470
Just about when she's
getting used to being with you,

697
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,360
you suddenly disappear.

698
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,360
Then she'll realize just
how much you matter to her.

699
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,360
Where did you learn this stuff?

700
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,120
I knew sooner or later

701
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,710
you would ask me these questions,

702
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,870
so I read many books

703
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,280
about relationships ahead of time.

704
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,470
Including pre-marriage,

705
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,630
post-marriage,

706
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,760
sweet love, bitter love,

707
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,670
you name it.

708
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,670
I didn't expect

709
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,230
you to be this thoughtful!

710
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,760
Send him a message.

711
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
See if he replies to you right away!

712
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,640
[Sheng Zhening   Are you asleep?]

713
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,360
Are you asleep?

714
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,870
Remember,

715
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,870
do not reply to her message too quickly.

716
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,870
Let her wait at least 30 minutes.

717
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,280
[Xia Qian  Not yet. You?]

718
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,840
Not yet. You?

719
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,120
Ask him to go out with you.

720
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,760
See if he's keen on it.

721
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,760
Would you like to go downstairs

722
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,670
and get a roasted yam with me?

723
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,950
Besides,

724
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,840
don't always follow her lead.

725
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,630
Let her know that you are busy.

726
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,760
I can't. I'm busy.

727
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,800
[Sheng Zhening  I can't. I'm busy.]

728
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,470
How was it?

729
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,320
Very aloof.

730
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,320
I think my friend thinks too much.

731
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,360
Don't jump to a conclusion.

732
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,040
Here's a more direct method.

733
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
More direct?

734
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,870
Well…

735
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,280
I'm sorry

736
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,360
I called you out so late.

737
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,760
It's alright.

738
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,430
Just for signing a contract.

739
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Was it necessary to drink?

740
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,190
I didn't want to drink either.

741
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,190
But I had to.

742
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,390
I feel dizzy!

743
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,150
Well…

744
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,080
Can I borrow your shoulder for a sec?

745
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,190
Sure.

746
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,910
Try to make close contact with him.

747
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,430
See how he responds.

748
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,840
Be firm!

749
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,560
Must be firm!

750
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,560
Do not surrender just because

751
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,800
of those small gestures!

752
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,800
Be cool!

753
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,040
What's wrong?

754
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,560
I sprained my ankle!

755
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,430
Can you walk?

756
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,230
No.

757
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,800
What do we do?

758
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,560
Can you carry me?

759
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,320
Carry me!

760
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,760
Let me help you up.

761
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,950
Here.

762
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,390
Take it slow.
