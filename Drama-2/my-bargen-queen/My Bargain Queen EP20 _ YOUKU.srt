Sorry.

00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,830
The number you dialed cannot be reached.

00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,400
Please redial later.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,110
Yes, it is.

12
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,390
Excuse me.

13
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,720
Are you Mr. Qin?

14
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
I called you but couldn't get through.

15
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,670
No mobile mast here, I guess.

16
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Well.

Hey. Don't be angry.

I come to tell you that

I've left Evergreen.

27

Let me explain. Okay?

28
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,440
We were friends.

29
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
For the sake of the rain,

I won't kick you out.

31

At this time,

it's hard for her
to persuade other shareholders

38

to sell their stock.

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,440
I guess, before opening,

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
she cannot make any big moves.

41
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,110
That's great.

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,190
Look at this.

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,390

44
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,520
similar to your father's.

45
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,910
One case has the same symptom as his.

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,750
And the patient regained his senses.

Take a look.

52
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,190
Who would play music for him?

53

I don't care about him.

54
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,880

how he is now.

63
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,760
He has no reaction to whatever I do.

64
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,760
When he regains his senses,

65
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,320
Who?

196
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,910
The guest in Room 102.

197
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,960
No.

198
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,030
He's paid me. How can I reject him?

199
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,880
Has he paid you?

200
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,960
I won't go.

201
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,760
Alright.

202
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,520
I'll go by myself.

203
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,440
It's been raining recently.

204
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
My back aches again.

205
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,280
My back!

206
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,350
Have fun.

207
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,470
Have a good time.

208
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,400
Rest assured.

209
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,710
I'm your daughter

210
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,080
and you sell me out?

211
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,960
Let me help you.

212
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,150
Leave me alone.

213
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,670
Fasten the seat belt.

214
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,710
Let's go!

215
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,520
Do you remember this song?

216
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,950
You taught me when I was a kid.

217
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,519
I knew you were heartless.

218
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,760
It's hot.

219
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,950
But he still cares about you.

220
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,590
Or he wouldn't have cried.

221
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,800
I hope so.

222
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,350
But he is still in dementia.

223
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,590
What's your plan next?

224
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,800
Next week, his favorite band

225
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,920
will hold a concert in China.

226
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,520
When I was a kid, he promised me

227
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,400
to take me to it.

228
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,880
It's a deal between us.

229
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,640
I'll take him for it next week

230
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,950
and see if it can help him

231
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,040
recall something.

232
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,310
Good idea.

233
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,070
Come and follow me, tourist.

234
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,760
This is

235
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,640
the first scenic spot

236
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,310
in Yangliuqing,

237
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,310
the Bliss Pavilion.

238
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Yangliuqing was on the only way

239
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,710
that the Emperor Qianlong went to the south.

240
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,920
And the name was given by Emperor Qianlong.

241
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,350
That's all.

242
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,070
Is that all?

243
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,190
But the file describes

244
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,110
many other things in the south and north.

245
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,230
How did you know that?

246
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,280
No.

247
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,110
Skip that.

248
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,280
No.

249
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,470
This is the Bliss Pavilion.

250
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,470
Prayers will be answered by God,

251
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,520
especially those

252
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,560
about marriage.

253
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,590
Look over there.

254
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,310
And there.

255
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,470
Alright.

256
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,710
Next scenic spot.

257
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,470
Wait.

258
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,950
I want to make a wish.

259
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,640
Excuse me.

260
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,950
Wait a moment.

261
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,190
I've said it is deceptive.

262
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,760
Sir.

263
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,800
Would you make a wish?

264
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,640
Madam.

265
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,590
Two wishing cards, please.

266
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,680
Okay. Here you are.

267
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,590
Okay. Thank you.

268
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,950
The pen.

269
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,470
Don't peek.

270
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,110
Are you writing a composition?

271
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,800
Don't peek.

272
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,880
Would you make a wish?

273
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,470
I wish you

274
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,760
to get out of my sight right now.

275
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,710
Can you do it?

276
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,760
Don't tell Xia Qian. Okay?

277
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,110
Please.

278
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,950
Shuangshuang, are you working?

279
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,280
Yes, Mr. Wang.

280
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,950
Make way.

281
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,710
Okay. You've visited this scene.

282
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,590
No. Wait.

283
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,590
It...

284
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,680
Is it so soon?

285
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,070
You...

286
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,160
Well.

287
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,560
Are you slacking off?

288
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,680
It takes one hour for this scenic spot.

289
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,800
You dawdled there for so long.

290
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,110
Am I slacking off?

291
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,190
No.

292
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,830
I'm just saying.

293
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,710
Don't be angry.

294
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,760
Where are we going next?

295
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,710
Eat.

296
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,590
Go.

297
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,560
What is this?

298
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,190
Hey.

299
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,350
Is this the food?

300
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,000
What else do you want?

301
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,190
Two dishes and one soup, or something.

302
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,920
Look there.

303
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,920
So many restaurants.

304
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,190
And barbecue.

305
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,310
Milk tea. And...

306
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,470
Don't eat then.

307
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Yes. Yes. I'll eat.

308
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
Don't you eat?

309
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,710
Not hungry.

310
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,350
Time to work.

311
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,310
Next...

312
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,590
No need.

313
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
Since we are tired,

314
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,950
let's go back and rest.

315
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,350
Who is tired?

316
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,430
Are you tired?

317
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,520
No.

318
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,000
You said you didn't have much fun.

319
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,350
Now you are tired.

320
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,880
You are so hard to please.

321
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,920
I'm getting on in years,

322
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,760
and tend to get sleepy.

323
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,590
I even dozed off when eating noodles.

324
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,800
Let's go back.

325
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,680
Go.

326
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,110
My mom didn't allow him

327
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,950
to practice guitar at home.

328
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,350
So he took me to practice

329
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,430
in this park.

330
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,350
I wonder if he remembers it.

331
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,190
He does.

332
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,590
Are you so sure?

333
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,640
You are his daughter.

334
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,710
Since you remember it,

335
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,880
he remembers, too.

336
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,000
Has he bribed you?

337
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,800
Why are you speaking up for him?

338
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,470
Candyfloss.

339
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,920
He used to buy that for me.

340
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,800
How about we try some?

341
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,760
Sure.

342
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,920
I won't eat.

343
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,520
I didn't ask you.

344
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,000
Wait here.

345
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,520
I want to eat.

346
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,350
Buy one more.

347
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,070
Perhaps your dad wants some.

348
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,950
Got it.

349
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,070
You can't always pretend like this.

350
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,830
Sir, I want one.

351
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,950
- Now she
- Two, please.

352
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,800
- doesn't hate me that much.
- Okay.

353
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,710
Should I find an opportunity

354
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,590
and get my senses back?

355
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,230
She'll take you to a concert in two days.

356
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,310
At the end of it, pretend that

357
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,920
your memories are back.

358
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,160
Okay.

359
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:17,950
These two.

360
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,920
Which one would you like?

361
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,640
This is cute.

362
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,350
Remember.

363
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,230
Behave naturally

364
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,000
when you regain your senses.

365
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,590
Well.

366
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,190
Should I practice?

367
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,560
Yes.

368
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,280
How about this?

369
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,520
I will be at a loss at first,

370
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,920
and then surprised to see Xia Qian,

371
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,950
and then happy,

372
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,710
then guilty,

373
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,470
then happy again,

374
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,560
then guilty.

375
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,350
The mix of happy

376
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
and guilty feelings.

377
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,350
What do you think?

378
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,040
It's

379
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,190
a little bit unnatural.

380
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,830
Unnatural?

381
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,830
I'll practice more.

382
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,280
In a loss.

383
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,350
Surprised. Happy.

384
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:15,950
Guilty.

385
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,590
At a loss.

386
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,430
Surprised.

387
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,800
Ma'am.

388
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,560
I want tour guide service today.

389
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,950
Can I have it?

390
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,070
Sorry.

391
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,710
My daughter

392
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,520
went to work for other guests.

393
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,760
For other guests?

394
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,560
[Biandang, make life light and easy]

395
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,950
You'll get thirsty at the concert.

396
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,470
I'm gonna buy some water.

397
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,520
Stay here alone. Okay?

398
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,280
Just a moment.

399
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,880
Wait.

400
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,110
Can you ride?

401
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:42,880
Dad.

402
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,160
Are you alright?

403
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,680
I'm fine.

404
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,070
Did you get hurt?

405
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,760
Have you recovered?

406
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,680
I... I...

407
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,070
Well.

408
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,310
The motorcycle nearly hit you.

409
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,520
I...

410
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,590
I stood up right away.

411
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,430
Okay.

412
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,040
It's good that you get recovered.

413
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,350
How could you get recovered suddenly?

414
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,470
I guess

415
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,920
it's the love of a father.

416
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,350
It was unbelievable.

417
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Just now I...

418
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,000
Were you trying to save me?

419
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,110
Yes.

420
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,560
Let me put it on you.

421
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,760
Where is the wound on your head?

422
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,920
Wh... What?

423
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,230
You just had an operation on your head.

424
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,760
Where is the wound?

425
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,070
Perhaps I'm resilient

426
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,160
and it has healed.

427
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,350
It...

428
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,640
Well...

429
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,760
You are pretending!

430
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,350
Sorry.

431
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,350
Hey, why are you doing this?

432
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,430
Why pretending?

433
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,280
Sorry. You...

434
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,760
Sorry. Yueyue.

435
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,000
I...

436
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,800
Ouch! Ouch!

437
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,560
Ouch! Ouch!

438
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:04,800
Ouch!

439
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,110
Gosh.

440
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,640
It's fine.

441
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,760
But...

442
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,760
Wait. Wait.

443
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,110
The tourists walked so much.

444
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,710
I've got blisters on my feet.

445
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,190
Can you not go tomorrow?

446
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,110
No. I've promised them.

447
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,160
I have to.

448
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,040
What...

449
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,110
Mom.

450
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,880
I'm hungry.

451
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,190
I'm going for some food.

452
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,880
Don't move.

453
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,710
Don't move. I'll go.

454
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,400
No, I'll do it myself.

455
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,160
Slowly. Slowly.

456
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,520
Look at you.

457
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,000
Slowly. Come on.

458
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,400
Do you want me to tell her?

459
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,830
No.

460
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,160
I've been lying to her.

461
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,110
Being with her these days,

462
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm contented.

463
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,640
Now you are with her.

464
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,040
I'm reassured.

465
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
You still can't forgive him.

466
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,160
Why should I?

467
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,470
He's a liar.

468
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,110
Actually,

469
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,950
I knew he was pretending.

470
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,950
Did you know it?

471
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,560
Why did you lie together with him?

472
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,040
I meant to tell you.

473
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,470
But...

474
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,830
Don't tell Xia Qian. Okay?

475
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,190
Please.

476
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,310
Take a look.

477
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,160
What is it?

478
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,710
Actually,

479
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,560
he's been around you.

480
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,190
It's just that his music career

481
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,640
didn't go well.

482
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,070
He felt ashamed to see you.

483
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,230
The fact is,

484
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,640
he wasn't absent.

485
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
He just chose to

486
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,190
watch you in the dark.

487
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,190
This one.

488
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,160
Freeze! Stop there!

489
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,430
- Stop there!
- Stop there!

490
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,470
Where are you going?

491
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,800
Where are you going?

492
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,160
Why are you bullying me?

493
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,160
Go away!

494
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,350
I won't.

495
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,760
Yes, I'm bullying you.

496
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,350
Go away!

497
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,070
Where's your dad?

498
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,710
Did he abandon you?

499
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,680
Flying.

500
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,430
Beat you.

501
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,280
Beat. Beat. Beat.

502
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,880
Stop there.

503
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,560
You two,

504
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,280
don't bully that girl ever again.

505
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,520
Otherwise...

506
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,519
- Dad!
- Dad!

507
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,190
- A man is bullying me!
- A man is bullying me!

508
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,279
Please!

509
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,870
I'm begging you.

510
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,840
Let go.

511
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,470
Tell your son

512
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,280
to stay away from my daughter.

513
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,000
Are you nuts?

514
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,150
Please! Please!

515
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Please!

516
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,950
You two, stay away from his daughter.

517
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,800
Don't make trouble for me.

518
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,560
Got it?

519
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,630
Thank you! Thank you!

520
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,320
Thank you! Thank you!

521
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,520
He begged that man,

522
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,710
and finally got the bad boys

523
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,520
away from you.

524
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,040
That was quite like his style.

525
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,760
And?

526
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,600
What?

527
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,950
Hello.

528
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
I'm at the Evergreen Hotel.

529
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,360
Okay. I'm on my way to pick you up.

530
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,360
Hello.

531
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,630
Hello.

532
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,760
Hello.

533
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,670
Hello.

534
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,630
Xia.

535
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,630
Hello.

536
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,520
Let's go.

537
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,360
Talk to him

538
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,150
face to face.

539
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:28,910
Go.

540
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,390
Look.

541
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,000
You are badly hurt.

542
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,150
Why don't you have one day off tomorrow?

543
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,360
None of your business.

544
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,360
How about this?

545
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,280
I'll pay you one week's tour guide fee.

546
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,040
Be my tour guide

547
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,080
and you'll get money.

548
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,230
You'll be paid anyway.

549
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,910
Right?

550
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,080
I'd rather be paid by others.

551
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,000
I have the right to choose customers.

552
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,760
What are you doing?

553
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,910
Nothing.

554
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,390
You are in my way.

555
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,390
I'm going to my room.

556
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,230
Me too.

557
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,360
He isn't at home.

558
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,800
Your surgery cannot be delayed any longer.

559
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,760
If you faint again,

560
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,120
you may never wake up.

561
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,360
I'll have the surgery.

562
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,710
Arrange it.

563
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,040
Dad.

564
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,390
Xia Qian.

565
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,150
Where is he?

566
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,470
He doesn't have to hide from me.

567
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,230
I forgive him.

568
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,630
Where is he now?

569
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,470
I'm asking you. Where is he?

570
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,470
He doesn't allow me to tell you.

571
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,190
What happened to him?

572
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,120
The tumor in his head is true.

573
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,840
And the surgery is very risky.

574
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,670
He might never wake up

575
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,910
even on the operating table.

576
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,390
That's why he lied to you

577
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,840
so that he could be with you a while longer.

578
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,470
Yueyue.

579
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm leaving.

580
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,760
You should grow up happily.
