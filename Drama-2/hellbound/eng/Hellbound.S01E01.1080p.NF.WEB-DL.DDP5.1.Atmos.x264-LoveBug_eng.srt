1
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,562
THAT DAY…

2
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,239
WAS JUST ANOTHER ORDINARY DAY

3
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,497
-Can I have it as a set menu?
-It's not available…

4
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,459
We have your drinks ready, ma'am.

5
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,754
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

6
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,216
Hey, wait for me.
Don't watch it without me.

7
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,886
Thank you.

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,928
<i>Firstly…</i>

9
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,182
<i>an angel appears and prophecizes.</i>

10
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,935
<i>The angel says</i>
<i>the name of the recipient first.</i>

11
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,774
<i>They are then told when they will die</i>
<i>and that they are bound for Hell.</i>

12
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,485
<i>When the time comes,</i>

13
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:13,865
<i>the executors come from Hell</i>
<i>to fulfill the prophecy.</i>

14
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>If you're watching this</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

15
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,621
<i>you may find it shocking.</i>

16
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,414
He looks completely normal.

17
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,917
But why is he talking nonsense?

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,253
Does anyone even believe this bullshit?

19
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,256
Lots of people believe this.

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,051
Loads of videos
on his YouTube channel back it up.

21
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,680
Come on. Con men like him can only exploit
people because idiots like you exist.

22
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,850
Don't take this seriously, all right?

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,522
Hey, don't tell me
you're already indoctrinated.

24
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,523
What?

25
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,733
Let's watch it again, then.

26
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,193
This is all CGI.

27
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,694
It's not.

28
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,160
NOVEMBER 10, THURSDAY

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,761
NOVEMBER 10, THURSDAY

30
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,159
What's that?

31
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,037
What's going on?

32
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,155
Move!

33
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,075
Damn it! Move out of my way!

34
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,076
What the--

35
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,562
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

36
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,199
-You punk!
-Stop, you bastard!

37
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,867
-What the hell?
-Don't move!

38
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,785
Damn.

39
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,996
-You startled me. Take him away.
-It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

40
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,289
Don't be too harsh.

41
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,543
Damn, that startled me.

42
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,090
We will now begin the case briefing

43
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,343
on the Hapseong Station murder case.

44
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,430
It occurred on November 10th, 2022.

45
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,141
at a coffee shop near Hapseong Station.

46
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,603
Some strange creatures appeared
out of nowhere and murdered the victim…

47
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,064
The body ran…

48
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,816
I mean, they burnt the body and ran.

49
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,735
We are currently working on
tracking down the suspects.

50
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,865
We have yet to find any evidence
at the scene.

51
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,244
We still need to wait
for the full autopsy report,

52
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,372
but it is clear that the body
was burnt to a crisp

53
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,999
at a very high temperature.

54
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,459
When did it start?

55
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,379
-Just now.
-Here are the preliminary autopsy results.

56
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,966
We do not have the full results yet,

57
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,305
but the body seems to have been burnt at
a very high temperature in a short time.

58
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,515
TRENDING: HELL, GOD, DEATH,
THE NEW TRUTH, ANGEL

59
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,851
It's blowing up the Internet.

60
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,645
The chief must be anxious as hell.

61
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,814
…were able to identify him.

62
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,692
Joo Myeonghun, age 36.

63
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:08,237
He lived alone in an apartment
15 minutes away from the coffee shop.

64
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,616
He divorced two years ago
and his ex-wife was his only family.

65
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,035
He had no kids.

66
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,078
It happened in broad daylight,

67
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,081
so we've got tons of witnesses
and video evidence.

68
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,875
Here's one of the clips.

69
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,214
What is that?

70
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:33,721
We can clearly see a strange creature
murdering the victim in this clip…

71
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,639
What is that?

72
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,934
…but we couldn't find
any physical evidence at the scene.

73
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,523
"Jung Jinsu." "The New Truth"?
What are these?

74
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,983
Kyunghun! Stop looking at your phone!

75
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,401
He's going to cover it all!

76
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,278
The New Truth.

77
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,241
It was formed in 2012,
and it's recently become--

78
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,283
That's enough.

79
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,663
Everyone, listen.

80
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,917
The media, the press, and the Internet…
They are all going wild over this case.

81
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,919
You all need to do your job properly!

82
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,422
Kids are already spreading
strange rumors about this case.

83
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,883
But is it even human?

84
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,884
Just bring it in!

85
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,887
We'll find out what it is
once we have it in custody.

86
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,640
Unit One, do some legwork
and find more about the victim.

87
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,809
-Yes, sir.
-Unit Two, go check the scene.

88
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,103
Question those who were
at the coffee shop.

89
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,690
Make sure you don't give reporters
any info. They'll only spread rumors.

90
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,317
-And Kyunghun.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,737
Team up with Eunpyo
and find more about the New Truth.

92
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,864
They are having a gathering
near the scene.

93
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,118
It looks like those fanatics
are related to this case somehow.

94
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,453
-You two, go check on them.
-Yes, sir.

95
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,330
-Do not incite them.
-Okay.

96
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,583
It's best not to mess
with religious groups.

97
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,543
-Everyone, get to work!
-Yes, sir.

98
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,714
Kyunghun.

99
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,549
-Yes, sir.
-Come here.

100
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,017
Feel free to let me know if you need
some time away from the field.

101
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,771
I'm a detective. What else would I do?

102
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,689
That's not…

103
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,359
At least be on time, then.

104
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,711
"The New Truth."

105
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,090
"An organization for religious studies
formed by Chairman Jung Jinsu in 2012."

106
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,177
The group hasn't been around long.

107
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,554
Just a little over ten years.

108
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,598
What are you reading?

109
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,601
Oh, this? It's an online encyclopedia.

110
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,810
You punk.

111
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,481
"They have never disclosed
the exact number of members,

112
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,401
but it is assumed that its radical members
formed the Arrowhead."

113
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,278
What? The Arrowhead?

114
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,698
You mean those psychos
who leak ex-cons' identities online?

115
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,200
Are they part of the New Truth?

116
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:03,829
From what I know,
the Arrowhead isn't just active online.

117
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,416
I've heard of them
being involved in petty crimes.

118
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,210
It says here

119
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:14,757
that an angel-like figure appears
and tells you when you will go to Hell.

120
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,597
"Hell" and "angel"? Are they saying
this is divine retribution?

121
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,059
Yes. "An angel prophecizes
an individual's time of death,

122
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,145
and when that time comes,
executors come up from Hell,

123
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,190
demonstrate the pain of Hell
and disappear."

124
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,610
They say it's some kind
of warning to the people.

125
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,072
So are they saying
what we saw earlier is God's work?

126
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,657
Their doctrine is full of holes,

127
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,493
but people are attracted
by the video evidence they present.

128
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,621
Kids learn everything
from videos these days.

129
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,167
Whether it's God's work or not,
I hope it's true.

130
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,086
Why do you say that?

131
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,337
Think about it.

132
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,925
Whenever we bring in all those
evil bastards who deserve death,

133
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,429
the court lets them off
based on something trivial.

134
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,934
Sorry.

135
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,103
Our job is to catch them.

136
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,814
Whether their victim is good or bad,

137
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,109
whether they killed
to save the world or for fun…

138
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,946
No matter what their reason is,
we're supposed to catch murderers.

139
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,698
That's all we need to think about.

140
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,037
<i>Send backup to sector two and three.</i>

141
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,960
Open the gate.

142
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,601
<i>Patrol team moving to sector four.</i>

143
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,195
<i>Code two-one moving to sector three.</i>

144
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,326
<i>Patrol team report position. Patrol team…</i>

145
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,953
I didn't expect to see you at the scene.

146
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,747
-Hey, Kyunghun.
-Hello.

147
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,042
The damn team leader is on vacation.

148
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,837
And since all eyes are on this case,

149
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,714
I had to be here.

150
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,593
Did you find anything?

151
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,011
Nothing.

152
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,723
The witness testified
that the creature excreted bodily fluids,

153
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,266
but there's no trace.

154
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,185
There aren't any footprints either.

155
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,145
All we got were bloodstains.

156
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,939
Look over there.

157
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,691
They all belong to the victim.

158
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,360
Oh dear.

159
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,031
I heard the New Truth
is having a gathering here.

160
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:44,990
Over there.

161
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,743
Maybe that's them.

162
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,247
They've been blabbering
into a microphone for a while.

163
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,915
-See you, then.
-All right.

164
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,958
See you later, sir.

165
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,629
<i>That sin signifies God's message.</i>

166
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,507
We need to listen
to God's voice, starting now.

167
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,554
This person, who lived
in a village in South East Asia,

168
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,932
had received a prophecy from an angel

169
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,810
that he would go to Hell in five hours.

170
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,727
Then…

171
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,312
WHAT IS "GOD'S WILL"?

172
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,198
This was filmed exactly five hours
after he received the prophecy.

173
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,292
A few days later,

174
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,336
three bodies were found buried
at the man's house.

175
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,924
They were missing persons
from unsolved cases.

176
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,388
This was taken seven years ago in Japan.

177
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,018
This person had multiple counts
of fraud and assault.

178
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,064
This was from Nicaragua six years ago.
Child exploitation and murder.

179
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,942
At a glance, they look similar,

180
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,904
and were all killed in the same way,
as you saw in the video.

181
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,656
And they were all criminals.

182
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,201
Manufacturing narcotics.

183
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,454
Robbery and theft.

184
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,289
Fraud.

185
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,291
Rape, arson…

186
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,503
Why do people sin?

187
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,007
People who say they value humanity,

188
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,843
above everything else,

189
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,970
make excuses like this.

190
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,557
Because they had a tough childhood,

191
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,310
because of structural inequality,

192
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,354
because they have a mental disorder,

193
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,690
because they were under the influence
of drugs and alcohol.

194
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,319
The concept of sin exists

195
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,490
because humans choose to sin.

196
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,159
As a result of denying that fact,

197
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,745
we humans have forgotten
about shame, remorse,

198
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,623
repentance, and redemption.

199
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,753
God has found a way
to directly present to you

200
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,966
what Hell is like.

201
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,344
Why would God do this?

202
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,518
He's telling us to be more righteous.

203
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,568
Chairman Jung, you did great today.

204
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,862
-Thank you. Safe trip back home.
-Thank you.

205
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,614
Chairman Jung Jinsu?

206
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,246
-Oh, I guess you are newcomers.
-We're from the police.

207
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
Hello.

208
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,043
Hello.

209
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,338
What brings you here, Detectives?

210
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,216
We're investigating the murder
that occurred over there today.

211
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,760
-Murder case?
-Yes.

212
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,808
I guess you're talking about
the demonstration.

213
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,982
It's funny how you investigate
God's deeds.

214
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,484
I understand.

215
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,863
In your eyes, it's still a murder.

216
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,657
Heejung, I got this. Give it to me.

217
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,409
-Take a break.
-Thank you.

218
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,120
Someone has died so we must investigate.

219
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,455
So how may I help you?

220
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,248
Well…

221
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,917
-Heejung! Hey!
-Kyunghun.

222
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,961
What are you doing here?

223
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,756
Let go, Dad! Let go of me!

224
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,342
Aren't you supposed to be at the academy?
What are you doing here?

225
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,385
Hi, Heejung.

226
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,387
It's been a while.

227
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,264
You're so tall now.

228
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,515
Hello.

229
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
I'm on my way there now. Don't worry.

230
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,812
Go straight home after class, all right?

231
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,230
Okay, I got it.

232
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,859
Chairman Jung, I'll get going.

233
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,487
Okay. Bye, Heejung.

234
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,239
Thank you for today.

235
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,866
What do you think you're doing?

236
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,996
Heejung once told me
that her father is in the police.

237
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,290
What a coincidence.

238
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,834
Does your organization
take advantage of minors?

239
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,960
Of course not.

240
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,880
I got to know her through volunteer work.

241
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,342
Since you don't find it appropriate,

242
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,470
I'll tell her to refrain
from volunteering from now on.

243
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,140
Well, anyway,

244
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,310
we'd like to ask you
a few questions regarding the case.

245
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,188
I'm sorry,
but I have an interview scheduled.

246
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,149
-Do you mind if I answer them on the way?
-Not at all.

247
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,234
Shall we?

248
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,153
Let's follow him for now.

249
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,580
<i>Thank you for waiting.</i>
<i>The train will be departing shortly.</i>

250
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,626
Is this how you usually commute,
Chairman Jung?

251
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,837
You do not need to address me as Chairman.

252
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,132
You can just call me by my name.

253
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,885
The members helped me get a car,

254
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,139
but I prefer to use public transit.

255
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,933
I guess

256
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,980
you expected me to be
some kind of cult leader.

257
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,816
I'm not like that at all.

258
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

259
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,784
How can humans ever
fully understand God's work?

260
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,787
Have you always been a believer?

261
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,914
Not really.

262
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,168
I grew up in a Catholic orphanage.

263
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,253
Religion's always been part of my life.

264
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,384
Chairman Jung!

265
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,094
Please take my seat.

266
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,555
No, it's okay. There's no need.

267
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,266
Please, you should take this seat.

268
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,350
No, thank you.

269
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,936
Hey, that's Jung Jinsu.

270
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,149
-Where? You're right, it is him.
-He's so cool.

271
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,112
As I matured with age,

272
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,240
I had always wanted to die.

273
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,326
To tell you the truth,

274
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,537
I had no interest in life.

275
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,376
I was looking forward to turning 20,
wondering how to end my life.

276
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,587
Why 20, specifically?

277
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,174
Once you turn 20,
you get to leave the orphanage

278
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,009
with some financial support.

279
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,804
I was determined to end my life,

280
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,975
but I didn't want people to see me dead.

281
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,688
So I traveled to a plain in Tibet.

282
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:49,873
<i>There, vultures take care of dead bodies.</i>

283
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,884
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>I found meaning in life.</i>

284
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,183
Ever since, I traveled all over,
looking for traces of God.

285
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,352
After traveling for ten years,

286
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,355
I got to understand
God's will a little.

287
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,616
And I realized what I was meant to do.

288
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,619
Some people are saying that the New Truth

289
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,415
is closely associated with the Arrowhead.

290
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,878
I feel regretful about that claim.

291
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,715
There are some people

292
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,635
who misinterpret our doctrine
and have radical ideas.

293
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,807
Letting the world know of God's wish
for us to live more righteously.

294
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,685
That's our only goal.

295
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,776
What's so funny?

296
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,945
Living by performing good deeds
in fear of damnation…

297
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,282
Can we call that just?

298
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,577
Aside from fear,
what else makes people repent?

299
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,455
Are you aware of anything else?

300
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,749
According to you,

301
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,796
this God must not believe
in humankind's free will.

302
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,884
That's an interesting point,
Detective Jin.

303
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,471
Free will…

304
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,389
Right.

305
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,769
I heard from Heejung

306
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,400
that your wife was murdered.

307
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,197
I can't begin to imagine
the pain you went through.

308
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,118
What is the murderer doing now?

309
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,874
Hasn't he been released back into society?

310
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,631
Do you think that man-made laws
help justice be served?

311
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,512
Do you think the murderer
feels any remorse?

312
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,056
Chairman Jung?

313
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,644
Hi, I'm here for your interview.

314
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,603
Hello.

315
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,486
That's my number.

316
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,198
Please feel free to contact me
if you have any additional questions.

317
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,366
Bye, then.

318
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,622
-This way, please.
-Okay.

319
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,417
Does he really live in <i>there?</i>

320
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,086
He really is something.

321
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,677
Did you expect a cult leader
to be ordinary?

322
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,421
Heejung.

323
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,489
Don't wash it.
I'm going to wear it tomorrow.

324
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,912
We need to talk.

325
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,332
I'm not a fanatic or anything.

326
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,668
I attended a few of his lectures
out of curiosity.

327
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,044
Don't worry.

328
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,463
I haven't missed any school.

329
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,926
Are we done?

330
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,196
CHAIRMAN JUNG OF THE NEW TRUTH

{\an8}CHAIRMAN JUNG JINSU OF THE NEW TRUTH

336
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,936
<i>I heard from Heejung</i>

337
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:51,026
<i>that your wife was murdered.</i>

338
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,573
<i>I can't begin to imagine</i>

<i>Patrol cars, please set up a perimeter.</i>

342
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,402
Wait.

343
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,862
-Let go of me!
-Wait.

344
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,035
Let go of me, you bastards!

345
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,245
-Get him.
-Get him!

346
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,247
Let go, you jerk!

347
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,374
Stop, Kyunghun.

348
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,833
I told you not to come.

349
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,918
Let go!

350
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,003
Kyunghun, are you out of your mind?

351
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,338
Let go!

352
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,507
I'm her husband!

353
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,967
Let me see her.

354
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,928
Just let me see her!

355
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,972
Let go! Let go of me!

356
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,900
Honey.

357
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:19,989
Kyunghun.

358
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,752
CULPRIT OF THE REGENERATION AREA
MURDER CASE ARRESTED

359
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,881
CULPRIT SUBJECTED TO DRUG TESTING

360
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,344
LIGHT SENTENCE OF 10 YEARS SHOCKS PUBLIC

361
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,639
-Why did you kill her?
-What was your motive?

362
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,228
-When will he be imprisoned?
-Will the evidence be released?

363
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,938
That's enough!

364
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,941
-Please give us a comment.
-What was your motive?

365
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,990
Go.

366
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,700
Kyunghun, please.

367
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,827
You should leave.

368
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,997
You can't be here.

369
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,206
Let go of me.

370
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,417
Please, Kyunghun!

371
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,460
Let go.

372
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,545
Pull yourself together!

373
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,756
Think about Heejung.

374
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,550
You need to keep going.

375
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,013
Think about your daughter! Kyunghun…

376
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,729
How do you feel right now?

377
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,983
-Do you feel any remorse?
-You have to get through this.

378
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,651
Kyunghun…

379
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,575
POSITIVE DRUG TEST RESULT LED TO
MITIGATED PUNISHMENT FOR THE MURDERER

380
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,498
CULPRIT OF THE REGENERATION AREA
MURDER CASE

381
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,458
RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER 6 YEARS

382
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,113
I'm going home.

383
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,783
How come you're going home early?

384
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,536
It's been a slow day.
I'll see you tomorrow.

385
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,207
I should close early and go home too.

386
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:57,981
Hurry up.

387
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,024
Oh my, Eunyul.

388
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,735
Why are you still up?

389
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,280
Surprise!

390
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,824
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

391
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:11,494
-Hayul, you're still up too?
-<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

392
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,123
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mom</i>

393
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,626
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

394
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,879
Blow them out.

395
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,426
Thank you, Hayul.

396
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,220
Thank you.

397
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,848
Thank you, Eunyul.

398
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,728
Mom.

399
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,568
Park Jungja.

400
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:49,324
You will die five days from now

401
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,367
at 3:00 p.m.

402
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,495
And…

403
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,876
you are bound for Hell.

404
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,212
Finally!

405
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:09,761
God has demonstrated His damnation
here in Seoul, South Korea!

406
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,430
Humans have refused
to understand God's will

407
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,433
no matter how relentless He has been
in His pursuit of us.

408
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,310
Like spoon-feeding.

409
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,188
In Seoul, a city of ten million people.

410
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,691
In broad daylight!

411
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,444
But look how people are reacting.

412
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,072
"Cult"? "Terrorism"? "Special effects"?

413
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,574
You hopeless shits!

414
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,994
What else do they need
to see to believe it?

415
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:35,954
Huh?!

416
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,960
They launched an investigation.

417
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:42,919
Isn't that crazy?

418
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,297
{\an8}Do they investigate a judge
when they sentence someone to death?

419
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:52,178
{\an8}Are they going to go up to God and say,
"You are under arrest for murder"?

420
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,763
Listen to me.

421
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:57,016
What do you think the police
should be doing right now?

422
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,184
{\an8}Joo Myeonghun!

423
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,145
{\an8}They need to find out what his sins are!

424
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,358
They need to show people
that not a single person in this world

425
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,820
can ever avoid God's judgment!

426
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,989
By the way,

427
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:17,078
why do you think God demonstrated
damnation here in Seoul?

428
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,539
It's because we are here.

429
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,250
We,

430
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,960
the Arrowhead!

431
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,129
The Arrowhead!

432
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,674
When God releases an arrow,
we, the Arrowhead, should fly

433
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,384
and hit the target.

434
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,635
And what's our target?

435
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,182
I hate this shit! Disgusting!

436
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,478
Let's listen to this novelist
named Kim Gwangjin talking bullshit.

437
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,730
You bastard!

438
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,025
{\an8}<i>As the public's trust</i>
<i>in the government declines,</i>

439
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,319
{\an8}<i>people are drawn to personal revenge.</i>

440
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,948
{\an8}<i>Some people are trying</i>
<i>to find meaning in these events</i>

441
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,950
{\an8}<i>and say justice is being served.</i>

442
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,119
{\an8}<i>And many people are buying into it.</i>

443
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:04,125
{\an8}<i>This reminds me of the terrible violence</i>
<i>that happened in medieval theocracy.</i>

444
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,170
{\an8}<i>Once you let others control your thoughts…</i>

445
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,549
"Thoughts"? Did I just hear him right?

446
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,093
You shouldn't think
for yourself, you dipshit.

447
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,137
What gives you the right
to have an opinion?

448
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,890
God has kindly shown us His will!

449
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:24,854
I assure you that you
are bound for Hell soon!

450
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,105
Remember, everyone.

451
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:31,110
What God truly wants from us
is not to wait until His punishment.

452
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,488
Once God lets us know where we should go,

453
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,156
we must head in that direction.

454
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,160
That's the free will
that God has granted us.

455
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,161
That's why

456
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,830
the Arrowhead exists.

457
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:48,002
Now, it's time for me to show you
our accomplishments.

458
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,879
I'm so excited!

459
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,757
Beat him up!

460
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,511
Please don't kill me.

461
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,430
Please don't kill me. I have a family.

462
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,932
Shut the fuck up!

463
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,477
Hey, why did you do that?

464
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,272
Did you think blabbering like that
would make you look smart or something?

465
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,857
-I'm sorry.
-You like that?

466
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,275
You fucker!

467
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,111
Ask for forgiveness!

468
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,655
I'm sorry.

469
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:21,869
I denied God… I mean, I denied God's will.

470
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,289
-I thought of pursuing worldly values.
-Boring.

471
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,625
-I valued them above all--
-I can't hear you.

472
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,337
Come to your senses!

473
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,631
Look at him trying to look cool.

474
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,841
Beat him!

475
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,261
I'm gonna beat him up.

476
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,806
METHOD_44: THAT LOOKS LIKE KIM GWANGJIN
ARROWFIRE: ARROWHEAD SWAG

477
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,058
Who cares about your opinion?

478
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,062
Admit that you just wanted to look cool
and ask for God's forgiveness!

479
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,356
-That's right.
-I'm so sorry.

480
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,943
-I just wanted to sound smart.
-We can't hear you.

481
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,069
I'm so sorry.

482
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,739
I should've known my place
and kept my mouth shut.

483
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,159
Please don't kill me.

484
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,079
I'm so sorry.

485
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,207
Great job!

486
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,169
Well, he didn't even thank us

487
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,296
for putting him back on the right path,

488
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,007
but we have more important things to do.

489
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,925
We'll let this one go.

490
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:22,180
The more important matter
we should care about is

491
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,598
{\an8}Joo Myeonghun!

492
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,976
{\an8}We should find out all the evil deeds
this sinner has done,

493
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,478
and let the world know what God's will is.

494
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,608
That is it for today's broadcast!

495
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,696
The Arrowhead!

496
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,123
Hi, Detective Jin. Good morning.

497
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,626
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

498
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,087
About Joo Myeonghun, the victim
of the Hapseong Station murder case…

499
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,923
I don't know anything.

500
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,967
Don't be like that, Detective Jin.
Does he have any priors?

501
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,136
I don't know. That's all I can tell you.

502
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,931
Why do you want to know
about a dead man's criminal record?

503
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,100
Everyone on the Internet is trying
to find out why he was damned.

504
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,312
Shouldn't the press correct the fake news?

505
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,564
This is why people
never respect reporters.

506
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,359
As if they respect the police.

507
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,528
Anyway, let me know
if you find anything, all right?

508
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,696
Call me!

509
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,323
Joo Myeonghun?

510
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,492
Listen.

511
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,787
How can we investigate
when there's nothing to convict?

512
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,208
I get what you mean,
but that's not how filing a claim works.

513
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,294
What do you mean
we should investigate the victim?

514
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,673
If there's anything we should investigate,

515
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,967
you should file a police report.

516
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,134
Hello?

517
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,305
What's going on?
What are these calls about?

518
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,683
That skull mask guy
must have a lot of sources.

519
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,851
He even exposed
the identity of the victim.

520
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,103
What about those kids?

521
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,022
We arrested some of them
but they're refusing to testify.

522
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,524
Was that a live broadcast?

523
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,985
Those reckless little punks.

524
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,737
I don't know if those teenagers
are fearless or stupid.

525
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,865
What about the novelist? How is he?

526
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,035
Over there. He's here
with his lawyer for the statement.

527
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,954
I guess he doesn't need hospitalization.

528
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,628
All right. Talk to those kids with Wonpil.

529
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,463
I'll talk to the victim.

530
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,049
We should've brought in
the skull mask guy.

531
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,968
-I'll see you later.
-All right.

532
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:27,930
Hello.

533
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,517
I'm Assistant Inspector Jin Kyunghun.

534
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,936
I'm Min Hyejin of Sodo Law Firm.

535
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,815
It's not that high.

536
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,358
I'm so freaking hungry.

537
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,986
Hey, I think we can just jump off.

538
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,612
Get down, dumbass.

539
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,905
Crazy bastard.

540
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,825
Hey, it's the pigs.

541
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,076
You punks,

542
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,203
did you forget why you're here?

543
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,998
These little shits…

544
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,125
-Wonpil, they're just kids.
-So damn cool.

545
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,962
Behave and don't get on our nerves.

546
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,883
Are they playing
good cop, bad cop with us?

547
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,676
Shut up, you shithead.

548
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,803
-Don't fucking talk to me.
-Why so serious?

549
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,971
Seriously.

550
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,015
I had a lecture,

551
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,061
so I was on my way
to the underground parking lot.

552
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,813
They attacked me out of nowhere.

553
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,859
I think I passed out
after being hit in the head.

554
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,029
When I woke, I was tied up.

555
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,323
Well, do you remember how many there were?

556
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,575
I think

557
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,244
there were more than ten of them.

558
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,624
By the way, did you arrest them all?

559
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,668
Well, almost.

560
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,171
I'm afraid most of them

561
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,507
are minors.

562
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,011
Okay, listen.

563
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,265
You may think you aren't subject
to prosecution because you're minors,

564
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,310
but you're old enough to be penalized
under juvenile criminal law.

565
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,521
What? What are we supposed to do?

566
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,733
If you want to mitigate your punishment,

567
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,112
you'd better give me the names
of all those who were involved.

568
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,738
Hello, juvenile court!

569
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,157
Hey,

570
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,701
Mr. Po-po is being serious. Look at him.

571
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,120
Mister,

572
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:18,541
do you think the world will be the same
by the time we go to court?

573
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,085
Can't you see that the world is changing?

574
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,838
Don't you know you go to Hell
if you do something bad?

575
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,298
You guys have done something really bad!

576
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,344
Mister,

577
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,140
do you think you know
more about sin than us?

578
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:39,353
Have you ever read about God's will
stated in the New Truth doctrine?

579
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,233
<i>I hope you don't think</i>

580
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,820
this is just another crime
committed by reckless teenagers.

581
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,364
This is just the beginning.

582
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:56,495
As a person who has been following
the crimes committed by the Arrowhead,

583
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,666
I assure you that those religious fanatics
can do much worse for their cause.

584
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,711
We really don't have any idea

585
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,754
how we should deal with what's to come.

586
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,923
We also think

587
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,719
this case is different from other crimes
committed by the Arrowhead.

588
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,640
Please contact me

589
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,393
if you find anything strange

590
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,981
or if anything new surfaces
about the New Truth or the Arrowhead.

591
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,483
Sure.

592
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,943
Wait, Detective Jin.

593
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,238
So, those strange creatures…

594
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,450
Did you find out what they are?

595
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,872
Are they really sent by God?

596
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,553
Those punks aren't budging.

597
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,224
They must believe
that the world has come to an end.

598
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,976
Actually, what was the word they used?

599
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,645
Was it "complete"?

600
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,940
Oh, they said it’s becoming whole.

601
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,401
How did it go with Heejung? Is it serious?

602
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,987
Well, I wouldn't say that.

603
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,662
She smiled.

604
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,456
That's good. Doesn't that mean
things are getting better?

605
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,333
Something doesn't feel right.

606
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,586
I have no idea how she really feels.

607
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,298
I can never figure her out.

608
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,592
That's what it's like
being the parent of a teenager.

609
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,220
Just think of it as a good sign
when she's smiling.

610
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,776
SODO LAW FIRM

611
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,944
Hello?

612
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:52,987
GET LOST
WE MUST REPENT

613
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,948
I'm almost there.
I'm walking up the stairs.

614
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,408
What's the rush?

615
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,535
WE MUST REPENT
JUST DIE

616
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,704
I WILL GET YOU SOON

617
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,621
What?

618
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,456
Who?

619
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,584
Who did you say is here?

620
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,502
DEMONS
DEMON'S TONGUE BOUND FOR HELL

621
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,837
What's wrong with him?

622
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,715
KNOW YOUR PLACE

623
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:17,261
Minyong, can we remove
the graffiti on the wall?

624
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,596
-Okay.
-Hyejin.

625
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,849
-That's not important. Get in there.
-What's wrong? Who is it?

626
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,358
Hello, Ms. Min.

627
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,485
Hello.

628
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,031
I'm Min Hyejin. I heard you asked for me.

629
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,532
I did.

630
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,659
Hello.

631
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,369
Well,

632
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,789
I'm bound for Hell, so…

633
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,333
Pardon?

634
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,919
I'm bound for Hell.

635
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,379
Hell?

636
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,714
-Show her.
-Okay.

637
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,050
Here.

638
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,012
<i>Mom, look.</i>

639
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,061
<i>Park Jungja.</i>

640
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,106
-<i>You will die five days from now.</i>
-What is this?

641
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,443
-<i>At 3:00 p.m.</i>
-It's a decree.

642
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,946
-I'm sorry?
-They said that's what it's called.

643
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,575
The New Truth told me
that I received a decree.

644
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,744
I see.

645
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,996
The New Truth?

646
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,500
My son said they would know best
regarding this matter.

647
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,812
So what did they say?

648
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,023
They said they'd like to broadcast it.

649
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,609
You know, the demonstration.

650
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,527
Pardon?

651
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:01,031
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
What did they say again?

652
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,992
They'd like to do a live broadcast

653
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,745
of the moment I go to Hell.

654
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,956
Those crazy freaks!
