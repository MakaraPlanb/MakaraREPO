1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,346
<i>You should've stayed with them,</i>
<i>considering how serious the situation is.</i>

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,099
<i>Are you sure they're at home?</i>

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,309
<i>Listen, Mr. Bae.</i>

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>The New Truth and the Arrowhead</i>
<i>are working together.</i>

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,814
<i>The Arrowhead raided my office last night,</i>

6
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,899
<i>and the New Truth deacons were with them.</i>

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,318
<i>If they find out that your baby</i>
<i>received the decree,</i>

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>you and your wife will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,074
I'll have to call you back in a minute.

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,792
YOUNGJAE

11
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,965
-Ms. Song Sohyun?
-Yes?

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,216
Please come this way.

13
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,349
<i>Your call cannot be connected…</i>

14
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,437
SOHYUN
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

15
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,151
YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE NEW TRUTH, DID YOU?

16
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,614
PLEASE CALL AS SOON AS YOU SEE THIS

17
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,461
I'M SORRY, YOUNGJAE

18
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,090
I NEED TO ASK THE NEW TRUTH DEACONS
WHY OUR BABY RECEIVED THE DECREE

19
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,688
Good morning.

20
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,733
I'm Deacon Yuji.

21
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,654
I heard you have something
to discuss with me.

22
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,128
Please take a look at this.

23
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:14,300
Ms. Min, my wife said
she went to the New Truth.

24
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,469
<i>You must get your wife</i>
<i>and baby out of there.</i>

25
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>We'll be there as soon as possible.</i>

26
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,222
Okay.

27
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,899
<i>Song Sohyun's baby.</i>

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,695
<i>In three days…</i>

29
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,907
-<i>at 9:30 p.m.…</i>
-Deacon Yuji.

30
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,201
Has there ever been
a mistake in the decree?

31
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,704
<i>…you are bound for Hell.</i>

32
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,330
My baby was just born.

33
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,959
What sin could my baby have committed?

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,840
People here study all the cases
of demonstrations and decrees.

35
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,343
Something has gone wrong, right?

36
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,722
Even deacons don't know…

37
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,142
about all the cases out there.

38
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,729
Let us discuss this internally.

39
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,398
Could you please wait a moment?

40
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,400
Okay.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,088
Make sure the woman in Room Four
doesn't leave the premises.

42
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,131
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,177
Tell Deacon Sacheong to come in
immediately and keep an eye on her.

44
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,637
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,229
Chairman Kim, I need you to call
an urgent committee meeting.

46
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,698
YOUNGJAE

47
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,328
<i>Your call cannot be connected…</i>

48
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:01,384
<i>Song Sohyun's baby.</i>

49
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,179
<i>In three days,</i>

50
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:11,102
<i>at 9:30 p.m.,</i>

51
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:16,024
<i>you are bound for Hell.</i>

52
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,695
Where are the mother and the baby?

53
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,031
They are in a consulting room.

54
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,285
What do you think we should do?

55
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,079
Anyone?

56
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:37,420
It's hard for me to suggest
anything right now.

57
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,797
But one thing is clear.

58
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,758
That video.

59
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,427
If people find out about it,

60
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,848
they will start to have doubts
about the New Truth and our doctrine.

61
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,892
You're right.

62
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,984
First, isolate the baby
and the mother separately.

63
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,780
Find out who else knows about the video.

64
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,490
Bring them to isolation.

65
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:06,949
Yes, sir.

66
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,007
THE NEW TRUTH

67
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,802
YOUNGJAE: SOHYUN, THEY'RE GOING
TO HARM YOU AND THE BABY.

68
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,928
GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW!

69
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,809
Where's the mother?

70
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,851
She's in Room Four.

71
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,319
You're late. Did she get back to you?

72
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,030
No. I can't get a hold of her.

73
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,408
The consulting rooms
are in Building B over there.

74
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,708
Don't cry, my dear.

75
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,253
Don't cry.

76
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,675
Hello, Ms. Song. I'm Deacon Sacheong.

77
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,678
We'd like to give you
a detailed explanation on the matter.

78
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,555
Please come with us.

79
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,598
Oh, my. The baby's crying so much.

80
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,184
-Let me take the baby.
-No, there's no need--

81
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,769
It's okay. I'm good with babies.

82
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,354
-Give me the baby.
-No, I've got it!

83
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
Please get your bag and come out.

84
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,610
Excuse me! Give me back my baby!

85
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,781
Reporters.

86
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,867
Chairman Kim has other priorities today,

87
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,202
so I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.

88
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:38,624
We are still looking into Professor Gong's
case and the Arrowhead's statement.

89
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,543
We don't have an official statement yet.

90
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,004
The Arrowhead mentioned
the New Truth in their statement,

91
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,714
but you are not commenting on it?

92
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,175
The Arrowhead staged a demonstration
and punished victims.

93
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,135
Shouldn't you at least comment on it?

94
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,346
We have no plan to comment on
any of the issues at the moment.

95
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,557
I would like to ask you to leave now.

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,351
Deacon, are you refusing
to comment on the issues?

97
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,562
-Correct. You should leave.
-Deacon, give us a comment.

98
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,314
-Please leave.
-Give us a comment.

99
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,315
Deacon!

100
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,208
I received the decree!

101
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,125
Who is that?

102
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,504
I'm a sinner who's bound for Hell
in ten minutes.

103
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,255
-Take pictures. Follow him.
-Who is that?

104
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,717
I'd like to confess my sins
to the chairman this instant…

105
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,095
and face the demonstration.

106
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,056
-Get him!
-Right here, right now!

107
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,893
-No, up here! I'll face it up here!
-Take him down!

108
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,655
<i>A man is causing a scene in the lobby</i>

109
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,907
<i>saying that his demonstration</i>
<i>is in ten minutes.</i>

110
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,493
In ten minutes?

111
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,373
I'll go check what's going on.
Keep a close eye on the mother.

112
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,457
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

113
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,670
Wait.

114
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,672
Give me back my baby.

115
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,048
Get her off me!

116
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,634
What's wrong with you?
Give me back my baby!

117
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,428
Why are you doing this?
My baby! Let go of me!

118
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,013
Get her out of here!

119
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,306
Give me back my baby!

120
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,642
Get your hands off her, you bastard!

121
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,812
Let go, you son of a--

122
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,898
Hey, go get her.

123
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,206
Get away from here with that damn baby!

124
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,542
My baby…

125
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,632
Sohyun! Stop!

126
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,801
You bastard.

127
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928
-You arrogant bastard…
-Sohyun!

128
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,929
Oh, no!

129
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,056
Give me back my baby!

130
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,768
Get her off me! Come on, stop her!

131
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,145
What are you doing?

132
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,526
Sohyun!

133
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,694
Die, you bitch.

134
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,334
Call security right now!

135
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,463
Hurry!

136
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,556
Chairman Kim!
Please accept this sinner's plea.

137
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,351
Chairman Kim, where are you?

138
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,020
They're coming.

139
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,817
They're coming!

140
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,204
Drag him out of here right now!

141
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,914
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. Grab him.

142
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,254
I'll drive.

143
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,978
Stop them!

144
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,439
Stop the car!

145
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,466
Block the entrance!

146
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,036
Will that man in the lobby be okay?

147
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,540
They can't do anything to him now
because of the reporters.

148
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,625
He'll be under our protection afterwards.

149
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,923
Chairman…

150
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,967
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to find them.

151
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,095
What did you say?

152
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,305
What?

153
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,473
What?

154
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:32,311
You've got some nerve, carrying on
like that after what you've done!

155
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,486
You had them, and let them
slip right through your hands.

156
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,739
How are you going to catch them now?
Do you have a plan in mind?

157
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,326
Say something!

158
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,335
Do you have any idea what you've done?

159
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,008
The demonstration is tomorrow.

160
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,554
What do you think will happen
if people find out about it?

161
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,306
Pandemonium!
It'll be the end of the world!

162
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,561
They will think God is a joke whose
actions are not governed by principles.

163
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,273
What do you think will happen
in a world without principles?

164
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,275
It will come to an end!

165
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,154
You are the ones
who brought the world to an end.

166
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,244
All right.

167
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,875
From now on, you must
report every little thing to me.

168
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,627
Make use of the Arrowhead.

169
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,840
We need to stop the world from collapsing.

170
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,843
You may leave.

171
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,601
CHAIRMAN KIM JEONGCHIL

172
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,196
JEONGDAM GROCERY STORE

173
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,418
Can we trust this person?

174
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,087
One of our members in this area
referred me to him.

175
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,758
He received the decree long ago
and is waiting for his demonstration.

176
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,093
We should stay here for now.

177
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,884
Hello, Ms. Min. I was surprised
to hear you were coming.

178
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,553
Please come in.

179
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,146
You've come to such
a humble place as this.

180
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,313
Please have a seat.

181
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,108
Would you like some coffee?

182
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,527
I have some instant coffee mix.

183
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,280
-Sounds great. Thank you.
-All right. Please have a seat.

184
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,711
Ms. Song, we only have one day.

185
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,716
Your baby would mean a lot
to the countless victims of the New Truth.

186
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,636
I regret to suggest something like this,

187
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,098
but if you put off
making a decision any longer,

188
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,852
the New Truth could barge in any minute
and harm the baby and both of you.

189
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,064
They could commit murder
without batting an eyelid.

190
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,691
You have to make a decision now.

191
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,902
Here's your coffee.

192
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,575
Poor baby.

193
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,457
I heard the baby received the decree.

194
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,043
How could the baby

195
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,713
have committed any sins?

196
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,467
The same goes for me.

197
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,097
I was a follower of the New Truth.

198
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,434
I lived by their doctrine
more faithfully than anyone.

199
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,354
But after receiving the decree,

200
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,317
I couldn't help but think that
I may have committed sins without knowing.

201
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,653
The thought tormented me.

202
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,697
Anyone could die.

203
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,116
Everyone dies eventually.

204
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,660
They could die of an illness
or in an accident.

205
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,997
But the fact that I'm bound for Hell…

206
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,711
It makes me hate myself so much.

207
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,971
Your baby is proof
that I didn't do anything wrong.

208
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,852
Your baby proves
that I didn't do anything wrong.

209
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,282
Do I even have a choice?

210
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,495
It seems that none of us…

211
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,875
has the right to make our own decisions.

212
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,301
I'm going to upload a video statement
about the baby receiving the decree.

213
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,970
We have to make it reach
as many people as possible.

214
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,890
Oh, I can help you with that.

215
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,351
I used to do live streaming online.

216
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,478
I quit after receiving the decree,

217
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,773
but many people will watch it
if we upload it to my channel.

218
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,858
Hold on a second.

219
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,569
I still have all the equipment.
I'll bring it out.

220
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,363
Where have I put it? Oh, I remember.

221
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,338
Hello.

222
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm Min Hyejin and I was formerly
a lawyer at Sodo Law Firm.

223
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,097
What I am about to share with you
is a video of a newborn baby

224
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,683
receiving the decree from an angel.

225
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,399
<i>Song Sohyun's baby.</i>

226
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,987
I understand that this video

227
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,114
will confuse many of you.

228
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:48,247
What could a newborn baby
have done to face God's punishment?

229
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,711
The baby's demonstration
is at 9:30 p.m. tomorrow.

230
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:00,425
We will broadcast the demonstration
of this innocent baby live tomorrow.

231
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,970
We'll leave it up to you
to interpret its meaning.

232
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,807
<i>And I urge the New Truth</i>
<i>to stop deluding people</i>

233
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,768
<i>by calling this catastrophe</i>
<i>God's punishment.</i>

234
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,069
She's done it.

235
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,240
What do you think we should do?

236
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,326
Well,

237
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,663
maybe it's time for us to adopt
the concept of original sin.

238
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,542
We can say that humans are born sinners--

239
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,585
That is not acceptable!

240
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:41,300
The New Truth was able
to build influence quickly

241
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,929
because we made people understand
why some sinners were bound for Hell.

242
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,848
As soon as we adopt that concept,

243
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,143
people will start to wonder
how we are different from Protestants.

244
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,980
-We'll lose our influence in no time.
-Then what? You have a better idea?

245
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,315
Chairman.

246
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,984
We still have some time.

247
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,154
How about we claim
that the video has been manipulated

248
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,406
and see how the public responds to it?

249
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,284
The demonstration is yet to be held.

250
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,912
What if they really broadcast
the baby's demonstration?

251
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,997
What will we say then?

252
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,416
We should claim that they staged it.

253
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,043
Then people will start to say

254
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,837
that we also staged all
the demonstrations we've aired so far.

255
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,132
You seem eager to find
faults in the ideas of others.

256
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,718
We are here to come up with a solution.

257
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,428
Are you calling me a nitpicker?

258
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,221
Original sin is the safest option.

259
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,975
-Nothing out of line with our doctrine.
-Your suggestion is unreasonable.

260
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,354
-Do you even know what original sin is?
-Think before you speak!

261
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,564
-I don't even drink apple juice.
-Unbelievable.

262
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,399
-Let's calm down.
-Come up with a solution!

263
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,985
-Talk about the facts.
-We need a fundamental solution!

264
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,663
JEONGDAM GROCERY STORE

265
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,623
Yes.

266
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,584
Okay. One moment.

267
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,586
Mr. Bae.

268
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,428
This is one of our members
who'll help you and your wife seek asylum.

269
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,348
You won't be able to take
a lot of things with you.

270
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,475
But let them know
if there's anything you need.

271
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,852
They'll try to accommodate
as much as possible.

272
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,565
What about the demonstration?

273
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,777
We can't go far
because it could be dangerous.

274
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,572
We found a secluded place nearby
to minimize collateral damage.

275
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,866
Our people will be here soon.

276
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,330
Hello?

277
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,092
You don't have to be there
for the demonstration.

278
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,052
We'll take care of everything.

279
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,391
At first,

280
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,231
I couldn't stand all the crying.

281
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,151
It was horrifying.

282
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,154
I didn't know why…

283
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,992
or what the baby was trying to tell me.

284
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,498
Babies cry even if they are
slightly uncomfortable, right?

285
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:26,465
They cry when they are hungry,
sleepy, or when it's too cold or too hot.

286
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,052
All they can do is cry.

287
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,474
But now, I see…

288
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,519
that it was…

289
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,732
a cry for help.

290
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,694
That's why the baby was crying.

291
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,990
Because my baby wants to live.

292
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,913
The baby was crying for my help.

293
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,833
It's the first time…

294
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,256
that anyone has wanted my help so badly.

295
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,386
No one has ever told me
that I'm their only hope

296
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,390
other than my baby.

297
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,939
I'll stay with my baby

298
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,734
until the very end.

299
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,822
Understood.

300
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,292
I… I need to step out to get some things.

301
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,045
-Is there anything you need?
-No, thank you.

302
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,713
All right.

303
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,988
Chairman Kim Jeongchil
is planning on appointing deacons.

304
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,781
How?! What's the basis to decide

305
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:19,119
who qualifies and who doesn't
to be appointed as a deacon?

306
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,038
There is no one else in this world

307
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,624
that is as faithful to God's will
as the Arrowhead.

308
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:30,046
The Arrowhead won't stop
keeping a watchful eye on you! Why?

309
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:35,802
To make sure if you remain faithful
to God's will or not!

310
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,306
This is it for today's broadcast.

311
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,643
The Arrowhead!

312
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,339
What is it? Is he on the phone?

313
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,632
Yes, he is.

314
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,684
Mr. Lee Dongwook?
Chairman Kim Jeongchil of the New Truth.

315
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,896
<i>Are you really Chairman Kim?</i>

316
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,147
Yes, I am.

317
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,901
And I'm not alone.
I have the entire committee with me

318
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,569
to hear what you have to say.

319
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,197
<i>You said Min Hyejin</i>
<i>is at your place, correct?</i>

320
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,741
All of them? To what do I owe this honor?

321
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,453
Chairman Kim,

322
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,580
listen to me.

323
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:52,754
I was a faithful follower of the New Truth

324
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,091
even before you became the chairman.

325
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,930
I had been loyal to the New Truth
since Chairman Jung founded it.

326
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,474
You know,

327
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,186
you may think you are better than me,

328
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,691
but I know God's will better
than any of you in that room!

329
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,694
Okay, I see.

330
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,657
Being a deacon or a committee member

331
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,785
doesn't mean they are closer to God.

332
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,995
We are just a group of people

333
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,125
who try to come up with a better way
of delivering God's message to people.

334
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,668
I know that!

335
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,047
Don't patronize me.

336
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,006
<i>Got it?</i>

337
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,968
Please don't get me wrong.
I have no intention of patronizing you.

338
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,598
Chairman Kim, listen to me carefully

339
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,269
and think about what God is trying to say.

340
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,650
I received the decree three years ago.

341
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,943
<i>I'm bound for Hell.</i>

342
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,988
<i>But…</i>

343
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,906
I have never done anything

344
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,701
that goes against God's will
stated in your doctrine.

345
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,246
I never told this to Sodo people,

346
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,501
but do you know when my demonstration
will be held according to the decree?

347
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,589
Today.

348
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,841
<i>It's today.</i>

349
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:27,098
<i>But Min Hyejin and the baby</i>
<i>came to my place the day before.</i>

350
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,058
It turns out my demonstration will be

351
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,854
five minutes after the baby's.

352
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,359
What do you think this means?

353
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,694
What is He trying to say?

354
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,864
Well, what you told us
is indeed surprising.

355
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,073
-Chairman.
-I think…

356
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,659
YOU ARE THE MESSIAH

357
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,459
It's an absolute message.

358
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,419
<i>I think it shows</i>

359
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,714
that God sometimes makes mistakes.

360
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:05,470
And that He is trying to correct them.

361
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,807
<i>God somehow made a mistake</i>

362
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,142
<i>and addressed the decree to a baby.</i>

363
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,686
What would happen if people find out?

364
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,897
It'll cause great chaos.

365
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,820
Maybe He is trying to cover up His mistake
with your demonstration, Mr. Lee.

366
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:26,282
<i>Mr. Lee, you've been chosen</i>
<i>to cover up God's mistake,</i>

367
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:30,453
<i>and He will forever be indebted to you.</i>

368
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,209
You are to take on the most important role

369
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,587
to strengthen His message.

370
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,342
Mr. Lee,

371
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,011
you are the Messiah.

372
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,271
I knew it.

373
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,815
I knew it.

374
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,361
WE NEED TO FIND OUT HIS LOCATION

375
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,406
Mr. Lee. I'm sorry.

376
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,618
I should call you Messiah from now on.

377
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:15,164
Where are you right now, sir?
We will help you do God's work.

378
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,667
Help me?

379
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,753
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

380
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,215
God has given <i>me</i> this mission.

381
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,009
God has chosen <i>me</i> to do His work.

382
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,430
I will never let you deacons
steal my thunder ever again!

383
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,307
<i>Listen.</i>

384
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,559
I'll kindly leave you a clue,

385
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,812
so you can try all you want to find me.

386
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,112
Right, a clue.

387
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,331
What the hell?

388
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,083
I even called him the Messiah!

389
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,670
Chairman Kim,

390
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,798
we can trace the location
of his last call to find him.

391
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,343
We can ask an Arrowhead
who works at a telecomm company.

392
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,094
As soon as you get the location,

393
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,097
take whomever you need with you
and head there!

394
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,809
I'll tell the police that we need
their help in finding a sinner on the run.

395
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,646
All right, everyone. Get moving! Go!

396
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,851
Chairman Kim,

397
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,938
Lee Dongwook made his last call
near a supermarket in Seongnam.

398
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,357
We requested cooperation
from the police in the jurisdiction.

399
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,734
I don't care where he was.
Go get him right now!

400
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,986
Go!

401
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,072
We located Lee Dongwook.

402
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,741
Contact the deacons in Seongnam.
Get moving!

403
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,742
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

404
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,589
Yes, that's the place.

405
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,800
Park your car
in the underground parking lot.

406
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,343
Please hurry.

407
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,848
They're almost here.

408
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,574
{\an8}SIWON CLEANING SERVICE

409
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,635
What's wrong?

410
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,345
One moment.

411
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,950
-Ms. Min.
-Yes.

412
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,744
I'll go check on them.

413
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,496
Hold on.

414
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,542
Take it with you.

415
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,307
I have to show everyone.

416
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,521
I want to show them something.

417
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,530
Please seal off this area.

418
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,697
Yes, sir.

419
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,783
Search thoroughly.

420
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,996
Get moving!

421
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,002
What happened?

422
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,588
Hang in there.

423
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,256
Can you hear me?

424
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,237
The time is near.

425
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,655
Look at me.

426
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,865
Look!

427
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,620
I guess you don't recognize me.

428
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,583
I used to be a big shot in the Arrowhead.

429
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,169
Why…

430
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,963
Why are you suddenly doing this?

431
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,425
You received the decree too.

432
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,426
You're right.

433
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,846
I will be subjected to the demonstration

434
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,140
five minutes after your baby.

435
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,143
I'm the one to cover up God's mistake.

436
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,521
Would you like to hear what my plan is?

437
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,358
Firstly, I'm going to kill you here

438
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,654
and kill your wife
and Min Hyejin upstairs.

439
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,741
Then your baby's demonstration
will be in my room.

440
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,619
Within five minutes,
I will get rid of the body

441
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,955
and be subjected to the demonstration.

442
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,625
Then people won't be sure
who was subjected to the demonstration

443
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,585
or what happened to the baby.

444
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,671
They will be confused.

445
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:44,887
Come to think of it, I didn't know
God could be so damn despicable.

446
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,847
How could He make a mistake?

447
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,516
How?

448
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,936
And He's chosen me
to cover up His mistake?

449
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:55,856
Wait.

450
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,569
I don't understand what you're saying.

451
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,115
But please calm down.

452
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,452
Come to your senses.

453
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,412
What do you mean?

454
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,791
My mind has never been clearer.

455
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:17,420
I can see clearly why I was born
and why I am dying.

456
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,423
Not many people get to understand that.

457
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,968
I am the one…

458
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,348
who is closest to God.

459
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,403
Sohyun!

460
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,447
Sohyun, run!

461
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,866
Ms. Min!

462
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,775
-Come here!
-Let go of me!

463
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,972
Everyone.

464
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,560
There is something…

465
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,648
I need to show you all.

466
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,945
This is my baby…

467
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,158
who is about to be subjected to

468
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,078
the demonstration.

469
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,162
A baby?

470
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,249
Please stay and witness the moment.

471
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,835
-That's not right.
-How could a baby…

472
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,672
What?

473
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,508
-They've been located.
-Deacon Yuji.

474
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,343
Please check this out.

475
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,638
This is near here.

476
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,682
BABY SUBJECT, REAL-TIME
BABY DEMONSTRATION, INFANT

477
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,102
-Head there now.
-Get moving!

478
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,198
Poor baby…

479
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,749
My baby…

480
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,086
I will…

481
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,841
I will be with you until the end.

482
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,186
How much farther?

483
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,813
Almost there.

484
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,696
I don't have time for this!

485
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,241
Let go of me! Let go! Damn it!

486
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,995
You're a mere mortal!

487
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,373
Die!

488
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,734
Sohyun!

489
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,797
Sohyun!

490
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,018
It's going to be okay.

491
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,397
No.

492
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,247
Oh my…

493
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,417
-What is he doing?
-What a relief.

494
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,329
What the hell?

495
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,966
The message is too complicated
for me to understand.

496
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,676
You bastard.

497
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,600
What the hell are you
trying to tell me, you asshole?

498
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,355
Carry on?

499
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,109
Okay, I'll carry on with the plan.

500
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,824
Wait.

501
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,424
Oh, my goodness.

502
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,907
Get her!

503
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,872
Get out of the way!

504
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,914
Step aside!

505
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,708
Move!

506
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,293
Move!

507
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,047
Get out of the way now!

508
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,382
Move.

509
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,301
-Get out of the way!
-Move!

510
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,262
You are going against God's will.

511
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,764
Get out of the way now!

512
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,060
Get out of the way!

513
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,102
Stop it!

514
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,313
You pathetic crooks.

515
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,610
What did you say?

516
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:12,778
Enough is enough.

517
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,363
You are all liars.

518
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,245
What did you just call me?

519
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,040
What did you say?

520
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,044
Hey.

521
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,047
You disregard God's principles

522
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,841
and go against God's will.

523
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,095
Who are you to call me a crook?

524
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,764
How dare you!

525
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,558
How dare you!

526
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,914
What are you still doing here?
Go get that bitch. Damn it.

527
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:07,958
Deacon Yuji.

528
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,212
You are under arrest for battery.

529
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,297
You have the right to remain silent.

530
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,218
-You have the right to an attorney.
-What are you doing?

531
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:19,886
Come on.

532
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,847
What the hell are you saying?

533
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,058
Do you have any idea
what you're doing right now?

534
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,854
Do you know what it means
if God acts without logic?

535
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,231
It means the end of the world.

536
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,859
More sinners will ruin the world.

537
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,822
The victims of those sinners
will hold you responsible for everything.

538
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,951
You are the ones who
are helping the sinners to sin.

539
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,786
Shame on you.

540
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,038
Shame on you!

541
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:51,626
You disregard God's principles
and go against God's will.

542
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,461
-Who are you to…
-Let's head back.

543
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,493
Please take the main road
and drive as far away as possible.

544
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,270
The main road is straight ahead.

545
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,023
The police set up a checkpoint
on that street.

546
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,524
I saw it on my way here,

547
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,235
Ms. Min Hyejin.

548
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,406
I'll take a different route
to the main road.

549
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,116
It's safer.

550
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,288
I don't know much about God,

551
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,706
and I don't even care.

552
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,542
One thing I know for sure

553
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,711
is that this world belongs to us.

554
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,799
We should settle our own affairs.

555
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,593
Don't you agree, Ms. Min?
