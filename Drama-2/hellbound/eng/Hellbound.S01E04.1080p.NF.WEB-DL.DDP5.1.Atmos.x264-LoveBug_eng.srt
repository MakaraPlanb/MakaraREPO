00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,437
{\an8}SINNER #3, PARK JUNGJA
ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF DECREE

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,440
{\an8}Park Jungja.

3
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:28,361
{\an8}You will die five days
from now at 3:00 p.m…

4
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,740
{\an8}<i>After the sinner Park Jungja</i>
<i>informed the New Truth</i>

5
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,034
{\an8}<i>of the decree she received four years ago,</i>

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,578
{\an8}<i>we have entered a new era.</i>

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:46,629
{\an8}ALTHOUGH HER HOLY DEMONSTRATION
ALLOWED FOR US TO ENTER A NEW ERA

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,715
{\an8}<i>Unfortunately,</i>

9
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,926
{\an8}<i>the sinner did not confess her sins</i>
<i>until the final moment.</i>

10
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,636
THE NEW TRUTH

11
00:00:55,972 --> 00:01:02,353
{\an8}AFTER THE LOCATION OF THE FIRST SINNER'S
DEMONSTRATION WAS OPENED TO THE PUBLIC

12
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,817
{\an8}IT CONTINUES TO BE AN EXAMPLE FOR MANY WHO
VISIT THE SACRED SITE AT HAPSEONG STATION

13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,737
{\an8}<i>God has clearly shown His will</i>

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>through different forms</i>
<i>of divine intervention.</i>

15
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:19,079
{\an8}<i>However, we are too afraid and ashamed</i>
<i>to have our sins revealed</i>

16
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,457
{\an8}<i>and try hard to conceal</i>
<i>the message from God.</i>

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,670
{\an8}<i>Sinners try to face the demonstration</i>
<i>where nobody can witness it.</i>

18
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,674
<i>Among the sinners who received the decree,</i>

19
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,676
<i>some foolish ones take their own lives</i>

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,137
<i>without waiting for the day of judgment.</i>

21
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:40,642
{\an8}<i>This man was known to have committed</i>
<i>suicide because his business failed.</i>

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,980
<i>He was brought back to life</i>
<i>at the time of his demonstration</i>

23
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,151
<i>and faced damnation</i>
<i>in front of his friends and family.</i>

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,072
<i>His arrogance led him to believe</i>
<i>that he could avoid the wrath of God,</i>

25
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,659
<i>but God didn't allow it.</i>

26
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,330
{\an8}<i>So what does God want from us?</i>

27
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:08,253
{\an8}He's telling us to be more righteous.

28
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,963
{\an8}<i>That's right.</i>

29
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,800
{\an8}<i>That is God's will.</i>

30
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,929
{\an8}My father is a sinner.

31
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,931
{\an8}SINNER #27, SONG HYEONSEOP
INTERVIEW WITH FAMILY

32
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,893
He used his corporate credit card
for his personal expenses.

33
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:30,150
He also has sinful videos on his computer.

34
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,404
My father is a sinner

35
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,324
who deserves to go to Hell.

36
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,707
GOD'S WILL II

37
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,211
{\an8}SINNER #3, PARK JUNGJA - SACRED LOCATION
OF DEMONSTRATION IN BUKHYEON-DONG

38
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,380
{\an8}A society that
does not shy away from sins.

39
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:57,886
We must not hide our sins nor those
of our family members or friends.

40
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,721
2ND CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW TRUTH
KIM JEONGCHIL

41
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,139
{\an8}SINNER PARK JUNGJA'S REMAINS

42
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,474
{\an8}Don't end up like the sinner Park Jungja.

43
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,898
No. Do not try to hide your sins.

44
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,609
Confess your sins.
Do not try to silence God.

45
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,820
{\an8}Do not get in the way

46
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,947
{\an8}of God's will.

47
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,784
THE NEW TRUTH

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,786
The New Truth will be with you

49
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,460
as you strive to be more righteous.

50
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:38,968
{\an8}YOU CAN FIND GOD'S WILL
ON THE NEW TRUTH APP

51
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:55,401
Well, this is just a first cut.

52
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,529
We managed to secure a slot

53
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,741
right after the most popular TV drama,
<i>But First, Love</i>.

54
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,078
So, what do you think?

55
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,957
Well, thanks for sharing
the first cut with us,

56
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,711
but I'm concerned about
the close-up shot of Park Jungja's face.

57
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,008
The shot shows too much emotion
on the sinner's face.

58
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,428
And the background music
is a bit too sentimental.

59
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,307
I'm afraid it could
make some viewers pity the sinner.

60
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,519
We have emphasized multiple times

61
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,230
that the sinners
should still look like sinners.

62
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,567
What's so funny?

63
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,488
Why don't you just
run your own TV station?

64
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,875
Producer Bae Youngjae?

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,796
You're the producer in charge
of this campaign documentary,

66
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,590
but you seem to have something
against the New Truth.

67
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,927
Actually, I'm the lead producer.

68
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,680
Producer Bae is an assistant producer.

69
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,016
Who says I'm an assistant?

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,935
I'm a co-producer.

71
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,898
It's not that I have anything
against your organization…

72
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,778
Actually, you're right.

73
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,281
I do.

74
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,702
Do I need to ask your permission
for what background music to use?

75
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,247
That's enough, Producer Bae.
Don't be rude to the deacons.

76
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,460
If not the deacons, who else is
going to sign-off on the documentary?

77
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,586
Sir.

78
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,132
Enough is enough. What are we doing here?

79
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:45,094
We shouldn't be asking for them
to approve every little detail.

80
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,804
Can we really call ourselves the press?

81
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,933
Are we some kind of production company
under the New Truth?

82
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,101
Damn it.

83
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,772
I thought we were working together
to do what's right.

84
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,901
but I guess you consider us
merely one of your clients.

85
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,821
Do you not approve of the changes
we are making for the world?

86
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,784
If you look at the crime rate,
it has dropped significantly since--

87
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,327
Who believes those numbers?

88
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,205
Tell me.

89
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,958
People are too afraid
to report the Arrowhead's crimes.

90
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,961
If you count them,
I bet the crime rate would skyrocket.

91
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,381
They recently went
to one of the subject's houses

92
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,925
and wrote something in spray paint.

93
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,676
What was it again?

94
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,595
"The home of a sinner"?

95
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,516
They turned the house upside down

96
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,019
and beat up the family, didn't they?

97
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,064
Do you really not see a problem

98
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,984
in a world where a ten-year-old kid
calls her father a sinner?

99
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,236
Enough.

100
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,532
Making the world a better place
through intimidation and condemnation?

101
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,702
That reminds me of somewhere.

102
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,498
-Hell.
-Stop it already, you bastard!!

103
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,041
What the heck?

104
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,000
What…

105
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,713
Oh… Please excuse them.

106
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,216
You've done a great job so far.
Stop that now.

107
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,264
Anyway, we will make sure to apply
your feedback to the final cut.

108
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,307
In terms of the broadcast slot,

109
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,520
we are thinking of rerunning it five times
a week, so no need to worry.

110
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,233
Producer Bae is feeling
the pressure to meet the deadline.

111
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,193
He became a father a few days ago.

112
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,571
Why would you bring that up?

113
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,822
For God's sake.

114
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,949
I guess we were a bit overzealous.

115
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,870
I'm not saying the quality is bad.
It's good overall.

116
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,416
We'll trust you with it, then.

117
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,171
I'll let the chairman know
that everything's going smoothly.

118
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,797
Thank you so much.

119
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,048
Please don't worry.

120
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,303
Sorry, I should have gotten that for you.

121
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,639
Well, then. Take care.

122
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,557
Take care.

123
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,270
-They're such stuck-up jerks.
-Have a safe return trip.

124
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,273
Hey.

125
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,276
Are you two out of your minds?

126
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,820
Youngjae, you asshole.

127
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,157
You'd better apply their feedback today.

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,366
Sir, that's too…

129
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,580
I need to go see my baby at the hospital.
I thought we were done here.

130
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,249
Why did you rub them the wrong way, then?

131
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,459
Do you think I want to…

132
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,836
-Forget it.
-Damn it.

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,424
Anyway, make the segment with the kid's
interview longer, just like they said.

134
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,092
I liked that segment.

135
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,179
It made me want
to forgive my sins and repent.

136
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,722
Fix it like they wanted.

137
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,599
-Sir!
-Just do it!

138
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,309
Damn.

139
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,770
What's gotten into you?

140
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,356
Why are you bowing down to those assholes?

141
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,815
Junwon!

142
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,363
Damn, what's up with them?

143
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,083
Hey, Sohyun. One moment.

144
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,794
Hi, Toughie's father.

145
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,337
You must be really busy.

146
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,923
<i>You've left for the hospital, right?</i>

147
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm sorry, but I need
to re-edit the documentary.

148
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,178
I won't be finished until later tonight.

149
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,846
How are you feeling?

150
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,932
What do you think?
It's hurting like crazy.

151
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,849
<i>What's wrong?</i>

152
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,061
<i>The doctor said you were okay</i>
<i>when I talked to him on the phone.</i>

153
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,813
I just feel helpless.

154
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,067
Our baby is in the intensive care unit,

155
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,902
so I can't even visit when I want.

156
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,699
The baby should be okay, right?

157
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,450
<i>I'm sure it's nothing serious.</i>

158
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,203
Don't worry too much.
The doctor said the baby is okay.

159
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,206
<i>You can't come during visiting hours</i>
<i>if you have to work overtime, can you?</i>

160
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,374
Hello.

161
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,211
Well, I guess not.

162
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,756
<i>I think I should just take the day off</i>
<i>tomorrow and visit in the morning.</i>

163
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,800
How about…

164
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,805
I send you a video
of our little fighter later today?

165
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,808
<i>A video?</i> <i>Are you allowed</i>
<i>to take your phone in?</i>

166
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,477
It should be okay.
I'll only use it briefly.

167
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,605
Okay. Send me a video if you can.

168
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,232
I'll get it done as fast as I can.

169
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,402
I'm sorry, and I love you.

170
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,446
All right.

Hear me out, Misuk.

173
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,542

It's written on your face.

Fuck, those damn New Truth freaks.

175
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,213
Don't say anything bad about them.
It scares me.

176
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,882
Because I'll go to Hell for it?

177
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,801
No. What if you turn out to be
a member of the Arrowhead?

178
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,553
Well, that's reasonable.

186
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,865
What do they want us to revise?

187
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,575
We need to change the music

188
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,372
and re-edit the interviews
of the sinners' families.

189

193
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,175
It won't take long.
It's just a simple fix.

195
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,553

-Yes.

00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,881
Hey, Junwon.

348
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,762
Where did he go?

349
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,273
Where did he go? Damn it.

350
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,277
Junwon!

351
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:22,502
<i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

352
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,754
Where did he go?

353
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,759
Damn, it's scary here.

354
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,484
Junwon!

355
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,577
What the…

356
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,329
Junwon!

357
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,455
Are you crazy?

358
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,539
Junwon!

359
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,708
Seriously?

360
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,254
-Junwon!
-Go away!

361
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,631
-Come out!
-Go away!

362
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,592
Come out now! What are you doing? Whoa!

363
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,968
Let go! Let go of me!

364
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,637
-What's wrong with you?
-Let go!

365
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,596
Come here.

366
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,848
Are you drunk?

367
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,893
-Let go of me, please!
-Come here. Let's talk.

368
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,020
What the hell is wrong with you?

369
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,272
How did you come here?

370
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,526
I drove. What's wrong?

371
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,152
Your wife called me.

372
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,362
Come out and talk.

373
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:31,947
Please…

374
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,076
Please just pretend you didn't see me.

375
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,329
Come out already!
I need to go see my baby.

376
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,957
My wife is waiting for me.
Come out now. Seriously.

377
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,625
I…

378
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,005
I…

379
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,840
I received a prophecy.

380
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,593
What?

381
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,388
I'm going to Hell soon.

382
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,683
What did you just say?

383
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,519
Youngjae, I'm begging you.

384
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,981
I'm begging you. Please.

385
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,316
Just… Just pretend you didn't find me.

386
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,988
No one will find out that
I'm bound for Hell if you keep quiet.

387
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,905
So, please…

388
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,409
Junwon.

389
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,666
Please pretend you didn't find me.

390
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,836
Junwon. Look at me. Come on.

391
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,713
Are you okay?

392
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,967
I'm bound for Hell.

393
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,760
My family…

394
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,805
They will…

395
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,184
They will live with the shame
of being the family of a sinner.

396
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,478
Please, Youngjae.

397
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:51,151
The New Truth and the Arrowhead
will never leave my family alone!

398
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,907
Please, Youngjae.
Pretend you didn't see me.

399
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,075
What about you?

400
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,911
What's going to happen to you?

401
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,289
What will happen?
What are you going to do?

402
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:08,585
People from Sodo
will take care of things for me.

403
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,088
They will make it look like
I vanished without a trace.

404
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,590
Who are these Sodo people?

405
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,425
Listen, Youngjae.

406
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,304
Pull yourself together.
You have to pretend you know nothing.

407
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,056
Otherwise,

408
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,059
the Sodo people won't leave you alone.

409
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,352
What on earth…

410
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,269
Youngjae.

411
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,146
You should go now.

412
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,689
Junwon.

413
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,524
You should go!

414
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,443
Don't come any closer.

415
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,653
Go away! Now!

416
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,882
Youngjae.

417
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,802
My wife…

418
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,722
Don't tell my wife about this.

419
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,682
Junwon.

420
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,560
This…

421
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,562
This is for the best.

422
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:29,874
Youngjae…

423
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,876
Youngjae!

424
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,380
Junwon!

425
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,481
Junwon!

426
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,418
Where did he go?

427
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,945
Junwon.

428
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,161
All right, let's get this over with.

429
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,579
Let's hurry.

430
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:36,167
Shit, water, of course.
And I didn't bring my boots.

431
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,341
Move out of the way please.

432
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,593
Hold it. Let's put it back there.

433
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,513
-One, two…
-Three.

434
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,223
Junwon.

435
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,517
Who are you people?

436
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,434
Come on.

437
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,145
Junwon!

438
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,438
Let go of me!

439
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,441
Let go and talk to me!

440
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,068
Who the hell are you?

441
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,736
What are you going to do to me?

442
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,364
-Producer Bae.
-Let go of me! Who are you?

443
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,740
Producer Bae!

444
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,286
What?

445
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,079
<i>It's basically suicide.</i>

446
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,499
You'd better forget about
what you witnessed today.

447
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,669
Don't try looking into this.

448
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,255
Otherwise, you'll be put in danger.

449
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,135
What about Junwon? He…

450
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,329
Hyeongjun,

451
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
you shouldn't have revealed your face.

452
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,207
He can be trusted.

453
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,375
Bullshit.

454
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,045
People would sell their own parents
if the New Truth told them to.

455
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,171
No one can be trusted.

456
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,965
Are we really going to
let him go like this?

457
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,177
If anything happens,
you'll be held responsible.

458
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,637
Let's keep a watch on him

459
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,972
and see how he reacts.

460
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,329
SODO QUICK LOAN

461
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,640
Sorry.

462
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,435
How pretty.

463
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,687
My baby.

464
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,401
Hello.

465
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,327
You're up.

466
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,626
The editing took longer than I expected.

467
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,295
And my phone ran out of battery.

468
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,763
Don't stray too far.
Search along the path!

469
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,265
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,353
This is where the missing person
made their last call. Search thoroughly.

471
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,988
Come on, get in there!

472
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,489
Damn, really…

473
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,287
Are there other areas
you can access by car?

474
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,664
There are no residential areas
around here,

475
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,334
and I already checked
the two farm roads over there.

476
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,795
Thank you for your cooperation.

477
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,213
You're very welcome.

478
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,132
We're glad we could be of help.

479
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,093
But…

480
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,848
are there really a lot of people
who hide that they received the decree?

481
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,726
Yes, because…

482
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,105
it's hard to overcome the shame.

483
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,613
Withdraw! Everyone,
get ready to head back to the station.

484
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,157
What do you mean?
Who ordered you to stop searching?

485
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,368
Mr. Kang Junwon's car was caught
by a surveillance camera at a tollgate.

486
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,745
He's not here.

487
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,496
Have you found the car?

488
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,583
You can't go anywhere without
getting caught on a surveillance camera.

489
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,792
We're sure we'll find…

490
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,923
Let's head back.

491
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,883
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

492
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,177
Come out.

493
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,220
Tell him to come out.

494
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,137
Get your stuff.

495
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,472
Don't forget that.

496
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,158
No matter how much I search…

497
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,537
I can't find a case…

498
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,334
where a newborn baby

499
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,296
was sent to Hell.

500
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,802
Something must have gone wrong, right?

501
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,599
What could a newborn baby have done…

502
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,855
Does this mean I gave birth to a sinner?

503
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,774
Is that it?

504
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,445
Did I do something wrong?

505
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,575
What should we do?

506
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,453
You did nothing wrong.

507
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,955
What should we do?

508
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,755
Let's go home with our baby.
I'll look into it.
