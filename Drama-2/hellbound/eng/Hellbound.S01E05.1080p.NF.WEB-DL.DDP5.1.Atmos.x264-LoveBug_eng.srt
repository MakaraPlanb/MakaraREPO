SODO QUICK LOAN

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,768
Deacon Yuji, we located Kang Junwon's car.

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,939
It was found near a port in Incheon.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,402
He bought cigarettes with his credit card
at a convenience store near the port.

5
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,155
He must have stowed away on a ship.

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:34,325
He borrowed money from loan sharks
and fell into debt because of gambling,

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,245
and fled to another country
abandoning his wife and child.

8
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,789
How can he be so irresponsible?

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,000
He deserves to be damned.

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,170
Deacon Yuji,

11
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,213
we located the sinner, Kim Yeongseok,

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,591
who recently received the decree
at a supermarket.

13
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,551
He was hiding in a motel in Cheonan.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,929
Let's head there right now.

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,640
Have a safe trip back.

16
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,909
<i>Does this mean I gave birth to a sinner?</i>

17
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,827
<i>Is that it?</i>

18
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,371
Did I do something wrong?

19
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>What should we do?</i>

20
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,645
<i>Junwon.</i>

21
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,564
What's going to happen to you?

22
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,358
What will happen?
What are you going to do?

23
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,654
People from Sodo
will take care of things for me.

24
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,990
<i>They will make it look like</i>
<i>I vanished without a trace.</i>

25
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,042
SODO

26
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,381
A PLACE WHERE RITUALS FOR HEAVENLY GODS
WERE PERFORMED IN THE SAMHAN PERIOD

27
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,925
SODO

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,349
RECORDS ON SODO CAN BE FOUND IN HISTORICAL
TEXTS SUCH AS THE BOOK OF THE LATER HAN…

29
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,439
SODO WAS CONSIDERED A SACRED AREA
WHERE RELIGIOUS RITUALS WERE HELD

30
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,609
AND FUGITIVES WHO FLED THERE
WERE IMMUNE TO ARREST

31
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,990
What?

32
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,199
Hey, Producer Bae…

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,618
I thought you took a day off.

34
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,036
I did.

35
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,750
Hey, have you heard? About Junwon.

36
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,753
What about him?

37
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:55,425
It turns out… he was addicted
to gambling and fell into debt.

38
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,220
Rumor has it that he stowed away
on a ship from Incheon to escape the debt.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,599
I never thought
he'd do something like that.

40
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,436
So many people vanish
without a trace these days.

41
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,817
Hey, you don't gamble, do you?

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,571
Where are you going?

43
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,746
-Sinner Kim Yeongseok.
-Yes?

44
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,081
Pull yourself together.

45
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,293
Tell us how you received
the decree in detail.

46
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,171
Well, it was…

47
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,716
My wife asked me
to get some groceries for dinner.

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,384
I was at a supermarket--

49
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,471
Everyone knows that you received
the decree at a supermarket.

50
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,723
Just tell us when
your demonstration will be held.

51
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,351
That… That is…

52
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,312
I was in the liquor section,

53
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,191
and the angel suddenly appeared before me.

54
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,944
Kim Yeongseok, tell us the time
of your demonstration.

55
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,489
"You will die six days from now…

56
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,368
at 5:00 p.m."

57
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,496
Six days? When would that be?
Isn't that today?

58
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,248
It's happening soon.

59
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,793
Deacons, there isn't much time.

60
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,754
He already confessed his sins.
Please take him away.

61
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,589
Are you going to let it happen here?

62
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,260
The government can't spare more
in the budget for another sacred site.

63
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,637
Okay, we understand. Don't worry.

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,181
We'll take him to headquarters
and broadcast his demonstration.

65
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
We don't have much time.

66
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,185
Tell headquarters to get ready
for the live broadcast.

67
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,020
Contact the sinner's family too.

68
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,146
Noted, sir.

69
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,274
Get moving.

70
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,650

Hey, Misuk.

74
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,163
Youngjae, have you heard
about Producer Kang?

75
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,166
-The debate show you were working on…
-Sorry?

76
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,960
Some guy was talking
about people vanishing.

77
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,169
Yes, why?

78
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,504
Let me watch the clip again.

-Yes.

81
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,390

<i>Cue.</i>

88
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,440
This sinner, Kim Yeongseok,

89
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,568
has been operating
an illegal gambling house.

90
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,947
He received the decree
in a supermarket in front of everyone.

91
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,537
Even after receiving the decree,

92
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,082
he decided to run away
instead of confessing his sins.

93
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,379
Where did you try to flee to?

94
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:02,964
To where?!

95
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:09,345
Did you think you could
deceive God's eyes and run from Him?

96
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,763
Did you?

97
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,573
Look.

98
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,576
Take a good look at your family.

99
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,288
You will now face the demonstration

100
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,541
in front of your family.

101
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,212
And everyone who's watching.

102
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,756
Accept your fate.

103
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,758
All right?

104
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,305
Chairman, we have 30 seconds.

105
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:03,900
Go to Hell, you sinner!

106
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,783
I can't accept it.

107
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,120
I didn't commit a grave sin.

108
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,830
Honey.

109
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,166
Mom…

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,543
I don't sin like that.

111
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,922
Please spare me. Please.

112
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,225
How are the ratings?

113
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,102

Chairman…

116
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,907
I'd like to call for a committee meeting.

117
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,159
-Is it urgent?
-Yes.

118
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,871
There's an important matter
the committee should address.

119
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,206
All right, then.

120
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,296
I'll call a meeting
as soon as the broadcast ends.

121
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,449
You sinner.

122
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,993
As one who has committed sins,

123
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,456
you shall suffer eternal pain in Hell

124
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,170
and reflect on your sins

125
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,673
over and over again!

126
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,260
May you suffer greatly

127
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,389
in the pain of Hell's inferno.

SOCIOLOGY, PROFESSOR GONG HYEONGJUN

130
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,939
What is this?

131
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,190
What a pain in the ass.

132
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,359
-Let go of me!
-Producer Bae.

133
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:39,156
Didn't I tell you to forget about
what you witnessed yesterday?

134
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,996
<i>If you tell us now,</i>

135
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,959
<i>we won't make your daughter</i>
<i>witness your demonstration.</i>

136
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,296
<i>Your daughter would love</i>
<i>to see you being torn to pieces.</i>

137
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,297
<i>Sir…</i>

138
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,467
<i>My daughter is still too young.</i>

139
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,844
<i>Spit it out now.</i>

140
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,763
<i>Well…</i>

141
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,517
<i>The video of me receiving the decree</i>

142
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,894
<i>went viral online so fast.</i>

143
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,813
<i>So I decided to run away.</i>

144
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,232
<i>I don't know how they found me,</i>

145
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,734
<i>but I got a call from them.</i>

146
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,862
<i>Who are you referring to?</i>

147
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>The rumored organization…</i>

148
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:26,328
<i>that helps those who received the decree</i>
<i>vanish before the New Truth finds them.</i>

149
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,830
<i>What did they say?</i>

150
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:34,128
<i>They told me that they could help me</i>
<i>disappear without anyone knowing.</i>

151
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,671
<i>So I told them</i>

152
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,923
<i>I would think about it.</i>

153
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,009
<i>Then a little later,</i>

154
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,972
<i>I found that business card</i>
<i>in this motel room.</i>

155

SODO LAUNDRY SERVICE

156
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,683
<i>The New Truth claims</i>

157
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,977
that only sinners are subjected
to the demonstration,

158
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,645
but that's a lie.

159
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,399
It is more like a supernatural disaster
that cannot be explained.

160
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,902
Jung Jinsu simply gave meaning
to this random event

161
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,570
by calling it God's will.

162
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,071
So…

163
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,618
are you saying you're hiding
those who received the decree?

164
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,577
Yes.

165
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,288
It's to prevent the New Truth
from getting what they want

166
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,791
and to protect the bereaved
from being stigmatized.

167
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,835
That's the best we can do for them
at this point.

168
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,254
How do you find people
who receive the decree?

169
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,298
We can't find all of them.

170
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,760
It's easy to identify those
who received the decree in public.

171
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,639
In that case, we need to find them
before the New Truth does.

172
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,350
On the other hand, those
who receive the decree in private

173
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,018
show similar behavioral patterns.

174
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,104
For example, the things they search for
after receiving the decree.

175
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,151
They repeatedly search
for certain terms on the New Truth app

176
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,446
and once we notice the pattern,
we try to get in contact with them.

177
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,115
How is that even possible?

178
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,744
We use the backdoor
the New Truth has planted.

179
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,372
Our members are everywhere.

180
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,124
The police, telecomm groups,
search engine companies…

181
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,419
Even at your TV station.

182
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,880
There are some
who engage in illegal activities.

183
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,299
Most of them are family of the subjects

184
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,343
or hold a grudge against the Arrowhead.

185
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,889
Isn't it a bit too dangerous?

186
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,394
Half the world
are followers of the New Truth.

187
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,692
What do you think Chairman Kim Jeongchil
would do if he receives the decree?

188
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,945
He would turn to us first.

189
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,157
Once the tables are turned
and you become the one being judged,

190
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,660
you realize that humans

191
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,122
should have the right to die alone.

192
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,142
<i>Song Sohyun's baby.</i>

193
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,646
<i>In three days,</i>

194
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:03,903
<i>at 9:30 p.m.</i>…

195
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,864
-Please help me.
-…<i>you are bound for Hell.</i>

196
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,702
<i>I was going to call that woman</i>
<i>some time today.</i>

197
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,412
<i>That woman?</i>

198
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,373
<i>I'm sure you've heard of her.</i>

199
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,586
<i>Her name is Min Hyejin.</i>

200
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,592
The Min Hyejin that he mentioned

201
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,180
is the lawyer who was hostile
toward the New Truth.

202
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,932
She went missing a few years ago.

203
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:39,229
She was working
at Sodo Law Firm during that time.

204
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,318
Okay.

205
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,905
Yes, noted.

206
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,660
There is someone who'd like to meet you.

207
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,536
Please come with me.

208
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,290
Sodo…

209
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,959
We thought it was just a rumor,

210
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,003
but it turns out Sodo is the organization

211
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,006
that hides those who receive the decree.

212
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,257
And…

213
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,179
Producer Kang Junwon,
who's known to have fled the country.

214
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,516
I believe he is a sinner
who received the decree.

215
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,185
I'm sure Sodo covered it up.

216
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,065
Have you tried calling the numbers here?

217
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,566
Yes, we have.

218
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,861
They're temporary numbers generated online
and none of them are active.

219
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,451
This is blasphemy!

220
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:41,166
This is an act of rebellion against God
with an intention to incapacitate Him.

221
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,961
They are getting in the way
of the betterment of humanity.

222
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,797
It's an act of betrayal against humanity.

223
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,509
Apprehend every single
one of them right now.

224
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,928
-Take strong and swift measures.
-Yes, sir.

225
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,223
I'll request police cooperation
and call deacons--

226
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,975
What are you talking about?

227
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,437
We don't have time to make
formal requests from law enforcement.

228
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,066
Why do you think
they are always a step ahead of us?

229
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,111
It's because we always abide by the law

230
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,697
while they don't give a damn about it!

231
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,492
This is not the time to think about
what's legal and what's not.

232
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,746
Do whatever it takes to round them up.

233
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,083
Chairman.

234
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,794
That is beyond my authority.

235
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,140
Deacon Yuji, come here.

236
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,312
Come closer.

237
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,448
Deacon Yuji…

238
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,994
with the power given to me
as chairman of the New Truth,

239
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:04,792
as of this moment,
I empower you with the full authority

240
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,338
to take all necessary measures

241
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,381
to root out the unjust who deny God.

242
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,180
I empower you!

243
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,146
Devote your body and soul

244
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,234
to following God's will.

245
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:59,513
Hey, can we please come up
with something better for this ritual?

246
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,308
Something that looks
more impressive and phenomenal.

247
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,019
Well… I'll think of something.

248
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,563
Sure, please do.

249
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,690
My goodness.

250
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,821
Are you all right?

251
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,365
Deacon Sacheong.

252
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,449
Yes.

253
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,578
Contact the Arrowhead and find out
how many we can muster right now.

254
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,079
Sorry? The Arrowhead?

255
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,372
How would I…

256
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,459
I know you are in contact with them.

257
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,672
You do not need to be secretive this time.

258
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,508
Yes, sir.

259
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,893
Hey, it's me.

260
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,228
How many can you gather right now?

261
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,481
So…

262
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,739
you're saying those monsters
have nothing to do with God's will, right?

263
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,246
Do you really believe that nonsense?

264
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,123
Then what about the decree?

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,920
Those monsters call them by name,
claiming they're bound for Hell.

266
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,715
Well, we don't know
whether or not it's God's work.

267
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,177
The problem is that the New Truth
has the exclusive right

268
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,721
to dictate how this phenomenon
should be interpreted.

269
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,641
If all this is God's work,

270
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,894
and His will really is
what the New Truth says it is,

271
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,771
we have no choice but to deny God

272
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,398
because that means
He doesn't care for us humans.

273
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,949
This is just a disaster,
like an earthquake or an accident.

274
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,327
It's a misfortune that can befall anyone.

275
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,372
It's not about punishing
or being punished.

276
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,959
Your baby has no sin.

277
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,920
That's a fact nobody can deny.

278
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,666
Thanks for coming, Mr. Bae.

279
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,251
I'm Min Hyejin.

280
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,754
Please come in.

281
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,455
What kind of person leaves their engine
running in a parking lot?

282
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,048
Sujeong.

283
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,717
I'm home!

284
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,555
Sujeong!

285
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,227
What's all this, you fuckers?

286
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,286
Shut up!

287
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,081
He's not dead yet.

288
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,461
<i>Wake that asshole up!</i>

289
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,046
<i>Bring a chair.</i>

290
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,631
<i>Hey, wake up.</i>

291
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
Where did you get the information?

292
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,387
There's a member of the Arrowhead
who's a detective at Mapo Police Station.

293
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,723
He said some loan sharks
threatened Kang Junwon's wife

294
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,475
a few days before he disappeared.

295
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,104
What they did to collect the debt
was not necessarily illegal,

296
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,106
so they were let go after questioning.

297
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,360
It's obvious they did that to hide
Kang Junwon's demonstration.

298
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,321
He must be a family member of a sinner.

299
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,282
Yes, he's the son of sinner number 16.

300
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,535
His mother loaned money
to market vendors at high interest.

301
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,661
I mean…

302
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,164
I can't believe he still
hasn't come to his senses,

303
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,499
even after seeing his mother
damned to Hell.

304
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,754
We need to come up with a better program
to reform the children of sinners.

305
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,593
He's just a loan shark
and no one would care if he dies.

306
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,845
How pathetic.

307
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,557
We've confirmed the situation you are in.

308
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,060
The surveillance footage from
the hospital has been deleted as well.

309
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,687
Help yourself.

310
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,234
Even if the New Truth finds out,

311
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,528
they'll try to hide
your baby's demonstration

312
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,822
because it would not benefit
them in any way.

313
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,160
They could make it look like you
and your wife murdered the baby.

314
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:59,372
Or they might even try to hide
the fact that your baby was ever born.

315
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,753
There's no concept of original sin or
redemption in their doctrine. Therefore,

316
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,299
they'll never admit that a newborn baby
can be subjected to the demonstration.

317
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,010
You can never be sure, can you?

318
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,806
They can simply modify
their doctrine to fit their needs.

319
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,810
It may not seem like it,
but they have clear standards

320
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,562
on what they declare to be sins.

321
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,189
That's right.

322
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,443
Only acts that can be prevented
by human effort are considered sins.

323
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,238
As she said, there's no concept
of original sin and redemption.

324
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,365
They don't consider
lust or greed to be sins either.

325
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,410
If they cross that line, some find it hard
to understand and live by the doctrine.

326
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,411
Goodness.

327
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,998
A perfect world where no one commits
even the most trivial acts of evil.

328
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,043
By making that unrealistic goal
look achievable,

329
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,547
they're trying to make people keep an eye
on each other and condemn others.

330
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,967
The fear and catharsis the demonstrations
provide are what drives their system.

331
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,638
That's why they need sinners they can
make an example of on a regular basis.

332
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,349
They'd manipulate a case
that doesn't align with their doctrine,

333
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,977
and even come up with one
if there's no case that fits.

334
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,772
Have they ever concealed a case?

335
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,818
The one who started all this and vanished.

336
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,071
Where do you think
Chairman Jung Jinsu is right now?

337
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,908
I heard he's traveling the world.

338
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,867
He's dead.

339
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,831
He was subjected to the demonstration
somewhere four years ago.

340
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,500
He was subjected to the demonstration?

341
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,089
Are you saying he came up
with false doctrine

342
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,882
after receiving the decree himself?

343
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,135
-Why would he do that?
-Who knows?

344
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,055
Living for 20 years
knowing that your days are numbered

345
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,183
can make you do all sorts
of crazy things, don't you think?

346
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,563
Since he had those 20 years to live,

347
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,317
he was able to prepare
interpretations of this phenomenon.

348
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,528
Then let the world know.
What are you doing now?

349
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,657
Jung Jinsu warned people about this
for over ten years,

350
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,786
but people didn't listen to him
until they witnessed the demonstration

351
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,788
of Ms. Park Jungja with their own eyes.

352
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,045
In order to get people to listen to <i>us,</i>

353
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,340
we need a Ms. Park too.

354
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,509
What are you saying?

355
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,515
What are you trying to say right now?

356
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,770
We want to broadcast
your baby's demonstration live.

357
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,529
I should go.

358
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,157
Wait, Mr. Bae.

359
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,158
What?

360
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,954
An innocent newborn received the decree.

361
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,625
We have to show it to the people
so that we can take the world back.

362
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,418
Do I look like I care?

363
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,296
Do I? What does that have to do with me?

364
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,216
Do you think I asked for your help
to save the fucking world?

365
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:01,179
All I want is to protect my family,
all right?

366
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,391
You should fucking know better
when to blabber bullshit.

367
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,267
Why bring me here in this cold weather?

368
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,354
My baby is going to die!

369
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,566
My newborn baby received the decree!

370
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,403
Damn it…

371
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,281
How are you any different
from the New Truth?

372
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,202
You think this is your chance
to back up your nonsense? Huh?

373
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,498
You're only trying to use
my baby's death for your own benefit.

374
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,252
You're no different than those bastards!

375
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,920
Damn it.

376
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,970
We'll disguise your poor baby's death,
who was born into this shitty world,

377
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,264
as an accident, then.

378
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,350
We'll make sure that your baby
dies a meaningless death,

379
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,146
so you just carry on shooting
documentaries for the New Truth.

380
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,525
We'll do whatever you ask us to do.

381
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,861
Call us when you make up your mind.

382
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,742
Come on, let's go.

383
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,257
Listen.

384
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,636
Whenever you are ready to talk,
open your hands. Got it?

385
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,068
You really know
how to take blows, don't you?

386
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,739
Hold this.

387
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,993
Or should I play with your wife?

388
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,621
Please don't kill me.

389
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,583
Sujeong! No!

390
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,126
She's not a sinner.

391
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,254
She doesn't even know
what her husband does for a living.

392
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,131
Ignorance is a sin.

393
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,594
-Hey! Stop!
-Should I draw something on her face?

394
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,804
Hey!

395
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,892
It might hurt a lot.

396
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,770
Hey, he opened his hands.

397
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,523
You did the right thing. It's okay.

398
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,443
He gave us a name.

399
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,362
-A professor at Hankuk University.
-Yes.

400
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,489
-Ask them to track his location.
-Okay.

401
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,291
Ms. Min must be in a bad mood
because of today's live broadcast.

402
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,795
It's the first time
that we failed to protect

403
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,297
a person we got in touch with first.

404
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,926
Did you see the scar on her forehead?

405
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,138
She got that when she was attacked
by Kim Jeongchil and the Arrowhead.

406
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,266
She almost died,

407
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,143
but she was saved
by the sirens of a police car.

408
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,772
The Arrowhead punks
weren't as reckless as they are now,

409
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,109
<i>so she managed to survive. But…</i>

410
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,529
<i>she's angrier at herself than at them.</i>

411
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,700
<i>She regrets that she couldn't stop</i>
<i>the live broadcast of Ms. Park.</i>

412
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,621
<i>And that she failed to see</i>
<i>what Jung Jinsu was up to.</i>

413
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,415
<i>She blames herself.</i>

414
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,335
She feels responsible
for how the world turned out.

415
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,088
That's why she's so eager

416
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,300
to hold on to the opportunity
to make up for her mistakes.

417
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,721
She wants to atone for her mistakes.

418
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,975
I'll give you a ride.

419
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,768
No, thank you.

420
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,355
My daughter

421
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,274
received the decree too.

422
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,865
Out of the blue,
she said she wanted to see the ocean.

423
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,295
Wow. How did you find this place?

424
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,675
Is this where you used to come with Mom?

425
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,093
-Is it?
-What?

426
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,805
-It's a secret.
-Gong Yeonjae.

427
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:17,352
You are bound for Hell

428
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,689
in 30 seconds.

429
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,984
I'll never forget the look on her face

430
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,279
<i>during those 30 seconds.</i>

431
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,742
It seemed like she wanted me
to explain what was going on.

432
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,889
Dad.

433
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,433
Help me.

434
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,770
Yeonjae!

435
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,666
<i>Do you know</i>

436
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,587
<i>how I felt looking at her body</i>
<i>after it had been cruelly torn apart?</i>

437
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,634
I was relieved…

438
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,514
<i>that no one witnessed it.</i>

439
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,855
<i>That's how I felt in that horrific moment.</i>

440
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,150
<i>Mr. Bae…</i>

441
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,612
<i>would you say my daughter's death</i>
<i>was an accident or an act of judgment?</i>

442
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,286
I consider my daughter's death
a terrible accident.

443
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,789
I want to grieve this misfortune

444
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,794
as simply that…
a misfortune, nothing else.

445
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,715
I'm sorry

446
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,093
that such misfortune
has befallen your family.

447
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,348
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this first.

448
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,492
Come here.

449
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,328
What's wrong?

450
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,791
JUDGMENT

451
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,586
Hey.

452
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,087
It's him, right?

453
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,047
Is he dead?

454
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,091
Break the window.

455
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,558
Come out.

456
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,409
Youngjae.

457
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,164
You saw my mom at my dad's funeral, right?

458
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,503
You know, she cheated on my dad
and left me when I was five.

459
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,049
After he died,

460
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,802
I called her and waited for her to come.

461
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,349
You know what I imagined?

462
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,395
I thought she would hold my hand…

463
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,441
and tell me that she was sorry.

464
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,361
And that she missed me.

465
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,948
I thought she would cry
and beg for my forgiveness.

466
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,203
Then I would pretend
to resent her for a bit…

467
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,999
and cry my eyes out in her arms.

468
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,088
That's what I thought it'd be like.

469
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,132
But you know what she said?

470
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,053
She said she was so out of it

471
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,640
when she was divorcing my dad,

472
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,518
and she didn't get enough alimony.

473
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,440
She asked me how much Dad left for me.

474
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,820
She insisted on receiving her share.

475
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,366
She hadn't seen me for 30 years,

476
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,414
but she didn't even ask me how I had been.

477
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,835
Not all mothers are good mothers.

478
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,714
What's the point of resenting her now?

479
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,842
You're right.

480
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,555
But why does it have to be my mom?

481
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,309
Why does such a horrible person
have to be my mom?

482
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,688
I told myself every day
after I got pregnant

483
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,232
that I would be like

484
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,862
those loving mothers in TV dramas

485
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,365
because I'm different from my mom.

486
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:52,872
I wanted our baby
to grow up feeling loved.

487
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,043
I wanted our baby
to live an ordinary life.

488
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,050
But now,

489
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,138
I find that thing horrendous.

490
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,852
What kind of evil
resides in that little thing?

491
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,774
Why would it receive the decree
as soon as it is born?

492
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,740
Youngjae, I must be losing my mind.

493
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,580
I can't stop thinking about it.

494
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,458
And every time I do,

495
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,004
I can't help but resent myself.

496
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,552
Sohyun.

497
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,182
I met some people.

498
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,812
They said…

499
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,316
they'd like to broadcast
our baby's demonstration.

500
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,403
What?

501
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,614
Since our baby has no sin…

502
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,410
they said they can prove…

503
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,291
that the New Truth is lying
if they broadcast the demonstration.

504
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,005
That's what they suggested.

505
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,843
What if we don't agree to it?

506
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,138
They'll disguise
our baby's death as an accident.

507
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,224
It's our choice to make.

508
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,489
It's okay. We have a lot of time.

509
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,620
I'm sure you'll tell us
everything eventually.

510
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,542
Hey, that bastard's awake.

511
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,004
You, check up on him.

512
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,507
Professor!

513
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,968
You bastards.

514
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,304
You're finally up, Professor Gong.

515
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,264
You fanatical bastards.

516
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,349
Fine.

517
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,018
Go ahead.

518
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,769
Go ahead!

519
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:26,984
We're not going to ask you anything,
so don't get your hopes up.

520
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,696
We're getting enough information from him.

521
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,952
Hyeongjun.

522
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:37,995
Geunbae.

523
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,540
You fucking bastards.

524
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,919
He knows nothing. Nothing!

525
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,504
Just ask me the questions.

526
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,631
Shut the hell up!

527
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,551
You don't need to say a word.

528

What we need…

529
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,391
is this guy

530
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,519
and your car.

531
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,313
We just need the records
from your navigation system

532
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,440
that show us where you've been.

533
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,275
What?

534
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,737
Hold on. Wait a second.

535
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,489
Execute him.

536
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,242
Wait. Hold on!

537
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,118
-What are you doing?
-Untie me, bastards!

538
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,954
Untie me! Now!

539
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,247
Hey, listen to me.

540
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,831
Come on!

541
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,876
You can kill me,
so just hear me out for a second.

542
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,794
No! Fuck!

543
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,878

I don't care if I die,
but hear me out for a second!

550
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,142
Hear me out.

551
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,227
-Hey!
-Hyeongjun!

552
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,355
-You idiots! Hear me out!
-Goodbye. Close it.

553
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,898
Let Geunbae go!

554
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,358

563
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,075
Run!

Damn it!

567

-Over here! She's going upstairs!
-Run!

568
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,270
-The stairs are here.
-Hurry!

Where?

573
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,236
This way, you idiot!

574
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,950
What incompetent people.

575
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,246
Those idiots.

576
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,832
I told you she went this way!

Damn.

583

Get up. Get on your feet, now!

584
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,501
Nice to meet you, Ms. Min Hyejin.

-What?
-What happened?

588
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,061
Go after her.

<i>He disguised God's demonstrations</i>
