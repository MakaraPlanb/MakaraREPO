1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512
<i>The VIPs are here.</i>

2
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,596
Don't push.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,015
Back off.

4
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,364
Are you all right?

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,324
Yes.

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,953
All right, it is time.

7
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,040
Everyone except the subject, please leave.

8
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,585
Officers, you should wait outside too.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,097
Hey. Make the warning announcement.

10
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,144
<i>Please start the announcement.</i>

11
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,230
GOD HAS ABANDONED YOU

12
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,567
<i>The demonstration of damnation</i>
<i>will start soon.</i>

13
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,404
<i>Park Jungja,</i>
<i>the subject of the demonstration,</i>

14
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>received a decree of damnation</i>
<i>around 10:00 p.m. four days ago.</i>

15
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,705
<i>The demonstration</i>
<i>is a form of divine intervention</i>

16
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,250
that publicly shows the eternal pain
the subject is to suffer in Hell.

17
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:31,341
This is God's will to teach humanity
the weight of sin.

18
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,010
<i>All of you who are watching this</i>

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>must shed your arrogance and stubbornness</i>

20
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,435
and witness the divine intervention
with penitence.

21
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,697
COUNTDOWN FOR DEMONSTRATION
OF PARK JUNGJA TO BEGIN SHORTLY

22
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,040
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

23
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,045
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

24
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,382
<i>four, three,</i>

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,593
<i>two, one.</i>

26
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,516
{\an8}DAMNATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,830
DO NOT HAVE MERCY ON THE DEVIL
GOD'S JUDGMENT DAY HAS ARRIVED

28
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,636
How is this possible?

29
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,888
Open fire! Everyone, fire!

30
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,224
Fire, you dipshits! Open fire!

31
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,978
YOU SHALL HAVE NO REST IN HELL

32
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>Open fire!</i>

33
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,275
Come on! Open fire!

34
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,169
Please help me.

35
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,896
Oh, fuck!

36
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,978
GOD HAS ABANDONED YOU

37
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,524
Excuse me!

38
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,197
Eunpyo!

39
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,829
<i>Your call cannot be connected…</i>

40
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:10,383
SEOBUK POLICE STATION

41
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,542
<i>A horrifying incident</i>
<i>took place yesterday.</i>

42
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,796
<i>Many of you witnessed</i>
<i>the unbelievable moment live.</i>

43
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,634
<i>I'm sure everyone is waiting</i>
<i>to hear from one man.</i>

44
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,430
<i>He has become the most important person</i>
<i>in Korea overnight.</i>

45
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,223
{\an8}<i>It turns out,</i>

46
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,060
{\an8}<i>we had previously reported on him</i>
<i>multiple times.</i>

47
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,272
I'm sure many of you
remember this incident.

48
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,942
{\an8}<i>A man passing by the scene of a fire</i>

49
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,111
{\an8}<i>ran into the burning building</i>

50
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,739
{\an8}<i>and saved a four-year-old child</i>
<i>and her mother.</i>

51
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>I'm sure all of you remember this.</i>

52
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,992
<i>This is that man.</i>

53
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,580
{\an8}<i>An unarmed man approached someone</i>
<i>threatening people with a weapon</i>

54
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,416
{\an8}<i>and convinced him to put the weapon down.</i>

55
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,418
{\an8}<i>This incident surprised many people.</i>

56
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,131
{\an8}<i>Would you believe me if I told you</i>
<i>that the hero of all these stories</i>

57
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,507
{\an8}<i>is the same person?</i>

58
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:39,639
Moreover, he's been warning us
about the recent incidents

59
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,474
for over ten years.

60
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,061
Shame on us
for not taking heed of his warning.

61
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,521
In today's special,

62
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,776
{\an8}we bring you an exclusive interview with
Chairman Jung Jinsu of the New Truth.

63
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,820
Hello, Chairman Jung.

64
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,365
<i>Hello, nice to meet you.</i>

65
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,658
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

66
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,869
Many people are lost and confused
and dropping their daily lives

67
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,829
after witnessing yesterday's incident.

68
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,915
We are in desperate need of your advice.

69
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,253
<i>I am sure everyone needs some time</i>
<i>to ponder on God's message.</i>

70
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,382
I think it's only natural for people
to react this way.

71
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,424
However…

72
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,387
doing nothing out of fear of sinning

73
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,306
<i>cannot be the solution.</i>

74
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:28,479
<i>Everyone must return to their lives</i>
<i>and try their best to perform good deeds.</i>

75
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,315
<i>Recently, three people</i>
<i>were subjected to the demonstration,</i>

76
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,151
<i>but we are only clear on the sins of Kim,</i>
<i>an ex-con convicted of murder.</i>

77
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,072
<i>The sins of the other two subjects,</i>
<i>Joo and Park, are not yet known.</i>

78
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,908
<i>What could their sins be?</i>

79
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:45,371
<i>The New Truth</i>
<i>is doing its best to find out,</i>

80
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,791
<i>but there is a limit to the information</i>

81
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,085
<i>a non-governmental organization</i>
<i>can access.</i>

82
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,586
<i>As for Park Jungja's case,</i>

83
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,423
<i>key witnesses</i>
<i>have already fled the country,</i>

84
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,843
<i>and the identities of the police officer</i>
<i>and lawyers who helped them</i>

85
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,177
<i>have been confirmed.</i>

86
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,891
I urge everyone who is watching this

87
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,353
<i>and all government authorities,</i>
<i>including the police and prosecution,</i>

88
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,647
<i>to take immediate action,</i>

89
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>considering the circumstances.</i>

90
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,405
<i>I think it's safe to assume</i>
<i>that we are all curious</i>

91
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,906
about the same things.

92
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,952
Why do you think this kind of incident
is suddenly occurring so frequently?

93
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:30,166
<i>God has been sending His message</i>
<i>in supernatural ways</i>

94
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,835
throughout all of human history.

95
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,423
<i>Therefore, the question</i>
<i>shouldn't be "Why now?"</i>

96
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,093
"Why have we not taken heed of it?"

97
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,765
That is what we should be asking.

98
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:52,062
<i>I've been telling you this repeatedly</i>
<i>for over ten years.</i>

99
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,690
<i>The fact that we are having</i>
<i>this interview only now</i>

100
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,612
<i>clearly shows how ignorant</i>
<i>we have been towards God's will.</i>

101
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,031
<i>I think that is why</i>

102
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,366
God has come up with a way

103
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:10,289
to convey His message
in a clearer and more direct manner.

104
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,168
{\an8}CHAIRMAN JUNG OF THE NEW TRUTH
REGARDING GOD'S MESSAGE

105
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:20,966
<i>So that…</i>

106
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,679
<i>you can clearly see it.</i>

107
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,349
That son of a bitch.

108
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,728
<i>According to the New Truth,</i>

109
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,066
God is telling us to live by performing
justice through His message.

110
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,860
{\an8}That message may seem
a bit too obvious and conceptual--

111
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,403
That obvious truth

112
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:47,034
has never been upheld
since the beginning of humanity<i>.</i>

113
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,371
And that's what makes God discontented.

114
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,917
I'm sorry.

115
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,675
<i>The New Truth has studied 132 cases</i>
<i>of decrees and demonstrations,</i>

116
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,011
<i>and compiled a record of analyses</i>
<i>on the subjects' sins.</i>

117
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,932
<i>You can find it on our website.</i>

118
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,685
<i>Once you take a look at it,</i>

119
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>you will be able to clearly understand</i>
<i>what God wants from us</i>

120
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,192
<i>and what God forbids us from doing.</i>

121
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,822
{\an8}I spent all night
reading that document thoroughly.

122
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:29,326
{\an8}I think it could be considered
the Bible of the new era.

123
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,120
{\an8}But it's not easy for ordinary people

124
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,583
to discern justice from injustice
in their daily lives.

125
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,585
-If everyone can be like you--
-<i>No!</i>

126
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,669
We humans

127
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,131
are always capable
of discerning right from wrong.

128
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,466
God has given us that ability.

129
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,889
<i>We just have a hard time</i>
<i>resisting temptation</i>

130
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,559
<i>when we have to choose</i>
<i>between good and evil.</i>

131
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,019
{\an8}<i>Having the right to choose…</i>

132
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,647
{\an8}<i>It may sound great,</i>
<i>but it is a punishment in disguise.</i>

133
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,275
Now…

134
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,987
we no longer have the right
to neglect evil.

135
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,825
We are now obligated
to live by performing good deeds.

136
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,620
That's what we humans must do
in the new era.

137
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,290
I see. I'd love to hear more,

138
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,793
{\an8}but that's all the time we have for today.

139
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,922
{\an8}I hope we can have this kind of discussion
more often in the future.

140
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,966
I'm sorry,

141
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,847
but I fulfilled my duty as His servant
by letting the world know of His will.

142
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:36,936
<i>I plan to look for God's traces</i>
<i>until He calls me again.</i>

143
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,816
<i>I would like to welcome you all…</i>

144
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,279
<i>to the new world.</i>

145
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,409
Have you all seen it?

146
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,161
We don't deserve His love.

147
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,455
How can He love us so unconditionally?

148
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,671
Chairman Jung Jinsu,

149
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,549
{\an8}now is not the time to act cool
as if everything is over!

150
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,718
God has given us a chance,

151
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,179
and it is our duty to respond to it!

152
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,555
All of you,

153
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,891
don't get too excited.

154
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,228
It will lead us nowhere!
Rage is what drives us!

155
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,982
People act like they surrender to God

156
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,317
after witnessing
yesterday's demonstration.

157
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,986
But it'll soon be forgotten

158
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:31,448
and those bastard scholars, writers,
and lawyers will start to blabber again.

159
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,035
And the world will return to how it was
in the past. Do you understand?

160
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,914
You should never underestimate
the resiliency of human stupidity!

161
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,375
Look at them!

162
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,376
Look!

163
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,545
Everyone's bowing before God,

164
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,674
but look how these bastards are
standing there with their heads held high!

165
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,676
{\an8}Don't they look familiar?

166
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,973
{\an8}They are the assholes who have been
interfering with our work all along!

167
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,224
{\an8}Those shitheads.

168
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,188
Jin Kyunghun, you crazy bastard!

169
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,566
Who do you think
you're firing your gun at?

170
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,319
As long as people like them exist,
we can never rest.

171
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,196

Oh… Hold on.

354
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,824
I think I still have the recording.

355
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:37,121
Jung Jinsu…

356
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,164
Where is it?

357
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,374
2004 JUNG JINSU INTERVIEW

358
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,126
-Here it is. Shall I play it?
-Yes, please.

359
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,044
Okay.

360
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,756
<i>Hello.</i>

361
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,009
<i>Hello, my name is Jung Jinsu.</i>

362
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:50,927
<i>I see.</i>

363
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,514
{\an8}<i>Did you say you received</i>
<i>a prophecy from God?</i>

364
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,559
<i>Well, I don't know if it was God,</i>

365
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,770
<i>but it was something fearsome.</i>

366
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,870
Heejung.

367
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,833
Heejung!

368
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,071
Jung Jinsu!

369
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,657
Don't move, you bastard.

370
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,954
Hello.

371
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,873
Please calm down.

372
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,583
Where is Heejung?

373
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,545
I will tell you where she is

374
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,591
after I finish telling my story.

375
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,221
I received a prophecy 20 years ago.

376
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,726
What?

377
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,029
-Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

378
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,656
Guys, it's almost time to eat.
Where are you going?

379
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,991
We'll be back soon.

380
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,202
-Wait for us!
-Come back soon.

381
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,536
It's my turn to go first.

382
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,798
It was right over there.

383
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,635
That's where I saw an angel
for the first time.

384
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:03,810
An angel appeared to me and said this.

385
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,984
{\an8}<i>"You will die 20 years from now</i>
<i>at 10:30 p.m."</i>

386
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,364
<i>"You are bound for Hell."</i>

387
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:23,704
At first, I was startled
and thought I was dreaming.

388
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,790
I was confused.

389
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,418
It was…

390
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,172
You wouldn't know because
you've never experienced it,

391
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,926
but the memory of it
became more vivid as time went by.

392
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,184
So I eagerly hunted for similar cases.

393
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,526
At first,

394
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,363
I hoped that it wasn't real.

395
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,408
Then…

396
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,994
I hoped to find just one exception.

397
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,416
Pastor, can I get a copy
of this recording?

398
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,797
RECYCLE BIN

399
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,717
DO YOU WANT TO
PERMANENTLY DELETE THIS FILE?

400
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,013
I'm afraid you can't.

401
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,973
I just deleted the file.

402
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,766
What?

403
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,479
Chairman Jung came to see me
a few days ago.

404
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:38,404
Do you know when he is bound for Hell
according to the prophecy?

405
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,700
The prophecy will be fulfilled

406
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,454
ten minutes from now.

407
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,749
Why did you use my daughter?

408
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,212
What do you think my sin is?

409
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,173
Why did you get my daughter involved?!

410
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,053
Please listen to me
until I finish my story, Detective.

411
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,139
We don't have time for this.

412
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,557
Your sin?

413
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,101
I bet there isn't one.

414
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,813
Or maybe something as petty
as stealing a pencil or two.

415
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,731
Why?

416
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,276
How can I not have sinned
when I am bound for Hell?

417
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,154
You didn't grill Park Jungja
about her sins.

418
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,407
You would've if you were sure
only sinners are bound for Hell.

419
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,621
No wonder you're a detective.

420
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,541
But you know,

421
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,505
I've never stolen anything in my life.

422
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,092
I've never lied

423
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,220
or hurt anyone's feelings.

424
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,890
I've done nothing wrong.

425
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,689
<i>I believed…</i>

426
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,278
<i>that my mother would come back for me</i>

427
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,200
if I behaved myself and never cried.

428
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,794
Why would God do such a strange thing?

429
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:23,551
I've spent over ten years of my life
trying to find an answer.

430
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,262
But I couldn't find it.

431
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,144
If there is no legitimate reason
behind this strange phenomenon,

432
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,315
would people be able to accept it?

433
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:46,073
I think they will start
rioting and panicking.

434
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,161
There has to be a reason.

435
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,538
They need to believe

436
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,042
that this phenomenon occurs
to make the world a better place.

437
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,503
They need to believe that it occurs

438
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,380
so that justice can be served.

439
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,010
That is why…

440
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,805
I had to make it look like

441
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,975
only the undeniably evil
are bound for Hell.

442
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,814
I didn't need to get your daughter
involved though.

443
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,276
I could have done it myself.

444
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,694
Then why?!

445
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,864
Why did you use her?

446
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,994
Because I was impressed by what you said.

447
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,956
You said yourself

448
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,627
that humans should have free will.

449
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,797
What?

450
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,715
According to you,

451
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,177
this God must not believe
in humankind's free will.

452
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,808
<i>So?</i>

453
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,396
So you exploited Heejung's free will?

454
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,648
No.

455
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:09,198
I'm going to leave the world
to your free will.

456
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,951
What are you talking about?

457
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,828
Listen.

458
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,040
I have been…

459
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,504
living in constant fear…

460
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,716
since the day I received the prophecy.

461
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,432
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to live in fear for 20 years?

462
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,019
The fear is relentless.

463
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,609
The fear of committing a sin,

464
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,738
the fear of the possibility
that I keep quiet about others' sins,

465
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,657
the fear of eternal pain…

466
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,659
Those fears have haunted me

467
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,079
for 20 years.

468
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,799
But thanks to that,

469
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,514
I was able to live by behaving properly.

470
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,978
I don't know why God is doing this,

471
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,150
but I want every person in this world
to feel the same fear as mine.

472
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,944
Eventually…

473
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,951
that fear will make the world
more righteous.

474
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,078
It's the fear

475
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,165
that will

476
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,418
set people free from sin.

477
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,594
Chairman Jung came to me
with an intriguing offer.

478
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,599
In return for me keeping quiet
about the prophecy he received,

479
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:03,938
he promised that he would make me
the chairman of the New Truth,

480
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,692
which will be the most influential
religious organization in the world.

481
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,529
But what's interesting is…

482
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,240
he asked me to earn his trust

483
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,536
by killing you.

484
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,501
Unfortunately,

485
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,878
I'm the type who couldn't even harm a fly.

486
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,398
Where are you going?

487
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,501
I'll be a completely different chairman
from Chairman Jung.

488
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,671
I will be a more powerful one.

489
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,717
Anyway, it was nice meeting you, Ms. Min.

490
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:16,969
Goodbye.

491
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,738
We don't have much time.

492
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,500
Your daughter is…

493
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,131
waiting for you at your house.

494
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,217
I'll give you two options.

495
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,389
Those creatures will come and kill me now.

496
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,143
If you film that and show it to the world,

497
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,606
people will panic.

498
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,026
Then you can go straight home…

499
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:28,666
and arrest your own daughter
for murdering your enemy.

500
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,002
If you do that,

501
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,965
the world will remain orderly and just,
the way you believe it should be.

502
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,514
If that's not what you want,

503
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,728
just keep your damn mouth shut
about my death until the day you die.

504
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,317
And enjoy the world I created
for you with Heejung.

505
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,610
Be free in it.

506
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,715
They're here.

507
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,222
I'll leave the world in your hands.

508
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,354
If you choose to keep quiet,

509
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,191
please get rid of my corpse.

510
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,240
Stop.

511
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,159
Stop!

512
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,394
Those New Truth freaks.
