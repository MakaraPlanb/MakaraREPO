1
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,934
They said they'd like to broadcast it.
You know, the demonstration.

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,394
Pardon?

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,939
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,149
What did they say again?

5
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,775
They said they'd pay me.

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,902
They'd like to do a live broadcast

7
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,114
of the moment I go to Hell.

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,034
Those crazy freaks!

9
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,541
So what did you say to them?

10
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,877
Well…

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,047
that young chairman said

12
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,258
he'd pay me three billion won
if I agreed to it.

13
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,342
The thing is,

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,638
I don't know how I can safely receive
such a huge amount of money.

15
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,266
Ms. Min,

16
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,104
I don't know if that decree thing
is real or not,

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,856
but I really need your help

18
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,357
so that I can receive…

19
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,571
I mean, so that my kids
can receive that money.

20
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:20,121
I understand, ma'am, but you
shouldn't rush into accepting the offer.

21
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,125
Agreeing to the broadcast
can expose the identities

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,170
of not only yourself,
but also of your whole family, and--

23
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,797
What if it's real?

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,718
How are my children going to live
if I really die a few days later?

25
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,430
My son did a lot of research

26
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,100
and suggested I come see you
because you'd handle it best,

27
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,352
but I'll find someone else
if you can't help me.

28
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,856
No, you've come to the right person.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,818
Whatever the New Truth
bastards are scheming,

30
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,654
it's better to let them do it
in plain sight.

31
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,738
Don't worry.

32
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,368
Mr. Park,
can I see you outside for a minute?

33
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,206
Excuse us, ma'am.

34
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,878
What's wrong?

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,049
Are you really going to let her
go on the live broadcast?

36
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,971
Do you seriously think those monsters
will come and get her five days from now?

37
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,390
I don't think it will ever happen.

38
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,603
This is a great opportunity to show
that the New Truth is a total fraud.

39
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,857
Moreover, Ms. Park has nothing to lose.

40
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,944
They'll only embarrass themselves
and hand over three billion won.

41
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,574
What if they really do show up?

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,995
No matter what…

43
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,124
it's better for her to receive that money.

44
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,419
It sounds like the kids
will be on their own.

45
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,466
Let's report it to the police.

46
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:01,764
I'll try and come up with a way
to keep her children out of this.

47
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,600
I'll tell her we'll take the case.

48
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,442
We've come to an agreement.

49
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,569
I can't even imagine
how you feel right now.

50
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,739
We'll help you. Don't worry.

51
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,908
Thank you.

52
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,535
She never listens to me.

53
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,506
My goodness! I can't believe you!

54
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,633
Mom, are you out of your mind?

55
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,177
Did you forget that you have cancer?

56
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
You said you quit!

57
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,348
That was when I was healthy.

58
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,352
If anyone complains, tell them you're
burning incense sticks for my altar.

59
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,647
What kind of sick joke is that?

60
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,109
Why are you so cranky today?

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,822
Is that novelist in serious condition?

62
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,156
Not really.

63
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,662
I feel like the world
I used to know is falling apart.

64
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,915
What do you mean?

65
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,085
It's just that a lot of strange things
have been happening lately.

66
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,170
Like what?

67
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,425
Well…

68
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,554
they say something strange appears

69
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,850
and prophesizes your death.

70
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,229
Then it takes you to Hell
on the prophesized date.

71
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,029
I've seen that "something strange"
you're talking about.

72
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,698
What?

73
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,952
I saw it on the day
I was diagnosed with cancer.

74
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,954
It was my doctor.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,084
Mom.

76
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,046
Aren't you scared?

77
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:45,136
Everyone dies at some point.

78
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:51,309
I'm just glad that I can die
without losing myself.

79
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,728
It's a relief.

80
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,149
The fact that I am looking
at my daughter's face right now…

81
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,777
is also a relief.

82
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,346
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

83
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,225
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mom</i>

84
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,395
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

85
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,358
<i>Mom, look.</i>

86
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:47,615
<i>Park Jungja.</i>
<i>You will die five days from now</i>,

87
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,493
<i>at 3:00 p.m.</i>

88
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,705
-Hello?
-Hello?

89
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,834
-You have the wrong number.
-Then, file a petition first.

90
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,002
-Is that the forensic report?
-Yes.

91
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,588
That's not our jurisdiction.

92
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,674
-We don't know either.
-Hey, just hang up.

93
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,175
What?

94
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,844
The Arrowhead?

95
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,179
I mean…

96
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,766
Even if they are minors,
they were caught in the act,

97
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,476
and their addresses are unknown.

98
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,438
By the way, how did you get this number?

99
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,899
This is considered obstruction of justice!

100
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,069
When did I ever threaten you?

101
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,237
Hello?

102
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,324
How did they even get my personal number?

103
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,493
Everyone turn off your phones.

104
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,578
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

105
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,330
-Is that the report? Give it to me.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:41,961
What is this?

107
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,713
It's not organic matter?

108
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,716
Apparently, the burnt body
we thought was the victim

109
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,926
is not of a living organism.

110
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,888
It's something
that doesn't exist in this world.

111
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,306
What nonsense is that?

112
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,892
Then what the hell is it supposed to be?

113
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,311
A man died in broad daylight,

114
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,898
and there were dozens of witnesses.
How can it not be a living organism?

115
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,815
Then what is it?

116
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,735
You all saw it yourselves.
You saw the victim running for his life.

117
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,988
How am I supposed to report this
to my superior?

118
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,827
LAWYER MIN HYEJIN

119
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,038
-Hello?
-Hey, Kyunghun!

120
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,749
Yes.

121
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,459
What?

122
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,045
Chairman Jung.

123
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,672
This neighborhood isn't that expensive.

124
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,342
It won't be difficult
to get the landlords to agree to it.

125
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,887
Since we're here,
why don't we get consent from them today?

126
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,098
-How does that sound?
-Sounds good. No one will refuse it.

127
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,893
Chairman Jung, nice to see you again.

128
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:41,979
Hello.

129
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,941
I guess you got a call from the lawyers.

130
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,110
A death threat has been made,
so the police should be on it.

131
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,405
Is there any reason
we should stay out of it?

132
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,616
Of course not.

133
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,661
It's better to get more people involved.

134
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,454
But…

135
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,874
I didn't know the New Truth
had so much money.

136
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,129
We have very diverse members.

137
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,466
And some of them
have amassed great wealth.

138
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,678
But did you say "death threat"?

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,641
We see these cases
as one of those pre-announced murders.

140
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,897
Detectives who are after God's decree…

141
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,526
Sounds mythological.

142
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,778
Detective.

143
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,574
In the ancient world,

144
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,411
people believed that solar eclipses
were a sign of God's wrath.

145
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,333
They thought a heavenly dog
took a bite of the sun.

146
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:51,716
That's why they sent hunters
on a mission to catch that dog.

147
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,594
That's interesting.

148
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,014
Detectives.

149
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,434
Don't you think

150
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,811
you are like those hunters?

151
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,523
Isn't it better to be a hunter

152
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,571
rather than a priest who persecutes
the innocent using God as an excuse?

153
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,574
You must be Ms. Min Hyejin.

154
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,994
Let's go in. We have a lot to go over.

155
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,246
Please arrange a meeting
with the landlords.

156
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,289
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,125
Do you have all the documents ready?

158
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,084
Yes.

159
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,253
Let's hurry back to the office and call…

160
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,546
-Hello.
-Hello.

161
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,926
After you.

162
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,595
Thank you.

163
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,821
I'm sorry. This is all I have to offer.

164
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,240
-Don't be. This is more than enough.
-Here you go.

165
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,493
Are the kids at school?

166
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,829
I told them to stay in their room.

167
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,832
I was wondering if we could meet them.

168
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,750
Why?

169
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,252
Never mind.
It's better that they stay home.

170
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,004
-Thank you for this.
-Enjoy.

171
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,219
We should talk to the kids
since they are witnesses.

172
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,970
We have the footage on the phone.

173
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,515
-Leave the kids out of it.
-Please have some.

174
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,060
Thank you.

175
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,233
What are you doing, Eunyul?

176
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,319
Mom told you to help me color this.

177
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,779
Be quiet.

178
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,489
Is all the information correct?

179
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,282
Let me remind you

180
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,910
that the identities of the children
must not be exposed.

181
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,746
Same goes for Ms. Park
until the day of the live broadcast.

182
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,581
We wouldn't stoop that low.

183
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,876
You don't need to worry about that.

184
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,549
Even if the broadcast gets canceled,
you still need to pay her the rest.

185
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,885
Can we get a discount
if the broadcast gets canceled?

186
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,225
It's already been settled in writing.

187
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,894
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm not used to this kind of meeting,

189
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,359
so I made a joke to break the ice.

190
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,945
We'll agree to any conditions

191
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:22,032
as long as Ms. Park
will be here on the day.

192
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,744
-Okay.
-I'm not well versed in law.

193
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,705
Our head of legal will take care of it.

194
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,706
Will do, sir.

195
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,751
-We've looked over everything.
-Okay.

196
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,969
How old are your children?

197
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,223
They are 13 and 6.

198
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,018
I see. The age gap is quite big.

199
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:55,149
-I guess he must be the one who filmed it.
-Yes.

200
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,317
Is he not home?

201
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,111
I told him to stay in his room
with his sister.

202
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,781
Chairman Jung, the money has been wired.

203
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,115
Please check the account.

204
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,497
Here. Please check the account number
and the amount.

205
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,167
They are correct.

206
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,424
It would be nice if I could meet the kids.

207
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,262
But I don't see the father
in any of the pictures.

208
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,517
They don't have a father.

209
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,354
How can they not have a father?
How is that possible?

210
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,816
I'm a single mother.

211
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,818
The kids don't have the same father, so…

212
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,154
Ma'am, you don't need to answer
all his questions.

213
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,781
-Especially something like that.
-Okay.

214
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,366
I'm curious to know

215
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,994
how you ended up giving birth…

216
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,375
to not just one,
but two kids without fathers.

217
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,382
I wonder what their fathers were like.

218
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,972
Could they have been married men?

219
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,057
Excuse me.

220
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,185
Why are you curious about that?

221
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,980
Because I have to know the reason.

222
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,607
What reason are you talking about?

223
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,609
Isn't it obvious?

224
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,658
The reason Ms. Park
is bound for Hell.

225
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,451
What?

226
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,037
Is this how you work?

227
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,000
What did my mom do wrong?

228
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,334
Eunyul, go back to your room.

229
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,003
What did she do to deserve to go to Hell?

230
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,671
-You don't even know my mom.
-Calm down.

231
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,216
If you do, then figure out and tell us
what she did to deserve to go to Hell.

232
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,593
Go inside with your sister.

233
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,304
No! You did nothing wrong!

234
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,681
Go back to your room!

235
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,560
Can't you see the adults are talking?

236
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,228
Behave yourself!

237
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,480
Stay here with your sister.

238
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,784
Chairman Jung,

239
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,622
you can say whatever my sin is.

240
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,124
All I want

241
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,211
is to secure a better future
for my children.

242
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,258
Ms. Min, we are all good
with the contract, right?

243
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,929
It's the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

244
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,100
I've never been able
to provide much for my kids.

245
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,395
This is a great opportunity for me.

246
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:45,027
Please help my kids settle down
somewhere where no one will find them.

247
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,490
I beg you.

248
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,052
Chairman Jung.

249
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,680
The meeting with the landlords
has been arranged.

250
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,473
-Okay.
-Let's head there now.

251
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,642
Ms. Min.

252
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,020
About the priest you mentioned earlier…

253
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,857
Don't you think a priest is supposed
to endow people's lives with meaning?

254
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,821
Humans are doomed to destroy themselves
when they can't find meaning.

255
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,701
A new world is coming soon.

256
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,911
I'll see you there.

257
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,130
That crazy bastard.

258
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,800
Does he seriously believe
something's going to happen?

259
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,304
Not a single channel
will agree to broadcast this nonsense.

260
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,141
Only those Arrowhead freaks
will watch it online,

261
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,934
praying for something to happen.

262
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,896
Well, what do you plan
to do with the kids?

263
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,483
I'm going to send them
to my cousin in Canada in two days.

264
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,236
-Okay.
-They can come back if nothing happens.

265
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,989
Or Ms. Park can follow them there.

266
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,158
Why would they move to Canada?

267
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,951
The broadcast will get canceled,

268
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,454
and all the hype the Arrowhead
built up will be gone.

269
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,291
Ms. Park is right. Of course, she's
fortunate to receive that much money.

270
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,292
Don't you think?

271
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,596
It's a huge surprise!

272
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,432
A special announcement from the New Truth!

273
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,226
The New Truth is finally doing their job.

274
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,191
There is someone who received
a decree to go to Hell here in Korea.

275
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,235
{\an8}What's more surprising

276
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:55,449
{\an8}is that they will broadcast
the demonstration live!

277
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,661
Remember what we had to go through?

278
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,331
Just because we were enlightened,

279
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,751
we have been misunderstood,
despised, and insulted.

280
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,336
<i>But now…</i>

281
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,755
<i>in two days,</i>

282
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,843
<i>the whole world</i>
<i>will start listening to us.</i>

283
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,181
<i>We've endured pain and hardship,</i>
<i>and now it's paying off!</i>

284
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,350
-<i>Rejoice, everyone!</i>
-He looks like you.

285
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,020
I'm so happy! I can't wait!

286
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,690
But why isn't the New Truth
disclosing who the sinner is

287
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,862
and what the sinner did
to deserve to go to Hell?

288
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,418
{\an8}CONFORMIST38 HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

289
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,884
{\an8}CONFORMIST38: RECIPIENT PARK JUNGJA,
SON PARK EUNYUL, DAUGHTER PARK HAYUL

290
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,886
{\an8}SINGLE MOTHER,
DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL FATHERS

291
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,099
{\an8}Conformist38!

292
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,642
{\an8}Who the fuck are you?

293
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,269
<i>You blessed bastard!</i>

294
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,312
<i>This information is sick!</i>

295
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,233
<i>The Arrowhead!</i>

296
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,611
-The Arrowhead! The Arrowhead!
-<i>It's a woman called Park Jungja!</i>

297
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,572
The Arrowhead!

298
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,992
The Arrowhead!

299
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,217
Heejung.

300
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,763
Heejung.

301
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,852
Damn. Where is she?

302
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,026
<i>Hello?</i>

303
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,861
Hey.

304
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,696
Where are you at this hour?

305
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,739
<i>Well…</i>

306
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,616
<i>I'm at my friend's.</i>

307
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,036
We're pulling an all-nighter for a test.
I'll go to school from here.

308
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,871
Is that okay?

309
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,748
What friend?

310
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,625
<i>A friend you don't know.</i>

311
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,044
Why? Should I come home?

312
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,546
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

313
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,883
Don't stay up all night.

314
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,760
Make sure you get some sleep.

315
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,222
Dad.

316
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,681
<i>Yes?</i>

317
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,559
Thank you.

318
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,271
Oh, okay.

319
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,190
All right, then.

320
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,001
<i>Was that your father?</i>

321
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
Yes.

322
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,798
I saw your father earlier today.

323
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,800
Thank you.

324
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,723
Thank you, Heejung,

325
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,685
for making up your mind.

326
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,398
I made up my mind six years ago.

327
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,110
My mom…

328
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,990
She died because of me.

329
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,533
Sorry?

330
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,619
That day…

331
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,250
she asked me to stop by my dad's work
to bring him a change of clothes.

332
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,262
So cute.

333
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,108
I'm home.

334
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,109
You're back.

335
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,863
What's that in your hand?

336
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,118
I forgot.

337
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,370
I'll go there now.

338
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,414
It's okay. Wash up and do your homework.

339
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,041
I'll bring it to him.

340
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,917
I'll go. I can do it.

341
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,128
No, thank you. Give it to me.

342
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,173
I made some juice for you.
It's in the fridge.

343
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,257
But…

344
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,474
<i>If I…</i>

345
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,394
If I had just remembered…

346
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,732
If I had gone straight to my dad

347
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,902
without getting distracted, my mom…

348
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,365
<i>that bastard wouldn't have…</i>

349
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,623
It was all my fault.

350
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,217
You did nothing wrong, Heejung.

351
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,346
The real sinner is out there.

352
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,975
I'm sure that you and your father
know more than anyone

353
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,314
how powerless man-made laws are.

354
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,653
What we are going to do today<i>…</i>

355
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,282
will create a world

356
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,494
where nobody sins.

357
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,295
LAWYER MIN HYEJIN:
DID YOU SEE THE INTERNET?

358
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,466
TRENDING: PARK JUNGJA'S
DECREE CLIP, PARK JUNGJA'S SON,

359
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,385
THE NEW TRUTH LIVESTREAM,
PARK JUNGJA LIVESTREAM

360
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,470
Damn it.

361
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,979
We shouldn't have trusted them.

362
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm on my way to Ms. Park's
to get the kids out of there first.

363
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,154
I booked a flight for them.
I'm sending them to Canada right away.

364
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,823
I'll meet you at the airport then. Okay.

365
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,799
CALLING
HONG EUNPYO

366
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,926
-<i>Hi, Kyunghun.</i>
-Hey, Eunpyo.

367
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,720
Park Jungja's identity got leaked.

368
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,138
Bring others with you

369
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,891
and apprehend anyone
who's lingering around her place.

370
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,808
<i>What about you?</i>

371
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,644
The kids are leaving now.
I'm on my way to the airport.

372
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,104
<i>Okay.</i>

373
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:48,069
Damn, they're so diligent.
Running away already?

374
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,158
Run away all you want.
Let's see how far you can go.

375
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,787
{\an8}The subject of the upcoming demonstration
is Park Jungja.

376
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,248
{\an8}Look at her. She looks so scary.

377
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,667
{\an8}"Is it written all over my face
that I'm bound for Hell?"

378
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,214
I wonder what sin this woman committed
to deserve to go to Hell.

379
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,465
Let us speculate.

380
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,051
She has two kids from different fathers.

381
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,970
But neither of them are around.

382
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,055
What could this mean?

383
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,099
Could she have killed them?

384
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,019
She could have killed them
for insurance money.

385
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,187
I'm just speculating.

386
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,816
Someone just sent me a photo!

387
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,735
Where did you get this?

388
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,111
From her social media?

389
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,989
My dear members are
so good at getting information!

390
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,533
<i>They must be the kids.</i>

391
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,659
<i>You poor things…</i>

392
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,826
<i>Wait, what is that?</i>

393
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,912
<i>Isn't that a bruise?</i>

394
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,707
Did she abuse them?
How could she abuse these beautiful kids?

395
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,835
Bitch, you need to rot in Hell!

396
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,381
Listen, the New Truth and the police.
Are you protecting these kids?

397
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,468
You need to hurry! We don't know
what this crazy woman will do to the kids!

398
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,764
<i>If the police aren't already on it,</i>
<i>we should go and get the kids out of there</i>

399
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:02,769
<i>because they might be the only witnesses</i>
<i>who can testify against this woman!</i>

400
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,145
-Hurry!
-Hurry.

401
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,063
Be careful.

402
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,905
-Let's go.
-Okay.

403
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,163
{\an8}Listen, Park Jungja's acquaintances.

404
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,251
<i>You should let the world know</i>
<i>what her sins are,</i>

405
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,544
<i>all right?</i>

406
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,213
You can't keep quiet about it.
That is not the solution!

407
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,798
You guys,

408
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,426
do we still not know
the kids' whereabouts?

409
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,219
<i>Hurry up!</i>

410
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:40,307
We can't let her commit any more sins!

411
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,934
<i>We need to move!</i>

412
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,501
That's him, right?

413
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,005
The one who brutally murdered your mother.

414
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,184
So that's what he looks like.

415
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,688
I guess this is your first time
seeing him.

416
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,732
They never showed his face.

417
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,319
Not on TV or in the papers.

418
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,074
He looks like

419
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:25,537
he's doing just fine
after receiving a man-made punishment…

420
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,667
when you and your father

421
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,505
have been living in turmoil
ever since it happened.

422
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,304
Are you sure you won't regret this?

423
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,218
We should hurry. Eunyul, get your sister.

424
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,636
Mom, are we going on a trip?

425
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,263
Eunyul,

426
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,808
you are Hayul's mother from now on.

427
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,560
So…

428
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,855
You can't park here.

429
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,566
Go to the parking lot.

430
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,610
I'll be right back.
It'll just be a minute.

431
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,243
You can't take too long, all right?

432
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,244
Okay.

433
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,330
Let's go.

434
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,748
-Get out.
-Hurry.

435
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,209
Wait for Detective Jin here.
The parking lot is dangerous.

436
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,293
Okay.

437
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,160
Everything's been confirmed.

438
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,163
Let me know when they arrive.
Please take good care of them.

439
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,373
Will do, ma'am.

440
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,252
Eunyul, she will take care of you
until you board the flight.

441
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,171
Someone from our side
will be at the airport there.

442
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,383
Don't get distracted
and take good care of your sister.

443
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,467
You should go now.

444
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,595
Let's go.

445
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,013
Okay.

446
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,807
Let's see.

447
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,061
Eunyul, I need to pee.

448
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,188
Let me take you to the restroom.
Come with me.

449
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,315
Here's your ticket.

450
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,072
Look.

451
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,742
It looks like you.

452
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,744
Try it again.

453
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,963
Hayul, are you in there?

454
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,775
Where is your mother?

455
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,861
Hayul, what are you doing here? Come here.

456
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,495
Stay put until we get off.

457
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,668
Eunyul, when is Mom coming?

458
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,243
-You're here.
-Have the kids left?

459
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,078
I don't know yet.

460
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,830
What about the kids?

461
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,874
That's great.

462
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,875
Thank you so much.

463
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,044
Did they board the flight?

464
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,297
Yes, they did. I just checked.

465
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,925
-Somebody will pick them up, right?
-Thank you so much.

466
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,512
Someone from our side
will be at the airport, so don't worry.

467
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,888
Okay.

468
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,056
Thank you.

469
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,562
I didn't get to say goodbye to them.

470
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,817
I scolded them until the very last moment.

471
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,076
I should've hugged them one last time.

472
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,503
Thank you.

473
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,011
No matter

474
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,515
how many times

475
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,393
they are presented with evidence,

476
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:27,190
people won't believe it
until they receive a decree themselves.

477
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:32,528
They complain that God punishes them

478
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,365
even though He created them to be sinful.

479
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,496
Like those kids who blame
their parents for giving them life,

480
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,373
all they do is whine.

481
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,419
Heejung.

482
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,883
Get out of there!

483
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,385
Move!

484
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,678
Step aside.

485
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,595
Get out!

486
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,806
-Stop taking photos.
-Stop!

487
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,103
<i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after…</i>

488
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,695
WHY CAN'T I REACH YOU?
DID YOU FORGET YOUR CHARGER?

489
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,696
DID YOU EAT?

490
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,115
-I haven't told him yet.
-You should get ready.

491
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,449
He's here.

492
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,993
Hello, Detective Jin.

493
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:07,910
-Hey.
-Hello.

494
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,495
The Squad Chief asked for you.

495
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,496
Why?

496
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,873
You should go see him.

497
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,383
<i>An anonymous source provided</i>
<i>information to the press.</i>

498
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,302
<i>Given the information on the ID card…</i>

499
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,386
Come in.

500
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,557
-Hi.
-Just in time.

501
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,768
Come here and watch this.

502
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,314
<i>Let's hear more</i>
<i>from our reporter at the scene.</i>

503
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,481
<i>Reporter Kim?</i>

504
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,859
<i>The police launched an investigation</i>

505
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,612
{\an8}<i>after a burnt body was found</i>
<i>in an abandoned greenhouse in Jinyang.</i>

506
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:48,617
{\an8}<i>They found an ID card in a pile</i>
<i>of ripped clothing near the body,</i>

507
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,537
<i>and they assume that</i>
<i>the body belongs to Kim Changsik,</i>

508
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,708
<i>the culprit of the regeneration area</i>
<i>murder case from six years ago.</i>

509
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,502
<i>Kim was sentenced to six years in custody</i>

510
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,131
<i>and medical treatment as the crime</i>
<i>was committed under the influence.</i>

511
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,633
{\an8}<i>and had been living in Jinyang</i>
<i>since his release.</i>

512
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,803
{\an8}<i>After the news broke,</i>
<i>many people on the Internet</i>

513
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,432
{\an8}<i>pointed out similarities between this case</i>
<i>and the Hapseong Station murder case</i>

514
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,684
<i>and are making religious interpretations.</i>

515
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,602
<i>Meanwhile…</i>

516
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,314
If they had found a body,
they should've called the police.

517
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,985
The reporters got to the scene first,
so the victim's identity leaked.

518
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,487
<i>The police will conduct DNA testing</i>

519
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,031
<i>and analyze surrounding</i>
<i>surveillance footage…</i>

520
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,241
That body belongs to that bastard?

521
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,662
Based on the circumstantial evidence, yes.
But we won't get any DNA evidence.

522
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,457
They'll say that it's not organic matter.

523
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,750
Damn it.

524
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,885
You don't have anything
to do with it, do you?

525
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,887
Of course not.

526
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,433
Ms. Park's lawyers sent the kids
out of the country last night

527
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,602
because her identity was leaked.

528
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,646
They thought the kids
wouldn't be safe here.

529
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,233
This is driving me crazy.

530
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,945
Jinyang police are struggling
with the investigation.

531
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,073
Don't you dare meddle in this case.

532
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,243
The media and press are all over

533
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,995
Park Jungja's pre-announced
murder broadcast tomorrow.

534
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,792
We have to catch the culprits tomorrow.

535
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,129
This will all go away once we catch them.

536
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,385
Six years ago,

537
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,346
there was a woman
who was brutally murdered

538
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,266
while taking her detective husband
a change of clothes.

539
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,559
You remember the case, right?

540
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,479
{\an8}The murderer was never punished
for what he did.

541
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,275
{\an8}Instead of punishing him,
they let him get treated in a hospital.

542
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,651
{\an8}Why?!

543
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,695
Because he was a drug addict.

544
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,574
They claimed that
he had no intention of sinning.

545
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,411
We humans could not punish him.

546
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,370
However!

547
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,290
God has punished him.

548
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,168
{\an8}"If you sin, you get punished."

549
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,546
{\an8}We humans have been having a hard time
accepting this simple rule,

550
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,548
{\an8}and for thousands of years,

551
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,302
{\an8}God has been patient, patient,
patient, patient, patient with us.

552
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,513
After years of waiting,

553
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,099
God has finally decided to intervene.

554
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,643
{\an8}God is sending us a message

555
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,813
{\an8}before the demonstration tomorrow.

556
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,857
Park Jungja.

557
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,360
Park Jungja.

558
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,698
Please, I beg you.

559
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,034
Please confess your sins.

560
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,370
You only have one day to live,

561
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:43,334
so please do the most meaningful thing
you can do in your life.

562
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,169
I beg you!

563
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,129
I beg you!

564
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,592
-Park Jungja!
-Park Jungja!

565
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,219
-Shall repent!
-Shall repent!

566
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,346
-Her sins!
-Her sins!

567
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,264
Repent!

568
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,683
-Park Jungja, a sinner!
-Park Jungja, a sinner!

569
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,977
-Shall uphold God's will!
-Shall uphold God's will!

570
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,479
-And confess her sins!
-Confess!

571
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,023
-I'll go check on Ms. Park.
-Okay.

572
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,070
-We'll put cameras here. Clear the area.
-Yes, sir.

573
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,033
Come in.

574
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,089
Who drew this?

575
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,050
Hayul did.

576
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,472
Should I find you a place to stay?

577
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,850
It would be difficult for you
to spend a night here.

578
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,060
Excuse me.

579
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,814
Don't you see the crowd outside?
Do you think you can come back here?

580
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,483
-If you can't, the contract is nullified.
-No.

581
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,319
I'm staying here.

582
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,865
I'm comfortable here.

583
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,827
Okay.

584
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,415
EUNYUL, HAYUL, MOM

585
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,299
Yeongho, what's going on?

586
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,426
This is crazy.

587
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,969
What is it this time?

588
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,972
The TV stations
are airing it live tomorrow.

589
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,599
All the major networks.

590
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,975
What?

591
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,853
DIE, PARK JUNGJA
REPENT

592
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,063
Everyone's going crazy.

593
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,905
Hello.

594
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,076
This is Assistant Inspector Jin Kyunghun
at Seobuk Police Station.

595
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,121
I called to ask if you found any evidence.

596
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,499
<i>We can't even begin the investigation</i>
<i>because of the crowd.</i>

597
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,086
<i>They're following us around</i>
<i>and interfering with the investigation.</i>

598
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,256
<i>There is surveillance footage</i>
<i>recorded near his house,</i>

599
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,050
<i>but it's too dark to recognize faces.</i>

600
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,303
Well, if it's not too much trouble,

601
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,930
can I take a look at the footage?

602
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,767
<i>Okay. I will send it to you</i>
<i>when I get back to the station.</i>

603
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,187
All right. Sorry for the trouble
and thank you so much.

604
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,188
<i>Sure.</i>

605
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,164
CALLS
HEEJUNG

606
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,464
<i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after…</i>

607
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:49,436
HEEJUNG'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

608
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,736
Hey! What is it?

609
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,825
-Release our members!
-You cannot investigate God!

610
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:03,992
Fuck! Beat them up!

611
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,624
You fuckers!

612
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,184
You cannot investigate God!

613
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,937
Release our members!

614
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,106
Let go! Let go of me!

615
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,067
Let go!

616
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,236
You cannot investigate God!

617
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,584
Please check the camera placement.

618
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,960
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

619
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:59,047
-The cables should go like this.
-We're on it already.

620
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,515
REPENT
CONFESS YOUR SINS

621
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,279
GOD HAS ABANDONED YOU

622
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,156
GO TO HELL

623
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,533
The VIPs are here.

624
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,843
I wonder how much they paid to watch this.

625
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,890
Now I see where
the three billion won came from.

626
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,311
The New Truth may be bigger than we think.

627
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,232
How could all this happen
in just three days?

628
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,571
Oh, right.

629
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,907
Who's Kim Jeongchil?

630
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,410
I got it from the office,
and it was addressed to you.

631
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,788
241-5 GOYANG-SI, GYEONGGI-DO
KIM JEONGCHIL

632
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,638
Are you all right?

633
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,932
Yes.

634
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,187
I don't see Chairman Jung.

635
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,065
He's probably planning on
a grand entrance.

636
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,818
I'm sure he's watching from somewhere.

637
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,404
Is the SWAT team in position?

638
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,865
Team Leader, everything all right?

639
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,658
Yes, no issue.

640
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,951
Roger that.

641
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,788
What's all this fuss about?

642
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,336
Come here.

643
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,007
If anything feels wrong

644
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,093
or Ms. Park Jungja is in danger,

645
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,138
we will do whatever it takes
to protect Ms. Park.

646
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,681
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

647
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,807
Be careful.

648
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,601
Back to your positions.

649
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,855
All right, it is time.

650
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,108
Everyone except the subject, please leave.

651
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,445
Officers, you should wait outside too.

652
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,033
Would you like to talk to your kids?

653
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,826
We don't have time for that.

654
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,454
Not now.

655
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,999
I'll talk to them after this.

656
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,792
Once everything is over.

657
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,177
Please get out.

658
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,566
Hey, make the warning announcement.

659
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,867
PARK JUNGJA REPENT
THE GATES OF HELL ARE OPEN

660
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,998
Be alert. Safeties off.
