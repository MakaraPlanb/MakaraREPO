00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,500
[It was bad.]

880
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,860
[I suddenly had a mental breakdown.]

881
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,660
[You Da Yeon couldn't win
the part she wanted.]

882
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,300
Let's decide on part seven.

883
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,460
Part 2. Part 3.

884
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,020
[All parts except for
vocal 7 and 8 are fixed.]

885
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,700
Part 4. Part 5.

886
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,340
Six. Lead vocal.

887
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,220
Da Yeon, you first.

888
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,220
I don't think I can do it.

889
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,260
[You Da Yeon failed to win all the parts
that she wanted.]

890
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,860
[She cries unexpectedly.]

891
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
What's wrong?

892
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,460
[Although it didn't go perfectly
as I planned,]

893
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,700
there was an alternative.

894
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,860
But it didn't work out either.

895
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,580
[Then all my determination]

896
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,700
somewhat seemed meaningless.

897
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,060
I couldn't take what I wanted,

898
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,260
but I didn't get to show
what I could do either.

899
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,540
Let me show you first.
If it's still not good enough,

900
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,620
I'll take part 7 or 8.

901
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,980
This is not fair for the others

902
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,580
because everyone had only one chance.

903
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,740
Everyone got to choose once.

904
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,700
One chance per person.

905
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,180
[Opportunities
were given to everyone evenly.]

906
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,620
Okay.

907
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,260
[We placed first for the morning mission,
so we were able to make a choice.]

908
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,620
We should...

909
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,580
[You Da Yeon made her team by winning
the wake-up mission.]

910
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,780
Nonaka Shana.

911
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,380
[Had I known we could be rivals,]

912
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,620
[I wouldn't have picked
the current members.]

913
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,020
Nothing worked as I wanted.

914
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,020
I didn't feel like

915
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,580
I could survive here.

916
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,660
[It was so depressing.]

917
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,700
[99 girls started practicing in full-scale
for the first mission.]

918
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,020
[After the practice]

919
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
-Yes?
-Come in.

-Is Miyu here?
-I'm here.

921
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,460

922
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,540
I'll do the best I can too.

-Yes?

-Together...
-tomorrow as well.

-We can do it.

931

to the members.]

[I feel pressured and anxious.]

[I want to be in an enjoyable stage
so that I don't have any regrets!]

It was my dream to perform on stage.

941

Me too. I want to do a good job.

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,260
Let's get the benefit
and go to "M Countdown."

943

After "The Fifth Season" is over,

944

No, it won't.

Bloom? Yes.

for me and my team.]

[It makes me feel more responsible]

[that I could drop out with my teammates.]

953
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,340
[I don't want to cause any harm
to my teammates.]

954

all together.]

[What's the screaming about?]

1053
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,340
What?

1054
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,060
-Is it right?
-100 percent sure.

1055
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
[I'm 100 percent sure!]

1056
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,620
[What is it?]

1057
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,180
[A circular stage
that made the girls terrified.]

1058
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,380
There's a stage.

1059
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,540
I've seen this before.

1060
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,740
Maybe we have to perform here.

1061
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,700
Could it be about changing mission songs?

1062
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,340
-A battle?
-A battle?

1063
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,140
[Huh Ji Won is a good detective.]

1064
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,220
There must be a reason
why we're seated in teams.

1065
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
It's probably that.

1066
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,100
[The seats are divided into teams
per mission songs.]

1067
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,020
[Amid all kinds of speculation,]

1068
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,820
[familiar music is heard
and their hearts react.]

1069
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,100
[I can't stay still to the Signal song!]

1070
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,180

but they can dance while sitting.]

1074

[In the zone]

1075
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,420
[What's going on?]

1076
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,340
Awesome!

1077
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,260
[Perfect ending]

1078
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,060
[The real ending is only when
the connection is successful.]

1079
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,260
What a surprising entrance.

1080
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,980
[This is too good.]

1081
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,340
Hello.

1082

-Yes!
-Yes!

1087
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,660
[Everyone answers together.]

1088
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,140
I'm looking forward to it.

1089
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,820
[I'm watching. I will look forward to it.]

1090
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,540
Why do you think Joo Hee and I
are here today?

1091
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,660
For a dance battle?

1092
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,060
For a dance battle?

1093
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
What?

1094
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,580
Why didn't anyone say anything?

1095
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,060
[Because everyone wants to avoid it...]

1096
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,060
That's right.

1097
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,260
Today's the day of Planet Dance Battle.

1098
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,300
[Yes!]

1099
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,660
[Today is
the first "Planet Dance Battle".]

1100
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,100
But it's no fun without a prize, right?

1101
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,620
So we're going to give
the winners something.

1102
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,500
-You guys are curious, right?
-Yes!

1103
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,820
The winners will get

1104

[What will be the benefit
of the dance battle?]

1105
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,540
to decide which group will go first
for the performance!

1106
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,580
If I'm being really honest,

1107
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,340
whether we go first or last

1108
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,980
didn't really matter.

1109
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,580
We just have to win, right?

1110
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,700
[This is a survival program!]

1111
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,700

whether you go first or last.]

If some people weren't good enough,

1403
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,540
you needed to encourage them
to practice more.

1404
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,940
This is an exciting and cheerful song.

1405
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,140
But it felt like you were doing homework.

1406
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,580
Ji Won didn't stand out

1407
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,140
when she did the killer verse.

1408
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,660
It's the beginning of the song.

1409
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,020
This song is all about the energy.

1410
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,820
[We weren't used to performing the song.]

1411
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,660
So we just couldn't be energetic.

1412
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,060
[I kept thinking]

1413
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,300
[that we needed to practice more.]

1414
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,940
[Closing her mouth tightly]

1415
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,540
Team 2, you're up.

1416
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,100
[Next up is an interim evaluation
for "YES or YES" Team 2.]

1417
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,660
-Okay.
-Okay.

1418
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,980
[Team 2 does a chant before they begin.]

1419
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,700
Let's do the battle cry.

1420
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,460
Right, something like that is needed.

1421
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,860
Two, three.

1422
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,660
-Let's enjoy, yes or yes!
-Let's enjoy, yes or yes!

1423
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,300
♫ Hey, boy, look ♫

1424
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,300
[Team 2's performance
begins with Kim Do Ah's killer verse.]

1425
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,740
♫ I'm going to make this simple for you ♫

1426
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,980
[Watching]

1427
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,700
♫ You've got two choices ♫

1428
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,780
♫ Come on and tell me yes ♫

1429
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,500
♫ You just have to make a choice ♫

1430
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,700
♫ You don't even have to think ♫

1431
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,540
♫ It's simple, Y-E-S, hey ♫

1432
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,820
[The masters look different
from Team 1's performance.]

1433
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,980
[They finish the song with smiles.]

1434
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,700
In general, Team 2 was more energetic

1435
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,180
than Team 1.

1436
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,740
You guys made it yours

1437
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,180
and grabbed attention.

1438
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,220
The energy felt different from the start.

1439
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:26,220
How would you give the bright energy
to the performance?

1440
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,460
First off,

1441
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,220
we've got to practice enough

1442
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,260
to be able to do it
even with our eyes closed.

1443
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,260
I thought we needed to be more in sync.

1444
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,980
[Practice begins properly
after the interim evaluation.]

1445
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,180
One, two, three, four.

1446
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,940
Slowly from the start.

1447
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,180
Let's do it slowly from the start.

1448
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,580
Dance big. Again.

1449
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:50,660
Let's go again.

1450
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,500
[Team 1's practice progresses quickly]

1451
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,660
Again.

1452
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,860
[as Kim Hye Rim and Huh Ji Won
from K Group lead the session.]

1453
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,140
Again.

1454
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,740
Let's do this part once again.

1455
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,820
One more time.

1456
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,020
Let's do it one more time.

1457
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,020
[I felt like we were doing
only as we were told.]

1458
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:09,060
[I don't want to fake the bright energy.]

1459
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,060
[I want to enjoy performing on the stage.]

1460
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,700
Our personality itself

1461
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,540
isn't assertive.

1462
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,940
A lot of those from J Group are timid.

1463
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,140
[Okuma Sumomo tears up in the end.]

1464
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,500
I'm confused.

1465
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,980
I feel like I'm only causing harm.

1466
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,100
No, you aren't.

1467
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,780
You aren't causing harm.

1468
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,580
It's always my mistake

1469
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,420
that stops us in the middle.

1470
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,180
Don't blame yourself.

1471
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,340
It's tough because we don't have
much time to practice alone.

1472
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,020
I bet everyone wants
to practice properly now.

1473
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,700
I guess.

1474
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,820
[Chae Hyun came after
hearing J Group's conversation.]

1475
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,260
It's okay.

1476
00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:00,540
I feel a little frustrated.

1477
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,980
Was it a little too fast
when we practiced together?

1478
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,780
A bit.

1479
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,060
Fast?

1480
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,260
I'm sorry.

1481
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,900
[She's sorry for not being able
to consider J Group's feelings.]

1482
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,700
Sorry it was too fast.

1483
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,460
They kept being led.

1484
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,260
We felt sorry about it too.

1485
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,140
Maybe that's why they lost confidence.

1486
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,300
Hey.

1487
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,380
I think we need time to talk.

1488
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,500
Okay.

1489
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,460
We may work hard
on details and dance moves,

1490
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,900
but if we aren't close,
we can't make a good performance.

1491
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,460
We'll try harder to be closer
with each other.

1492
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,940
[A bond?]

1493
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,020
Closer?

1494
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,460
-Like this.
-One.

1495
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,140
[It means we're one!]

1496
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,580
Thank you.

1497
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,260
Being able to talk with the teammates

1498
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,420
made me feel a little better.

1499
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,740
["YES or YES" Team 1's bond
became stronger after the talk.]

1500
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,900
Close.

1501
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,220
Sumomo reminds me of my past.

1502
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,060
[When I first came to Korea,
I had language problems.]

1503
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,740
[I didn't understand
what people were talking.]

1504
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,180
There are non-Korean members in my group.

1505
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,900
[Cherry Bullet]

1506
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,540
[They probably felt similar]

1507
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,540
[when they first came to Korea.]

1508
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,900
[She reminded me of them.]

1509
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,060
[And I was sorry
that I couldn't be more caring.]

1510
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,460
[I wanted to get closer with her.]

1511
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,300
[I want to make a good performance
with pleasure.]

1512
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,900
We're doing great.

1513
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,220
-We just need to do as we practiced.
-Okay.

1514
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,300
-I trust you.
-I trust you.

1515
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,940
-I trust you.
-I love you.

1516
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,580
-I love you too.
-I love you.

1517
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,540
-I love you.
-I love you.

1518
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,220
Quite a lot of them lacked confidence.

1519
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,220
Right.

1520
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,900
I wonder how much they improved.

1521
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,180
-Go for it.
-You can do it.

1522
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,380
-Go for it.
-Good luck.

1523
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,020
[Everyone is cheering for
the first Connect mission performance!]

1524
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,420
-You can do it.
-Let's go.

1525
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,100
[Deep breathing]

1526
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,740
Good luck.

1527
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,860
Ji Won has to start it off well.

1528
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,060
Gosh.
