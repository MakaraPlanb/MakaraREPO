Our group was in such a bad place until
we heard the news about Girls Planet 999.

391
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,920
There were so many depressing news
like some groups breaking up.

392

that we might end up that way.

394

that Girls Planet 999
will be great for us.

396
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,360

That was so refreshing.

919

I saw her practice hard,

920

even studying the facial expressions.

921
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,320
I saw how it paid off on stage.
She looked great.

922

She looked cool
when she took the heels off.

923
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,920
Not many people have that kind of courage.

924

925
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,560
I must ask you,

926
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,120
why did you take your heels off?

927
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,000
I got them two days ago but

928
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
I got many blisters

929
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,480
for practicing all day in them.

930
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,640
I took them off to give it my all

931

in this first performance.

932
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,040

What kind of synergy
will the cells create?

1057

Their vocals are weak since they dance.

1058

So when they pick someone...

1059
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,440

She looked like a member of a girl group.

1259
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,840
I can't deny she's attractive.

1260

The cell members you choose now

[Wild cheers]

2152
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,480
It's really different seeing you
like this.

2153
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,440
Did you miss me?

2154
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,960
Yes! Of course!

2155

[Myah also missed you.]

2158
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,320
Yes.

2159
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:25,320
I bet you're wondering
why I'm here, right?

2160
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,800
[Why did he come to Planet Camp?]

2161
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,080
Yes!

2162
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,880
[They're very curious.]

2163
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,760
What you've been dying to find out.

2164
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:34,000
The first mission.

2165
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,040
[I don't know what to do!]

2166
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,320
- Finally, it's time.
- We're in trouble.

2167
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,120
Here's Girls Planet's first mission.

2168

Connect Mission.

2169
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,480
[What does "connect" mean?]

2170
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,320
Connect?

2171
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,600
Connect?

2172
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,280
But I'm already connected with my cell.

2173
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,920
Connect? How?

2174
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,840
The Connect Mission is for the 99 girls

2175
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,360
["Connect Mission" means that 99 girls
will be connected through K-pop.]

2176
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,480
to connect with K-Pop.

2177
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,000
3 cells will be assigned to 1 song.

2178
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,720
3 cells to 1 song?

2179
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,320
[The girls buzz after hearing
the number of people for the mission.]

2180
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,880
9 will be connected to 1 performance.

2181
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,880
[Nine people will be connected
on stage as a team for the first time.]

2182
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,080
Whoa!

2183
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,320
- Together?
- Together.

2184
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,840
3 persons and 3 cells.

2185
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,240
[Do three cells have to be connected?]

2186
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,120
[Where am I? Who am I?]

2187
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,560
[Surprised]

2188
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,800
That's too many of us!

2189
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,200
I was shocked. 9's way too many.

2190
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,680
Putting it together's going to be tough.

2191
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,000
We might have issues communicating.

2192
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,720
[She's worried about communication.]

2193
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:38,840
How are we going to manage practices?

2194
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,240
2 teams can choose 1 mission song.

2195
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,360
[Two teams can choose]

2196
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,200

[The teams that chose the same song]

2199
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,480
[will go up against each other
in a match.]

01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,160
will battle against one another.

2201
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,840
[They get goosebumps from
just hearing the word "match".]

2202
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,760
[The masters will choose
which team will win.]

2203
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,480
The masters will decide who wins.

2204
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,920
The winning team will be given a benefit.

2205
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,600
[That team will receive a huge benefit
that is connected directly to survival.]

2207
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,360
Oh no!

2208
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:08,880
Here are the Connect Mission songs.

2209
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,600
[Which song will they perform
for the first Connect Mission?]

[Connect Mission]

2211
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,560
[Behind the falling curtain,
the panel is full of question marks.]

2212
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,400
My head was filled with question marks.

2213
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,480
What's going on?

2214
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,400
What are they going to have us do
to put all those question marks?

2215
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,800
Here's the group name of the first song.

I wanted to do BTS or SEVENTEEN.

2411

But that's risky.

2412
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,400
Yeah. It's risky.

2413
