2096
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:51,550
-She must've been under a lot of pressure.
-Right.

2097
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:54,590
She survived with a Planet Pass,

2098
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:57,790
so she probably felt a lot more burdened.

2099
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:01,150
Ruan, you did really well,
so it's all good now. Right?

2100
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:02,350
Yes.

2101
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,150
Great job, everyone.

finished their performance.]

01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,030
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

2104
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:10,390
You worked so hard. Good job.

2105
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,190
Good job.

Da Yeon! Yes!

2107
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:17,110
-Thank you.
-How can they be this good?

2108
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,670
They were more powerful towards the end.

2109
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,350
The later parts had
all the powerful dance moves.

2110
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:26,630
Da Yeon made
a narrative arc strategically.

2111
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,750
This is needed.

2112
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,110
I keep getting goosebumps

2113
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:32,670
to see how they prepared
such a performance only in a short time.

2114
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,350
-Plus, it's just so well done.
-I know.

2115
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,950
I better score them
after watching the other teams.

2116
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:42,230
Honestly, my choreography was difficult.

2117
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,990
-Don't say that.
-But none of you showed it.

2118
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:48,030
-It's all thanks to your dancing skills.
-Good job.

2119
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:50,310
-Right.
-I know.

2120
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:52,670
I love you guys. Good work.

2121
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:53,990

-Ice cream, yes!

2123
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:58,030
Good work.

2124
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,270
When we listen to this song,

2125
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:04,830
our shoulders start to groove right away.

2126
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:07,790
It makes us want to dance.

2127
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:11,470
It's "No Excuses" by Meghan Trainor.

2128
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,870
Oh, Meghan Trainor.

2129
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:16,510
I love this song.

2130
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:17,950
We're the vocal trainers.

2131
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,310
[She's Meghan Trainor.
We're vocal trainers.]

2132

-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

2133
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:22,310
[Hi.]

2134
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:23,310
Look.

2135
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:28,790
-We're Bling Cling Girls.
-We're Bling Cling Girls.

2136
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:30,350
They're so cute.

2137
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:34,310
Did you have any difficulties
with making the choreography?

2138
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:39,750
[Combination Mission Mid-checkup]

2139
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:39,590
You made the choreography
from start to end, right?

2140
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,670
Yes.

2141
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,190
[Exclaiming]

2142
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:46,470
[That is how much
they look forward to it.]

2143
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:46,470
What are you doing?

2144
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:48,070
The hand...

2145
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:51,030
Who's doing the killing-part?

2146
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,550
Hikaru encouraged me

2147
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:57,550
that I'd pull it off nicely,

2148
01:27:57,630 --> 01:27:58,830
so I decided to take the job.

2149
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:02,950
I think Su Yeon is totally suitable
for the killing-part.

2150
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:04,910
Really?

2151
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:08,790
I want to do it,
but my lack of confidence says otherwise.

2152
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,510
No, it goes well with you.

2153
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:14,230
-It's got a happy mood.
-Happy.

2154
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,790
[They are happy.]

2155

2156
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:21,590
things like this.

2157
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:25,030
Then I'll try my best.

2158
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,150
-Okay.
-Thank you.

2159
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:26,510
[Kim Su Yeon takes the Killing-Part.]

2160

How's your practice coming along?

2161
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:30,510
Yes.

2162
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:32,310
Why do you look so worried?

2163
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:33,950
Well...

2164
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:34,350
[Well...]

2165
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:35,750
-You have a lot of concerns?
-Yes.

2166
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:41,430
["No Excuses" Team's Mid-checkup begins
with worries.]

2167

[Two masters watch them
more composedly than before.]

2168
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,630
-It's not fun.
-No.

2169
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:10,230
If this choreography already existed

2170
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:12,150
and this is how you practiced it,
I would...

2171
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:13,630
[You know?]

2172
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:15,310
We all know you're good dancers.

2173
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:18,590
I want you to focus more on acting.

2174
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:20,190
You're smiling,

2175
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:21,990
but I don't know why.

2176
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:24,830
If you decide on acting and characters,

2177
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:29,430
your gestures, eyes,
and dance highlights will change.

2178
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:32,590
You need a vibe like, "I'm the best."

2179
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,750
But now, you just danced like,

2180
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:36,830
[It felt like a machine.]

2181
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,510
"One, two, three, and four."

2182
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:40,830
Hikaru, you always make this look
when you start dancing.

2183

[Hikaru's unique expression
for "BOOMBAHYAH" and "The Eve".]

2184

[That does not match this song.]

2186

You just did your thing
and gave a strong vibe.

2187
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:53,710
To advance to the next round,

2188
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,830
you need to make the audience go,

2189
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,030
"Oh, gosh. Yes, Su Yeon!"

2190
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:00,990
You need such reactions from them.

2191
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:03,030
I think they tried to make
their comments sound nice

2192
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:06,270
so they wouldn't hurt our feelings.

2193
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:09,470
But they looked so disappointed.

2194
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,070
I was sad.

2195
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:16,270
We were all too powerful.

2196
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:19,670
It's not impressive. This is hard.

We were busy working on the choreography

2198
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:25,110
that we couldn't
focus on our facial expressions.

2199
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:28,630
Our efforts seem meaningless.

2200
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,270
