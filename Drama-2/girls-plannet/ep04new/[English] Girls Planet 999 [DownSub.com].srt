although she had a small part.

1735
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,140
♫ Look at me with an arrogant gaze ♫

1736
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,260
[She's good!]

1737
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:55,220
She was good at handling her part.

1738
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,420
It left an impression on me.

1739
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,900
Thank you.

1740
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:05,780
Something feels uneasy.

1741
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:06,140
[The evaluation]

1742
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,300
Something is...

1743
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,380
What could be the problem?

1744
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,020
We wanted them to do better

1745
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,940
because we saw the interim evaluation.

1746
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:15,140
Masters,

1747
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:19,620
please choose the winning team
out of the three teams.

1748
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,140
This is so hard.

1749
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,580
This is difficult.

1750
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,700
Oh, goodness.

1751
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:27,420
[It's time to choose the winner.]

1752
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,020
[The masters don't know
each other's choices.]

1753
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:32,620
I'm curious about the result.

1754
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,020
I wonder how everyone decided.

1755
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,140
It's a tie!

1756
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:41,340
[Shocking news was delivered
to the masters.]

1757
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,020
That's insane.

1758
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,180
I'm curious.

1759
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,980
[It's decided by combining
the score the masters gave them.]

1760
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,700
Can we get the three teams up
on the stage?

1761
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,140
They get three times the votes
if they win.

1762
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,820
[For 24 hours]

1763

[Who will be the lucky team
to win the triple votes?]

[They are dumbfounded.]

1782
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,860
Goodness.

1783
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:57,420
It was extremely fierce this time.

1784
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,940

Let's hear from the other two teams
that were so close to winning.

1792

["Pretty U" Team interpreted
the song perfectly.]

1801

She's so pretty.

1891
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:00,260
Here's my advice
as someone older than you, not a master.

1892
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:04,300
Some will get eliminated, and some not.

1893
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,540
Even if you get eliminated,

1894
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:12,780
I hope you won't dwell on it.

1895
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,620
You're all so young,

1896
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,100

1897
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:22,580
Be the first one to take care of yourself.

1898
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:25,820
You'll keep failing and making mistakes

1899
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,460
in life, not just on stage.

1900
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:34,060
It's only a process to become successful,

1901
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,260
so I hope you won't give up.

1902
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,380
I know the language barrier is huge

1903
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:44,900
and the schedule is hard to keep up with.

1904
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,620
You're doing well.
