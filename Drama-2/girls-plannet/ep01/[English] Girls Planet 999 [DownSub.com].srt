You performed professionally.

2009
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:08,840
It felt like I was watching a performance
at a concert, not an audition.

2010
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,240
They're better than I expected.

2011
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,760
Is it because I didn't expect much?

2012
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,040
Why is she so good?

01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,640

[They're showing off
their girlish charms.]

[Another J Group unit's stage was
cheerful and energetic.]

2017

I think I had a stereotype.

2029
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,360
I was really surprised.

2030

Finally.

2037
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,920
J Group's number one.

2038
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,800
Number one.

2039
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,680
Yes!

2040
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,760
Number one?

2041
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,920

[Ezaki Hikaru is the center of
everyone's attention.]

Look at those eyes.

01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,280
She was charismatic when she walked in.

2048
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,520
"I'm amazing" was written on her face.

Ezaki Hikaru, you were ranked first

2061
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,320
I felt this when I saw your audition tape,

2062
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,680
and you have quite a talent.

2063
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,920

Exactly.

2069
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,320
Did hard work make you talented?

2070
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,280
I wasn't good at singing or dancing,

2071
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,280
but I worked really hard for my dream.

2072
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,600

for the unit stage.]

I want to do well in all of them.

2081
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:53,280
I practiced without compromising

2082
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,760
to get a grasp of what I'm unskilled at.

2083
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,400
I practiced facial expressions the most,

2084
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,840
so I hope many people will notice it.

I feel like hard work paid off.

How amazing will their performance be?

2103
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,920
I think it's easy to have a stereotype

2104
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,800
of J Group's skill level.

2105
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,360
I don't think we're inferior to anyone,

[During the first greeting]

[She also pointed out the wrong
choreography among 8 beats.]

2667
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,920
And we couldn't practice a lot

2668
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:20,520
because the girls were in pain.

2669
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,760
[During the unit practice]

2670
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:24,040
My shoulder hurts...

2671
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,400
Myah sprained her shoulder.

2672
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:33,960
Chae-yun hurt her back, so she sang.

2673
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,840
I was a bit sick as well.

2674
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,480
So Ye-seo really had to pull her weight.

2675
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,640
I knew that the girls were in pain,

2676
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,840
so I thought I should really help them.

2677
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:52,440
I think we just need to decide our parts.

2678
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,840
Let's try that again.

2679
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,760
Let's do it this way.

2680
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:57,120
[Ye-seo teaches them
on what she practiced alone.]

2681
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,040
Let's do it three times.

2682
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,560
The rest of us didn't have any experience.

2683
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,960
We didn't know how to put in our in-ears.

2684
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,120
This is my first in-ear experience.

2685
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,240
If they're uncomfortable, take them out.

2686
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,520
Have them tape the mic to your cheek.

2687
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,760
-Oh, tape it?
-Yes, you have to.

2688
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,440
Ye-seo really played a vital role.

2689
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,840
-Is that the center stage mark?
-Yes.

2690
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,680
The neon is the same as the white one.

2691
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,280
4minute?

2692
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,320
This?

2693
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,520
But they look like babies!

2694
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,200
They'd be too cute.

2695
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,520
They shouldn't be.

2696
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,600

on the stage?]

-That was crazy!
-Thank you.

Ye-seo's mic fell off in the middle of it,

2746

so we were nervous as well.

But she didn't waver at all.

And when her part ended, she turned

2750
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:13,000

I can't choose. I'm sorry.

Yu-jin always does well.

3558
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:47,320
I always trust she'd do well.

3559
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:49,280
[I actually fell asleep.]

3560
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:49,400
So I slept.

3561
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:52,560

Yu-jin, I love you!

3563
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:58,640
I know myself very well.

3564
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,600
I buckle when I feel pressure.

3565
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:05,000
So I figured I'd just enjoy it.

3566
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:07,480
They're here to see me,

3567
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:09,480
so I'll show them what I'm about.

3568

Who will you choose
to project their dreams?

3584
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:06,840
[The voting starts next week!]

3585
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:17,480
[The girls' performances
are not over yet.]

3586

[Finally, the moment of TOP9
announcement approaches.]

3587
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:39,760
The first place goes to...

3588
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:42,760
[Who will take the 1st place
for the first time?]

3589
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:44,920
This girl.

3590
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:48,880
[After the intense test is over,]

3591
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:53,040
[the girls enter the Planet Camp at last.]

3592
02:28:59,640 --> 02:29:01,320
Here's the first mission.

3593
02:28:59,640 --> 02:29:01,640
[The first mission is revealed.]

3594
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:07,320
We're in trouble. What should we do?

3595
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:09,760
[The first group of survivors
is announced.]

3596
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:11,320
