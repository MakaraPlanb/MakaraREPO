00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,780
Sis!


6
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,940
What are you doing?


7
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,820
I'm going to work backstage.	


8
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,420
Mind your own business.


9
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,140
Sis,


10
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,700
grandma told me before I came here that	


11
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,980
you can't go to any crowded place.


12
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,380

13
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,140

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,180
I'm here to take care of you, 


15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,620

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,340

18

If you try to make an issue of me,


19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,460
I'll show no mercy.


20
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,490
Sis, don't get me wrong.


21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,340
I just do


22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,810
what grandma tells me to do.


23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,860
It better be.


24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,780
Don't worry, sis.


25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,380
I'll take good care of you.


26
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,660
Although


27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,340
I have my own plans,


28

32

Don't interfere with my business.


33

I'm telling you,


37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,580
 you're done. 


38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,660
You'll never work as a model again!


39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,700
If it's our fault, 


40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,340

41
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,180

44

And you ruined it!


45
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,900
And you're talking about respect? 


46
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,060
Talk to my lawyer!

What's going on?	


48
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,290
Someone ripped Qianying's dress.


49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,700
It was bustling here.


50
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,260
We don't know who did it.


51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,100
Annie, 


52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,780
you must solve this matter.


53
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,660
I spent a whole year


54
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
on this dress


55
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,780
and half a year


56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,980
on this show.


57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,300
If it's ruined,


58
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,700
I'll...


59
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,140
I'll sue you!


60
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,900
I didn't do it...Not me.


61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,780

62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,340
we're old friends. 


63
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,860
Give me some time.


64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,060
So someone did it on purpose.


65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,170
I'm going to check them out one by one.


66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,780
There's no point of doing that at this moment.


67
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,540
The priority is to fix the dress


68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,060
 and ensure that Qianying can go on stage.


69
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,940
Otherwise, 


70
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,860
we'll be deemed as unprofessional.


71

72
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,579
I'm afraid


73
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,020
 your dress is about to take on a new look.


74
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,540
How?


75
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,460
How will you present it?


76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,420
I've already


77
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,340
seen the tear of the dress.


78
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,940
Even if you sew it back,


79
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,700
the lines are not as smooth as before.


80
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,060
There's only one option now.


81
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,140
We must change the look.


82
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Change?


83
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,579
I've put my heart and soul into this dress.


84
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,060
How can you just change it?


85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,980
I know this dress means a lot to you.


86
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,420
That's why I'm proposing this.


87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,330
If you don't change it now


88
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,780
because you're in a fit of anger,


89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,340
we both know the consequences.

94
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,380
all I'll lose is a model


95

The changed look is not bad,


112

Su Bei, don't announce the divorce yet.


564
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,460
I've found something important! 


565
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,220
I'm sorry. 


566
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,460
We were interrupted


567
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,700
 by a technical glitch.


568
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,140
So let's move on


569
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,580
and hear Ms. Su Bei's story


570
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,940
of her relationship


571
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,750
with Mr. Lu Nan.


572
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,780
You just asked me why I came back.


573
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,980
I came back because I wanted to


574
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,660
clear up the misunderstanding


575
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,060
 I had with Mr. Lu seven years ago


576
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,540
and to make up for the mistakes we made 	


577
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,420
when we were young and stupid.


578
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,380
As for the online rumors


579
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,740
about our disputes,


580
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,340
I'd like to tell you that


581
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,340
Mr. Lu is my partner


582
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,180
 and lover for the rest of my life.


583
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,060
Have you cleared up the misunderstanding


584
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,220
 between you and Mr. Lu now?


585
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,220
Misunderstandings were just misunderstandings.


586
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,700
We won't be bothered by them anymore.


587
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:23,640
[Yun Fan]


588
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,100
Su Bei came back to avenge Yu Qinglan's accident 


589
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,420
and to destroy Eminence and you.


590
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,250
Su Su, this is the man	


591
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,460
 who drove an Audi in and out of the factory


592
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,620
 on the day of the fire.


593
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,710
[Personnel Information]


594
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,300
But the factory's cameras were damaged, 


595
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,180
so no video of him was kept.


596
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,540
This photo was taken


597
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,740
by the camera in the kiosk


598
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,220
 near the factory.


599
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,340
What is yours will always be yours.


600
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,980
 If it's not, don't be obsessed with it.


601
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,900
Yezi, I'm so tired.


602
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,980
I feel like


603
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,100
 a fool.


604
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,060
Su Su, don't.


605
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,380
 It's not your fault.


606
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,650
Although Lu Nan wanted to 


607
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,660
acquire Auntie Lan's company at the beginning,


608
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,620
he mortgaged it instead.


609
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,050
They transferred a deposit, 


610
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,140
but the money 


611
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,540
went back to Eminence in the end,


612
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,260
and his relationship with Zhang Yuan, 


613
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,660
and the Fragrance Brocade you found in his wardrobe


614
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,700
and the recording I received.


615
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,460
Anyone would have been confused


616
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,740
by all these things.


617
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,860
What exactly happened?


618
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,420
Who was behind it?


619
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,540
And what role


620
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,940
 was Gu Chengze playing?


621
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,580
I'm so confused. 


622
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,780
I feel like my head is about to explode.


623
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,420
Su Su...


624
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,220
How am I supposed to face him?	


625
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,140
I have a date with him tonight.


626
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,380
Let's go to the restaurant.	


627
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,860
- OK.
- Go.


628
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,770
â™« Your silhouette in the mist â™«


629
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,790
â™« Is both far and near â™«	


630
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,160
â™« I'm following you â™«


631
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,850
â™« Carefully â™«


632
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,550
â™« Like a faint light â™«


633
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,700
â™« Held in my hand â™«


634
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,550
â™« Afraid that I might accidentally â™«


635
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,870
â™« Lose you â™«


636
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,240
â™« This road home â™«


637
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,100
â™« Is cold and quiet â™«


638
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,210
â™« People in the streetlights â™«	


639
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,780
â™« Fading away â™«


640
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,520
â™« The cold air is coming through again â™«


641
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
I can explain.


642
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,500
â™« The leaves are falling â™«


643
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,490
Explain what?


644
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,220
Explain how you took me


645
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,020
â™« How I wish I could turn around â™«


646
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,180
as a suspect?


647
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,680
â™« To see you â™«


648
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,260
I've thought of a million reasons why you'd come back.


649
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,670
â™« We both forgot to sign our names â™«


650
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,490
â™« On the letters sent to each other's hearts â™«


651
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,770
Either you want to get back together with me, 


652
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,500
or you hate me and come back for revenge.


653
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,600
â™« Forgot to find your eyes â™«


654
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,140
I can and must accept it.	


655
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,170
â™« Keeping a secret â™«


656
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Because I owe you these seven years.


657
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,410
â™« There's glass between you and me â™«


658
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,270
â™« I can see but I can't touch you â™«


659
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,580
But


660
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,290
â™« Pretend it's nothing â™«\


661
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,660
I never thought


662
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,780
â™« Letting go has become an addiction â™«


663
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,740
that you'd see me as a suspect.


664
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,060
â™« We're both glad â™«


665
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,660
You get close to me 


666
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,180
just to ruin me for good.


667
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,840
â™« Thinking it's better to have than to lose â™«


668
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,870
â™« Naive and unguarded â™«


669
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,580
Tonight,


670
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,730
â™« I surrendered myself â™«


671
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,900
I planned to let you know about


672
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,660
all my feelings for you.


673
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,740
Everything.


674
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,140
â™« If we were back where we were â™«


675
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,180
To let you know


676
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,370
â™« Would we meet again â™«


677
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,660
even though we'd lost seven years,	


678
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:38,030
â™« Would I still be addicted to waiting â™«	


679
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,940
I still love you


680
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,500
when I see you again.


681
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,540
To let you know


682
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,180
 even though my brain has left you out, 


683
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,260
my heart still beats for you.


684
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,460
To let you know


685
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,540
 even though I'm in charge of my life, 


686
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,100
I can't help


687
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,100
falling in love with you.


688
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,940
Sorry.


689
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,740
Mr. Lu, here's your cake.	


690
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,150
[Su Bei, will you accept me?]	


691
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,780
This cake 


692
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,660
here


693
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,340
is so ironic.


694
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,820
When you protected me at the bar and


695
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,300
held on to Eminence while I was in a coma, 


696
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,180
was that a sign of love 


697
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,780
or just a scheme?


698
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,680
â™« This road home â™«


699
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,540
â™« Is cold and clear â™«


700
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,660
â™« People in the streetlights â™«


701
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,220
â™« Fading away â™«


702

â™« The cold air is coming through again â™«


703
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,950
â™« The leaves are falling â™«


704
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,470
â™« How I wish I could turn around â™«\


705
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,120
â™« Too see you â™«


706
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,360
â™« We're both glad â™«


707
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,139
â™« Thinking it's better to have than to lose â™«


708
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,170
â™« Naive and unguarded â™«

00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,030
â™« I surrendered myself â™«


710
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,250
â™« If we were back where we were â™«


711
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,670
â™« Would we meet again â™«


712

â™« Would I still be addicted to waiting â™«	


713
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,840
â™« We don't want to believe â™«


714
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,489
â™« Beautiful dreams are broken too easily â™«


715
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,360
â™« We thought we were holding on to the memories â™« 


716
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,550
â™« And that would suffice â™« 


717
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,670
â™« The things in my heart are hiding in my eyes â™«


718
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,360
â™« Tears gently fall â™«


719
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,290
â™« Time is like a heavy rain â™«


720
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,120
â™« I'm addicted to lies â™«


721
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,980
â™« I still don't know the ending â™«


722
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,890
â™« Think the story may go on â™«


723
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,540
â™« Watching your back â™«


724
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,110
â™« Lying to myself â™«


725
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,020
â™« I can't talk about â™«


726
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,790
â™« Anything about you â™«


727
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:46,600
â™« Even when I'm sober, I'm addicted â™«


728
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,220
How does it feel to lose?
