[Episode 3]


4
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,300
I've always been nice to women,


5
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,700
so if you drink up these three shots,


6
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,020
I'll pretend nothing has happened.


7
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,100
What? You're afraid?


8
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,860
Then don't bother.


9
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,010
I'll talk to Mr. Lu then.


10
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,060
Gu Chengze is obviously trying
 to make things difficult for Su Bei.


11
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,020
So Mr. Gu is saying


12
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,580
as long as I drink these three shots,


13
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,539
we can move on


14
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,500
and continue


15
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,780
our cooperation, right?


16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,140
I'm in charge of Gu's Group,


17
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,650
so of course I'll keep my word.


18
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,100
Very good.


19
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,700
Ms. Su,


20
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,690
let me drink it for you.


21
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,930
No you can't.


22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,300
Mr. Gu said


23
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,260
 if I drink it,


24
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,180
we'll get


25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,020
the endorsement.


26
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,220
Interesting.


27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,700
Now I really regret that


28
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,940
 I didn't go all the way with Eminence


29
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,220
 to get you to work for me.


30
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,540
Mr. Gu,


31
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,460
if I were working under you,


32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,140
 you'd be paying me for cooperation.


33
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,450
But now,


34
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,060
I'm doing whatever it takes
 to beg you for cooperation. 


35
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,650
Which is more satisfying?


36
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,420
You know it very well, right?


37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,940
By the way,


38
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,370
this is our new model Liu Qianying.


39
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,980
Nice to see you, Mr. Gu.


40
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Kong's target customers


41
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,820
are the young people.


42
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,579
And Qianying can be 
a perfect brand ambassador for that.


43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,340
I'll definitely take Annie's recommendation


44
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,340
 into consideration.


45
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,370
Let's talk about it tonight. 


46
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,060
Mr. Gu,


47
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,090
please take care of my sister.


48
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,020
Zhao Long,


49
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,060
give her your contact number.


50
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,260
Ms. Su,


51
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,500
are you all right?


52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,220
Stop faking it.


53
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,140
You convince a man with just a few drinks.


54
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,300
I'd like to see


55
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,380
whether Mr. Lu will still want you	 


56
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,260
 when he finds out what you really are.


57
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,500
Ms. Su, 


58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,820
are you all right?	


59
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,860
I'm fine.


60
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,500
I...I'll go and have some tea with you.


61
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,420
Come.


62
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,740
Take it easy.


63
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,860
She tried to turn it around by drinking.


64
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,820
I don't think


65
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,810
she really has what it takes to be a good agent.


66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,420
You may not have feelings for Su Bei now, 	


67
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,980
but officially she's still your wife.


68
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,100
A wild wife makes you a cuckold.


69
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,380
Nice chandelier...


70
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,420
Mr. Lu,


71
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,780
before you get in the car, 	


72
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
I have a favor to ask.


73
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,460
Say it.


74
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,980
No matter what you see later, 


75
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,060
don't get mad.


76
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,140
What's in it?


77
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,330
I won't tell until you promise me.


78
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,420
Alright.


79
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,020
I'll take that as a yes
 if you don't say anything.


80
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,700
How dare you


81
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,020
let her get into my car?	


82
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,810
She's drunk and


83
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,900
insisted to get in the car, and 


84
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
I couldn't stop her.


85
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,340
Besides, I would feel bad


86
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,460
to leave a drunk woman in the garage  


87
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,020
in case that something happens to her.


88
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,260
Get her out of the car	


89
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,220
 right now.


90
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,060
That...


91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,900
That's not very nice.


92
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,860
Get a drunk woman out of the car	


93
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,500
 and leave her on the side of the road.


94
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,540
I'm too much of a man


95
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,860
 to do that.	


96
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,300
Besides, 


97
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,740
if someone takes a picture of that and makes it public,


98
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,020
it will be a disgrace for me!


99
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,250
You'll have to deal with this woman yourself later.


100
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,780
Alright.


101
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,300
Well...


102
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,650
I just remember that


103
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,420
 I have something to do at home.


104
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,020
 I have to go now.


105
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,460
Yunfan!


106
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:52,940
Yunfan!


107
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,140
What about her?


108
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,020
Deal with her yourself.


109
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,180
Love you!


110
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,220
Don't vomit in my car


111
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,140
 or you'll be finished	.


112
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:15,860
Out!


113
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,380
Out!


114
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,780
It hurts!


115
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,140
It stinks!


116
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,340
Why on earth did I marry her? 


117
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,500
Who are you?


118
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,700
Why are you so ugly?	


119
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,300
You say I'm ugly?


120
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,650
Don't lie down yet.


121
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,290
 Get up. 


122
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,460
Here.


123
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,300
Vomit here.


124
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,140
Don't make my couch dirty!	


125
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,580
Where did he put the fragrance brocade?


126
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,770
[Oxiracetam]


127
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,180
[Oxiracetam]


128
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,860
Why does he take this?


129
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,940
What?


130
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,860
 Water, water.


131
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,220
Nuts!


132
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,340
Get up! 


133
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,620
What's wrong with me?


134
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,670
What are you doing here?


135
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,860
Now that you're awake, 


136
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,190
get out of my place.


137
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,500
I'm having a serious headache.


138
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,500
So


139
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,030
you want me to throw you out?


140
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,780
Don't bother.


141
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,140
I'll leave myself


142
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,900
 when I'm sober.


143
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,310
But


144
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,340
 I'm not feeling well right now. 


145
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,940
I need to have a rest.


146
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,380
It's a big world out there. 


147
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,300
You can rest as much as you like.


148
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,700
Then I'll use Mr. Lu's place to wash up.


149
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Is that okay?


150
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,350
Sorry, no.


151
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,510
You tried to solve a problem in business by getting drunk.


152
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,060
That's your competence


153
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,390
and value?


154
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,060
As long as the problem is solved


155
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,220
it doesn't really matter what I do to achieve that.


156
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,380
Mr. Lu,


157
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,820
you sound more like


158
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,070
you're jealous.


159
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,140
Get out!


160
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,460
Thanks for taking me in last night.


161
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,020
Su Su,


162
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,740
as a woman, 


163
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
if you want to get close to Lu Nan as soon as possible,


164
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,300
you have to use your womanly charm


165
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,180
to trick him.


166
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,700
I don't think


167
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,630
he can be totally cool, calm and collected


168
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,060
when his wife


169
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,100
is so attractive.


170
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,550
But I must do it in the right way.


171
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,500
He's very wary of me now.


172
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,420
If I just go for him without a strategy,


173
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,820
then all our plans


174
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,830
will be to no avail.


175
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,580
Fine.


176
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
It's up to you.


177
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,950
Did you hear anything 


178
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,990
about Lu Nan's health


179
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,180
while I was away?


180
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,740
No.


181
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,260
But I found medication at his place


182
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,140
that treats brain damage and neurological deficits.


183
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,420
[Oxiracetam]


184
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,620
Brain damage?


185
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,460
Is the medicine for himself?


186
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,070
I'm not sure,


187
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,590
but it's true that


188
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,340
Lu Nan does forget about me.


189
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,780
So why don't you


190
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,060
 look into it?


191
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,180

378
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,990
We're in big trouble.


379
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,350
We should have known she was going to throw dirt on you


380
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,750
 and stopped her earlier.	


381
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,580
Now the shareholders are waiting for your explaination.


382
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,230
This woman


383
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,900
 not only wants me to acknowledge our relationship


384
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,830
but also forces me to act like a loving couple with her.


385
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,220
Because if I don't,


386
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,500
I can't clarify what's between me and Su Manni.


387
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,230
At this moment


388
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,980
when Eminence is ready to go public,


389
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,590
I have to do it her way.


390
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,350
She's something.


391
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,870
I was wondering why Ms. Su rose so quickly to the top.


392
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,710
Now I see she did it by sleeping with the important person.


393
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,860
Oh my god! What an asshole!


394
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,420
Two women for one man!


395
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,580
She's here. Hurry up.


396
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,710
Did you do it? 


397
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,220
Which one are you talking about?


398
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,180
Don't play dumb with me.


399
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,940
Who are you to question me?


400
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,500
A home-wrecker of your own sister's marriage?


401
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:24,900
You...


402
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,220
Mr. Lu.


403
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,460
Su Bei bosses me around again!


404
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,270
Sit down.


405
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,230
Ms. Su,


406
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,260
you should explain to us about what happened today.


407
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,710
My bad.


408
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,150
I've put on your desks


409
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,790
a contingency plan


410
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,580
 for the negative news 


411
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,020
based on my discussion with the PR department.


412
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,020
Check it out.


413
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,580
The trending topics last night


414
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,020
are not top searches any more.


415
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,660
And Ms. Su put other news out


416
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,980
to deflect the criticism towards us.


417
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,710
But we didn't expect that


418
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,950
another post about you went viral this morning.


419
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,060
So I'd like to ask Mr. Lu to decide	


420
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,900
 which plan we should go for.


421
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,020
The longer it takes, the more damage Eminence will suffer.


422
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,870
I promised Ms. Su that 


423
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,420
I wouldn't interfere with any decision you make


424
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,190
 about our subsidiary.


425
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,820
Mr...Mr. Lu.


426
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,260
You can't agree to this! I...


427
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,420
Thanks for your trust, Mr. Lu.


428
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,180
Then


429
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,790
let's go for the last option. 


430
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,030
Within one hour, 


431
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,380
we'll have the legal department issue
 a letter of recourse


432
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,390
and post the following statements
 on our official account.


433
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,300
First,


434
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,550
we acknowledge that we're indeed married


435
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,780
and we keep it private for personal reasons only.	


436
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,150
There is no marital discord, 


437
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,340
and no separation.


438
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,700
Second,


439
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,340
upload a photo of me and Su Manni,


440
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,180
denying the rumors of cheating	


441
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,460
and sisterly discord.


442
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,260
Third,


443
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,510
mention and warn those


444
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,460
 who have spoken out of turn online.


445
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,350
Last,


446
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,180
you will 


447
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,980
 make a video


448
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,940
of your alleged affair with Mr. Lu


449
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,540
and post it on Weibo to explain yourself.	


450
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,550
Make it short and simple.


451
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,590
I'll send you


452
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,740
exactly what to post later.


453
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,260
Before the criticism subsides,


454
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:00,940
I'll suspend all of Su Manni's endorsements


455
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,620
in the domestic market.


456
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,340
No! Mr. Lu,


457
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,870
 I just got the endorsement for L.


458
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,150
Do as she said.


459
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,860
-Ms. Su, please stay. You can leave now.
- I...


460
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,180
Let's wait and see!


461
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,990
I know what Mr. Lu wants to ask.


462
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,630
I was the one who let out the word about our marriage.


463
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,910
The reasons are simple.


464
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,700
First,


465
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,260
In Eminence Starlight,


466
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,470
I'm Annie,


467
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,790
and I can't let Manni take the lead over me.


468
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,740
Otherwise,


469
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,420
I won't be able to manage the company in the future.


470
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,550
Second,


471
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,470
with the power of the internet,	


472
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,340
 it's only a matter of time


473
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,300
before they can find out about our relationship.


474
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,300
So I must take preemptive action


475
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,060
to turn the tide.


476
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,940
If you were in my position, 


477
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,340
you'd do the same thing.


478
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,300
So Ms. Su had already forseen this.


479
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,780
I admire capable people, 


480
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,700
but I loathe scheming ones.


481
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,660
I'll be cooperative


482
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,900
and make public our marriage.


483
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
But at the same time,


484
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,190
please behave as Mrs. Lu.


485
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,110
We've come this far.


486
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,220
There is no way 


487
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,140
you can deny our relationship anymore.


488
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,860
Have you found Zhang Yuan?


489
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,700
No. I'm still looking for him.


490
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,090
[Eminence Group]


491
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,020
-Yeah. Why hasn't he come out?
- What's wrong?


492
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,260
-It's been a long time.
- Right.


493
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,990
Yeah?


494
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:57,980
I've checked it.


495
00:25:59,330 --> 00:25:59,770
Here they are!


496
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,050
[Eminence Group Co., Ltd.]


497
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,390
- Here they are!
- Here they are!


498
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,110
- Mr. Lu!
- Mr. Lu!


499
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,700
- Mr. Lu!
- Mr. Lu!


500
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,950
- Mr. Lu, tell us!
- Mr. Lu!


501
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,450
Tell us!


502
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,860
- In response to the news about me,
- Mr. Lu!


503
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,020
I have two points to declare.


504
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,390
First,


505
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,350
I have been married to


506
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,620
Ms. Su since seven years ago.


507
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,860
We have trusted each other 


508
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,460
and supported each other all the way,


509
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
and we have never betrayed each other
 because of our long-distance relationship.


510
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:31,980
Second,


511
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,590
There's nothing


512
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,470
between me and Ms. Su Manni.


513
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,620
For the smear and rumors


514
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,900
about our marriage,


515
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,100
Eminence will take legal action


516
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,980
 to pursue the matter to the end.


517
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,820
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,


518
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,790
since you're so much in love,


519
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,660
then why did Mrs. Lu 	


520
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,470
spend the last seven years living abroad?


521
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,500
-Right.
-Right.


522
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,300
Tell us.


523
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,030
-Tell us.
Tell us, Mr. Lu.


524
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,700
Tell us.


525
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,060
I would like to thank Mr. Lu


526
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,830
 for giving me seven years to grow myself


527
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,950
into Annie.


528
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,070
Now I return to Eminence as a top agent.


529
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,900
All our effort is worth it.


530
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
I hope my wife


531
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,260
 can achieve her dream


532
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,500
 and contribute to Eminence Starlight.


533
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,420
Take pictures!


534
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,390
-What a loving couple!
-Right!


535
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,510
-So sweet!
-Right!


536
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,540
So sweet!


537
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,150
Yeah.


538
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,130
Here! Look at me!


539
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,080
Take more pictures.


540
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,050
-Here!
-Here!


541
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,940
What are you doing here?


542
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,750
It's rare to see you so disturbed.


543
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,110
You're trespassing my place.


544
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,350
I can call the police


545
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,620
to arrest you for


546
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,700
trespass.


547
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,990
We are legally married	


548
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,540
 and here I am at my home.


549
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
But my husband is going to 


550
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,790
accuse me of trespassing.


551
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,820
 If the police found out about this,


552
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,540
will they charge you


553
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,500
 with obstruction?


554
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,590
Su Bei,


555
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,110
I know it's impossible 


556
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,070
to find a man


557
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,980
 as perfect as me in this world, 	


558
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,660
but you can't force me to love you.


559
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,590
So


560
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,740
if you want me


561
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,950
 to show you any respect,


562
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,780
then go back to wherever you came from.


563
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,060
Mr. Lu,


564
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,630
everybody knows we're married


565
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,710
and we're in the spotlight now.


566
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,700
If those journalists find out 


567
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,870
we're not living together


568
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,660
and word gets out that we don't really get along,


569
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,900
don't you think it will


570
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,500
 affect Eminence's IPO at this point?


571
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,070
You and I both know


572
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,620
 what's more important at this moment.


573
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,380
Co-habitation?


574
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
You really like me, huh?


575
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,030
You're trying very hard.


576
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,190
And you want a lot, don't you?


577
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,270
You'll get all the other party's assets after a divorce.	


578
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,700
If you're not happy with it, 


579
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,540
you can change it.


580
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,580
This clause binds both of us.


581
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,470
Even if we do get a divorce,


582
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,820
 the law will decide who gets what.


583
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,900
Remember, 


584
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,180
I only let you move in


585
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,470
for the sake of the company.


586
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,820
[Man's signature: Lu Nan]


587
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,500
Your room is on the second floor.


588
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,300
You're not allowed to be in my presence


589
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,910
 as long as I'm around.	


590
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,060
Mr. Lu,


591
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,310
that's too much to ask for.


592
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,660
The door is right there.


593
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,260
You can leave if you don't like it.


594
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,900
Go!


595
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,190
Grandma, why are you here?


596
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,940
 Grandma?


597
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,300
Open the door!	


598
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,540
Verification failed.


599
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,740
Su Bei!


600
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,710
Open the door!


601
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,740
Open the door!	


602
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,100
Open the door!	


603
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,830
Mr. Lu.


604
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,020
Su Bei!


605
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,220
Open the door now!	


606
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,670
Or I'll let you pay the price!


607
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,820
Sorry, Mr. Lu.


608
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,470
I locked the door by accident.


609
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,950
I'm really sorry.


610
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,500
Su Bei!


611
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,820
But there's something wrong with the door


612
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,020
and I can't open it.


613
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,860
I'm asking you as your boss now.


614
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,780
Open the door right away!	


615
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,900
It's not working time.


616
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,180
So I won't listen to you.


617
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,380
I really can't open it.


618
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,020
You must know the consequences of doing this to me!


619
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,740
Mr. Lu.


620
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,220
 I have a stomachache.


621
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,620
I must use the toilet.


622
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,940
Please wait outside for a while


623
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,260
and breathe


624
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,700
some fresh air.


625
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,340
See you!


626
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,710
Don't ignore my warning!


627
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,100
The password is Lu Nan's birthday?


628
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,710
Verification failed


629
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,510
Su Bei, open it!


630
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,350
Shit.


631
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,860
Lu Nan.


632
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,030
What's wrong?


633
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,150
Why are you here?


634
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,710
Su Bei said something's wrong here.


635
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,590
You...


636
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,470
What happened?


637
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,340
Is the password grandma's birthday?


638
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,100
Verification failed. Please re-enter.


639
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,550
It's neither Lu Nan's birthday


640
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,820
 nor grandma's birthday.


641
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,430
What is it exactly?


642
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,110
No.


643
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,780
If I put the wrong password again,


644
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,740
it may call the police automatically.


645
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,590
If you dare to laugh,


646
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,140
I'll send you to Africa tomorrow


647
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,070
and let lionesses entertain you.


648
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,750
 Su Bei has gone too far!


649
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,740
How dare she push you around!


650
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,380
We must teach her a lesson.


651
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,910
Kick her out of my house tomorrow.


652
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
You...even you can't handle her,


653
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,550
let alone me.


654
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,030
Then I'll fire you.


655
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,580
Don't!


656
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,990
It's hard to find a job now.


657
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,220
You can't take it out on me.


658
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,580
Hello?


659
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,340
Ye.


660
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,420
I found a safe at Lu Nan's place.


661
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,830
I entered the wrong password twice.


662
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,990
If I make it wrong for the third time, it will probably call the police.


663
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,340
I want you to


664
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
prepare some things for me.


665
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,790
I'll send you the list on Wechat.


666
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,100
Alright.


667
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,460
Besides,


668
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,580
 it's good to let her live with you.


669
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,900
I mean, 


670
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,580
it's a good idea to have her around 


671
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,860
so we can find out what she's up to, 


672
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,740
right?


673
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,420
Why don't you just come over to my place


674
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,660
 for the night?


675
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,940
Tomorrow we'll teach her a lesson.


676
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,900
If you tell anyone 


677
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,430
about what happened today, 


678
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,220
you'll be fired.


679
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:02,900
Don't worry.


680
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,740
I'm a fish. 


681
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,990
My memory only lasts for seven seconds.


682
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,060
Fei, you know what?


683
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,780
In one day, 


684
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,909
I've already had six partners to cancel my contract!


685
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,909
And your brother listens to everything she says.


686
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,590
No way.


687
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,830
My brother promised grandma 


688
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,340
that he'd divorce Su Bei.


689
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,949
And the divorce agreement...


690
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,820
Are they really going to get a divorce?


691
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,510
Why?


692
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,460
I don't know.


693
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,980
I heard from grandma about it.


694
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,659
You must not tell others.


695
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,260
Why don't you tell me everything? 


696
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,710
You know me very well!


697
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,790
Is your brother going to...


698
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,670
Of course not.


699
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,909
He's hurt so much by Su Bei


700
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,139
and determined to divorce her.


701
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,550
They're negotiating the share of assets now,


702
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,949
but they haven't reached an agreement yet.


703
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,020
But they're getting divorced, 


704
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,500
and still living together.


705
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,310
They're still a couple,


706
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,830
so of course they live together.


707
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,780
What I'm worried about is that	


708
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,940
although grandma doesn't like Su Bei,


709
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,740
as long as Su Bei is pregnant, 


710
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,940
she'll have to accept her sooner or later.


711
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,380
It's time for brother to have a kid.


712
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,180
 I don't want the mother of the child to be Su Bei either.


713
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,820
But as long as she gives birth to an heir for the Lu family, 


714
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,470
I have to accept her.


715
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,100
Fei, how can you think that way?


716
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,670
Su Bei is just pretending to be pathetic


717
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,060
 to make your brother fall for her.


718
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,350
I don't think	


719
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,100
if your brother knew the way she really is, 


720
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,150
he would still like her so much.


721
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,860
Manni,


722
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,780
take it easy.


723
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,710
 I'll go to my brother's place


724
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,100
in a few days


725
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,300
 to see what's going on.


726
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,700
Verification failed.


727
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,620
Verification failed.


728
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,750
I've changed the password.


729
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,990
Mr. Lu, is this a retaliation?


730
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,740
No.


731
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,390
The air outside is fresher, right?	


732
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,740
Enjoy!


733
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,860
Honey.


734
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,550
How did you get in? 


735
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,430
Through the back door.


736
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,580
You don't know your own house?


737
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,580
Su Bei, watch your language.


738
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,150
Who told you you can call me honey?


739
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,820
The government!


740
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,020
The marriage certificate says we're husband and wife.


741
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,790
Mr. Lu, please don't be mad at me.


742
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,660
I didn't mean to keep you out yesterday.


743
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,870
I wanted to ask Yunfan to open the door for me.


744
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,430
But when I came out of the bathroom, 


745
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,110
you were both gone.


746
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,180
Stop it.


747
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Don't think you can get my attention


748
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,270
in this way.


749
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,590
I'm telling you the truth.


750
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,300
I apologize, okay?


751
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,580
This bitch is making fun of me.


752
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,060
Lu Nan, what are you doing?


753
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,550
Come here.


754
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,910
Lu Nan.


755
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,980
It has been a while.


756
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,700
 I need some time to get used to it.


757
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,460
You can't get enough of me, can you?


758
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,860
I will make you happy.


759
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,590
What?


760
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,070
You can't wait


761
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,460
to rekindle our love, can you?


762
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,340
Do you like it?


763
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,620
You think I'll fall for


764
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,230
a body like that?


765
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,780
If you have any self-respect, 


766
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,350
don't strip yourself naked


767
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,070
 in front of your wife, 


768
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,020
whom you say you want to divorce.


769
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,550
You're a lousy man!


770
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,830
Lousy?


771
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,550
Then let me show you something.
