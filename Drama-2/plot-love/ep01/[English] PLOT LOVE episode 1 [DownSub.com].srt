00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,860
Mr. Lu.


382
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,650
Did you stay in the room


383
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,540
 with Su Manni?


384
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,900
Does it mean that


385
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,420
you and Su Manni are a couple?


386
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,220
Right, Mr. Lu.


387
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,820
Is it true? Tell us.


388
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,500
You know what?


389
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,060
If I slap you now


390
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,700
and tell everybody that you seduced your brother-in-law,


391
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,380
what would the paparazzi react?


392
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,580
You were alone in a room together.


393
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,250
Does that mean


394
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,380
you're about to get married?


395
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,180
Right, Mr. Lu.


396
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,900
Alone in a room together?


397
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,300
You can see for yourselves.


398
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,180
Hurry up!


399
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,340
Sorry guys.


400
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,780
Sorry to disappoint you.


401
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,330
Mr. Lu and I


402
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,780
are just friends.


403
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,940
A crazy fan of mine


404
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,100
harassed me 


405
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,340
and I hurt my leg by accident.


406
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,420
So Mr. Lu


407
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,220
was very nice to bring me back.


408
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,670
This lady


409
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,660
is my elder sister.


410
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,100
She heard that I was injured


411
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,220
and came to see me.


412
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,020
So you're biological sisters?


413
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,100
Really?


414
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,220
Yes.


415
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,170
We're sisters of the same father.


416
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,700
Take a picture!


417
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,940
Take more pictures!


418
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,660
A few more from this angle.


419
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,460
We have a situation here.


420
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,570
I'll see you later.


421
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,570
Are you really going to


422
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,300
take their offer?


423
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,140
You know what Auntie Lan meant to me.


424
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,980
Only when I get close to Lu Nan


425
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,020
 can I find the fragrance brocade.


426
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,100
But the information and evidence we have 


427
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,660
is not enough to prove that


428
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,420
 Lu Nan took the brocade.


429
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,260
But he's the most likely.


430
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,410
Auntie Lan called me 


431
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,660
before the accident.


432
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,930
She said that Lu Nan came to her several times


433
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,580
and offered a high price to buy the brocade.


434
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,140
But she refused.


435
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,700
According to our investigation,


436
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,330
Zhang Yuan came


437
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,740
soon after that.


438
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,100
Then on the night before the delivery,


439
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,460
 the factory caught on fire.


440
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,340
Don't you think


441
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,940
 it's all too much of a coincidence?


442
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,260
Now I see.


443
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,180
You're right.


444
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,260
But Su Su,


445
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,140
Lu Nan went to great lengths to get you into Eminence,


446
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,100
because he didn't know that


447
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,300
you're actually the famous model agent Annie.


448
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,540
You and him...


449
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,980
are a married couple who has been separated for seven years.


450
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,620
Married couple...


451
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,660
Don't you remember that


452
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,020
you signed a divorce agreement


453
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,060
that you wouldn't be able to get anything if you divorce.


454
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,060
So...


455
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,620
What are you going to do about it?


456
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,540
 Since I didn't get a divorce then,


457
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,700
 I'm not going to


458
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,140
 let him go now. 


459
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,420
Grudges old and new.


460
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,500
Our seven years of marriage feud


461
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,660
must be settled now.


462
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,340
Even if we get a divorce,


463
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,940
you better stay abroad 


464
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,220
 and not come back


465
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:20,980
without my consent.


466
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,780
I'm leaving.


467
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,290
I won't bother you.


468
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,860
You're just as ruthless as before.


469
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,770
I'll hit back, 


470
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,900
twice as hard!


471
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,140
So


472
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,180
is she really my wife?


473
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,700
If her name is Su Bei, 


474
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,100
then yes.


475
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm married?


476
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,610
You'd better tell me what happened,


477
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,690
 or I'll send you to Africa for business.


478
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,260
I...


479
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,860
I promised your grandma


480
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,300
 I wouldn't tell you about


481
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,300
 your marriage with Su Bei seven years ago.


482
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,900
So you do as she says?


483
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,220
Who's your boss


484
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,540
and who pays your salary?


485
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,660
Right.


486
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,180
Yes, you're my boss,


487
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,330
and you pay my salary, 


488
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,180
but you have to listen to your grandma too.


489
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,580
Why did she keep it a secret from me?	


490
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,420
She...


491
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,580
She doesn't want to make you upset.


492
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,180
After all,


493
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,220
we called Su Bei many times 


494
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,620
during the five years when you were in a coma  


495
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
after the car accident,


496
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,420
but she never came back.


497
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,700
Anyway, 


498
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,460
when your grandma returns, 


499
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,300
you can ask her yourself. 


500
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:55,860
But


501
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,210
 Su Bei went abroad.


502
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,260
I tried so hard but didn't find her.


503
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,860
Why is she suddenly back now?


504
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,100
That's weird.


505
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,980
Have someone investigate


506
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,540
what she did abroad over the past few years	


507
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,100
 and why she came back.


508
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,720
[Nanxi City Hospital]


509
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,020
Auntie Lan,


510
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,300
I'm back.


511
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,860
You were the one she thought of the most


512
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,220
 before the accident.


513
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,900
She'd be so happy to know


514
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,060
 you're back.


515
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,260
Jiajia,


516
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,020
thank you so much


517
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,180
for what you've done.


518
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,140
Sorry.


519
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,940
After the accident, 


520
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,540
everyone at the factory left. 


521
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,020
It's all my fault.


522
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,100
No. You've done a good job.


523
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,620
She has dedicated herself to the company.


524
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,330
But now there's nothing left.


525
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,210
No.


526
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,300
 I came back


527
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,900
 to find out the truth


528
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
about who tried to kill her.


529
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,820
How's


530
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,860
the investigation going about the factory?


531
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,980
On the day of the fire, 


532
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,260
the factory's camera circuit was broken.	


533
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,540
So,


534
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,820
 there was no evidence left.


535
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,180
I asked Yu Jia about Zhang Yuan.


536
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
She said she didn't know either.


537
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,460
She only knew that Zhang Yuan contacted Auntie Lan on his own initiative. 


538
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,660
By the way,


539
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,780
Zhang Yuan was sent to the detention center by Lu Nan today.


540
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,100
He probably won't be out for a dozen of days.


541
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,220
I'll go see him then.


542
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,820
There are so many coincidences.


543
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,740
It's unlikely that


544
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,700
they're all isolated incidents.


545
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,220
Go ahead with the investigation.


546
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,420
 It's a pity that we didn't seize


547
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,980
the great opportunity today.


548
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,020
Su Manni is lame.


549
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,780
Actually,


550
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,380
it's not a complete waste.


551
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,420
The super model seduced her brother-in-law.


552
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,900

553
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,620
it'll make next week's headlines, right?


554
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,660
But...


555
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,260
Was Lu Nan


556
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,140
really pretending that he didn't know you?


557
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,410
Whether he's pretending


558
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,500
or not,


559
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 I'm looking forward to 


560
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,940
what he'll do next.

After all, we've been married for seven years.


569
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,340
You talk so harsh.


570
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,340
It's heartbreaking!


571
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,380
Watch your language.


572
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,020
We've been separated 


573
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
for seven years,


574
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,700
so our relationship is virtually over.


575
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,860
That's what you really think of me?


576
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,340
Stop it.


577
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,820
Charm offense doesn't work on me.


578
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,100
I almost hit your car


579
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,180
and gave you a fright.


580
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,540
So take the money


581
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,580
as my apology.


582
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,900
I don't like to owe people anything, 


583
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,060
especially you.


584
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,140
What do you mean?	


585
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,620
 What do you mean?


586
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,290
[Eminence Group]


587
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
Hello, Annie.


588
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,500
I'm Tang Xin, Eminence's administrative director.


589
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,180
Welcome on board!


590
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:12,980
I've completed


591
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,260
 all the paperwork for you.


592
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,740
Mr. Lu is still in a meeting, 


593
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,500
so I'll show you around first.


594
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,140
This way, please.


595
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,690
I've sent you the file.


596
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,420
OK.


597
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,100
Find the information.


598
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,090
The whole building is owned by Eminence.


599
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,500
The top floor is the headquarters. 


600
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,900
We're on the sixth floor,


601
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,860
where you'll be in charge of


602
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,300
 the Eminence Starlight Agency.


603
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,700
Our models are all very excited


604
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,450
that you're coming.


605
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,580
They've been waiting for you early on.


606
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,900
All of them?


607
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,100
Except for those who're at work,


608
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,130
the rest are all here.


609
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,060
I'll take you to meet them. 


610
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,500
It's over there.


611
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,300
I'm sorry. I have to take a call. 


612
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,860
No worries. I'll go myself. 


613
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,540
Alright. The model training room is right over there.


614
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,660
OK.


615
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,700
Hello?


616
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,740
Did you hear that


617
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,820
Annie is really of something?


618
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,900
I heard that when Juli first started with Annie,


619
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,580
she was still nobody.


620
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,780
Then Juli made it to the Big Four


621
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,020
in less than four years.


622
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,740
She was endorsed by top brands thanks to Annie.


623
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,580
Really?


624
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,820
Yes!


625
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,690
Every little connection and resource 


626
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,780
that Annie has


627
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,700
is world class!


628
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
With her credentials,


629
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,290
she can help you rise to international fame


630
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,380
even though you're a loser.


631
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,540
Exactly.


632
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,900
You're new here, aren't you?


633
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,380
It's my first day here.


634
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,020
But


635
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,100
I read online that


636
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,740
Annie is extremely strict.


637
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,620
It's a living hell


638
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,660
to work with her.


639
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,140
I heard she's really crazy.


640
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,500
Could she be a harsh and callous woman?


641
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,820
I think so.


642
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,780
If not,


643
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,540
then how come she never


644
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,780
takes interviews and does publicity?


645
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,860
Right.


646
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,340
You know what?


647
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,020
I think she must be


648
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,900
an old, ugly witch.


649
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,260
Stop it.


650
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,660
Annie is coming soon.


651
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,540
Who do you think you are?


652
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,580
A rookie who's never walked on runway.


653
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,340
Who are you


654
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,380
 to tell us what to do?


655
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,580
Sister Manni. Sister Manni. Sister Manni.


656
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,620
Here you are.


657
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,340
Sister Manni. Sister Manni.


658
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,860
You look gorgeous!


659
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,380
I love your lipstick color!


660
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,340
Right!


661
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,820
Hey you, rookie!


662
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,700
Sister Manni is here.


663
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,100
Come and say hi.


664
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,780
She's the chief here.


665
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,100
Do you want to say hi?
