[Episode 11]


4
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,900
I think,


5
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,660
you need to reexamine


6
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,700
your relationship with Lu Nan.


7
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,460
A man


8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,460
who forgot you and fell in love with you again.


9
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,020
A man


10
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,289
who risked his life to save you from danger.


11
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,810
A man 


12
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,060
who will give you everything he has.


13
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,580
You really don't find this man


14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,650
attractive at all?


15
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,170
Yes I do.


16
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,900
So I'm sacred.


17
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,170
This time,


18
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,100
I approached him with a purpose.


19
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,020
I lied about Chris.


20
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,620
I even tried to destroy everything he had.


21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,100
But I'm afraid he really did it.


22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,259
I'm also afraid


23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,300
he didn't do it.


24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,860
After this period of time,


25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,860
I feel that Lu Nan


26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,620
is not a mercenary person by nature.


27
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,740
I think 


28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,300
we misunderstood him about Auntie Lan.


29
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,660
Su Su,


30
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,660
look into your heart.


31
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,500
This


32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,060
will make it easier for you.


33
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,500
My life would have been easier


34
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,940
if I hadn't been hesitating.


35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,460
At least I can be ruthless.


36
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,700
I don't have to 


37
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,140
struggle like this.


38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,540
I don't want to think about it anymore.


39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,700
Let's


40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,780
get to the bottom of this first.


41
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,020
In this way,


42
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,020
 I will live up to Auntie Lan's expectations.


43
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,820
I will be relieved, too.


44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,220
If I find out who's behind this,


45
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,579
I'll kick his ass.

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,820
Hello.


48
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,500
Annie.


49
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,420
I was wondering if you could keep your promise


50
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,420
to buy me lunch tomorrow.


51
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
Mr. Gu asks me out.


52
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,500
So I have to make time for you no matter what.


53
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,700
How about this.


54
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,500
Send me the address.


55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,540
Twelve at noon.


56
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,340
See you.


57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,020
OK.


58
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,860
See you.


59
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,740
Pull over ahead.


60
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,020
Pull over here.


61
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,980
I‘ll just walk there.


62
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,260
Why?


63
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,540
You don't want to stay with me?


64
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,260
In public,


65
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,740
you're still my boss.


66
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,420
You'd better be more cautious.


67
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,700
Do you want to be


68
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,420
called jobbery?


69
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,500
You care about me.


70
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,100
Last night, I took a big first step.


71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,500
I didn't take your feelings into account.


72
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,940
About that,


73
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,700
I'm not in a hurry either.


74
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,620
We can take our time.


75
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,260
Now that you have forgiven me,


76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,380
let's have lunch together.


77
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,660
I have an appointment today.


78
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,260
Next time.


79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,570
With whom?


80
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,860
Gu Yan.


81
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,100
Did Gu Chengze know


82
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,460
you came for me?


83
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,420
Yes.


84
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,380
Well,


85
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,980
was he cool with it?


86
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,340
There are no permanent enemies,


87
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,660
only mutual benefits.


88
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,740
I don't think he's that stupid.


89
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,899
I guess


90
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,700
I just worry too much about it.


91
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,250
No.


92
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,420
I want to thank you for worrying about me.


93
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,060
Did he know about


94
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,420
the kid?


95
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,380
Aren't you going to tell him?


96
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,580
Don't worry.


97
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,100
Your secret is safe with me.


98
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,980
I just don't think


99
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,340
it's fair to the kid.


100
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,940
What is fairness?


101
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,860
Is there such a thing as fairness?


102
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,659
You're right.


103
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,300
But it must be hard for you


104
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
to raise the kid alone.


105
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,500
I don't feel tired


106
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,260
with him.


107
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,050
Chris is lucky to


108
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,260
have you as his mother.


109
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,780
After all, not everyone


110
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,580
can be that lucky.


111
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,490
Are you OK?


112
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,610
I'm fine.


113
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,780
I'm just a bit emotional.


114
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,940
Maybe because I remember something when I was a kid.


115
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,500
If she had been like you


116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,540
at that time,


117
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,940
I wouldn't have been left in an orphanage


118
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,940
at that age.


119
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,540
And I wouldn't have been bullied


120
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,890
for being an illegitimate son.


121
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,060
It's all over.


122
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,659
Besides,


123
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,380
you're a successful man now.


124
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,700
The good is yet to come.


125
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,100
Thank you.


126
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,660
What's wrong?


127
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,260
Zhang Yuan may have in cahoots with Gu Chengze.


128
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,980
Based on what we found,


129
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,180
Gu Chengze's assistant


130
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,660
and Zhang Yuan's mistress come from the same town.


131
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,210
They have stayed in touch.


132
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,850
And,


133
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,860
the money that Zhang Yuan made up the deficit


134
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,500
was unknown.


135
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,460
Even if he wants to have a patron,


136
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,820
he shouldn't have turn to a loser.


137
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,780
What's wrong with him?


138
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,180
That loser

to talk about...tripartite cooperation.


141
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,340
Sure enough,

there're Gu's people everywhere.


143
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,420
I smell jealousy.

Just now,


145
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,980
I saw Su Bei


146
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,659
having dinner with Gu Yan.


147
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,820
They were chatting and laughing.


148
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,380
All right.

The papers are all upside down.


151
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,060
Drop the act.


152
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,140
Tell me.


153
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,740
What happened?


154
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,900
Your confession failed again?


155
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,020
Didn't I tell you to do it like you really mean it?


156
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,620
I did.


157
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,740
But she said I was crazy.


158
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,620
W...what did you do?


159
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,780
I drafted a divorce settlement overnight.


160
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,860
Doesn't she want my property?


161
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,900
I didn't keep anything for myself.


162
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Wasn't that sincere enough?


163
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,620
No offense.


164
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,090
But you are indeed crazy.


165
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,060
Besides,


166
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,740
you disliked her adopted son before,


167
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,620
and now you‘re insulting her for eyeing your money.


168
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,659
If I were Su Bei,


169
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,460
I would also choose the gentle and considerate Gu Yan,


170
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,020
rather than you, an old dull man,


171
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,340
who doesn't get women.


172
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,340
Fine.


173
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,100
You tell me.


174
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,010
What am I gonna do?


175
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,340
What?!


176
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,460
Get down there.


177
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,900
Show them your power and gain the upper hand.

179

180
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,420
I already did it.


181
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,700
Just go.

His EQ...


184
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,580
It tastes good.


185
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:12,980
Yes.


186
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,260
But I think we can 


187
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,140
try another one next time.


188
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,420
It's also very tasty.


189
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,370
Didn't you say we would have dinner together after business?


190
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,500
How can you forget your husband when you work?


191
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,780
Mr. Lu, you must have mistaken.


192
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,020
I came to Su Bei


193
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,180
just to talk about


194
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,100
the tripartite cooperation with Sia.


195
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,220
I think Mr. Gu came for the wrong person.


196
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,059
Shouldn't you come to me to talk about cooperation?


197
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,260
Besides, you‘ve already found Yun Fan.


198
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,380
What's going on here?


199
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,659
Isn't that because Mr. Lu


200
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,539
hasn't replied to me yet?


201
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,860
So I just stop by


202
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,900
to see someone I know.


203
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,060
But now that Mr. Lu has said yes,


204
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,500
my trip is worth it.


205
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,620
Did I say yes?


206
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,220
Mr. Gu,


207
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,340
I think you flatter yourself again.


208
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,860
I have things to do with my wife. Excuse me.


209
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,060
Brother.


210
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,180
This is the soup grandma asked me to bring to my sister-in-law.


211
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,620
Take it back.


212
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,420
And tell grandma she doesn't have to prepare these.


213
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,980
But it was grandma


214
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,060
who made it for sister-in-law.


215
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,380
She said it was good for a pregnant woman.


216
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,100
If I carry it back like this,


217
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,780
she'll be upset.


218
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,820
You're pregnant?


219
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,220
Yes.


220
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,460
She's pregnant.


221
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,260
So Mr. Gu,


222
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,380
please behave yourself in the future.


223
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,860
You must tell me exactly


224
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,700
what work you just talked about.


225
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,660
Have we met somewhere before?


226
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,300
Maybe.


227
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,690
Tell me.


228
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,010
What's your relationship with Gu Yan?


229
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,300
Partnership.


230
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,220
Partnership?


231
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,580
Why don't I remember


232
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,900
Eminence had any business


233
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,060
with a manager like him?


234
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,900
Are you


235
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,180
jealous again?


236
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,060
You turned me down


237
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,180
because of him.


238
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,580
Should I be jealous?


239
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,820
Besides,


240
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
you smiled at him.


241
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,660
You never smile at me like that.


242
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,020
He and I were really talking about business.


243
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,100
By the way,


244
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,140
Sia


245
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,220
is very interested in the thorough dyeing process we're developing.


246
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,620
But after all,


247
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,020
it has its drawbacks.


248
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,180
And Gu's market share


249
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,420
is far beyond us.


250
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,540
So,


251
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,780
would you like to consider


252
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,820
tripartite cooperation?


253
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,700
Do you really want a tripartite relationship?


254
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,340
At present, it seems


255
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,980
tripartite cooperation


256
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,740
is more conducive to us to get Sia's case.


257
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,500
Are you sure


258
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,540
it is not about Gu Yan?


259
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,780
I can keep it professional.


260
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,260
Gu's market share


261
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,860
is far beyond us,


262
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:23,860
but,


263
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,260
they are rigid in their business model


264
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,020
and do not pay attention to e-commerce platforms.


265
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
Give me one year


266
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,140
and I'll build our company stronger than them.


267
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,820
Although


268
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,700
there're still some problems


269
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,740
with our thorough dyeing technology,


270
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,180
we still stand at chance


271
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,540
to win the competition.


272
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,180
Lu Nan, are you a dog?


273
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,860
You can bite me back.


274
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,380
Not here.


275
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,460
Here.


276
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,660
Mr. Lu.


277
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,740
They haven't arrived yet.


278
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,020
Let's go.


279
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,420
Wait a little while.


280
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,780
My time is precious!


281
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,900
Since he doesn't show any respect,


282
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,180
let's see who'll win the competition to work with Sia.


283
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,340
Sorry, Mr. Lu.


284
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,700
We're late.


285
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,740
You stand to meet us.


286
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,540
We don't deserve it.


287
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,820
Sorry, Mr. Lu.


288
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,260
Ms. Su.


289
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,620
Sorry. There was traffic jam


290
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,690
on the way here.


291
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,300
What are you sorry for?


292
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,260
You are so close to Ms. Su.


293
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,980
Ms. Su and Mr. Lu are family.


294
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,420
 I hope you don't mind us being a little late.


295
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,340
Sit down, please.


296
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,890
Come on, Ms. Su.


297
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,980
I'd like to drink a toast to you.


298
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,180
Come on.


299
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,060
Lu Nan.


300
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,420
Let's have a drink.


301
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,500
Lu Nan.


302
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,180
Sia


303
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,940
is interested in working with you.


304
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,220
But the market


305
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,500
is changing.


306
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,540
Before the last moment,


307
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,820
no one knows what will happen.


308
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,260
Sia is not stupid.


309
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,300
A strong partner confers a lot of benefits.


310
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,860
If it wants to enter the domestic market,


311
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,740
it has to depend on us,


312
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,460
our brand,


313
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,460
our resources,


314
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,500
and our market dominance.


315
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:22,900
You're right.


316
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,300
Gu's Group 


317
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,620
does have a higher market share


318
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,820
than Eminence.


319
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,780
But,


320
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,620
Sia now seems to


321
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,260
value our thorough dyeing technology more.


322
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,660
Don't talk about your technology.


323
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,620
That is just a half-finished product.


324
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,100
What shall I call it?


325
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,380
It's cheating at best


326
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,660
and fraud at worst.


327
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,900
I advise you


328
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
not to use your thorough dyeing 


329
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,500
to for Sia's project.


330
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,980
The game is not worth the candle.


331
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
As I say,


332
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,130
you can sell the technique to me.


333
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,420
And I'll give you a good offer.


334
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,260
Brother.


335
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,010
Who are you? I'm not your brother.


336
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,130
Lu Nan.


337
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,740
You're not stupid.


338
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,940
You don't need me to teach you


339
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,860
how to make money in this business.


340
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,220
Sell it


341
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,420
while it's still worth it.


342
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,020
Mr. Gu,


343
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,580
I thought you invited me here today


344
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,170
to talk about tripartite cooperation.


345
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,890
It turned out to be persuasion.


346
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,850
Since our technology is not mature,


347
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,300
Mr. Gu,


348
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,380
why do you have to buy it?


349
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,260
Gu's Group has come this far because


350
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,250
first,


351
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,860
we have good management.


352
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,820
Second,


353
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
we make good friends.


354
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,100
Because your company has accidents every now and then,


355
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
I am your peer,


356
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,140
as well as your senior,


357
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,620
so I can't just sit back and do nothing!


358
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,140
Think of it as a good deed.


359
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,300
I'm trying to give you a hand.


360
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,980
Gu Chengze,


361
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,700
I find you


362
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,340
really stupid.


363
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,260
Lu Nan,


364
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,300
what did you just say?!


365
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:02,980
Brother.


366
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,090
I thought you just had a low IQ.


367
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,620
But now it seems


368
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,660
your're


369
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,740
completely brainless.


370
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,180
Lu Nan,


371
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,860
let him go.


372
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,260
About Su Manni,


373
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,020
don't you think I'm unaware of


374
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,980
what you did behind us.


375
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,420
Next time if you dare to mess with me,


376
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,340
I don't mind


377
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,260
pushing harder.


378
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,210
Next time.


379
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,140
Next time.


380
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,700
Su Bei, be careful.


381
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,580
Su Bei, are you OK?


382
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,540
I'm OK.


383
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,420
Go away.


384
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,980
Are you OK?


385
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
I'm OK. I just hit somewhere.


386
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,420
Mr. Gu.


387
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,780
Let go of me.

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:41,900

389
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,340
Mr. Gu.


390
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,570
Chris.


391
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,450
Why don't you watch cartoons?


392
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,570
What are you doing here?


393
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,619
I've watched it three times.


394
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,780
I know what‘s coming later.


395
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,460
When will Nan Nan and Bei Bei


396
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,140
come back?


397
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,140
They're all working overtime.


398
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,780
When they get off work,


399
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,099
they'll come back and play with you, OK?


400
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,810
Who's it?


401
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:35,980
Here.


402
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,860
Please do me a favor.


403
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,540
What are you doing here?


404
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,500
Do you think I want to come?


405
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,060
Goodbye.


406
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,220
What are you doing!


407
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,060
This is the toy that Lu Nan gave Chris.


408
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,860
It's from Nan Nan?


409
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,540
Yes, Chris.


410
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,860
Come in, please.


411
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,340
Well.


412
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,580
You...


413
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,060
Just put it down and leave.


414
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,220
I'm not leaving.


415
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,610
I'm gonna play with Chris.


416
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,300
Right? Chris.


417
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:03,940
Look at it.


418
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,340
You're no match for my aunt.


419
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,980
I don't play with fools.


420
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,740
Good boy!


421
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,900
You...you're so much like Lu Nan!


422
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,820
If I tell people you two were father and son,


423
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,060
I don't think anyone would doubt it.


424
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,420
Put the toy down.


425
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,620
The door is over there.


426
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,940
I worked so hard to carry these things,


427
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,300
but you don't even give me some water.


428
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,900
Is that how you behave?


429
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,850
Fine, drink some water and then leave.


430
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,020
Chris, come here.


431
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,060
Come here.

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,340

the luxury car that


434
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,540
every boy should have.


435
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,860
Come here. I show it to you.


436
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,540
Come here.


437
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:49,740
Chris.


438
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,380

We‘re here for the tripartite cooperation.


463
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,900
As president of Eminence,


464
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,620
you should look out for the interests of both parties.

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,660
If it's not yours, then forget about it.

I just thought,

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,220
it was inconvenient that Ms. Lu was pregnant.

That's why I wanna...


486
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,740
There's no misunderstanding.

Mr. Gu.


490
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,700
Excuse me for a moment.


491
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,580
I'll get the car.


492
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,780
You really think I beg for your cooperation?!


493
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,580
I show you some respect and you don't want it!


494
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,220
What's wrong with you?!


495
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,100
Why did you butt in when I was talking?


496
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,100
Before we came, the chairman gave orders.


497
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,700
He said this time Sia


498
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,940
didn't completely turn us down,


499
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,940
but Eminence weighed in


500
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,300
and we lost ground.


501
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,860
Plus, Lu Nan


502
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,900

503
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,460
If we lose the cooperation


504
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,620
this time,


505
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,020
it'll be a big blow

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,140
to our company's position in China.


507
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,740
So the chairman said,


508
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,210
we must secure our cooperation with Lu Nan.


509
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,180
Do I need you to teach me


510
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
how to do it?


511
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Know your limits and becareful what you say.


512
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,820
Just shut up


513
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,660
unless I ask you to speak.


514
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,340
This is what the chairman said.


515
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,980
What do you mean? Use father to pressure me?


516
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,580
Do you really think he gives you some power


517
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,620
and you can lecture me?


518
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,900
Don't overstep your authority.


519
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:29,780
Come on.


520
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,020
Be careful.


521
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,010
Don't move.


522
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,180
Who asked you to stand up?!


523
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:45,780
I...


524
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,180
I'm OK. Look.


525
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,340
Sit down.


526
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,810
What are you doing?


527
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,820
Don't move.


528
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,060
It takes months to heal the broken bones.


529
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,890
Behave yourself these days.


530
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,020
It's not that serious.


531
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,780
When I say it's serious, it's serious.


532
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,100
I don't want you to get hurt.


533
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,980
Not at all.


534
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,820
Besides,


535
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,700
you're pregnant.


536
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,210
I should take good care of you.


537
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,220
Let's get something straight.


538
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,940
You lied about it.


539
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,380
I didn't say I was pregnant.


540
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,580
You're being unreasonable.


541
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,020
I lied for you.


542
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,060
I didn't ask you to do it.


543
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,380
But now,


544
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,900
how are we supposed to make it right?


545
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,220
Grandma is getting old.


546
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,740
She can't take it if she knows the truth.


547
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,620
But we have other solutions.


548
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,420
What?


549
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,460
To make it real.


550
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,900
You stop.


551
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,060
What are you doing!


552
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,660
You brat!


553
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,060
Grandma.


554
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,700
The baby is not even three months old,


555
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,100
and you're on her stomach!


556
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,450
Can't you just put up with it?


557
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,420
Grandma, don't worry.

How can you rub your feet with safflower oil?


567

Isn't it bad for the baby?

That's how you take care of her?!
