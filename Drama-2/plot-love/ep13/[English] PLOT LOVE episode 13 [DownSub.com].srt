193
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,580
I've hurt someone who loves me very much.

194
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,180
You know what?

195
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,820
No one has been that nice to me

196
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,460
in years.

197
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,700
But I screwed up everything this time,

198
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,820
and I don't think he'll ever forgive me again.

199
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,660
But Chris likes him so much.

200
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,210
How sad would Chris be

201
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,260
if he knew that

202
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,220
Lu Nan would no longer be able to spend time with him

203
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,740
or play football with him!

204
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,380
Auntie Lan,

205
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,860
what do you think I should do?

206
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,530
If only all this hadn't happened.

207
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,140
If only I could go back to the past.

208
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,890
Sis,

209
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,900
don't be so upset.

210
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,660
If she sees you like this,

211
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,020
she would be heartbroken.

212
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,530
If only Auntie Lan

213
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,140
could really wake up.

214
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,500
Hello?

215
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,260
Babe,

216
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,820
I'm back in Nanxi.

217
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,300
I've got good news and bad news.

218
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,450
Which one do you want to know?

219
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,060
I'm fine with both of them.

220
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,210
[Yonghong Grand Spa Thermal Resort]

221
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,580
Here you are!

222
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,460
Mr. Lu!

223
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,300
All pomp and circumstance, huh?

224
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,860
He ignores me.

225
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,660
What are you looking at?

226
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,420
Your eyes are about to fall out.

227
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,500
I know she's good, but she's taken.

228
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,180
Loser!

229
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:56,940
Mr. Gu,

230
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,300
you can say whatever you want to me.

231
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,060
But I do hope

232
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,540
you can control yourself.

233
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,650
After all, we're the ones who asked Amy a favor,

234
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,300
and it's not easy for her

235
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,500
to do this for us.

236
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,740
Do I need a woman to do business?

237
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,380
It's an honor for her to work with us.

238
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,660
What an idiot!

239
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,500
He'll ruin the Gu's Group sooner or later.

240
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,740
I feel sorry for his brother.

241
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,500
You have nothing better to do?

242
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,860
No.

243
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,220
I just don't get it.

244
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,380
Why did Sia

245
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,210
ask them here too?

246
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,020
For mahjong?

247
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,180
You think Amy doesn't have her job to do?

248
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,420
Fine, fine, fine.

249
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,380
I can't argue with you two. I'll shut up.

250
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,460
Here you are.

251
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,020
Let's get to the point.

252
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,140
You want to work with us,

253
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,020
but why is Eminence here too?

254
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,900
The head office has checked both of your portfolios,

255
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,010
and you both have your own advantages.

256
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,940
We're very interested in Eminence's thorough dyeing technology,

257
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,020
but it is not well-developed yet.

258
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,140
And Gu's Group is a dominant force in the market,

259
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,220
which is what our head office values.

260
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,340
But in terms of profit sharing,

261
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,060
your proposal is a bit demanding for us.

262
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,380
How come you make such a big fuss about

263
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,860
an ill-developed technology?

264
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,500
Mr. Lu.

265
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,980
if you really don't have enough money,

266
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,540
Gu's has some orders.

267
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,340
Just ask.

268
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,140
After all, big brother

269
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,820
should look after his little brother.

270
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,460
Don't argue with a fool.

271
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,100
We're here for business.

272
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,820
So

273
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,180
what is Sia's decision?

274
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,210
We come to Asia for a partnership.

275
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,580
Our core objective

276
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,900
is to find a partner

277
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,020
who excels at

278
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,580
the design of Chinese elements

279
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,900
so that we can carry out joint development.

280
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,540
Apart from the unique strengths

281
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,060
that each of you has,

282
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,500
we also want to test your design skills

283
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,340
against each other.

284
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,340
And the winner will be our partner.

285
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,690
We're going to hold a design competition,

286
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,170
two out of three.

287
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,220
Chinese elements will be the main inspiration.

288
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,260
Each round will have a different theme.

289
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,020
We will work with the one

290
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,420
who caters to the design concept that

291
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,450
Sia has in the Chinese market

292
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,700
within the time limit.

293
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Mr. Lu, the car will arrive soon.

294
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,940
Sorry.

295
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,380
I didn't know it was a tripartite meeting.

296
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,620
Well.

297
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,180
Chris says he misses you,

298
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,020
so...

299
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,100
I'm sorry, Ms. Su.

300
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,980
They don't have manners.

301
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,940
The manners of the Gu's Group

302
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,980
are evident in Mr. Gu.

303
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,570
You're still very eloquent, huh?

304
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,380
That's off-putting.

305
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,500
Instead of having a smack talk here,

306
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,740
why don't you think about

307
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,090
how to make a decent exit?

308
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,650
Your designers

309
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,020
are lousy.

310
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,290
Eminence has worked very hard to stage a comeback.

311
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,180
If you fall again because you bite off more than you can chew,

312
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,420
you'll make a fool of yourself.

313
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,690
Mr. Gu,

314
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,540
if you have time to argue with women,

315
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,540
why don't you go back

316
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,660
and ask your father

317
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,260
whether there's something missing

318
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,300
in your head

319
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,380
when you were born?

320
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,140
You prick!

321
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,460
We'll see.

322
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,780
Thank you.

323
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,420
Sia's case

324
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,300
is not your job.

325
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,819
Leave it to the design department.

326
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,260
Remember who you are.

327
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,099
If it's not your job, then stay out of it.

328
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,020
Let's go.

329
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,780
Get on the car.

330
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,860
Yun Fan.

331
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
We have a meeting at 3pm.

332
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,740
There are only 15 minutes to go. Come on.

333
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,940
You don't look very good.

334
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,100
Anything wrong between you and Lu Nan?

335
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,700
I think I've made a mistake,

336
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,260
but I don't know what I can do now.

337
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,580
In that case,

338
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,060
just follow your heart.

339
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,210
Because your heart

340
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,380
will never lie to you.

341
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,620
You're very perceptive.

342
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,220
By the way,

343
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,180
what do you know about Gu Chengze?

344
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,340
What aspect do you refer to?

345
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,700
Things about him that others don't know.

346
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,260
What do you want to know?

347
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,060
Do me a favour

348
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,820
and I'll owe you one.

349
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,900
Ms. Su.

350
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,780
Mr. Lu.

351
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,540
I just went to the showroom

352
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,940
to see the entries

353
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,220
and compare them with Gu's works.

354
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,220
Chinese style

355
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,820
is Gu's strong suit.

356
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,660
If we don't have something outstanding

357
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,060
in other design elements,

358
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,300
I'm afraid we'll lose this competition.

359
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,180
What does this have to do with you?

360
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
This competition

361
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,860
is about our partnership with Sia.

362
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,700
Just do your job.

363
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,140
You can leave now.

364
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,580
Lu Nan,

365
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,540
this is not the time to get personal.

366
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,460
There's something wrong with our design,

367
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,060
and I'm doing it for the good of Eminence.

368
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,460
I...

369
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,180
Do you think you're awesome?

370
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,820
Do you think you're good at everything?

371
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
For the good of Eminence.

372
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,780
Shame on you!

373
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,700
If you really want to change Eminence for the better,

374
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,260
you wouldn't have done what you did before.

375
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,370
Do you know

376
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,340
that's my parents' legacy,

377
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,660
and the only thing they left to me?

378
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,500
Lu Nan, calm down.

379
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,740
- I...
- Go away!

380
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,060
Stop pretending.

381
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,170
I won't be fooled by you again.

382
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,100
Get out!

383
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,100
Out!

388
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,300
This result is a bit disappointing.

389
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,700
Annie,

390
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,090
we're friends,

391
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
but the company is my top concern.

392
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,340
So congratulations.

393
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,220
Gu's Group won the first round.

394
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,460
Thanks.

395
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,180
Sia, plus Gu's Group,

396
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,540
will dominate the clothing market

397
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,940
in the future.

398
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,060
I hope our cooperation will go well.

399
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,580
You're too early to say that, Mr. Gu.

400
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,460
It's only the first round.

401
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,380
Mr. Lu is not convinced?

402
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,380
Alright.

403
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Let's see whose design is better.

404
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,940
I'll report to the company first.

405
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,860
I look forward to your next design.

406
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,060
If you lose, you lose.

407
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,340
Don't be so mean.

408
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,260
If you ask me,

409
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,060
you should have admitted failure earlier.

410
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,260
The best designers in China are at Gu's.

411
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,820
Just give up.

412
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,980
The show has just begun.

413
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,380
We take it easy.

414
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,370
Why do you look like you're in such a hurry?

415
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,410
Of course I'm in a hurry.

416
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,100
I can't wait for you to ruin Eminence

417
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,940
so I can take it over.

418
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,220
What are you laughing about?

419
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,300
Nothing.

420
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,740
I just find Mr. Gu

421
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,620
funny.

422
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,140
You talk about taking over a company

423
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,020
as if it's as easy as a waste gas discharge.

424
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,060
I admire that.

425
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,340
I'm always kind

426
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,180
towards women.

427
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,410
I never give women a hard time.

428
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,860
Mr. Lu,

429
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,260
you can only count on women to protect you.

430
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,620
I tried to help you before.

431
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,780
Had you sold me the thorough dyeing technology

432
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,620
I would have given you a good price.

433
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,340
But now,

434
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,930
you'll get nothing.

435
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,700
Don't worry.

436
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,900
We still have chances.

437
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,580
I need to talk to you

438
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,420
about work.

439
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,220
If we don't change the design,

440
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,340
we'll lose the next round.

441
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,050
But at the moment,

442
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,900
our designers are no match for Gu's.

443
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,340
We're running out of time

444
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,380
and we can't find a new design team.

445
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,060
So there's only one solution.

446
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,650
Please let me be in charge

447
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,380
of the design for Sia.

448
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,900
How?

449
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,580
I'll be the designer and

450
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,100
do the drawings myself.

451
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,690
I promise I can beat Gu.

452
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,980
You give yourself too much credit.

453
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,020
Our professional designers

454
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,980
can't beat them,

455
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,980
and you think you can do it as an agent?

456
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,620
Why should I believe you?

457
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,970
[Cooperation Agreement]
 [Party A: Lu Nan Party B: Su Bei]

458
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,060
Last time, you signed an agreement with me

459
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,460
to live in my house.

460
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,660
Now you're giving me another agreement.

461
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,220
Why don't you

462
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,020
just say what you want

463
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,940
and see if I can satisfy you?

464
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,020
I know you won't believe

465
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,260
what I say now.

466
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,220
And I don't want to explain.

467
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,300
I'm betting

468
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,860
my marriage and my career

469
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,730
with you.

470
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,380
If I can't win Sia,

471
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,500
I'll divorce you without asking for any compensation

472
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,180
and resign from the company.

473
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,020
And I'll never let you see me again.

474
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:43,440
[Party A (Signature): Lu Nan]
 [Party B (Signature): Su Bei]

475
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,020
I hope you'll comply with this agreement.

476
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,300
Alright.

477
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,460
Then I'm going back.
