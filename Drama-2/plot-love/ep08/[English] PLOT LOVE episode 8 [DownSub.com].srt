14
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,100
How is Lu Nan? Is he serious?


15
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,380
Doctor, how is he?


16
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,330
Have the patient had any brain


17
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,060
and chest surgery before?


18
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,540
He had a car accident seven years ago.


19
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,660
He had been in coma for five years.


20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,610
There was a blood stasis in his brain.


21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
The injury wasn't serious


22
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,900
but triggered the previous wound.


23
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,260
The doctors are trying their best.


24
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,700
The blood stasis in his brain shifted


25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,700

26
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,500

What should we do?


28
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,780
It can only be confirmed when the patient


29
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,010
wakes up after the surgery.


30
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,100
You should be prepared.


31
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,700

After he woke up,


40
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,460
he lost all the memory about you.


41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,260
Impossible.


42
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,500
I called him before.


43
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,620
So


44
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,260
he didn't care about me because he was in a coma.


45
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,700

I want to ask you a favor.


55
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,250
I already told the company that Mr. Lu

61
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,020
when he can wake up?


62
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,380

- How could it be a trifle?
- Yeah.

If others know about it,


121
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,020
they must laugh at us,


122
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,260
saying that the board members of Eminence


123
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,500
are a bunch of kids


124
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,740

125
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,540
This affects Eminence's being listed.


126
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,860
I'll handle the issue.


127
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,420
You shall wait for the result.

As Mr. Lu isn't around,


131
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,530
I'll substitute for him


132
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,980

136
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,940
As long as Lu Nan


137
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,180
acknowledges my competence,


138
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,100
we two will bear


139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,380
any consequence and responsibility.


140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,750
What do you mean?


141
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,940
Do you need me to give you a massage?


142
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,900
I didn't expect that


143
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,060
he would protect me at that moment.


144
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,500
We investigated the case for so long.


145
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,860
But things turned out this way.


146
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,700
I'd rather he


147
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,900
didn't do anything at that time.


148
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,780
So


149
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,620
you feel that he likes you.


150
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
What are you going to do?


151
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,220
Lu Nan saved you


152
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,300
and you had feelings for him.


153
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,060
I totally understand.


154
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,100
I can set apart the gratitude


155
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,780
of saving my life and Auntie Lan's case.


156
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,700
I'll go on with the investigation.


157
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
If it is Lu Nan


158
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,090
who manipulated everything,


159
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
I won't forgive him.


160
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,140
Let me massage you more.


161
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,740
Su Bei has substituted for Lu Nan

Is my brother there?


165
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,460
I just saw the news online


166
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,460
about my brother and sister in law.


167
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,860
Are they okay?


168
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,340
Don't worry. Just small matters.


169
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,660
Mr. Lu will take care of it.


170
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,050
Don't let grandma know yet


171
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,140
or she'll be worried.


172
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Is my brother there?


173
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,980
Mr. Lu went on a business trip to the US.


174
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,380
He may be in a meeting now.


175
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,260
Thank you Yun Fan.


176
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,070

I want to say something to dad.


182
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,050
You can go back first.


183
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,480
- No.32
- Hurry back.


184
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,490
Coming.


185
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,980
Take care and be safe.


186
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Okay.


187
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,820

189
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
Does it hurt?


190
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,540
It wont' hurt after I blow it.


191
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,180
Although I don't like you,


192
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,740
