The moment I found out I was pregnant,


324
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,620

328

need somebody to drink with me.

Actually,


346
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,820
the kid...


347
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,980
Come on, stop drinking. 	


348
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,740
I know you're upset,


349
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
but drinking won't help.


350

352
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,260
keep the fuss die down.


353
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,410
You did your best.


354
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,620
No.


355
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,220
We still haven't found out who's behind it yet.


356
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,500
Didn't we already know


357
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,980
it's Su Manni who did it?


358
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,980
There's someone else.


359
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,780
She alone couldn't have done this.


360
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,780
You look into this matter


361
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,460
and find out the person.


362
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:34,940
Well...


363
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,260
Well...


364
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,740
I...


365
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,740
I ordered too much take-out, 	


366
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,580
so if you're hungry,


367
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,820
 let's eat together.


368
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,140
I don't think it's a good idea to wear so little in the morning.


369
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,170
 What's wrong with this?


370
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,380
Nice.


371
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,980
But it's our last meal together.


372

374
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,340
That's not what I meant. 


375

What do you mean then?


376
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,220
It's up to you


377
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,660
whether you leave or stay.

was my fault.


380
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,690
I shouldn't have left you alone


381
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,340
 with the kid. 


382
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,500
It's all past.


383
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,620
Don't worry about it, Mr. Lu. 


384
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,780
I'm full now. I'll leave.


385
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,180
You haven't even eaten yet. 


386
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,210
I don't want to. You can eat yourself.	


387
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,580
The person who exposed the abortion


388
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,500
was Su Manni.


389
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,100
Then what do you expect me to do,


390
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,380
Mr. Lu?


391
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,740
At work, 


392
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,140
you're her boss.


393
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,900
And in private,


394
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,300
you're her sister.


395
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,740
So I'll stay out of this. 


396
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,220
Do what you want with her.


397
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,380
What's up? 


398
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,580
Close the door.


399
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,340
Just say it.


400
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
You think I have time to waste with you?	


401
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,050
 Do you know how much money Eminence will lose


402
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,780
while you waste my precious time here?


403
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,660
If you don't mind


404
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,140
 letting everyone know


405
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,330
 how you got to be a top model,


406
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,220
then leave the door open even wider


407
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,540
and let's talk.


408
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,220
What do you want?


409
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,650
[Letter of termination] 


410
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,780
[Letter of termination] 


411
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,710
[Party A: Su Bei]


412
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,780
You're terminating my contract?


413
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,460
Does Mr. Lu know about this?


414
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,660
I'm in charge of Eminence Starlight.


415
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,380
I don't have to inform him about my decision here.


416
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,740
Su Bei, are you out of your mind?


417
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm the top model of Eminence.	


418
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,700
Do you know what it means 


419
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,580
to terminate my contract?


420
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,540
Mr. Lu won't agree.


421
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,060
What I admire most about you


422
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,980
 is your arrogance and stupidity.	


423
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,180
I can defeat you


424
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,940
effortlessly.


425
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,100
You're abusing your power.


426
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,850
You're taking revenge on me


427
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,060
 for telling the press


428
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,340
about your dirty business abroad, aren't you?


429
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,340
Well, you can take it that way.	


430
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,580
But


431
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,460
 since you've called me your sister


432
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,180
for so many years,


433
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,580
I'll let you sign the letter and leave.	


434
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,020
[Letter of termination] 


435
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,900
Dream on!


436
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,180
 I won't sign it.


437
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,660
You have the same father,


438
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,020
but you way outsmart her.


439
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm more like my mother.


440
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,060
The way you said that


441
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,940
looked exactly like Chris.


442
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,380
Are you all right?


443
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,220
Lu Nan


444
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,500
feels guilty about the kid now.


445
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,140
Now that he relents,


446
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,050
I'll take advantage of it.


447
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,900
But I don't want to see you get hurt again.


448
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,940
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.	


449
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,380
Miss Su!


450
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,580
Mr. Lu is working. 	


451
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,380
You can't disturb him.


452
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,180
Mr. Lu, she...


453
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,980
Mr. Lu.


454
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,620
Mr. Lu, Su Bei pushes me around again. 


455
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,820
She wants to terminate my contract 


456
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,300
and says you've agreed.


457
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,660
You're not happy with her offer?


458
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,460
You...


459
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,460
Why?


460
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,540
Do I have to explain to you?


461
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,900
 I know. 


462
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,020
It's Su Bei, isn't it?	


463
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,460
She bad-mouthed me, right?


464
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,580
Don't listen to her!


465
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,940
She's trying to make mischief.


466
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,820
She hasn't said anything bad about you.


467
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,260
No way. It's her!


468
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,420
Mr. Lu,


469
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,460
She's pregnant with someone else's child.


470
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,620
I don't want you to suffer. 


471
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,300
Shut up!


472
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,090
One more negative thing about her,


473
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,980
I'll kick you out of the fashion industry.


474
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,780
Mr. Lu, 


475
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,660
why is this happening all of a sudden?


476
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,260
There are still many loving pictures of us online.


477
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,580
You gave me a car 	


478
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,140
and took me to shows.


479
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,220
You...


480
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,540
How can you treat me like this


481
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,180
just because of	


482
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,500
that little bitch Su Bei?


483
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,300
You think I did it because I liked you?


484
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,740
I did it


485
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,380
to raise your profile


486
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,820
and boost your fame


487
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,060
for the sake of Eminence.


488
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,380
But


489
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,460
since you've worked so hard


490
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,620
for everything with me,


491
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,940
I'll make it look decent by letting you


492
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,620
leave Eminence on your own.


493
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,150
[8th Anniversary]


494
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Hello, Mr. Zhang.


495
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,020
You look even hotter!


496
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,880
Mr. Zhang.


497
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,860
We come straight here.


498
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,060
Will it alarm him?


499
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,300
What if Zhang Yuan informs Lu Nan...


500
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,700
He won't.


501
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,260
You really have faith in him?


502
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,940
Not in him,


503
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,580
but in money.


504
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,660
Mr. Zhang,


505
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,050
here's your wine. Enjoy it.


506
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,700
Uncle.


507
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,420
Su Bei?


508
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,220
I'm so glad you remember me. 


509
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,220
What are you doing here?


510
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,380
Don't be nervous, uncle.


511
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,820
I'm here today


512
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,100
for business.


513
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,930
It's a deal that's sure to pay off.


514
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,460
I...


515
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,380
I'm not nervous at all!


516
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,940
Uncle,


517
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,980
what do you think of Lu Nan?


518
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,700
Good, very good.


519
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,660
Uncle,


520
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,700
it's so nice of you.


521
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,900
Lu Nan drove you out of Eminence


522
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,860
like a piece of garbage,


523
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,980
and you still defend him.


524
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,060
As far as I know, you was with Eminence


525
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,060
since its inception.


526
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,580
You worked so hard for the company for so many years.


527
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,980
Who in the company doesn't respect you?


528
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,330
But you end up like this.


529
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,850
This is outrageous.


530
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,620
I've been married to Lu Nan for seven years


531
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,740
 and he wants to divorce me without giving away anything.


532
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,580
That's how he treats his wife.


533
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,540
Uncle,


534
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,780
You must have had a hard time


535
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,940
with what happened back then, right?


536
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,860
Just get to the point. What do you want?


537
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,580
Good!


538
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,500
I'll cut the crap then.


539
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,980
I want to get rid of Lu Nan 


540
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
and take over Eminence.


541
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,140
You were working with Lu Nan for so many years, 	


542
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,420
so I'm sure you have what I want.


543
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,740
Lu Nan calls me uncle.


544
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,500
When a junior made a mistake, 


545
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,980
I had to cover for him as an elder.


546
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,700
Here are some of my assets overseas.


547
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,180
As long as you work with me,


548
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,300
we can negotiate


549
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,980
[Personal deposit Su Bei total RMB 4,500,000]


550
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,700
about your pay.


551
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,060
[Personal deposit Su Bei total RMB 4,500,000]


552
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,330
She's rich!


553
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,170
That's all I have to say.


554
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,740
Uncle,


555
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,140
think about it.


556
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,540
Uncle, what I say is always valid.


557
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,740
 Take your time.


558
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,860
By the way,


559
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,940
how is Su Manni doing


560
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,860
since she left?


561
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,620
Lu Nan has taken


562
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,370
a tough line on her.


563
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,740
He already told everyone in the business about it,


564
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,260
and now no one dares to hire her.


565
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,410
Also,


566
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,980
Su Manni has been


567
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,220
pestering Gu Chengze.


568
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,820
But Gu Chengze is too busy dealing with his father


569
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,220
 to care about her.


570
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,540
I said that


571
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,620
I would get back everything


572
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,420
 she took from me.


573
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,740
Hello?


574
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,250
What's wrong?


575
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,660
Chris is back.


576
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,470
[Nanxi Eminence Group Co., Ltd] 


577
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,540
Why isn't she coming?


578
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,580
She's not here. She's not here.


579
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,230
[Misunderstandings cleared up. What a loving couple] 


580
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
I've finally found Bei Bei and dad.


581
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,140
Dad!


582
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,620
Chris, what are you doing here?


583
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,090
I'm looking fo dad.


584
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,060
You're not talking to your sis?


585
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,060
What sis?


586
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,140
She's a mean old aunt.


587
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,220
Chris, you're petty!


588
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,740
Please call me Mr. Su.


589
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,620
I was so close seeing dad.


590
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,060
Then you stopped me!


591
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,580
Bei Bei!


592
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,290
Come on.


593
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,260
Tell me


594
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,940
how you get back.


595
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,420
Don't be mad at me


596
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,660
if I tell you about it.


597
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,900
I wasn't mad at you


598
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,690
when you went back to China without telling me.	


599
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,100
Being mad not only makes you ugly, 


600
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,890
it also gives you wrinkles.


601
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,340
He's really something.


602
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,300
He managed to get the teacher


603
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,020
 to change the location of the winter camp to Nanxi.


604
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,620
Sorry, Bei Bei.


605
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,180
I just wanted to see dad so much.


606
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,500
I'm not mad.


607
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,690
 I'm just worried about you.


608
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,060
You're only six years old.


609
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,780
This is dangerous.


610
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,220
Don't you ever do it again.


611
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,460
Bei Bei, my bad.


612
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,620
I just missed dad so much.	


613
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,100
No. It's not your fault.


614
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,260
It's mine.


615
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,370
Did you apologize to auntie?


616
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,020
She was worried about you too.


617
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,929
Auntie, sorry.


618
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,300
And I miss you too.


619
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,940
Fine. Fine.


620
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,580
Apology accepted.


621
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,610
But


622
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,260
you'll be deprived of a week's worth of desserts and snacks


623
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,219
 because of this lie.	


624
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,020
No!


625
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,380
Tell me


626
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,820
how you found the company.


627
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,219
I saw a picture


628
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,860
 of you and dad on the internet.


629
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,219
There was a big sign


630
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
 behind you and dad.


631
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,980
So I asked my teacher to send me over 


632
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,220
to surprise you.


633
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,900
Bei Bei,


634
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,940
when are you going to take me to see dad?


635
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,300
It's my fault


636
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,860
 for putting Chris at such a risk.	


637
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,170
[Nanxi Eminence Group Co., Ltd] 


638
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,500
Come in.


639
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,220
I promised Chris yesterday 


640
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,100
that I would spend the day with him.


641
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,690
Call me


642
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,620
if anything happens at the office.


643
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,220
It's time to spend some quality time together.


644
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,820
Chris told me 


645
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,900
he didn't want to go back to Italy.


646
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,060
He kept asking me 


647
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,780
why he couldn't stay


648
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,700
 with mom and dad.


649
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,420
I didn't know how to explain to him.


650
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,340
Chris is a smart boy.


651
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,020
It's not like he doesn't know I'm lying to him.	


652
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,260
He just doesn't want to put me in a difficult position.


653
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,460
It's all my fault.


654
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,900
If he doesn't want to leave this time, 


655
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,220
find him a school here	


656
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,860
and transfer his student file as soon as possible.


657
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,900
Chris will be thrilled


658
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,020

does work, huh?


662
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,620
I guess I can't stay

685
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,930
No way!


686
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,460
In that case,
