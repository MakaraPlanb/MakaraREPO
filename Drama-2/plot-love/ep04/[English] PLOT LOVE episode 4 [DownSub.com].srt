You are awake!

Have a drink?


6
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,060
No!


7
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,100
Don't be nervous,


8
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,100
you don't need to take the responsibility.


9
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,620
Why should I take the responsibility?


10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,100
Normally speaking,


11
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,460
I wouldn't touch you at all.


12
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,500
What do you want?


13
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,740
Why are you so nervous?


14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,540
I will let you go.


15
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,170
We are adults,


16
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,690
and everything we did was out of passion.


17
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,139
So I won't blame you.


18
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,139
Su Bei,


19
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,730
what are you plotting?


20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,050
I'm tired,


21
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,460
and I want to get some sleep.


22
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,610
If you don't want to go now,


23
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,380
you can also continue to sleep here.


24
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,660
Have you really regarded yourself


25
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,780
as my wife?


26
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,770
Am I not?


27
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,060
I warn you!


28
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,780
Don't fancy me.


29
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,940
You're just my nominal wife.


30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,500
I can still get rid of you


31
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,370
even you slept with me.


32
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,660
You don't need to stress that again.


33
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,740
I have kept it in mind.


34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,460
That's great.


35
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,540
I don't want to embarrass you.


36
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,780
So,


37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,730
don't conduct shameful behaviors.


38
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,010
Do you know that I may lose the whole Eminence


39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,660
just because of what you did.


40
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,980
You don't believe me？


41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,460
It doesn't matter whether I believe you or not.


42
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,100
You need to make the public and the media


43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,860
believe you.


44
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,020
If you leave now,


45
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
you can at least reserve some dignity.


46

Do keep the secret!


51

You should know what to say


52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,820
and what not to say.


53
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,180
You know my boss has a bad temper.


54

if something bad happens to him.


59
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,780
I will firmly keep the secret.


60

And I'm gonna "forget" all of it.

am I so handsome


66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,700
that both men and gods would be jealous of me?


67

Yes, you are


68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,780
not only handsome but also rich.


69
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,700
Both men and women would be jealous

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,459

What happened?


75

You slept with her?


76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,300
That was because I drank too much.


77
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,300
What?


78
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,420
Did she take the first step?


79
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,060
No,


80
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,860

Impossible.

you can't drink much.


84

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,020
Unfortunately, he seems to be busy today.


192
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,420
So I shouldn't have come today.


193
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,460
Sorry.


194
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,860
Our cooperation may


195
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,340
need further negotiation.


196
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,940
Never mind.


197
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,860
Every cooperation is reached


198
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,580
through negotiation, disagreement and re-negotiation.


199
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,620
That's the normality.


200
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm afraid that it's not that simple.


201
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,420
I understand.


202
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,700
You have a high standard when selecting partners.


203
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,780
But I think the high standard


204
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,700
can be either a barrier


205
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,340
or an open door


206
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,660
if you can reach it.


207
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,620
Am I right?


208
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,460
Okay,


209
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,260
since you have prepared 


210
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,180
to open the door,


211
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,380
I shall wait to see it.


212
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,330
It's late.


213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,140
Tomorrow,


214
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,740
I need to go to the eastern suburb
 with Mr. Gu to play golf.


215
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,220
I need to go home and have some rest now.


216
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,540
Let's have a raincheck.


217
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:02,980
Okay,


218
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,300
thank you.


219
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,940
You are welcome.


220
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,900
See you then.


221
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,780

226
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,140
It's so nice of you to cancel my overtime work.


227
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,530
You really don't want to have some liquor?


228

You think I have the time?


229
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,420

244
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,980
I should hire a new special assistant.


245
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,420
You don't need to worry about it.


246
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,900
Just have a good rest after work.


247
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,330
I'll get the things done,


248
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,780

249
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,700

It doesn't matter.


259
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,100
I can hold you in my arms and get you there.


260
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,420
You can just continue to sleep.


261
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,780

Why are you in my room?


267
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,410
There's no hot water in my room.


268
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,940
So I came to your room for a shower.


269
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,260
Then you even borrowed my shirt to wear?


270
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,060
I forgot to take mine.


271
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,660
I'll wash the shirt 
and give it back to you tomorrow.


272
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,420
Just throw it away.


273
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
I don't wear shirts that are worn by others.


274
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,620
But,


275
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,820
it's a pity.

It's all in your head.


281
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,260
I just feel hot after taking the shower.


282
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,980
No matter what you do,


283
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,500
your efforts will be in vain.


284
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,980

285
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,690

287
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,140
It was just an accident.


288
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Don't take it so seriously.


289
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,180

Don't talk about work at home, thanks!

377
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,340
Induced abortion operation?


378
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,020
How did this happen?


379
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,540
When we searched Ms. Su's medical records, 


380
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,620
we found a file in a private hospital showed that


381
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,180
Ms. Su had had an abortion


382
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,620
eight months after she came to Italy.


383
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,460
The fetus was nine weeks old.


384
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,940
Who's the father?


385
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,580
We didn't get that information.


386
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,980
Ms. Su had contact with many male friends


387
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,410
and staff at that time.


388
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,300
And it's been a long time,


389
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,340
so some of the information is hard to find.


390
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,620
I see.


391
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,900
Don’t tell anyone 


392
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,900
about this.


393
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,090
I won't.


394
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,690
Why are you absent-minded?


395
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,500
I cracked the code of Lu Nan's safe.


396
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,180
Did you find the fragrance brocade?


397
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,780
No.


398
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,580
He came back


399
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,660
before I could open it.


400
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,140
Then why are you upset?


401
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,100
The combination to the safe


402
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,770
is the date of our wedding anniversary.


403
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,140
Didn't he forget about you?


404
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,700
How could he


405
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,180
remember your anniversary?


406
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,100
If you can't figure it out, forget it.


407
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,860
Here.


408
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,460
This is the project investment information

410
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,540

412
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,380
It seems that Gu's group has some infighting.


413
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,500
I heard that Mr. Gu


414
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,620
is meeting my sister tonight.


415
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,180

Here, Mr. Gu.

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,460
Mr. Gu.


424
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,540
You sang beautifully just now.


425
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,740
Well…


426
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,140
Just let me endorse Kong.


427
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,220
Okay,


428
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,780
but I can't give the job to you for nothing.


429
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,820
Mr. Gu, Su Bei always bullys me.


430
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,460
If you don't help me,


431
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,380
then I'm not gonna be able to stay in Eminence.


432
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,100
You can turn to me then.


433
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,700
I'm always tender to women.


434
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,140
Then that's a deal.


435
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,820
Sorry, I'm late.


436
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,490
Why are you here?


437
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,540
Didn't you ask me to meet with Mr. Gu?


438
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,260
I didn't.


439
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,420
She had the gall to show up.


440
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,140
I was just going to compliment you


441
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,050
for knowing I like to deal with beautiful women, 


442
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,220
and asking your sister to join me.


443
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,220
She's not my sister.


444
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,580
Now that you're here, come and sit down.


445
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,500
We all have different destinies.


446
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,740
We have the same father, but we live different lives.


447
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,700
I am the president of the Gu's Group.


448
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,220
But look at Gu Yan.


449
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,380
He's just a sidekick.


450
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,300
You're right.


451
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,370
But Manni,


452
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,740
why can't you beat Su Bei?


453
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,820
In terms of appearance, you are even.


454
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,140
But in terms of intelligence,


455
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,570
you're not even as good as Su Bei's little finger.


456
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,330
The endorsement is very important.


457
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm a little worried about giving the job to you.


458
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,020
What?


459
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,420
But Mr. Gu...


460
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,980
Didn't you just promise me


461
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,740
the endorsement of Kong?


462
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
Verbal promises do not have the force of law.


463
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,940
You have to sign a contract.


464
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,500
That makes sense.


465
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,570
Why do you have to vie with me, Su Bei?


466
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,060
What do you mean?


467
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,540
Mr. Gu has his own judgment.


468
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,740
How come I vie with you for the job?


469
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,290
You think Mr. Gu is stupid


470
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,740
or incompetent?


471
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,140
You…


472
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,340
No...


473
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,300
That's not what I meant.


474
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,020
Su…


475
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,580
Su Bei's trying to drive a wedge


476
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,940
 between us.


477
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,700
There's nothing between us.


478
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,780
I always


479
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,780
 take the side of my friend.


480
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,500
This is the way I am.


481
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,100
I can only do business with you if we're friends.


482
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,140
Then I'd like


483
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,180
to be your friend.


484
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,140
I have a big show tomorrow, Mr. Gu.


485
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,860
My face will swell if I drink too much.


486
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
That won't be good.


487
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,540
Yeah.


488
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,410
I don't like making people do things they don't like.


489
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,700
If you think the big show is so important,


490
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,460
you can forget about the endorsement.


491
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,620
Su Bei,


492
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,740
the endorsement is yours now.


493
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,210
Thank you then.


494
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,420
No...Mr. Gu...


495
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,020
That's not what I meant.


496
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,580
Manni, don't put Mr. Gu in an embarrassing position.


497
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,980
Su Bei, you’ve gone too far.


498
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,620
It's quite a drama.


499
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,860
Sorry for that.


500
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,300
Excuse me for disciplining the subordinate.


501
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,540
Mr. Gu,


502
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,660
when should we sign the contract?


503
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,410
What contract?


504
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,820
You sisters are stupid.


505
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,980
Can't you see I was tricking you?


506
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,810
So Mr. Gu played another trick, huh?


507
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,580
It’s all right.


508
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,900
I have a very nice present for you.


509
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,380
Look.

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,540

I'm fine. My feet hurt a little bit.

the favor you did me.

You know it was me?


534
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,700
There's no way anyone in my company


535
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,140
could have access to such confidential information,


536
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,380
except some insiders.


537
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,260
But you're the only one who knows Gu Chengze so well

what I think is best

for my brother and Gu's Group.


542
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,820
I couldn't talk my brother out of certain things,


543
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,660
so I had to find another way to deal with it.


544
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,140
After all, you knew


545
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,460
my position in the Gu family.


546
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,180
It's all right. So did I.


547
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,460
In that case,


548
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,540
aren't we


549
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,500

550
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,860

00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,780
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take back what I just said.


555
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,260
I wonder if Mr. Gu


556
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,380
would walk me in.

I'm honored.

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:18,860
Su Bei.


563
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,340
Su Bei.


564
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,260
Sweetheart.


565
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,460
Annie hurt her leg. So I brought her back.


566
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,420
Don't bother.


567
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,300
Wait.


568
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
It's prescribed by the hospital.


569
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,420
Apply it on her when you get back home.


570
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,940
You don't need to worry about my wife.


571
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,740
Su Bei.


572
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,140
I want you to remember you are my wife


573
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,900
before you do anything.


574
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,740
I think someone told me


575
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,100
we were married in name only.


576
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,260
We're still married.


577
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,860
So you admit I'm your wife?


578
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,980
Be serious.


579
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,610
I want you to


580
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,450
avoid any physical contact with any other man.


581
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,500
You’re being jealous.


582
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,940
Jealous?


583
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,380
I just don't want to be embarrassed


584
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,980
You like me.


585
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,100
I like you?


586
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,930
Marrying you is the most ridiculous thing


587
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,140
I've ever done in my life.


588
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,060
Since you don't like me, 


589
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,900
don't try to manipulate me.


590
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,300
I'm not your personal property.


591
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,820
I am a person who can think independently!


592
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,220
Think independently?


593
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,180
You mean evil thoughts.


594
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,460
I know


595
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,420
why you moved here.


596
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,340
Stop trying to get in my room.


597
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,420
I already have the cameras installed


598
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,380
in my house.


599
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,740
If you dare to do that again,


600
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,340
it's gonna be more than just throwing you out of the house.


601
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,780
You sent me to Italy seven years ago.


602
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,740
Where do you want to send me now?


603
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,100
Jail?


604
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,050
Su Bei.


605
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,540
Don't put me to the limits.


606
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,860
Not divorcing you


607
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,699
is the best I can do.


608
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,460
Whatever you want from me,


609
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,340
I'm not gonna let you get it.
