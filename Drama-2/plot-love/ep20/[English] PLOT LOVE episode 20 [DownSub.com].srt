Can't wait

Chris, let's go.

I can't believe you're trying

10
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,140
to cheat on me.

11
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,900
Aren't you afraid I'll use it

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,140
as evidence of affair against you?

13
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,740
I've asked my lawyer

14
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,940
to handle the divorce.

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,100

If it wasn't for the kid,

22
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,900
I wouldn't want to see you either.

Nothing.

166
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,300

No thanks.

173
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,980
I'll just rest for a while.

give you something so cold.

179
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,020
Sorry.

Look at you.

185
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,700
I told you that your health is the most important thing, all right?

186

That meeting can be cancelled.

187
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,299
You should take a good rest

188
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:36,940
and resume work tomorrow.

189
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,730
No, I can't.

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,500
Everyone's waiting for the project

193
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,780
of the environmental conference.

194
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,290
I have to work hard.

195
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,780
If I can't make it,

196
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,540
I'll let you down.

197
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,820
Are you undervaluing

198
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,060
our friendship?

199
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,740
We're both businessman.

200
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,500
Profit is our priority.

201
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,900
It has nothing to do with our friendship.

202
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,700
We're friends

203
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
and colleagues.

204
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,540
We're very close. Don't worry.

205
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,460
Come in.

206
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,180
Sis,

207
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,220
I bought you the medicine for stomachache.

208
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,420
You'll feel better with this.

209
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,890
Thanks.

210
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,300
This is Yu Jia,

211
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,900
the best tailor in our company.

212
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,260
No,

213
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,540
the best tailor in China.

214
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,580
We're not related,

215
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
but we're like sisters.

216
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,460
Nice to meet you.

217
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,780
Nice to meet you, Mr. Gu.

218
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,780
Sis.

219
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,100
I'll take my leave.

220
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,260
Take your medicine and rest for a while.

221
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,140
I'll go now.

222
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,580
I've taken my medicine

223
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,740
and I'm ready to get back to work.

224
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,420
Take care of yourself then.

225
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,800
[How take care of someone with a stomach flu?]

226
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,320
[How take care of someone with a stomach flu?]

227
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,780
What's wrong?

228
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
You look so serious.

229
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,460
Damn it.

230
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
Look at how thoughtful

231
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,330
and passionate Mr. Gu is

232
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,740
in expressing his love.

233
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,690
It's just stomach flu

234
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,980
and he wants to show his concern to the whole world.

235
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,130
Unlike some guy,

236
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,980
who's as insensitive as a stone

237
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,380
and gives the cold shoulder to his loved ones.

238
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,020
Do you think I'm not passionate enough?

239
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,620
You said it yourself.

240
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,220
Alright.

241
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,010
I'll show you how passionate I am.

242
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,140
What's wrong with you?

243
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,260
You've gotten into acting now, haven't you?

244
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,220
No.

245
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,140
Then why do I get the feeling that

246
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,580
you're going to leave me

247
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,220
for that Gu Yan?

248
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,900
Am I passionate enough for you?

249
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,020
Mr. Jealousy is getting jealous again.

250
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,540
Then Mrs. Jealousy,

251
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,220
would you like to take a bite?

252
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,780
[Gu Yan]

253
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,740
Hello?

254
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,020
Are you asleep?

255
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,740
Not yet.

256
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,020
Do you still have a stomachache?

257
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,660
I'm getting much better.

258
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,460
Get some rest early.

259
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,380
Alright.

260
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,930
Then tomorrow...

261
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,210
I'm going to get mad.

262
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,300
Su Bei,

263
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,140
there will be serious consequences.

264
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,140
Really?

265
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,820
Stop!

266
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,340
Are you really in love with her?

267
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Don't think too much.

268
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,380
I know you're faking.

269
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,420
But every time I see you being nice to her,

270
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,580
I'm worried that

271
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,300
you'll fall for her.

272
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,940
Just do your job.

273
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,660
I'm putting up an act now.

274
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
When we're done,

275
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,860
I'll give you what you deserve.

276
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,300
Are they really

277
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,380
getting a divorce?

278
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,140
They've been arguing a lot.

279
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,460
It doesn't look like pretending.

280
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,740
Besides,

281
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,820
Su Bei has met with her lawyer several times

282
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,020
for discussions.

283
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,620
So it's all worth it.

284
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,780
Thanks.

285
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,980
When they get divorced

286
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,060
and you get

287
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,580
what you want,

288
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,820
we'll be able to

289
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,210
make our relationship public, right?

290
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,940
I'm looking forward to that day.

291
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,100
But you'll have to speed up.

292
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:34,820
And

293
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,700
don't come to see me lately

294
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,300
so we won't get caught.

295
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,020
Delivery!

296
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,900
Don't go.

297
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,540
Stay in bed.

298
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,490
I'll take a look.

299
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,980
Who is it?

300
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,540
It's me, Gu Yan.

301
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,900
Hide somewhere! Gu Yan is here.

302
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,140
We're married.

303
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,100
It's not an affair.

304
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,860
What's the panic about?

305
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,860
Stop it!

306
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,980
If he finds out, we'll be in big trouble!

307
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,220
Go go go!

308
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,740
Here.

309
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,380
Come on!

310
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,860
Su Bei,

311
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,700
anything wrong?

312
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,580
Sorry,

313
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,660
I just went to the bathroom.

314
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,220
What are you doing here?

315
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,500
I bought you breakfast.

316
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,130
Porridge.

317
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,700
It helps warm your stomach.

318
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,540
Thanks.

319
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,420
You don't have to...

320
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,820
Any time!

321
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,820
I'll buy you breakfast

322
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,660
every day

323
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,140
to take care of your stomach.

324
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,620
Thanks.

325
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,420
You don't have to do this.

326
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,140
I'd love to.

327
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,780
Here.

328
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,940
Try it.

329
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,940
I waited in line

330
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,740
for over an hour this morning

331
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,170
to buy it for you.

332
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,540
The porridge is really good.

333
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,500
Thank you.

334
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,260
Next time, don't bother.

335
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,820
It's my pleasure.

336
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,180
You...

337
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,180
What's wrong with you?

338
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,900
Are you feeling sick?

339
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,180
Nothing.

340
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,380
It's just the weather is dry.

341
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,260
I'll have some water and it'll be fine.

342
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,860
You don't have a fever.

343
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,220
Here.

344
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,300
Thanks.

345
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,020
Thanks for your concern.

346
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,700
Of course I'm concerned about you.

347
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,860
Because I'm very serious about you.

348
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,339
What's that noise?

349
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Well...I...

350
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,740
I don't really like the egg.

351
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,060
It's okay.

352
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,020
I bought you another one.

353
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,619
Why is there still a sound?

354
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,500
Look, the flowers I bought

355
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,740
two days ago are nice, aren't they?

356
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,500
Yes.

357
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,980
Should we have breakfast first?

358
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,140
It'll get cold.

359
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,620
OK.

360
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,780
What are you doing?

361
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,740
I've had enough of you!

362
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,820
You're staying out all night.

363
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,940
You're a bad dad.

364
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,820
I'm going to find Bei Bei.

365
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,180
Go ahead. Go!

366
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,740
Did you find another woman to be your wife?

367
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,580
The short-form videos were right.

368
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,180
If there's a stepmother, there's a stepfather.

369
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,820
No wonder you're kicking me out.

370
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,260
I'm going to tell Bei Bei about it.

371
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,300
You...

372
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,140
You're doing bad things behind her back.

373
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,010
Hurry up.

374
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,140
You'll lose your mother

375
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,180
if you keep wasting time here.

376
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,980
Hurry!

377
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,540
Go!

378
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,580
Who said she didn't want to eat

379
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,700
and had to head for work?

380
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,810
I wasn't hungry then,

381
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980

710
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,060

He's your brother's son.

731
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,220
After all this time,

732
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,740
I finally became an aunt.

733
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,380

734
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,700
Come here.

735
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,980
Say hello to your aunt.

736
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,420
Come here.

737
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,900
Come on.

738
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,500
Come!

739
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:32,860
Here!

740
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,700
Here!

741
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,140
I...

742
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,500
I've got homework to do.

743
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,460
He's shy.

744
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,850
It'll be better if you spend more time with him.

Where's my sister-in-law?

746

00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,580
It's your brother's fault.

748
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,540
They already have a kid.

749
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,380
But they're getting a divorce!

750
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,940
Divorce?

751
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,820
The kid is small.

752
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,940
I don't think she has the heart to divorce.

753
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,540
Brother, you're back.

754
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,780
She only left for a short period of time.

755
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,580
Why do you look like strangers to each other?

756
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,860
That's not nice.

757
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,980
Come on, have a seat.

758
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,540
This is your brother's house.

759
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,780
Make yourself at home.

760
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,180
Come on.

761
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,300
Why are you back?

762
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,660
I missed grandma.

763
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,340
I found a job in China.

764
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,740
No matter how it is in other countries,

765
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,740
there's no place like home.

766
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,700
You don't want me to come back, brother?

767
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,260
No way!

768
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,580
He just doesn't mince his words.

769
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,900
Fei'er is such a sweet girl.

770
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,540
Of course your brother wants you back.

771
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,980
Why did you have to look for a job?

772
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,300
Eminence is so big.

773
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,260
If you want a job,

774
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,620
ask your brother to arrange it for you.

775
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,180
I'm still learning. I'm afraid

776
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,660
I'll be a nuisance to brother if I don't do well.

777
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,700
We're family.

778
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,980
Don't say that.

779
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,620
You can count on him.

780
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,500
Grandma is the best!

781
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,170
My sweet girl.

782
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,660
My lovely girl.

783
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,450
I warned you to stay away from grandma.

784
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,610
Ever since I was a child,

785
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,130
you won't let others into your study room,

786
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,340
just like your heart.

787
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,700
I thought

788
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,540
you were like that to everyone.

789
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,780
Until you met Su Bei,

790
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,780
I realized that

791
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,420
not everyone was the same.

792
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,540
What are you trying to say?

793
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,260
I just want to say that

794
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,540
you got me wrong, brother.

795
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,020
I came back

796
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,820
because I missed you and grandma.

797
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,620
Grandma missed me too.

798
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,340
It's only right for me

799
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,460
to come back to visit her.

800
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,420
How do you get

801
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,500
the fragrance brocade?

802
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,580
You mean

803
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,980
the book with a beautiful cover?

804
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,980
Is it something important?

805
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,780
I happened to see

806
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,340
your text message from Yu Qinglan.

807
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,020
I thought since you were so busy,

808
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,420
I'd go get it for you.

809
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,260
Then

810
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,580
it suddenly occurred to me that

811
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,300
Yu Qinglan

812
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,050
was a very important person to Su Bei.

813
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,460
I didn't want to upset you,

814
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,740
so I stopped it for you.

815
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,940
I don't care what you're up to.

816
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,300
But you must stop.

817
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,940
If you hurt my family again,

818
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,860
then

819
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,580
it'll be more than just sending you abroad.

820
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:16,780
Family?

821
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,900
I'm not your family?

822
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,060
Lu Nan,

823
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,380
you've never thought of me

824
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,060
as part of this family, right?

825
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,380
Am I

826
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,090
an outsider to you?

827
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,450
Get out!

828
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,020
Su Bei is with Gu Yan now.

829
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,180
You think she cares about

830
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,340
how long you've been waiting for her?

831
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,890
Seven years ago,

832
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,180
she left you behind without a second thought.

833
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,980
Seven years later,

834
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,860
she is still the same one.

835
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,700
She doesn't deserve your care and love.

836
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,580
Brother,

837
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,100
I'm the one who loves you the most.

838
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,260
Even if I divorce Su Bei

839
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,100
and even if she didn't exist in the first place,

840
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,210
it's impossible

841
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,660
between me and you.

842
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,300
Besides,

843
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,620
Su Bei is still your sister-in-law.

844
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,820
Be respectful

845
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,580
when you refer to her.

846
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,220
If you speak ill of her again,

847
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,700
I won't let you off the hook.

848
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,020
Why can't I do the same

849
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,300
as Su Bei does?

850
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,700
Because you can never be compared to her.

851
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,900
And stay away from grandma.

852
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,650
I didn't tell her about what you did

853
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,500
because I didn't want to break her heart.

854
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,660
I can accept that you don't love me,

855
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,700
but I can't accept that you love someone else.
