It's clear that Lu Fei'er


17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,539
went behind our backs.


18

Why didn't you say anything?


19

Lu Nan's grandma is getting old.


20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,050
I was afraid she wouldn't be able to handle it if I told her.


21

But why did she do that?


22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,020
She likes her brother?


23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,060
But she doesn't have to split you up.


24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,180

Now you're proud of her?!


38

At the beginning, I didn't know it was who


39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,380
tried to kick her out of the family.


40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,820
But


41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,940

42
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,380
I was really happy for you

 when I saw Su Bei


44
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,180

45

since you woke up.


48
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,050
I was always worried about what would happen


49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,940
 if you couldn't handle the stress.

Then you shouldn't have unfastened your seatbelt

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,539
Here you are.


194
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,980
This is for me?


195
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,580
Yes.


196
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,300
Thank you, Chriser.


197
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,420
Auntie, I'm not Chriser.


198
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
I'm Chris.


199
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,020
Chriser.


200
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,340
Chris.


201
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,620
Chriser.


202
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,380
Chr...


203
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,260
Forget it.


204
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,860
Just call me Mr. Su.


205
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,220
All right. Whatever you say.


206
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,500
Then


207
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,740
take me to my dad.


208
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,260
OK.


209
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,380
Let's go!


210
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,940
If you don't wake up, dad,


211
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,220
 someone else will take Bei Bei away from you.


212
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,220
You've got my money, so you must do as I say.


213
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,220
Take care of yourself. 


214
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,060
Dad, you're awake.


215
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,500
Here you are.


216
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,300
This is ugly!


217
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,100
Dad!


218
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
I'm not your dad.


219
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,660
Daddy!


220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,540
I'm not your dad


221
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,500
 and I'm not your daddy either.


222
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,780
Then I'll call you Nan Nan, 


223
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,530
just like Bei Bei.


224
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,860
Nan Nan, do you play football?


225
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,700
No.


226
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,300
Do you have friends who play football?


227
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,340
No.


228
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,020
Can you


229
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,940
lift me up?


230
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,500
No.


231
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,530
Then what can you do?


232
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,210
Make money.


233
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,700
What's the point of just making money


234
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,380
 if you can't play football


235
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,420
 and you don't have any friends who play football


236
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,420
 and you can't lift me up?


237
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,900
What's the use of making money?


238
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,130
Do you know what money is?


239
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,780
Of course I do.


240
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,180
Where did you get this money?


241
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,740
You don't have to know that.


242
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,740
Just be good


243
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,100
and I'll take care of you.


244
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,780
You'll take care of me?


245
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,380
Do you know who am I? 


246
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,100
And you want to take care of me?


247
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,860
You're Nan Nan.


248
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,220
Bei Bei!


249
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,300
How dare you!


250
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,580
I'll teach you a lesson when we're home.


251
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,420
Mr. Lu, sorry.


252
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,100
Brat!


253
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:24,860
I was so worried!


254
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,620
Thank you.


255
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,820
We're off. You take care.


256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Let's go.


257
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,460
Let them go home first. 


258
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,180
You, come here.


259
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,100
Beibei, 


260
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,660
he said something bad about you.


261
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,180
Let's go. I don't want to talk to him.


262
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,180
I...I've got a huge headache.


263
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,020
You go home first.


264
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,060
I'll see you later.


265
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,180
Be good.


266
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,300
Massage my temples for me.


267
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,380
My head hurts so much.


268
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,380
I don't know if there will be a sequela.


269
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:07,940
I...


270
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,300
go home today.


271
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,020
Why didn't you come home with me?


272
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,860
Don't worry. I'm with you.


273
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,420
Find all that women's stuff


274
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,820
in this house


275
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,300
 and throw them away!


276
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,500
Yes, grandma.


277
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:39,980
What are you doing?


278
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,940
Grandma asked us...


279
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,860
Just do your job.


280
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,410
Leave now.


281
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,420
Nan Nan.


282
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,020
Nan Nan,


283
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,540
why did you get out of the hospital so early?	


284
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,220
I told you to get some rest.


285
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,540
Did he do that


286
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,170
because you want to come back?!


287
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,140
She had nothing to do with it. 


288
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,180
I want to bring her back.


289
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,090
No.


290
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,100
I told you that


291
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,060
this woman is not allowed to enter our house.


292
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,580
Get out!


293
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,740
Grandma. 


294
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,330
She's my wife.


295
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,260
So


296
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,380
this is her home.


297
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,180
If you want to get rid of her, 


298
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,700
then I'll have to move too.


299
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,220
Grandma!


300
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,100
Grandma!


301
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,340
Grandma.


302
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,420
What's wrong? 


303
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,820
You're having a headache again?


304
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,300
I'm fine.


305
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm just upset.


306
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,020
Dizzy.


307
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,420
What upset you?


308
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,610
Stay home and rest.	


309
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,620
I told you to stay in the hospital for a few more days,


310
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
but you didn't listen.


311
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,100
I want to spend more time with you.


312
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,300
With me?


313
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,620
What a sweet talker! I don't think I'm the one you want to spend time with.


314
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,220
Grandma, I was just faking it.


315
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,140
I'm old


316
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,050
but I‘m not stupid.


317
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,140
I saw how you treated her.


318
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,890
There's no way you were faking it.


319
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,420
Grandma,


320
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,900
there's nothing more important to me


321
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,940
than you and Eminence.


322
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,130
Su Bei is only with me for now.


323
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,980
I'll kick her out


324
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,100
as soon as I acquire Sia.


325
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,260
No.


326
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,460
She must leave now.


327
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:52,900
Fine.


328
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Since grandma insists,


329
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,980
I respect your decision.


330
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
I'll get rid of Subei now


331
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,820
and pay a visit to Sia myself.	


332
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,700
Their cooperation with Gu's Group


333
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,060
should be finalised in a couple of days.


334
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,860
There's only one day left. 	


335
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,180
So I'll go immediately.


336
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,260
Don't worry. 


337
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,020
Come on, sit down.


338
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,140
Be good. 


339
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,220
It's okay, grandma.


340
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,860
I won't come back until I get Sia.


341
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,300
The doctor said 


342
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,780
I should be able to hold on like this for a while.


343
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,460
No, no, no. 


344
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,620
You can't go.	


345
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,620
My lovely Nan Nan.


346
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,340
I listen to you.


347
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,130
We're not going.


348
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,130
Let that woman go.


349
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,460
Grandma has made it so clear	


350
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,660
that you should leave here.


351
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,740
You'd better do.


352
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,780
You're not faking it anymore, are you?


353
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,420
It's not worth it to waste my time


354
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,260
on a loser.


355
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,300
Since you used to be


356
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,860
my sister-in-law,


357
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,580
I'd like to remind you that


358
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,300
my brother loved you before,


359
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,210
so your pestering was a sign of love


360
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,260
for him.


361
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,460
But now he's forgotten about you and he doesn't love you anymore.


362
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,860
So your pestering is a nuisance.


363
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,180
I hope you'll behave yourself.


364
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,220
You find it annoying,


365
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,260
but I think your brother enjoys it a lot.


366
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,650
Now I see	


367
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,820
why Lu Nan


368
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,620
had to move out of the house seven years ago


369
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,660
despite grandma's objection.


370
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,340
It's because


371
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,660
 someone didn't put herself in the right position.


372
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,100
Besides,


373
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,700
I didn't tell Lu Nan and grandma


374
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,690
 about your phone call


375
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,900
 seven years ago.


376
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,980
I didn't do it out of repsect


377
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,450
or fear towards you.


378
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,220
I just didn't want to upset grandma


379
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,220
and put Lu Nan


380
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,700
in a dilemma.


381
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,339
That's why you lied to grandma


382
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,089
and told her that Sia was one day away 


383
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,500
from finalising the contract with Gu.


384
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,020
Su Bei is expected to turn things around in one day.


385
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,060
The person in charge of Sia


386
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,180
 isn't even in China.


387
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,940
So who will Su Bei talk to?


388
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,420
When grandma asks about this, 


389
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,579
how will you explain?


390
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,740
But it's an urgent situation.


391
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,780
So I understand why you said that.


392
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,900
Here are the documents for your review.


393
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,620
I've already commented on problematic parts.


394
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,860
Take a look at them.


395
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,060
Thanks.


396
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,180
By the way, 


397
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,260
there's good news from Amy.


398
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,580
There're a lot of people at Sia's headquarters


399
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,740
would love to work with us.


400
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,020
If we can have breakthrough of thorough dyeing at this point,


401
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,940
we'll have a better chance	


402
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,940
 even if Gu agrees to a concession.


403
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,980
Well done.


404
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,540
So...


405
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,900
So we must find the fragrance brocade!


406
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,140
This is weird.


407
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,580
You had an accident


408
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,780
and the fragrance brocade was lost.


409
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,900
Then look for it right now!


410
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,380
Su Bei, I...


411
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,140
We want to celebrate tonight.


412
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,860
So...


413
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,700
Hello?


414
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,150
[Gu's Group Gu Yan Manager]


415
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,100
If you're free tonight, 


416
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,060
could you make good on your promise?


417
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,860
Ms. Su, you're not going to break your word, are you?


418
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,820
Let's do it tonight. You decide where and when. 


419
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,620
Okay, see you tonight.


420
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,980
What were you going to tell me?


421
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,700
Never mind. It's fine.


422
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,580
It doesn't matter what I say 


423
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,420
since you've got an appointment.


424
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,780
Fine.


425
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,170
By the way,


426
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,090
take calcium supplement.


427
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,500
After all,


428
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,140
you're not getting any younger.


429
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:21,910
Thanks.


430
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,560
Enjoy it.


431
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,620
You're really a good friend, huh?


432
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,820
You've ruined my business


433
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,100
and my dad gave me a dressing-down for it.


434
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,140
It's all right.


435
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,220
I'll treat you to a nice dinner to make it up to you


436
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,700
when I secure the deal.


437
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,340
I'll keep that in mind.


438
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,900
But I didn't expect Eminence 


439
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,940
to know so much about thorough dyeing.	


440
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,660
Are you trying to


441
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,980
get some information from me?


442
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,940
If so,


443
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,140
will you tell me?


444
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,410
But I don't know about it!


445
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,820
You think I'm the Monkey King who


446
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,220
 can do anything?


447
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,210
No no no.


448
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,500
You're much better looking than that monkey.


449
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,140
Be careful.


450
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,460
Mr. Gu,


451
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,940
 do you mind if I share the table with you?


452
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,690
If I say yes,


453
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,060
will you use another table?


454
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,860
No.


455
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,500
Why do you have to share the table with us?


456
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,740
 There are so many tables available over there. Are you blind?


457
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,690
But I like this table.


458
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,180
 I'll cut it for you.


459
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,660
Let me do it.


460
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,780
Here.


461
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,740
It's done.


462
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,500
Eat mine.


463
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,060
The meat looks good, 


464
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,740
but 


465
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,900
it's a bit overcooked.


466
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
By the way, Mr. Gu,


467
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,290
you're not a young lad anymore.


468
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,220
When are you getting married?


469
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,500
I may let you down.


470
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,260
After all, not every woman is as wonderful


471
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,620
as Su Bei.


472
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,740
Exactly.


473
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,580
You must try harder.


474
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,460
After all, only a wonderful man


475
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,050
deserves a wonderful woman.


476
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,900
Mr. Lu is right. 


477
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,860
You'd better be nice to Su Bei.


478
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,660
She's very popular.


479
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,300
But she only loves me,


480
00:21:59,500 --> 00:21:59,900
right?


481
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,410
Bei Bei.


482
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,340
Here.


483
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,180
Eat this.


484
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,220
Mr. Lu, why didn't you go to bed?


485
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,340
Can't you see that I'm jealous?


486
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,220
Yes I can.


487
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,900
You were so jealous to the point that


488
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,740
you did public display of affection.


489
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,980
I'm not blind.


490
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,090
Then don't you have anything to say to me?


491
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,100
Yes I have.


492
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,820
Don't you ever


493
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,060
say things so childish.


494
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,820
People will make fun of you.


495
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,500
Mrs. Lu, 


496
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,380
we need to talk.


497
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,900
What do you want to talk about?


498
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,820
You can't have any contact with Gu Yan from now on.


499
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,940
I don't like it.


500
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,500
You're jealous.


501
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,140
And you're sweet.


502
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,900
Stop faking it.


503
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,140
Look at your happy face.


504
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,140
I can see that from miles away.


505
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,340
These are the investment information


506
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,020
 for Gu Chengze's project.


507
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,620
No wonder Gu Chengze is so generous.


508
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,580
He's desperate.


509
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,580
The projects he invested in


510
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,940
are loss-making.


511
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,100
Tell me.


512
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,660
What are you up to?


513
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,260
Doesn't he have a younger brother?


514
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,900
You want them to fight over each other?


515
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,180
How's the board of directors?


516
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860

and you never praise me.


524
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,700
You don't have work to do, huh?


525
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,420
That expression on your face just now	


526
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,380
looks so familiar.


527
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,700
It's exactly the same as 


528
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,500
when you talked about Su Bei seven years ago.


529
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,860

about Su Bei.

00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,940
 happily together.


570
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,210
You...


571
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,420
You remember that?!


572
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,460
It turned out that


573
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,060
we were really in love before.


574
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,820
But I forgot


575
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,450
about such an important thing.


576
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,060
Don't say that.


577
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,460
It's not your fault about amnesia.


578
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,420
Don't blame yourself.


579
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,340
Besides, 


580
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,180
even if you remember everything,


581
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,500
it's all past.


582
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,380
What's the point?


583
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,820
Since you're in love with her again,


584
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,980
just get her back.


585
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,650
Right?


586
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,540
Forget about


587
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,820
your goddamn pride.


588
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,700
If you like her, then go for her. 


589
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,620
As simple as that.


590
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,820
Don't be a coward.


591
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,140
To be honest,


592
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,860
I had to bite my tongue not to tell you this before.


593
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,740
I wouldn't bother to say this


594
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,980
if you were not


595
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,580
my best friend.


596
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,540
Alright.


597
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,580
Then make me a proposal


598
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,700
before you get off work.


599
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,580
What?


600
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,660
A proposal?


601
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,660
Why don't you ask me to write a paper?


602
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,100
Fine, fine, fine.


603
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,060
Don't look at me like that. I'll do it.


604
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,700
But


605
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,060
this is not my job,


606
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,540
so I can't do it for free, right?


607
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,810
A luxurious 10-day trip to Europe.


608
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,740
15 days, plus double bonuses.	


609
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,020
Good!


610
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,020
Forget about the proposal.


611
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,460
That won't work.


612
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,260
Let me tell you.


613
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,660
All women have one thing in common.


614
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,180
They're softhearted.


615
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,180
Remember that


616
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,660
and you'll make it.


617
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,660
First, you have to...


618
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,900
And then...


619
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,460
Then you come this way


620
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,500
and that's pretty much it.	


621
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,380
Got it?


622
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:52,840
What are you going to do?


623
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,820
Practice!


624
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,620
What about my European tour?


625
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,780
Do it yourself!


626
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,820
You...


627
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,620
Phone!


628
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,000
[Yun Fan]


629
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,580
A tip for you.


630
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,340
I've tried my best to help you.


631
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,220
Remember, you're invincible when you're shameless.


632
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,980
What's wrong?


633
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
I'm cold.


634
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,460
I'm cold.


635
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,660
Cold?


636
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
Aren't you supposed to feel hot?


637
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,620
It's so hot!


638
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,860
You need to go to the hospital.


639
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,580
I'm fine.


640
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,500
Just help me to my room.


641
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,290
Don't go.


642
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,580
Let go of me. I'll get you some medicine.


643
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,380
Let me hold you for a while.


644
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,740
Let me hold you for a while.


645
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,820
Let me hold you for a while.


646
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,860
Shouldn't you be weak 


647
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,660
when you have a cold?


648
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,780
But you look


649
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,460
as strong as a bull.


650
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,500
I'm dizzy. 


651
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,260
I can't hear anything.


652
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,460
I can't hear anything.


653
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,180
Let me hold you for a while.


654
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,050
Let's eat the egg.


655
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,140
Give it a try.


656
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,620
How is it? Is it good?
