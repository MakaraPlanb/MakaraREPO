[Episode 10]


4
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,740
There's someone out there.


5
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,500
You again?


6
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,729
Nan Nan,


7
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,740
I made an appointment with Pang


8
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,700
to bring our fathers


9
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,420
to the football game on the weekend.


10
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,660
It's not my business.


11
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,020
You're going to the football game with me.


12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,780
I'm not your father.


13
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,380
You can be my father.


14
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,780
Who is it?


15
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,020
A little beggar.


16
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,580
I'm not a be...


17
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,420
Be good.


18
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,300
Go back to where you came from.


19
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,860
I have no time for you today.


20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,820
You like Bei Bei,


21
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,810
and Bei Bei likes me.


22
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,260
If you don't go with me this weekend,


23
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,579
I'll stay with Bei Bei.


24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,460
I dare you to!


25
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,850
If you go with me,


26
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,060
I'll let you have Bei Bei.


27
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,579
Do you think I would be threatened by you?


28
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,980
Wait and see!


29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,370
Come on!


30
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,780
Come on, Dad!


31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,500
Come on, Dad!


32
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,300
Come on, Dad!


33
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,380
You're useless.


34
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,180
Useless.


35
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,700
Loser.


36
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,260
Such a loser.


37
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,500
Just because they can play football doesn't mean they're good.


38
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,980
Can you sing?


39
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,380
No.


40
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,740
Can you dance?


41
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,620
No.


42
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,820
How come you don't know anything?


43
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,100
Uncle Gu is better than you.


44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,500
He is handsome and rich.


45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,580
And he recommended me for the job.


46
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,460
When he speaks, everyone listens to him.


47
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,540
How about you?


48
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,890
I have to make money to support you.


49
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,019
You must try harder!


50
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,140
He recommended you for a job?


51
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,580
Don't tell Bei Bei about it.


52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,620
Chris.


53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,060
Were you secretly modeling out there?


54
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Bei Bei, Auntie, I'm sorry.


55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,380
Apologies don't work. You have to be educated properly.


56
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,260
You're being disloyal


57
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,380
and a snitch!


58
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,860
Uncle Gu is not like you.


59
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,980
Be serious.


60
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,860
It's your fault.


61
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,020
How can you blame him?


62
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,180
Do you have any idea


63
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,220
what to do if a little child like you encounters bad guys?


64
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,140
Well...


65
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,180
As for educating Chris,


66
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,380
you can leave it to Ye Ting.


67
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,220
Let's go back.


68
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,900
Grandma's birthday is tomorrow.


69
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,090
We have to get ready for it.


70
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,340
Mr. Lu is right.


71
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,220
Then I'll take care of Chris.


72
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,540
You may go home.


73
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,820
I'll go back as soon as he calms down.


74
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,690
I think we should go back together.


75
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,540
Mr. Lu,


76
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,100
you can't be jealous of a child, can you?


77
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,220
Don't worry.


78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,220
I'll send her home later.


79
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,250
Although the two of them always argue,


80
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,860
 I can see that


81
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,020
Chris really likes Lu Nan.


82
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,300
And Lu Nan


83
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,700
was just reluctant to admit that he likes him.


84
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,420
I know what you're trying to say.


85
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,780
Even if I want to give more love to him,


86
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,530
the love is not complete.


87
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,700
It's all my fault.


88
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,580
Su Su,


89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,340
Lu Nan


90
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,980
hasn't found out who Chris really is so far.


91
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
Don't worry about it.


92
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,060
And


93
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,300
I want you to be happy.


94
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,180
Will I ever be happy again?


95
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Why are you still here?


96
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,780
I'm waiting for you to come home with me.


97
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,860
I was


98
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,780
being gossipy today.


99
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,300
You didn't have to be so hard on Chris.


100
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,420
Although


101
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,140
Ye Ting is his Auntie,


102
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,420
I always felt like


103
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,260
you two were closer.


104
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,620
You...


105
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,140
Nothing.


106
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,500
I do feel closer to him.


107
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,140
If my boy 


108
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
had been alive,


109
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,740
he would have been Chris's age,


110
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,740
so 


111
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,620
I always subconsciously take


112
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,540
Chris as my own kid.


113
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,340
So...


114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,100
Lu Nan,


115
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
can you be nicer to him?


116
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,250
Give him as much love as you can.


117
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Let's go.


118
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,940
Is there anything we can't talk about over the phone?


119
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,900
I can't go out much.


120
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,300
We need to talk.


121
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:25,810
Go ahead.


122
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,220
No, I won't do it.


123
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,100
If he sees me now,


124
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,340
he's gonna kill me.


125
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,700
There is always a way.


126
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,100
Think about it.


127
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,580
With your relationship,


128
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,340
he can't do anything to you right now.


129
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,300
But if he finds out what...


130
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,940
what I did behind his back,


131
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,620
he's gonna kill me.


132
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,900
Our Boss is gonna kill you too,


133
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,380
if he knows you refuse to do it.


134
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,860
Remember,


135
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,180
we're in the same boat.


136
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,380
When can I


137
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,820
live without fear?


138
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,740
I can't live like this anymore.


139
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,420
I want to live a stable life.


140
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,780
Zhang Yuan, you don't think


141
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,570
you can just get away with it, right?


142
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,340
What are you thinking?


143
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,900
You embezzled so much money.


144
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,700
If I were you,


145
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,580
I would do it without complaint.


146
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,580
Otherwise you'll have to bear the consequences.


147
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,100
This is the deposit.


148
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,500
Our Boss said


149
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,820
you'll have more


150
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,820
after it is done.


151
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,100
You can go now.


152
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,500
Does this look good on me?


153
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,860
I need you to zip it up.


154
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,700
Is it done?


155
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,260
Where are you going dressed like that?


156
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,540
Aren't we going to Grandma's birthday party?


157
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,540
No.


158
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,780
This one doesn't fit you.


159
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,460
Let's go. Change your clothes.


160
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,740
Change your clothes.


161
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,410
How about this one?


162
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,140
Too revealing.


163
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,420
You think I can't afford clothes with more fabrics?


164
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,860
Well...


165
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,860
How about these two?


166
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,860
Not elegant enough.


167
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,660
In that case,


168
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,700
why did you ask Yunfan to send them here?


169
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,340
I just asked him to send some dresses here,


170
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,180
and who knows that he had such a bad taste?


171
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,500
I'll teach him a lesson after I get back.


172
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,420
How about you?


173
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,380
Do you have appropriate clothes?


174
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,060
This one.


175
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,500
You want me to wear a sweat suit


176
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,940
for a birthday party?


177
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,140
Then why don't you wear it?

179
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,380
May your fortune be as boundless as the East Sea and may you live a long and happy life, Grandma!


180
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,420
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


181
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,660
Come on, let's have a toast.

183
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,990
Good.


184
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,940
Sit. Sit down.


185
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm so pleased that you're here.


186
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,940
That's very kind of you.


187
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,380
Thank you for your presents.


188
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,300
Really.

Why isn't Nan Nan here yet?

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,140

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,620
Grandma.


193
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,300
Nan Nan, come.


194
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,100
Have a seat.


195
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,380
Come here.


196
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,940
Grandma.


197
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,620
Grandma.


198
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,900
Happy birthday.


199
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,700
I really don't want to see her.


200
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,500
Grandma. Happy birthday.


201
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,380
I chose this present especially for you.


202
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,530
See if you like it.


203
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,180
You don't really think


204
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,090
I want your gift, do you?


205
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,100
Besides, 


206
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,340
what good things


207
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,130
can go in such a small box?


208
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,060
Grandma, don't say that in public.


209
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,740
Grandma.


210
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Although Su Bei chose this present,


211
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,700
I was the one who paid for it.


212
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,620
So if you don't like it,


213
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,260
I'll be upset.


214
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,060
Why didn't you tell me sooner?


215
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,940
I like


216
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,300
whatever you buy.


217
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,940
Okay.


218
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,500
My grandson


219
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,900
is excellent.


220
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,180
He just took over the company.


221
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,260
And the company is about to go public.


222
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,340
More importantly,


223
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,820
he is very filial.


224
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,780
Just take this birthday party for an example.


225
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,580
I told him not to do it


226
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,740
because I'm too old for this.


227
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,220
But he insisted


228
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,980
and invited a chef


229
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,460
from a Michelin 4-starred restaurant in the USA.


230
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,740
He made it too grand.


231
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,340
This kid is really "disobedient".


232
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,300
Aunt,


233
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
happy birthday.


234
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,820
Yuan,


235
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,340
come here, have a seat.


236
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,740
May your fortune be as boundless as the East Sea,


237
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,930
and may you live a long and happy life


238
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,940
for a hundred years,


239
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,060
and I wish you good health.


240
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,380
That's enough. I know you are a good boy.


241
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,900
You don't have to do that in our family.


242
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,380
Come here, have a seat.


243
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,260
Sit.


244
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,900
Sit down.


245
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,420
Cousin.


246
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,370
Why didn't you


247
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,780
greet your uncle?


248
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,820
Uncle?


249
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,180
Just ask him


250
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,180
what he did.


251
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,340
He is unworthy of being an uncle.


252
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,250
Nan,


253
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,220
I did all those things


254
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,740
so the company


255
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,290
could make more money.


256
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,380
Besides,


257
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,980
I made up the shortfall


258
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
three months ago.


259
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,650
Eight million RMB,


260
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,500
not a penny less.


261
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,540
Otherwise,


262
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,100
you would face consequences that are worse than being fired.


263
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,380
Aunt, Nan...


264
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,420
Enough.


265
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,770
Today's my birthday.


266
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,020
Don't talk about work.


267
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,620
Yeah.


268
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,220
Be happy for my birthday.


269
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,740
Yeah. Yeah.


270
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,820
Aunt, happy birthday.


271
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,180
Who is this girl?


272
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,540
My girlfriend.


273
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,740
What's your name, girl?


274
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,690
How old are you?


275
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,700
Aunt,


276
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,700
my name is Qiao Qiao, and I'm 24 years old.


277
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,700
- She is so pretty.
- Qiao.


278
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,780
Much prettier than the previous one.


279
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,540
Aunt.


280
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,890
It's too stuffy here. 


281
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,780
Shall we talk a walk together?


282
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,500
Aunt,


283
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,660
excuse me.


284
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,940
Qiao Qiao's just got pregnant.


285
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,090
She probably finds the room stuffy.


286
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,770
I'll walk her out for some fresh air.


287
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,140
You can go.


288
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,140
Okay.


289
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,780
Enjoy yourselves.


290
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:47,810
What's wrong?


291
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,380
Nothing.


292
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,780
I need to go to the bathroom.


293
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,820
Everybody.


294
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,620
Make yourselves at home.


295
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,820
Honey.


296
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,260
Don't be angry.


297
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,580
How many ex-girlfriends do you have?


298
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,340
Don't listen to the old lady.


299
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,860
Uncle.


300
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,380
What are you doing here?


301
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,140
Nothing. Nothing.


302
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,700
Really?


303
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,180
Yes.


304
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,650
You're not lying?


305
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,860
Seriously. I'm not lying to you.


306
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,780
Uncle.


307
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,020
Where did you make your fortune recently?


308
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,700
I didn't make a fortune,


309
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,660
I was just surviving.


310
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,660
You're too modest.


311
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,500
You could cover an eight million deficit.


312
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
If you have any good projects,


313
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,500
why not share them with me?


314
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,860
After all, we're relatives.


315
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,220
I have no project.


316
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,700
I was just lucky.


317
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,980
Qiao Qiao is waiting for me.


318
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,860
I need to go now.


319
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,460
Byebye.


320
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,020
What happened?


321
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,250
[May your happiness be as immense as the Eastern Sea]


322
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,660
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.


323
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,100
Goodbye.


324
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,260
Take care.


325
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,500
Grandma, let's sit down.


326
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,220
It's really nice to see


327
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,140
your uncle


328
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,060
finally settle down this time.


329
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,700
If only your brother


330
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,020
could have a baby.


331
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,780
At my age,


332
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,220
I don't know whether I could see four generations under one roof.


333
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,380
Grandma, don't say that.


334
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,500
You're gonna live a long life.


335
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,500
What you need to do


336
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,500
is to take care of yourself.


337
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,780
My brother is still young.


338
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm sure they can


339
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,180
have another baby soon.


340
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,260
Another baby?


341
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,380
What do you mean?


342
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,540
I...


343
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,100
I was wrong.


344
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,980
I didn't mean anything.


345
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,660
Fei.


346
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,980
You're not a good liar.


347
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,780
Tell me.


348
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,810
Su Bei was pregnant, wasn't she?


349
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,780
Tell me.


350
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,460
You're driving me crazy.


351
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,050
What happened?


352
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,100
I saw on the news that


353
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,060
my sister-in-law aborted a baby


354
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,890
when she just arrived in Italy.


355
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,060
This Su Bei.


356
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,540
I can't believe she aborted my great-grandson.


357
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,780
She...


358
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,450
Does she have the right?


359
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,460
Grandma, don't be angry.


360
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,260
I think, 


361
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,900
at that time


362
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,780
and in that situation,


363
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,420
she was suddenly sent abroad.


364
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,300
She couldn't


365
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,780
figure it out.


366
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,060
Couldn't figure it out?


367
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,700
Even so, that was a human life!


368
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,660
That was the baby of the Lu family!


369
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,780
Su Bei.


370
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,300
Su Bei.


371
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,380
What's up?


372
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,500
Grandma, what happened?


373
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,340
Why didn't I see you so vicious


374
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,140
when you two got married?


375
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,980
What happened, grandma?


376
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,140
Nan Nan.


377
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,700
Hang in there.


378
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,780
Grandma had just


379
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,820
learned the news.


380
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,020
This woman


381
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,900
aborted a child abroad.


382
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,220
She killed the offspring of our family.


383
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,060
Grandma.


384
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,460
Let me explain.


385
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,620
Su Bei


386
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,890
did this for a reason.


387
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,570
You knew that?


388
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,540
How can you be so confused?


389
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,460
I don't care.


390
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,170
Get rid of her.


391
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,450
Divorce her.


392
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,900
I don't want to see this woman.


393
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,170
Get out.


394
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,580
Grandma.


395
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,660
Grandma.


396
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,380
Don't scare her.


397
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,140
Su Bei


398
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,140
is pregnant.


399
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,540
Well...


400
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,740
Yes. Su Bei is pregnant.


401
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,540
It's


402
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,780
my child,


403
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,260
your great-grandson.


404
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,500
If you make her angry,


405
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,540
your great-grandson might be gone.


406
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,620
Is it true?


407
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,260
You didn't lie to me?


408
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,460
Grandma, how can I lie to you?


409
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,300
I swear,


410
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,450
if I lie to you,


411
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,340
I will have no children.


412
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,740
My great-grandson is fine!


413
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,220
Okay.


414
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,820
Su Bei, sit down please.


415
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,300
Sit down.


416
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,380
Come here.


417
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,860
From now on,


418
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,500
we can't let anything happen to you.


419
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,140
Come on.


420
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,300
Get over there and take care of her.


421
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,220
Grandma.


422
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,620
You should pay attention to her diet, too.


423
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,860
Take good care of her.


424
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,740
Su Bei, what do you want to eat?


425
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,060
I'll make it for you.


426
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,660
OK. I...


427
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,580
I'll take good care of her, grandma.


428
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,260
Fine.


429
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,820
Hello?


430
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,820
Bei Bei.


431
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,980
I found out that Auntie Lan


432
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,500
had deposited the Fragrance Brocade


433
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,260
in a safe


434
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,260
at 318 Qing'an Road before the accident.


435
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,410
After Auntie Lan had an accident,


436
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,860
it was taken away by someone else.


437
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,260
But that place


438
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,780
never registers customer information.


439
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,980
They are only accessed by password.


440
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,810
So there's no way to find out


441
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,660
who took the Fragrance Brocade.


442
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,220
OK. I see.


443
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,620
By the way, look into Qiao Qiao.


444
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,540
Qiao Qiao?


445
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,580
Who is it?


446
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,900
Zhang Yuan's girlfriend.


447
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,340
Zhang Yuan came to 


448
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,380
grandma's birthday party today.


449
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,460
Three months ago,


450
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,780
he covered the Eminence's deficit of eight million.


451
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,180
I don't believe he can come up with so much money at once.


452
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,340
Besides, the time


453
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,180
matches the time when Auntie Lan's account


454
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,060
was transferred out.


455
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,100
And his girlfriend's last name is Qiao.


456
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,260
They are both 24 years old.


457
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,180
You focus on


458
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,580
these two points.


459
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,380
OK.


460
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:24,860
By the way,


461
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,780
the witness has been found.


462
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,300
He said he saw someone


463
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,570
enter the warehouse before the fire.


464
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,740
I‘m already looking for


465
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,180
the surveillance footage that day.


466
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,820
When I find it,


467
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,730
I'll check with the witness.


468
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,210
We should have results soon.


469
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
I hope this time we can get to the bottom of it.


470
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,810
I'm getting more and more confused.


471
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,260
I don't know I should doubt him


472
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,140
or believe him.


473
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,700
But the Fragrance Brocade hasn't been found yet.

I hope this time we can get to the bottom of it.

But the Fragrance Brocade hasn't been found yet.


485
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,180
It turns out that Su Bei came back for this.

[Fragrance Brocade]


487
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,580
Why did you lie?


488
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,100
What?


489
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,900
I'm not pregnant.


490
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,020
Why did you lie to grandma?


491
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,460
Grandma is trying to get rid of you.


492
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,740
I had to do something.


493
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,100
What are we gonna do?


494
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,980
How are we going to pull this off?


495
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,300
I eat regularly


496
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,300
and keep regular hours.


497
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,340
I'm in good health.


498
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,100
I can climb the tenth floor without stopping.


499
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,700
You have no problem.


500
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,860
We have no problem.

502
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,980
I'm not kidding you about this.


503
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,300
I‘m not kidding you either.


504
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,300
Su Bei.


505
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,700
Trust me.


506
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,060
I'm gonna be 


507
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,100
a good and responsible father.


508
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,460
Look,


509
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,970
you like Chris so much.


510
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,460
But he is someone else's kid after all.


511
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,340
He's close to you


512
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,700
because his mother is not around.


513
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,180
When his mother come back,


514
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,700
he won't hang out with you.


515
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,690
What's more,


516
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,860
that kid


517
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,220
is a sweet-talker and not serious.


518
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,500
So,


519
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,460
maybe we should just 


520
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,220
have our own kids.


521
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,340
Do you really hate your own child so much?


522
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,940
You came to me with wine in the middle of the night.


523
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,860
What's the matter?


524
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,220
Well...


525
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,660
It's kind of important to you.


526
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,900
Aren't you used to 


527
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,220
not talking about work at home?


528
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,020
I'm not talking about work.


529
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,540
I'd like to discuss


530
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,820
pregnancy solutions with you.


531
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,540
Discuss what?


532
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
You want to make it real?


533
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,780
Well...I can do that


534
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,370
if you want.


535
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,940
I can cooperate.


536
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,380
But before we get started,


537
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,940
let's have a drink, shall we?


538
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,820
Who wants to have a baby with you!?


539
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:17,980
Get out.


540
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,980
What's wrong with me?


541
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,740
Can't I do something else at night?


542
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,940
I can't believe I'm fighting here with you.


543
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,020
A single man


544
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,500
can only play with his hands.


545
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,020
What else can you do?


546
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Holy shit.


547
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,500
You're making personal remarks.


548
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,620
Well, don't blame me 


549
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,060
for being ruthless.


550
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,330
Come on.


551
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,220
I've heard of premarital  phobia.


552
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,500
Do you have a fear of being a father?


553
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,220
Su Bei is not pregnant.


554
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,140
Is there something wrong


555
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,940
with your "that" ability?


556
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,540
You're killing me.


557
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,410
What's wrong with you?


558
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,090
You look like you're insatiable.


559
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,300
Do you think I'm attractive?


560
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,380
Of course.


561
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,100
Women are killing each other for you.


562
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,820
Then why did she turn me down?


563
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,860
What did you do?


564
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,140
Well, that's it.


565
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,050
You're a little desperate


566
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,660
to get laid.


567
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,540
She's hinting that she wanted a baby.


568
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,740
What did she do?


569
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,700
She was...


570
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,260
Look,


571
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,900
she's so moved by these words.


572
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,820
Wasn't that a hint?


573
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,260
Are you sure?


574
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,180
Wasn't she angry


575
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,500
because you disliked her adopted son?


576
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,340
Brother.


577
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,260
I didn't mean that.


578
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,940
I mean,


579
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,260
maybe


580
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,620
we're taking this a little too far.


581
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,380
You know,


582
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,940
you haven't seen each other for seven years.


583
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,180
It's like falling in love again.


584
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,860
You didn't even make your first confession.


585
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,220
And you went straight to the last step to sleep with her.


586
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,460
You're acting like a hooligan.


587
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,420
What else am I supposed to confess?


588
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,020
I'm almost giving myself away.


589
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,460
Look at what you have done.


590
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,540
Sending gifts.


591
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,620
Does she lack these?


592
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,220
And you asked her to give you a baby.


593
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,700
Weren't you hurting her?


594
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,330
You should sing the chorus of love.


595
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,780
Otherwise, Gu Yan...


596
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,020
I mean,


597
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,620
anyone can do these things.


598
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,540
You should give her what she wants.


599
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,220
This is what comes from your heart.


600
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,020
I see.


601
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,180
This time,


602
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,050
I'm sure she won't leave me.


603
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,020
Uh,


604
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,020
you asked me to look into Su Bei.


605
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,060
I found out that she had contact with Zhang Yuan.


606
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,780
What are you trying to say?


607
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,420
I...


608
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,540
I mean...


609
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,260
Are you gonna...


610
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,580
You don't have to look into her anymore.


611
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,380
Now that I have chosen her,


612
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,740
I shall no longer doubt her.


613
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:36,980
OK.


614
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,410
By the way,


615
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,740
Tomorrow, I need you 


616
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,100
to have the cameras removed from my house.


617
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,050
Hello.


618
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,060
I need you to track


619
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,810
Su Bei's movements after she came back to China.


620
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,890
The more detail, the better.


621
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,060
I'll transfer the money to your account.


622
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,140
OK.


623
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,090
Don't worry.


624
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,340
Su Bei.


625
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,860
Come here, please.


626
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,180
I've got you something.

628

629

Do you like it?


630
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,740
Early in the morning,


631
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,660
my husband gave me the divorce agreement.


632
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,260
Do you think I'll like it?


633
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,660
No, you got it wrong.


634
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:38,980

00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,930
I give it to you now.


639
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,300

640

you will give me 99.9% of the Eminence Group shares you hold?


641
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,770

646

is sincere or not?
