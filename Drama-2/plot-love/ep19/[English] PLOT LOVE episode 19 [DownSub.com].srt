Ms. Su,

164
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,460
for the pattern on the clothes,

165
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,890
shall we use screen or heat press printing?

166
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,940
If I let you decide,

167
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,020
which one would you choose?

168
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,020
Screen printing is cost effective and efficient.

169
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,740
Heat press printing costs more

170
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,740
but cannot endure multiple washing.

171
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,860
But

172
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,740
either way

173
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,020
will cause damage

174
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,940
to the clothes to some degree.

175
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,180
So

176
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,620
I'll use embroidery printing.

177
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,740

178
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,650

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,180

of money at this point?

382
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,740
Ye Ting, explain yourself.

383
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,340
I don't know.

384
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,940
How can you not know about your account?

385
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,370
I really don't know.

386
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,660
Nobody has ever transferred money to me.

387
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,860
No need to investigate anymore.

388
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,660
All the evidence is here.

389
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,060
No way!

390
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,140
Ye Ting would never do that.

391
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,210
Think about it.

392
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,380
How did you get the money?

393
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,860
I believe you are innocent.

394
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
I really don't know.

395
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,580
Although this account is under my name,

396
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,460
I've never seen it before.

397
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,380
No need to explain anymore.

398
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,770
Since you're Ms. Su's assistant,

399
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,220
this thing must have

400
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,100
something to do with Ms. Su.

401
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,060
Since the sketch was leaked out,

402
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,060
Ms. Su tried to turn the tide on her own

403
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,060
and solved the problem successfully.

404
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,700
She even managed to double the sales.

405
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,540
Because of this,

406
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,500
I can guarantee that

407
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,619
Ms. Su couldn't be involved.

408
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,500
It seems that Eminence

409
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,140
has become a couple company.

410
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,260
We shareholders

411
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,260
don't matter anymore.

412
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,579
Fine.

413
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,500
Since I owe you an explanation,

414
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,100
I'll hand Ye Ting over

415
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,500
to the police.

416
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,810
You really suspect Ye Ting?

417
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,540
Whether it's true or not

418
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,900
will be revealed by the police.

419
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,740
She's just assisting the investigation.

420
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,500
You have to believe in law.

421
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,900
Suspecting her

422
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,620
means you're suspecting me.

423
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,340
I said

424
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,980
we'll leave it to the police.

425
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,060
What's the difference between

426
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,800
investigating her and suspecting me?

427
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,460
Don't be ridiculous.

428
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,180
Somebody has to be blamed.

429
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,780
I'm so disappointed in you.

430
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,180
Ye Ting is in my team.

431
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,020
Before there's any concrete evidence,

432
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,500
nobody can fire her.

433
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,740
Let's go.

435
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,930
Ms. Lu, what happened?

436
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,740
What happened?

437
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,610
We've been worried to death.

438
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,630
Don't worry everyone.

439
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,360
Yeah.

440
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,700
I'll be responsible for everything.

441
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,540

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,320
- Hi Mr. Lu.
- Hi Mr. Lu.

444
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,890
Hi Mr. Lu.

445
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,620
You can leave now.

446
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,700
Okay.

447
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,500
Okay.

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,380
Can you stop being so selfish?

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,860
I'm not only your husband.

451
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,260
I'm also the chairman of the board.

452
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,020
You made me lose face

453
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,980
in front of all the other directors.

454
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,020

What do you mean?

456
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,540
Are you sending Ye Ting to the police?

457
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,140
For an outsider,

458
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,620
you want to hurt our relationship?

459
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,740
Outsider. You're saying she's an outsider.

460
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,540
Isn't she?

461
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,900
Lu Nan,

462
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,580
when I was criticized seven years ago,

463
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,500
what were you doing?

464
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,700
When I was giving birth

465
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,260
and the baby was sick,

466
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,740
what were you doing?

467
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,540
When I was making a living

468
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,980
and drinking a lot for work,

469
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,060
where were you?

470
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,980
It was Ye Ting

471
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,020
who supported me through

472
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,780
the most difficult time of my life.

473
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,020
She isn't an outsider.

474
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,060
You have no right to judge her.

475
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,180
Fine.

476
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,420
I admit she went through with you during

477
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,220
the most difficult seven years of your life.

478
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,740
But that is past tense.

479
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,020
People change.

480
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,100
You can't say that

481
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,060
there's no problem with Ye Ting now.

482
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,700
If you think there's a problem with Ye Ting,

483
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,580
there's a problem with me.

484
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,780
You're being ridiculous.

485
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,700
Lu Nan. I tell you

486
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
in my heart, Ye Ting

487
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,450
was never an outsider.

488
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,930
On the contrary, you

489
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,410
are so selfish.

490
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,980
You hurt people around you for yourself.

491
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,900
Seven years ago,

492
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,540
you didn't try to find out the truth

493
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,700
and sent me abroad directly.

494
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,180
Seven years later,

495
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,340
you don't try to find out the truth

496
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,820
and send Ye Ting to the police.

497
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,540
Lu Nan,

498
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,580
in my heart,

499
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,580
you can't be compared with Ye Ting.

500
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,860
In your view,

501
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,380
am I that terrible?

502
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,260
I find what you did

503
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,140
very disgusting.

504
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,260
Lu Nan,

505
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,460
I want a divorce.

506
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,580
Fine.

507
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,740
Let's do it. I don't care.

508
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,460
Sister,

509
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,660
you can't suddenly bring up divorce.

510
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,820
You have to think straight.

511
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,820
You and Ye Ting are the most important people to me.

512
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,090
I won't let anyone hurt you.

513
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,580
You're drinking.

514
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,780
Why are you here?

515
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,220
We're

516
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,060
colleagues.

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,540
I came to comfort you.

518
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:10,940
Go away.

519
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,300
This is not nice.

520
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,220
You'll feel lonely drinking alone.

521
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,020
I came with sincerity.

522
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,220
Enough.

523
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,020
You better stay away from me.

524
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,980
I'm a corporate espionage.

525
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,340
What are you talking about?

526
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,570
Am I that kind of person?

527
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,540
Aren't you?

528
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,970
Come here.

529
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,260
Sit properly.

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,180
Although you're a tomboy,

531
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,740
I'm willing to swear

532
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,740
in the name of my future generation

533
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,380
that you would never do anything like that.

534
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,740
I trust you.

535
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,180
Are you afraid?

536
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,380
Close your eyes.

[Eminence Group]

538
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,740
What is it?

539
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,410
It's a transfer from the director of boards.

540
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,980
They decided that

541
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,900
from now on you'll be removed from

542
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,620
the collaboration project with Sia.

544
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,180
It's just a temporary suspension.

After the investigation of the design sketch,

546
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,860
Mr. Lu will resume your position.

547
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,660
Is this what the director of board wants

548
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,820
or what he wants?

549
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,780
It certainly isn't what I want.

550
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,460
I'll go ask him.

551
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,500
I'll go too.

If you don't want to die,

555
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,100
then stay away from them.

558
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,460

It's not at home.

560
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,930
You have no respect.

561
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,660
Lu Nan, what do you mean?

562
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,060
Getting rid of me after I finished the job?

563
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,180
You were so sincere just then

564
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,420
and now you turn yourself against me.

565
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,260

566
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,140
what kind of person are you?

567
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,060
What kind of person am I?

568
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,660
Don't you know?

569
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,700
All right.

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,580
Enough.

571
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,500
Compared with the company,

572
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,940
I need you to return to family.

573
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,940
Our family needs you.

574
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,020
Mr. Lu,

575
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,140
you want me to take the blame again?

576
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
What are you thinking?

577
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,340
I want the best for you and for our child.

578
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,130
You've been working so hard

579
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,300
and suffering a lot.

580
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
I care about you.

581
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,570
Chris also needs your company.

582
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,780
When I was settling the sketch matter,

583
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,100
why didn't you say I worked too much?

584
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,900
Now the board is holding me accountable.

585
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,260
You ask me to return home.

586
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,740
I'm not stupid.

587
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,940
I'm serious.

588
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,900
You can't settle the matter now.

589
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,620
Leave it to me.

590
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,380
You can take a good rest at home.

591
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,130
I want one more baby.

592
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,540
For the Lu family business,

593
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,100
one child is not enough.

594
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,300
Let me tell you.

595
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,740
In your dreams.

596
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,420
I'll never have children with you.

597
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,520
Why are you arguing?

598
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,460
Don't be ungrateful.

599
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,580
There's a cap to my tolerence.

600
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,140
If you can't tolerate, then don't.

601
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,420
I can't tolerate you anyway.

602
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,380
I must be blind

603
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,140
to have feelings for

604
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,450
someone selfish like you.

605
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,820
My lawyer will prepare for divorce agreement tomorrow.

606
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,380
Fine.

607
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,260
Get a divorce.

608
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,780
Even if we divorced,

609
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,260
you won't get a penny

610
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,300
nor Chris's custody.

611
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,740
Let's go.

612
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,060
That can't be true.

613
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,360
What's happening with the CEO?

614
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,660
Ms. Su

615
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,540
- Ms. Su.
- Ms. Su.

616
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,700
I decide to leave Eminence

617
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,940
and create my own brand.

618
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,940
Does anyone

619
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
want to join me and leave?

620
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,620
I do.

621
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,020
Don't leave me here.

622
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,500
You have to think carefully.

623
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,090
Yu Jia,

624
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,700
do you want to leave with me?

625
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,860
Anybody want to leave with me?

626
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,980
I do.

627
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,460
Ms. Su,

628
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,860
we'll go anywhere you go.

629
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,820

630
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,140
I do.

631
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,660
Great.

632
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,140
From now on,

633
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,700
I won't let you down.

634
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,460
Su Bei,

635
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,820
what's going on?

636
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,380
Why are you leaving in a sudden?

637
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,220
What are you doing? You can't go.

638
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,780
How can you leave in a sudden?

639
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,940
Grandma, I don't want to,

640
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,900
but I have no choice.

641
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,380
Nan Nan,

642
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,580
Nan Nan

643
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,860
come on.

644
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,220
Can we stay, mom?

645
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,660
Chris, good boy.

646
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,140
If we miss great grandma,

647
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,580
we'll come back to visit her.

648
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,060
Don't go.

649
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,060
Stay with great grandma.

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,570
What's going on, Nan Nan?

651
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,780
Nan Nan, you have to talk to Bei Bei.

652
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,180
She's leaving.

653
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,100
You can stay if you don't want to go.

654
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,140
No.

655
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,250
When you two argue,

656
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,220
don't let my great grandson suffer.

657
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,860
Grandma, just let her leave.

658
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,620
Don't come back after leaving.

659
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,940
Chris, let's go.

660
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,740

661
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,660
Grandma,

662
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,340
What's wrong, great grandma?

663
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,300
You're leaving at will.

664
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,730
Whatever I say,

665
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,250
you won't care about me.

666
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,260
Just go.

667
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,340
Just go.

668
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,500
I don't know when we'll meet again.

669
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,220
Great grandma, I won't go.

670
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,100
Bei Bei, don't go..

671
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,460
Good boy.

672
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,500
Chris you stay with great grandma first,

673
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,020
okay?

674
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,100
Bei Bei.

675
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,380
Good boy. I'll pick you up after some time.

676
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,260
I used to

677
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,740
wish playing golf like this.

678
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,330
The feeling of dominating the whole field.

679
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,540
Back then,

680
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,140
I always came with Gu Chengze, that jerk.

681
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,380
I was his aid.

682
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,290
I could only stand beside him

683
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,500
like a slave.

684
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,020
Now I finally achieved it

685
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,260
but there's nothing more.

686
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,180
I actually miss

687
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,820
the feeling of being marginal.

688
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,860
Try it.

689
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,020
Mr. Gu is starting to

690
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,220
miss the feeling of being marginal.

691
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,580
I'd rather not try.

692
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,460
So I can still dream about

693
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,700
dominating the field.

to attend the opening of MISS Studio.

701
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,380
It's not only a milestone in my life,

702
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,220
but also grand for all the MISS members.

703
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,020
From now on,

704
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,740

for the development of MISS.

Everything's hard in the beginning.

708
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,500
But I believe

709
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,700
as long as there is

710
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,060
joint effort and mutual trust among us,

711
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,700
we can definitely succeed.

As long as you guide us,

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,620
we can stick through any difficulties.

Thank you.

724
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,860
What did you want to

725
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,060
talk about collaboration?

726
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,340
Before that,

727
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,900
I want to apologize to you.

728
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,140
I didn't think the decision of the Gu's Group

729
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,740
could affect your marital relationship

730
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,820
and cause some conflicts.

731
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,100
It has nothing to do with Gu's Group.

732
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,540
It's our own issue.

733
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,020
You've came a long way

734
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,980
to get together.

735
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,020
Why are you divorcing again?

736
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Actually there has been

737
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,780
a big problem in our marriage.

738
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,140
I used to think that

739
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,060
as long as we love

740
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,380
and tolerate each other,

741
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
we can solve all problems.

742
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,460
But now it seems that

743
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,340
I was just cheating myself.

744
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,100
There's nothing bad about divorce.

745
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,780
It's a relief for the both of us.

746
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,740
It's nice to be on my own.

747
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,380
I have my career and my child.

748
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,900
As long as you're thinking straight.

749
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,420
Speaking of important matters,

750
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,700
the environmental-friendly organization

751
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,540
is going to hold a conference in Nanxi.

752
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,740
The Gu's Group

753
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,210
is the clothing sponsor for the conference.

754
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,020
We plan to,

755
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,570
other than providing daily outfit,

756
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,900
sponsor the formal dress

757
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,140
and advertising outfit with Chinese characteristic.

758
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,220
Every member will get three sets.

759
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,500
So we're

760
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,420
looking for

761
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,780
a design group

762
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,900
that can produce together.

763
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,810
If you can participate in the design,

764
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,940
it will be a great publicity

765
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,300
for your  company.

766
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,380
The Gu's Group has professional design team.

767
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,300
Why do you want me?

768
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,900
Because it's like the steak.

769
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,700
If the steak is good,

770
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
there's more people

771
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,220
willing to spend their money.

772
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,700
I have confidence in your talent.

773
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,330
Thank you.

774
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,660
But

775
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,690
if I

776
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,140
proposed a divorce to Lu Nan

777
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,740
and decided to work with you,

778
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,140
it'll bring the blame of others.

779
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,690
For me and for you,

780
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,100
I need to think about it.

781
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,660
No hurry.

782
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,020
You can tell me after you thought about it.

783
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,010
[Lu Nan]

784
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,219
Nan Nan,

785
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,500
did you regret?

786
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,380
You look like

787
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:40,060
a defeated jet.

788
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,540
Do you know what mom is doing now?

789
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,219
I don't know.

790
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,580
Judging by your look,

791
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,179
she must be with another man.

792
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,980
That man is no good.

793
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,900
If your mom left for him,

794
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,700
you'll have no mom anymore.

795
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,540
You're just jealous

796
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,420
and talk too much.

797
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,140
If you want me to win your wife back,

798
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,580
then say it directly.

799
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,140
Let's go.

800
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,340
Let's wait for her at her home.

801
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,380
Let's go.

802
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,900
Bei Bei,

803
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,980
Bei Bei.

804
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,580
Mr. Gu,

805
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,450
we meet again, Chris.

806
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,380
Su Bei,

807
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,130
even if we divorce,

808
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,660
Chris is still your child.

809
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,420
As a good mother,

810
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,970
how could you

811
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,460
neglect your son?

812
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,140
Sorry. Chris.

813
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,490
I've been too busy lately

814
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,460
to take care of you.

815
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,340
Bei Bei,

816
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
I know you've been working hard.

817
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,500
I'm not mad.

818
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,620
You know what.

819
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,740
It's Nan Nan

820
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,460
who's jealous of Mr. Gu.

821
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,220
Chris,

822
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:15,980
Chris.

823
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,060
Good boy. Come here.

824
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,780
I'll play football with you during the weekend.

825
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,380
All right?

826
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,420
Yes.

827
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,060
No.

828
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,940
I can spend time with my own kid.

829
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
No need to bother you.

830
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,220
Listen to me.

831
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,860
Su Bei is still my wife

832
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,540
so Mr. Gu

833
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,620
please respect the border.

834
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

835
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,130
If you didn't mention,

836
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,900
I almost forgot that

837
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,740
Su Bei has a husband.

838
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Please be assured that

839
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,380
I'll wait for Su Bei to get the divorce.

840
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,380
You are really in a hurry

841
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,420
to find another man.

842
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,380
Isn't it too early?

843
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,620
Let's go, Chris.

844
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,020
How can you do such thing as

845
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,820
finding a second-line?

846
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,940
Aren't you afraid that

847
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,940
I'll use it as an evidence of affair against you?

848
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,410
About the divorce,

849
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,740
I already handed it to my lawyer.

850
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,020
Before it's settled,

851
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,140
I don't want to see you anymore.
