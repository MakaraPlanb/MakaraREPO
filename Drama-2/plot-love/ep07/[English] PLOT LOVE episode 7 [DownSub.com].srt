Yes!

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,420
Yesterday, I found in his safe


41
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,940
 a mortgage contract


42
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,260
he signed with Auntie Lan.


43
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,980
Mortgage contract?


44
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,020
I didn't have enough time


45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,579

I also found 


48
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,579
a kind of dye called thorough dye


49
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,460
which only uses vegetable dyes.


50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Anything wrong with it?


51
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,940
Do you know


52
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,820
why they all want the fragrance brocade?


53
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,340
It requires a special kind of craftsmanship


54
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,420
to make the fragrance brocade.


55
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,140
No matter it‘s the filature, prints


56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,660
or dye,


57
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,180
any technique used in the process


58
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,100
can shock the clothing industry.


59
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,860
And that's why both Eminence and Gu's Group 


60
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,339
try every means to get it.


61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,779
But owing to its high cost,


62
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,020
no one dares to rashly invest in production


63
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,020
as it's not profitable.


64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,740
You mean


65
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,240
the thorough dye may be a step
 of making the fragrance brocade?


66
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,460
I'm still not sure about it.


67
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,580
For no one has seen the fragrance brocade


68
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,370
except Auntie Lan.


69
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,220
So


70
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,060
I may need some baits


71
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,900
to elicit the truth.


72
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,180
Mr. Lu,


73
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,620
this is my plan


74
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,490
for cooperating with Sia.


75
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,220
As far as I know,


76
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,650
the Gu's Group is now


77
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,860
Sia's first choice for cooperating.


78
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,460
Luckily, their director this time 


79
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,020
is Amy.


80
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,330
And I'm acquainted with her.


81
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,300
If my plan is okay,


82
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,460
then I'll visit her as soon as possible.


83
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,180
I want you to be fully in charge.


84
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,280
Be sure to make Sia cooperate with us
 even if giving up some profits.


85
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,740
Sit down.


86
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,580
The cooperation with Sia


87
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,860
can be much more important than profits.


88
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,100
I think


89
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,340
we need to find a special way


90
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,860
to get Sia's favor.


91
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,140
We can focus on the fabric


92
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,740
which is always the weakness of Gu's Group.


93
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,100
Because we have no other strength over them.


94
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,220
That's true.


95
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,260
I also think so.


96
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,140
Three months ago,


97
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,860
I tried to cooperate with a factory


98
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,340
which produced brocades and silks.


99
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,260
But things didn't go very well.


100
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,680
Later the one in charge needed money urgently,


101
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
so he promised to use their core technology


102
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,740
as the mortgage.


103
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,140
But after I paid the deposit,


104
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,180
the one in charge had an accident,


105
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,460
and then the cooperation was suspended.


106
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,620
But you have already paid the deposit.


107
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,860
Even the manager had an accident,


108
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,900
we still have the right 


109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,460
to use their core technology they mortgaged.


110
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,020
Only the manager knows the core technology.


111
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,540
But she became a vegetable


112
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,660
and has been in a coma.


113
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,650
Lu Nan has paid the deposit!


114
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,700
But from the records of Auntie Lan's bank account,


115
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,210
she didn't receive the deposit at all.


116
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,220
What are you thinking about?


117
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,340
I didn't expect that


118
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,250
you once had a failure


119
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,060
in investing.


120
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,620
Don't worry,


121
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,140
I'll try my best


122
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,060
to make Sia cooperate with us. 


123
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,820
Although the thorough dye is newly developed


124
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,180
by our research department,


125
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,180
it can be our selling point.


126
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,980
So I'll tell them to assist you


127
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,500
with anything you need.


128
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,580
Okay,


129
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,420
thank you Mr. Lu.


130
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,060
Have you found something different


131
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,780

Data for the thorough dye.


135
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,060
So is it the same to the fragrance brocade?


136
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,420
They're very different.


137
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,340
That's weird!


138
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,130
If Lu Nan did have the fragrance brocade,


139
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,210
there should be no need for him to do so.


140
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,220
It's a total waste of time for him.

Anyway, thanks to you!


150
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,420
By the way, I found that

Auntie Lan signed a mortgage contract


152
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,610
with Eminence before.


153
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,420
Do you know about it?


154
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,300
Mortgage contract?


155
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,060
What did Master Lan mortgage?


156
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,780
She didn't tell you about it?


157
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,570
Maybe before she was to tell me,


158
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,620
the accident just happened.


159
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,940
You're recovering well on the whole.


160
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,180
The blood clot has become much more smaller


161
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,220

162
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,540
As for your memory,

After all,


165
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,620
as far as I'm concerned,


166
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,980
it's already a miracle for you


167
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,780
to go out of a five-year coma.


168
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,460
Is it that only when the clot disappear


169
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,860
can my memory return?


170
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,620
Not exactly!

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,860
It' hard to say.


172

Why?


173
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,700
Because


174
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,820
it's full of nerves in our brains.


175
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,180
If the clot 


176
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,220
moves towards your nerves,


177
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,340
it'll compress 


178
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,380
the nerves around.

for feeling too stressed,


200
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,220
so I came to get some medicine.

Why are you also here?

207

I just came to ask the doctor


208
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,620
to prescribe some medicine for me.

Sure. You're still young.

It's normal to do so.

But medicine won't help all the time.


212

It can be a pity to throw it away.

 is indeed considerable.

and the high reputation in clothing

358
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,580

359
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,220
So it has an edge over you.


360

I admit what you mentioned above.


361
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,260
But it can also be hard for the Gu's Group
 to develop something new.

377
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,220
Thanks a lot.


378
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,660
Su Bei!


379
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,330
You're still here!


380
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm waiting for you.


381
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,860
I can drive you home.


382
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,380
Okay!


383
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,100
Come!


384
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,740
Thanks.


385
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,420
You can just stop here.


386
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,700
Thank you!


387
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,180
I'll treat you another day.


388
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,860
So are you returning me a favor?


389
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,300
If it is,


390
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:58,860
then there's no need for you to do so.


391
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,260
If it's just a meal between friends,  


392
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
then it will be my pleasure.


393
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
It's both of what you mentioned. 


394
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,780
If you don't want it,


395
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,900
I can save the money.


396
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,340
If you say so, I must let you treat me.


397
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,460
I can do it myself.


398
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,620
We can eat when you have time.


399
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,380
Bei Bei,


400
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,940
you're back!


401
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,860
Have you been waiting for me here?


402
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,260
You're a girl,


403
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,980
and I'm a boy.


404
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,420
I have to protect you.


405
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,620
I'm your mom.


406
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
You have a son?


407
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,180
You...


408
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,380
why are you here?


409
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,820
You lost it in my car.


410
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:21,750
Thank...


411
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,300
Thank you!


412
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,260
So careless of you.


413
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,860
So,


414
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,940
about today...


415
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,820
I have a poor memory,


416
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,450
so I can't remember what happened.


417
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,380
Thank you very much!


418
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,140
You're my friend,


419
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,780
so you don't need to thank me many times.


420
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
Please keep down!


421
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,900
Bei Bei,


422
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,220
I hope you can listen to me


423
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,100
patiently.


424
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,220
Although my dad


425
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,740
 can be annoying,


426
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,740
I'm not


427
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,780
prepared


428
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,940
to have a new dad.


429
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,380
I think my dad deserves another chance.


430
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,020
Yes,


431
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,780
you're right.


432
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,540
You don't understand! All of you！


433
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,700
This family still needs me to protect.


434
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,140
So,


435
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,260
Mr. Su,


436
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,420
have you finished your homework yet?


437
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,860
That...


438
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,940
As for the homework,


439
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,700
I think,


440
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,860
we can talk about it later.


441
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,140
Be careful!


442
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,900
Are you sure that Lu Nan paid the money?


443
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,540
Yes, the money was indeed received,


444
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,380
but was soon 


445
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,700
transferred into the account of a person


446
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,820
named Qiao Yufeng.


447
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,780
This is a 24-year-old countryman in Guang Lin.


448
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,900
But why didn't we have any idea


449
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,620
of the money before?


450
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,140
Someone has covered the track
 in Auntie Lan's account. 


451
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,700
But I haven't 


452
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,180
found out where Qiao Yufeng is now.


453
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,820
Keep investigating in it.


454
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,940
We must find the manipulator of all this.


455
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,980
Su Bei, get out there!


456
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,100
-You can't come in
-You can't come in.


457
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,820
Long time no see.


458
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,290
What?


459
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,380
Is anything wrong?


460
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,540
Damn you！


461
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Are you the one who deprived me of my endorsements,


462
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,660
and asked to force me out?


463
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,900
You don't deserve me to do so.


464
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,690
How could I waste my time and energy


465
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,570
on you?


466
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,900
Why do you look down upon me?


467
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,380
Don't you know who you really are?


468
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,420
You think being President's wife


469
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,980
and the famous Annie


470
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,540
can allow you to do whatever you want to do?


471
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,260
Yes.


472
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,100
You...


473
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
Fine, Su Bei,


474
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,170
you want to destroy me, right?


475
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,540
Then I'll give you a hard time.


476
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,220
We will see.


477
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,120
[The 8th Anniversary Celebration]


478
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,580
Manni,


479
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,170
Manni, don't drink too much.


480
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,820
You should stop now.


481
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,940
You can't just be angry and drink here.


482
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,370
I've told you 


483
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,860
Su Bei is no longer the one she was 7 years ago.


484
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,260
You should listen to me


485
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,940
and stop competing with her.


486
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,980
You don't think I can defeat her, right?


487
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,580
That's not what I meant, Manni.


488
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,020
Think about it.


489
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,380
We're best friends.


490
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,140
I'm definitely on your side.


491
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,300
I just think that


492
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,500
my brother is now under her control,


493
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,300
so we can do nothing to her.


494
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,820
Who said it?


495
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,500
If I expose  to the public her plagiarising


496
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,380
seven years ago which caused one's death,


497
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,980
then she will be done.


498
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,900
You can't do that.


499
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,340
I mean Eminence 


500
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,380
was also involved in it.


501
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,420
So you must keep the secret.


502
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,940
Besides,


503
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,220
time is different.


504
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,300
She's no longer a designer.


505
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,460
No one will care about


506
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,260
whether a model agent has plagiarised before.


507
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,900
And it was


508
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,740
you...


509
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,220
Anyway,


510
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,810
You can't


511
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,180
let her have the advantage over you anymore.


512
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,100
But,


513
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,140
if I can't do anything,


514
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,660
she will always


515
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,260
ride over me.


516
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
Or


517
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,220
maybe you can let her disappear.


518
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,140
You're right.


519
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,420
If only I can let her disappear.


520
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,980
Nan Nan!


521
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,300
Are you ignoring me?


522
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,930
Have we met before?


523
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,020
You...


524
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,900
Fine,


525
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,540
as a gentleman, I've forgiven you.


526
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,780
I came here today to tell you 


527
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,260
you should treat your wife well.


528
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,660
If she got away with another man,


529
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,020
you can only cry.


530
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,380
Are you done?


531
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,420
Boy,


532
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
first I have to tell you


533
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,090
I'm not your dad.


534
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,460
So whether your mom is fine or not


535
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,260
has nothing to do with me.


536
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,660
Second, I'm very busy now.


537
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,770
I have no time with you.


538
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,340
So,


539
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,580
you should go back 


540
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,500
to where you came from.


541
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,060
Or I'll find your mom


542
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
and ask her how she taught you


543
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,100
and why you're here alone.


544
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,340
Don't tell my mom!


545
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,500
Chris!


546
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,180
Why are you here?


547
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,450
He's the child of Ye Ting's sister.


548
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,860
Sorry for bothering you, Mr. Lu.


549
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,860
So,


550
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,740
I'll take him back home.


551
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:34,660
It doesn't matter.


552
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,540
Let's go!


553
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,300
He,


554
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,140
is so cute.


555
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,100
He's cute, but he lacks love.


556
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,500
Being abandoned by his dad since he was born,


557
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,020
he has never felt any love from his dad.


558
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,140
Do you think


559
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,620
whether his dad would regret abandoning him


560
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,540
if the dad knew


561
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,580
how lovely his son is.


562
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,540
I still have work to do. I shall go now.


563
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,100
What's wrong?


564
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,340
Did I say anything wrong?


565

No,
