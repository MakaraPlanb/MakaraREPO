[Episode 2]


4
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,620
Hey, you new arrival!


5
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,380
Miss Manni is here,


6
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,740
don't you know you should come and greet her?


7
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,460
This is our head,


8
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,980
you'd better go to greet her.


9
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,180
I only heard that there's an unknown model. 


10
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,020
So it's you!


11
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,460
Why?


12
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,420
Couldn't make a living abroad?


13
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,180
Do you need my help?


14
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,660
Well,


15
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,660
how can you help me?


16
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,380
Let me think about it!


17
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,770
I'm afraid that no company will want you,


18
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,780
considering your experience and age,


19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,180
plus your scandal abroad.


20
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,260
Of course, there's still a way left.


21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,780
To sleep around.


22
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,780
Miss Manni,


23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,140
Annie will be here soon.


24
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,220
What if...


25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,500
You'd better piss off as soon as possible.


26
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,260
Or you'll feel ashamed


27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,860
when Annie arrives.


28
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,980
She's very picky！


29
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,500
You're right.


30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,180
Annie is indeed very picky,


31
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,250
especially when seeing models


32
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,340
like you.


33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,500
You...


34
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,460
Full of obscenities, rude manners！


35
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,140
How can you be so rude?


36
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,700
I definitely can!


37
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,380
All girls here respect me very well,


38
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,290
and many brands invite me to be their models.


39
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,060
Since I am truly very busy,


40
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,660
I don't have much patience for you.


41
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,300
Really?


42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,020
But I'm very good at 
deprive others of what they own.


43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,620
There will be no renewal of contracts for you


44
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,620
in the next quarter.


45
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,420
Besides, the Gu's Group,
 the Eminence,


46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,980
and the Kong that you're going to cooperate with,


47
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,690
will all terminate the cooperation with you.


48
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,620
Models like you


49
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,260
deserve better opportunities.


50
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
Who are you?


51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,260
How can you be so arrogant?


52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,820
Shut up!


53
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,780
Look at you!


54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,220
Do you look like standard models?


55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,140
You do look like


56
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,180
those women selling vegetables in the market.


57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,980
- You...
- She really doesn't respect us


58
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,910
at all.


59
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,020
Get her out of here!


60
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,780
Don't do that!


61
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,540
How can you treat Annie like this？


62
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,420
Manager Tang, you mean she's...


63
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,300
The Eminence is truly famous,


64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,700
but if you don't work hard


65
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,579
it can still be difficult for you


66
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,380
to stand out.


67
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,940
Annie, don't be mad.


68
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,530
They used to be indolent,


69
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,300
so you may need to guide them.


70
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,620
You mean she's Annie?


71
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,540
This is the genius you talk about


72
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,380
everyday,


73
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,899
Annie.


74
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,930
Now you've met each other.


75
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,340
I was invited by Boss Lu


76
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
to be CEO of the Eminence Starlight Agency.


77
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,580
Tomorrow afternoon, 


78
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,700
I'll pick a model from you.


79
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,620
And I'll train her personally.


80
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,940
I won't require too much.


81
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,180
The one I want should follow my words,


82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,340
and work hard.


83
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Whether you can walk onto the international stage,


84
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,580
it's up to you.


85
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,730
Let's go!


86
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,420
Look at you!


87
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,060
Miss Manni,


88
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,820
what should we do now?


89
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,500
Please sit down.


90
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,780
Boss Lu will come back soon.


91
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,140
Would you like some tea or coffee?


92
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,820
Coffee, thanks!


93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,460
Okay!


94
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
If Lu Nan really has


95
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,460
the fragrance brocade,


96
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,140
he must have hidden it in his office


97
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420
or his home.


98
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,100
I'll try to find it!


99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,659
Boss Lu!


100
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,700
Why it's you again?


101
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,260
Boss Lu!


102
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,460
Nice to see you again.


103
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,220
What a coincidence.


104
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,220
This earring is so tiny,


105
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,700
and it's hard to find it back.


106
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,580
First, you pretended at the feast,


107
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,300
then you tried to blackmail me in the parking lot,


108
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,210
now you're looking for earrings in my office.


109
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,260
The way you attract me is so special.


110
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,140
So,


111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,700
have I impressed you


112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,010
a lot?


113
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,780
How about telling me your aim directly?


114
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,980
I don't want to waste my time on you.


115
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,020
I have told you.


116
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,980
It's all because I can't forget you.


117
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,890
If there's no other aim,


118
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,340
then get out of here right now.


119
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,060
At least we have been a couple.


120
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,740
Why do you be so ruthless to me?


121
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,380
Besides,


122
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,940
are you really so eager


123
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,580
to rid yourself of me?


124
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,620
What value do you think you have for me


125
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,180
to maintain our relationship?


126
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,140
Now that


127
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,420
I mean nothing for you,


128
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,420
I will just leave you alone.


129
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,180
Hope that you won't regret.


130
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,060
Wait!


131
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,050
[Divorce Agreement]


132
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Sign it!


133
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,070
[Divorce Agreement]


134
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,700
Fine, I can sign it.


135
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,940
But first we need to talk about


136
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,260
how to divide properties.


137
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,860
Your aim is truly about money.


138
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,860
- Annie.
- Su Bei.


139
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,980
Don't you need to work?


140
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,780
You're not working either!


141
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,130
I...


142
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,340
Special assistant Yun,


143
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,530
do you think


144
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,180
at this time,


145
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,380
I should enroll Annie into our company


146
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,500
or


147
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,340
get her discharged?


148
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,500
You...


149
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,420
you should decide


150
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,180
according to your understanding of Boss Lu.


151
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,020
Boss Lu,


152
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,650
do you think I'm useful now?


153
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,100
Do you think 


154
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,610
there's no one else that can replace you?


155
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,300
There're many agencies better than you.


156
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,740
But I believe that


157
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,980
the reason you chose me is that


158
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,740
I'm the most appropriate one.


159
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,260
[Employment Contract]


160
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,420
Now you're not.


161
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,940
There're 27 models
 in the Eminence Starlight Agent in all,


162
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,380
and the annual cost can be this.


163
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,260
But among all the 27 models,


164
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,380
only Su Manni


165
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,940
has stood out.


166
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,100
Most of her endorsements are from brands
 we always cooperate with.


167
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,540
And most of 
the Eminence Starlight Agent's income


168
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,140
comes from


169
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,380
the advertisements she made.


170
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
I suppose this is not


171
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
what you expect.


172
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,260
It seems that you're in a hurry


173
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,690
to prove your own ability.


174
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,380
Within three months,


175
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,700
I'll make the Eminence Starlight Agent


176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,540
become the best Model Agency in our country.


177
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,980
And I'll let more models 


178
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,420
to stand out like Su Manni.


179
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,540
Without Manni,


180
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,450
I can still find Mandy,


181
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,700
or Jenny.


182
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,340
As long as I give them enough money,


183
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,290
they're bound to make it.


184
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,420
Fine,


185
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,980
since you've made up your mind,


186
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,620
I'll respect your choice.


187
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,700
We just mentioned


188
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,460
how to divide properties before divorcing.


189
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,260
The Eminence Starlight Agency
 you worked so hard for


190
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,300
should belong to our postnuptial property.

How can it be?

Have you ever seen a easy-going person

who directly asks for properties from me?


214
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,220
It's normal to divide properties


215
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,700
if you're to divorce.


216
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,780
But,


217
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
she never came to visit you


218

219

A heartless woman like her


220
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,980
doesn't deserve getting your properties.


221
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,620
Don't divide your properties with her.


222
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,060
She doesn't deserve getting a penny from you.

the divorce agreement at all.


233
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,740
Maybe he has forgotten it after so long a time.


234
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,140

246
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,380

248

and was kicked out by my beloved husband.


251
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,620
So,


252
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,530
if I'm still the same,


253
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,540

By the way,


255
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,820
it was so unfortunate that

you were on business 


257
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,860
during my several trips to Italy.


258
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,740
It's not like that.


259
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,380
Actually, I was avoiding you on purpose.


260
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,620
So,


261
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,260
will you leave this time?


262
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,900
I didn't expect that I could be so strange to you


263
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,140
just after a few years apart.


264
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,380
You even begin to neat around the bush.


265
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,260
But it doesn't matter!


266
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,260
Even if you don't trust me,


267
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,140
I'll still get along with you sincerely.


268
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,970
He asked you
 to find out why I come back, right?


269
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,060
This time, I come back


270
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,740
neither for divorcing with him, 


271
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,450
nor for getting his properties.


272
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,060
I just want to reconcile with him.


273
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,940
But I found that


274
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,500
he seems to have forgotten me.


275
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,220
What happened to him?


276
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,660
Nothing!


277
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,860
Maybe it's too miserable 


278
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,060

279
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,020

280
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,180
Really?


281
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,580
Then can you tell me


282
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,380
whether I'm greedy 


283
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,620
to resume my marriage with him?


284
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,420
It doesn't matter how I feel about it.

I won't give her a penny.


287

According to the Marriage Law 
of the People's Republic of China,


288
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,060
it's lawful to make the erring party

290
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,100
But, the properties must be divided.


291
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,460
Do you mean that


292
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,900
I have to give half of my properties to her?


293

Solve the problem before you get off work! 


294

she has cheated on you,


299
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,180
then it may be possible to let her


300
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,300
give up dividing properties


301
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,740

you can cut the crap


305
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,940

Do you guys know?


378
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,500
Ms. Su has been sleeping around


379
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,860
to get endorsements


380
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,620
for models.


381
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,700
Many in this business circle know about this.


382
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,900
How can it be?


383
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,780
Really?


384
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,380
Can you tell me


385
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,060
which assistant


386
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,340
of which brand said it?


387
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
I accidentally heard it


388
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,420
when I was modeling today.


389
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,860
Is it because you slept with too many people


390
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,060
so that you don’t remember it?


391
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,620
Is he William who founded CG?


392
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,860
Or is he Leo, the Design Director of Double C?


393
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,740
Or is the one Ken from L?


394
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,860
Give me some hints.


395
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,210
I'm afraid only you know


396
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,300
whether you have slept with all of them.


397
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,780
Of course I know.


398
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,890
It's you that don't know.


399
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,060
When William was not so famous and was about to starve to death,


400
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,420
it was me that spent ten thousand dollars


401
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,610
on a set of his clothes.


402
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,140
Then he could build the CG


403
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,860
you've all been hungry for.


404
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,180
And Leo


405
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,660
was a model under my management.


406
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
One day he hurt his foot


407
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,620
and stopped his career as a model.


408
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,180
Do you still wanna know who Ken is?


409
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,460
Hello, Annie?


410
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,380
You finally called me!


411
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,460
My daughter misses you so much.


412
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,380
Ken is a female?


413
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,900
Ken, I'll visit you when I'm free.


414
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,100
Ken is a girl!


415
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,860
This is Ken.


416
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,860
But,


417
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm used to calling her Kennie.


418
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,420
Now,


419
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,410
apologize to me for what you just said.


420
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,660
That's impossible.


421
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,340
You can't force me to do things just because you're superior to me.


422
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,020
You should know that my contract with Eminence


423
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,090
is about to expire.


424
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,540
There is more than one brokerage company


425
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
being in contact with me now.


426
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,090
Congrats!


427
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,300
Wish you good luck.


428
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,060
Liu Qianying.


429
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,300
You have the highest score in the assessment today.


430
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,540
After Su Manni terminates her contract,


431
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,300
you will be the chief model of Eminence.


432
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,600
- Chief model?
- So lucky is she.


433
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,220
Can she really do it?


434
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,500
Mary.


435
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,740
Assign all Su Manni's activities now


436
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
to Qianying.


437
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,900
For those that can't be assigned,


438
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,820
get ready for cancelling the contracts.


439
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,380
Okay.


440
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,860
Cancelling contracts with me?


441
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,780
Aren't you afraid that Boss Lu 
may come to you for trouble.


442
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,130
One of the entry requirements Boss Lu promised me


443
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,940
is that I have


444
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,140
the independent decision-making power
 over the entire brokerage company.


445
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,380
Of course,


446
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,700
it also includes not renewing our contract with you.


447
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,660
When you're out of the company,


448
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,180
I think you won't have any chance
 to approach Lu Nan.


449
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,460
I am going to take back everything


450
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,770
you stole from me.


451
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,220
As for the contract extension I prepared today,


452
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,020
I should just...


453
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,820
Don't even think about it!


454
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,620
[The second party's Signature(Fingerprint): Su Manni]


455
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,100
I won't let you have what you want.


456
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,020
Really?


457
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,620
Believe it or not,


458
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,180
within a month,


459
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,820
I will let Liu Qianying replace you


460
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,340
as the next national model.


461
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,340
Seriously?


462
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,740
No matter what purpose Su Bei has,


463
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,220
it was indeed a good idea


464
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,580
to let her hold down Su Manni.


465
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,820
Fei.


466
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,260
Do you know how insolent Su Bei was?


467
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,380
Does she really see herself as the Chairman's wife?


468
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,860
How did she pretend to be


469
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,740
so naive and innocent before?


470
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,900
And because of her,


471
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,140
your brother's attitude
 towards you was much colder.


472
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,820
Such a jinx.


473
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,220
Now I know that,


474
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,210
as long as she's there,


475
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,260
we'll never have a good time.


476
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,940
But she is the Chairman's wife.


477
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,300
It's useless to get mad.


478
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,860
Chairman's wife?


479
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,740
You didn't see that


480
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,180
your brother has been ignoring her.


481
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,820
But she's still shamelessly
 showing excessive passion to him.


482
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Maybe it's because that 


483
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
she has had such a hard time abroad


484
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
in the last few years.


485
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,380
What was hard for her?


486
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,500
Was it hard for her to be around various men?


487
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,660
I wonder how many men she has slept with


488
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,260
to get her to where she is now.


489
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,620
Manni.


490
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,540
You should stop.


491
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,900
After all she is the Annie my brother hired.


492
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,780
Not to mention that we don't like her,


493
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,980
even if grandma comes back,


494
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,140
she can still do nothing to her.


495
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,380
And


496
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,420
you know my brother.


497
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,500
He


498
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,580
would never trust anything if there's no evidence.


499
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,140
I have all the evidence he wants.


500
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,820
I will make sure that


501
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,660
your brother is going to see who she really is.


502
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,780
You shouldn't do it.


503
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,380
What if my brother finds out...


504
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,820
You're just such a chicken.


505
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,700
Seven years ago,


506
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,220
I could already get her wrapped 


507
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,540
around my fingers.


508
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,980
Okay.


509
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,020
I'll handle this.


510
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,860
I'm going now.


511
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,020
Help me investigate someone.


512
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,180
I want to know everything about her
 when she was in Italy.


513
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,100
Her information


514
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,380
will be e-mailed to you later.


515

[Gu's Apparel Group KOOG]


516
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,900
Welcome to the brand launch of the Gu's.


517
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,140
I am Gu Chengze.


518
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,260
I'm also the founder of the brand, Kong.


519
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,700
From the follower of fashion


520
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,300
to the leader of fashion


521
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,780
and the creator in the market.


522
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,260
This will be


523
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,460
the Gu's latest idea to build Kong.


524
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,980
I now announce that


525
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,660
Kong's Spring Fashion Show


526
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,580
will now begin.


527
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,660
The launch event the Gu's held wasn't so bad.


528
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,580
Well, it's okay.


529
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,500
We would have done it better.


530
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,980
You're right.


531
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,500
Do you want to endorse Kong?


532
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,740
But I heard Mr. Gu say that


533
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,060
he wanted Manni to...


534
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,100
Don't be so diffident.


535
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,300
I want to.


536
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,820
Good.


537
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,490
It's very cheeky of you to show up here.


538
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,340
But with a drag alongside?


539
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,340
You really have a lot of nerve.


540
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,940
When I help Qianying


541
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,740
get the Kong's endorsement from Boss Gu,


542
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,210
it will not be too late for you to keep your eyes polished.


543
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,410
Really? She?


544
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,900
Don't think that because you are Annie,


545
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,300
Boss Gu will agree to anything
 you ask about.


546
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,260
Given the relationship between me and Boss Gu,


547
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,980
isn't it quite easy


548
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,860
to ask for some endorsements from him?


549
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,620
Are you Annie?


550
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,460
You are?


551
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,730
I’m Gu Yan, Gu’s project manager.


552
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,460
The intermediary from Gu's


553
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,980
who you declined three times.


554
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,700
Excuse me.


555
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,060
I was disrespectful last time.


556
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,170
My apologies.


557
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,420
I hope that I can get a chance to cooperete with Manager Gu.


558
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
You are not the same as I imagined.


559
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,380

560
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,580
Just call me Su Bei.

Apart from anything else,


563
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,820
the illegitimate child of Gu's family
 is quite good-looking.


564
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,140
He is quite a match for Su Bei.


565
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,140
Match?


566
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,620
I'm afraid she has seen the most perfect one,


567
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,540
and can't appreciate a defective like him.


568
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,660
Boss Gu, thank you. I'll leave first.


569
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,500
Boss Gu.


570
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,450
Manni.


571
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,140
Shouldn't you have a toast with me?


572
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,180
That's why I'm here.


573
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,180
I wish your launch a complete success.


574
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,700
Boss Gu.


575
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,490
For the endorsement of Kong...


576
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,340
Of course you can have it,


577
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,020
as long as you...


578
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,210
Boss Gu.


579
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,660
Who knows


580
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,700
whether you do this to everyone?


581
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,620
I can't trust you


582
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,580
unless I see the contract.


583
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,060
That's easy.


584
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,260
We can find a place and have a long talk about it.


585
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,860
Boss Gu, don't.


586
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,660
There are so many people.


587
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,780
There are so many people here.


588
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,780
Gu...


589
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,900
Boss Gu, I'm sorry.


590
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,020
Stop patronizing.


591
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,380
It's not like you have never been touched.


592
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,820
Don't flatter yourself.


593
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,060
Not to mention that you're literally nobody,


594
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,300
I don't even pay any attention to Eminence.


595
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,290
If you don't give me an explanation,


596
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,700
don't even think about
 getting anything in the business.


597
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,260
Boss Gu. I...


598
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,260
You just hurt your arm this morning.


599
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,220
Can't you hold your glass still?


600
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,940
Apologize to Boss Gu now.


601
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,460
You don't need to pretent to be kind-hearted.


602
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,260
Boss Gu.


603
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Could you please forgive me


604
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,980
for the sake of my injured arm?


605
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,500
Don't give me that.


606
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,420
If you wanna apologize,


607
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,980
tell Boss Lu to come to me himself.


608
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,140
Boss Lu is not


609
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,940
as tolerant as you, Boss Gu.


610
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,980
If Boss Lu knows that


611
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,660
on the first day of my employment,


612
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,820
my employee offended you,


613
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,820
then I may get fired.


614
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,540
How about


615
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,340
letting me


616
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,460
apologize to you for Manni?


617
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,100
What do you think?


618
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,620
You are the Annie who declined the Gu's?


619
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,700
You are really not like others.


620
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,380
Tell me


621
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,740
how you're gonna make an apology for her.


622
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,940
What do you want me to do, Boss Gu?


623
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,620
Whether it's discussing things


624
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,700
or doing businesses,


625
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,180
including apologizing for others,


626
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,620
nothing can't be solved with alcohol.


627
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,540
You want me to drink?


628
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,740
You don't know my rules?


629
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,980
I have always had


630
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,220
sympathy for womanhood.


631
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,820
Finish all three of them,


632
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,060
then I'll forgive her.
