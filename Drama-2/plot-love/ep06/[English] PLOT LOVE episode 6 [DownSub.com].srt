00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,060
Every year on my birthday,


195
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,210
he would ask Cristiano to give me


196
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,020
an autographed football


197
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,620
and a complete set of superman models.


198
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,540
Don't brag.


199
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,740
I did not.


200
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,180
That is brag!


201
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,420
No!


202
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,020
Well, why don't you get your dad over here,


203
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,940
and we'll see


204
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,140
who is better.


205
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,700
Okay.


206
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,260
Chris, why are you so upset today?


207
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,580
Auntie Yang,


208
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,220
can you help me?


209
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,180
What?


210
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,020
For the happiness of my family,


211
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,420
I decide to do something really big.


212
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,930
Can you keep it secret from mom


213
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,100
before I succeed?


214
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,660
I  can't do that.


215
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,020
I work for your mom.


216
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,140
I must tell her everything about you.


217
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,180
But


218
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,010
Pang has dad.


219
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,860
I don't have dad.


220
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,540
Honey, don't cry.


221
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,620
Don't cry, don't cry.


222
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,060
Don't cry, Chris.


223
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,060
I promise I won't.


224
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,940
Alright. Alright.


225
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,700
Fine, I promise you.


226
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,620
Dad!


227
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,690
Whose kid is this?


228
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,420
Come.


229
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm your kid, dad.


230
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,020
Don't call me dad.


231
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,220
Dad, you don't know me?


232
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,730
I'm Chris.


233
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,660
Your handsome


234
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,500
son.


235
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,780
I don't have a son.


236
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,940
Who is your mother?


237
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,940
My mom is your wife.


238
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,780
Dad, are you fool?


239
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,580
I see. Don't feel bad about yourself.


240
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,180
Mom and I still love you


241
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,700
Look,


242
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,780
you gave it to me


243
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,740
for my birthday when I was four.


244
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,380
So I saved money for a long, long time


245
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,180
and bought you this superman.


246
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,860
You're running around all by yourself,


247
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,780
and your parents don't care?


248
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,820
Auntie Yang is waiting for me there.


249
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:46,980
Look.


250
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,300
Don't change the topic.


251
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,980
Didn't you say


252
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,620
you liked it in the letter?


253
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,890
You take it.


254
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,020
Kid, I hate this.


255
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,260
- Take it.
- Don't be unreasonable.


256
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,620
You are my dad.


257
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,540
Take it.


258
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,100
No.


259
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,660
Take it.


260
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,740
Take it.


261
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,130
You are my dad.


262
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,260
Take it! Take it! Take it!


263
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,900
You broke it!


264
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,140
You pay for it, you pay for it.


265
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,090
Come on. Chris. Don't cry.


266
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,540
Auntie Yang will repair it. Okay?


267
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,130
Come on. Don't cry.


268
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,660
Auntie Yang will repair it.


269
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,660
This is 100 Yuan.


270
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,460
Buy him a new one.


271
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,180
Auntie Yang will buy you a new one, okay?


272
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,700
No!


273
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,240
Let's buy a new one.


274
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:39,850
Okay?


275
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,450
Okay?


276
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,650
Let's buy a new one.


277
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,680
Let's buy a new one. Go!


278
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,100
Chris.


279
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,820
Eat some noodles.


280
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,330
No.


281
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,180
Just eat some.


282
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,210
You are the most handsome. You're the best.


283
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,900
I won't eat.


284
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,580
Chris. You are the most handsome. You're the best.


285
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,700
Eat some noodles.


286
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
No.


287
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,090
Ms. Su, you're back.


288
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,620
Chris doesn't eat noodles.


289
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,940
Why, Chris?


290
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,940
You're upset?


291
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,500
Bei Bei, dad doesn't know me, right?


292
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,380
He doesn't know I exist, does he?


293
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,580
You went to see your dad?


294
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,460
Pang played football with his dad,


295
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,620
and I wanted to play football with my dad.


296
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,260
But he said


297
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,380
he wasn't my dad.


298
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,500
Chris, I'm sorry.


299
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,580
Your suffer


300
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
because of the conflict between mom and dad.


301
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,300
But mom assures you that


302
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,980
I'm doing this for your own good.


303
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,460
But


304
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,380
I want to play football with my dad, too.


305
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,980
Just give mom a little more time, okay?


306
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,020
Don't be sad, Bei Bei.


307
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,980
He is a bad dad.


308
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,380
I don't want him anymore.


309
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,860
He broke my superman.


310
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,620
Dad is the worst!


311
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,940
I won't see him anymore.

[Annie]


314
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,420
Sister-in-law,


315
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,060
My brother doesn't want to take your calls,


316
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,500
and he asked me to tell you


317
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,540
please stop harrassing him.


318
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,020
Fei'er.


319
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,690
I...


320
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,170
I'm pregnant.


321
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,300
The doctor said


322
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,380
the baby might not survive.


323
00:17:59,570 --> 00:17:59,860
I...


324
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,540
I want to go home.


325
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,140
My brother asked me to tell you that


326
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,940
it's better if the baby doesn't survive.


327
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,820
You're done with him anyway,


328
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,260
so it's no longer his business


329
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,540
whether you live or die.


330
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,380

Su Bei.


332
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,820
We used to be


333
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,980
 on good terms,


334
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,620
so you'd better


335
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,020
get over it.


336
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,220
 My brother sent you abroad.


337
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,420
Can't you tell what that means?


338
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,740
Don't ever call again.


339
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:03,980

00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,170
Su Su, are you all right?


342
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,780
Su Su, wake up.


343
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,290

00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,410
Su Su.


349
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,180
Honey, I'm sorry.


350
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,940
Tell me.


351
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,420
Did I really make a mistake?


352
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,940
I shouldn't have lied to Chris,


353
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,060
given him false hopes


354
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,740
and expectations about his dad.


355
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,620
You did nothing wrong.


356
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,820
Chris needs a dad who loves him.


357
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,220
But Lu Nan and I


358
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,460
can't go back.


359
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,860
I have no way to give Chris a complete home.


360
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,700
But he's at an age


361
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,020
when he needs father's love,


362
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,540
and I can't give him that.


363
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,740
Su Su.


364
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,180
You didn't give up on Chris


365
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,620
even in the most difficult time.


366
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,980
I'm sure he'll understand you


367
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,500
when he grows up.


368
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,460
 When this all clears up,


369
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm going back to Italy with you,


370
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,820
and we're taking Chris,


371
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,900
and we're never going back to this sad place.


372
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,500
A best friend is forever.


373
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,500
Men just come and go.


374
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,570

00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,940
What's wrong with this woman?


379
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,020
Does she know she's married?


380
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
How dare she stay outside so late


381
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,860
and hang up on me?


382
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
Go back.


383
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,500
Don't bother Mr. Lu.


384
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,020
He will throw you out of the house.


385
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,770
Special measures in special times.


386
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,140
Or


387
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,500
all our efforts


388
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,700
will be in vain.


389
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,690
Yezi.


390
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,850
I really want to leave.


391
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,220
You drank again?


392
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,100
You're injured and still drink?


393
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,420
What's wrong with you!


394
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,180
It hurts.


395
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
You know it hurts?


396
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,260
You deserve it!


397
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,500
Does it still hurt?


398
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,580
It's exactly the same.


399
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,020
Morning.


400
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,090
Last night we...


401
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,220
Last night we didn't do anything.


402
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,460
What do you mean?


403
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,650
You're not going to make me responsible for you, are you? 


404
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,260
Who was it that told me


405
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,820
not to fantasize about you?


406
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,780
What,


407
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,540
you can't afford


408
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,780
to play games?


409
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,050
What?


410
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,300
Why are you looking at me with such a nasty look?


411
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,620
You make me think


412
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,540
you're in love with me.


413
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,330
You are


414
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,340
unreasonable.


415
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,100
Su Bei.


416
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,580
You're not really improving.


417
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,140
Mr. Lu.


418
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,170
Don't look at me like that.


419
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,820
I'm really scared.


420
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,980
Keep peeling.


421
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,570
If you break it,


422
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,100
I'll send you to feed fish in a desert.


423
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,140
There's no fish in a desert.


424
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,580
No,


425
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,460
 I mean, why do I have to


426
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,580
peel apple for you early in the morning?


427
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,900
I tried my best.


428
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,660
Do you think


429
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,780
that the marriage is an interesting thing?


430
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
The apple peel


431
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,500
is like the relationship between people.


432
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,940
If you want it to go well,


433
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,500
it has to go on


434
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
and on


435
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,780
and on.


436
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:05,980
Bro.


437
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,410
Stop talking nonsense, alright?


438
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,860
Brilliant.


439
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,860
Why


440
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,540
is there such a woman like her?


441
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,580
What's wrong with you now?


442
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,220
After sleeping with me,


443
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,260
shouldn't she be stalking me and following me around?


444
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
Why does she want to run away instead?


445
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:28,980
Again?


446
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,540
You slept again?


447
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,260
That's not the point.


448
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,660
The point is her attitude after that.


449
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,580
Well.


450
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,780
She's not even that serious.


451
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,020
Why are you so serious?


452
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,460
You don't have a crush on her, do you?


453
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,260
No.


454
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,060
Have a crush on her?


455
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,500
Her?


456
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,100
Her


457
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:54,940
Her...


458
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,090
Her what?


459
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,700
You have a crush on her and you don't want to admit it.


460
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,060
Otherwise, why do you care so much


461
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,140
about her attitude?


462
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,860
I...


463
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,180
I condemn her for such an attitude.


464
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,660
Look, how can an irresponsible person like her


465
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,860
be the president of Eminence Fashion?


466
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,580
Right?


467
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,660
I like her? It's impossible.


468
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,500
I'll take the apple.


469
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,580
Besides,


470
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,660
this girly trick only works


471
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,140
if you peel it yourself.


472
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,540
Of course I won't do that.


473
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,300
Mr. Lu. Time...


474
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,820
Knock on the door.


475
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,420
Mr. Lu.


476
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,700
Time for the meeting.


477
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,540
Always knock on the door!


478
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,690
Who can stand a sickly proud person like that!


479
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Since becoming the brand ambassador of Kong,


480
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,540
Liu Qianying's status has been elevated.


481
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,460
During this period,


482
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
there have been two or three companies interested in cooperation.


483
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
They are all under negotiation.


484
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,380
One more news.


485
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,100
Sia, the foreign luxury brand,


486
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,380
 intends to enter China.


487
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,380
Eminence Fashion is also


488
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,580
 planning to venture into high-end market.


489
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,460
If Mr. Lu has the intention,


490
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,460
I will follow up.


491
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:41,900
Mr. Lu.


492
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,220
Mr. Lu.


493
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,420
Do what you said.


494
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,120
What's the matter with Mr. Lu?


495
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:57,920
Don't know.


496
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,100
Mr. Lu


497
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,340
is busy working recently.


498
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,780
He often works late into the night


499
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,900
and he must be tired.


500
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,060
Maggie.


501
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,980
Get some coffee and cheer them up.


502
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,210
And get some mosquito repellent.


503
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,500
Mosquito repellent?


504
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,700
Can't you see Mr. Lu got a mosquito bite on his neck?


505
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,660
Last night we didn't do anything.


506
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,140
You're not going to make me responsible for you, are you? 


507
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,100
You're mad.


508
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,210
Why are you here?


509
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,100
Are you still mad?


510
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,420
You wanted to stay away from me.


511
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,340
What do you want from me?


512
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,580
What do you mean I wanted to stay away from you?


513
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,820
You asked me to stay away from you.


514
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,260
And you told me not to fantasize about you.


515
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,300
In that case,


516
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,900
if I still harass you


517
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,220
to make you responsible for me,


518
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm afraid I'll be kicked out of the house.


519
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,740
I told you to stay away,


520
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,700
and you just did it?


521
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,220
Well.


522
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,290
I have no other options.


523
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,810
Look, I


524
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,060
really like you,


525
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,940
but I have to hide my feeling.


526
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Only in this way


527
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,860
can I get close to you.


528
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,700
Then you admit that you approached me in the beginning


529
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,140
with a hidden agenda, right?


530
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,090
I've had a crush on you for a long time.


531
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,060
Well.


532
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,260
I'll have to think it over.


533
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,300
But


534
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,940
you can have a crush on me.


535
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,780
Then


536
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,020
I wonder


537
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,300
if I would have the honor


538
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,570
to have you put a gauze on?


539
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,690
I accidentally got water on it.


540
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,260
Since you moved in,


541
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,700
accidents


542
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,900
keep come in your way, huh?


543
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:36,980
Well.


544
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,860
I don't take good care of myself.


545
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,300
Okay.


546
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,940
Well, for the sake of your injury,


547
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,580
I'm not gonna expose you, okay?


548
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,100
Gauze?


549
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I forgot.


550
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,530
I'll get it downstairs.


551
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,090
You just sit here.


552
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:03,980
I'll get it.


553
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,300
Don't move.


554
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,750
[Scientific Research Department of Eminence, Scientific Research Report on Thorough Dyeing Technology]


555
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,500
What are you doing?


556
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,580
What is thorough dyeing?


557
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,380
Is it classified?


558
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,260
Sorry.


559
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,460
It's a new dyeing technique


560
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,380
developed by our scientific research department.


561
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,740
It is classified.


562
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,100
Sorry.


563
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,620
But


564
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
it's not developed yet.


565
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,730
It doesn't make any sense for you to read it.


566
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,220
Gauze?


567
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,620
Oh.


568
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,180
You didn't tell me where it is.


569
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,540
It's


570
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,580
in the kitchen cabinet next to the dining table.


571
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:10,940
Dining table.


572
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,780
