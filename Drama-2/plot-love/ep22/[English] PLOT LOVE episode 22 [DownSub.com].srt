00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,660
I will wait until your condition is stable.

193
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,700
Yun Fan,

194
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,940
will you do me one more favor?

195
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,180
I forgot

196
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,860
what Su Bei looked like when she married me.

197
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,860
Before I do the surgery,

198
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,820
let me see it again.

199
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,700
No problem.

200
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,590
[LOVE]

201
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,810
[Seeing you exhausted, my heart aches.]

202
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,520
ðŸŽµ In the mist, your silhouette ðŸŽµ

203
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,540
ðŸŽµis far and near.ðŸŽµ

204
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,960
[Seeing you exhausted, my heart aches.]

205
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,910
ðŸŽµ I'm right behind you,ðŸŽµ

206
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,570
[I like your gentleness and manners.]

207
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,600
ðŸŽµ being so careful.ðŸŽµ

208
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,050
[I love dearly your toughness.]

209
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,300
ðŸŽµ Like a faint light, ðŸŽµ

210
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,310
[I like the way when you're working.]

211
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,450
ðŸŽµ I hold you in my palm. ðŸŽµ

212
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,250
[I like the way when you're working.]

213
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,560
[I like your subtle gentleness.]

214
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,300
ðŸŽµ I'm afraid thatðŸŽµ

215
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,620
ðŸŽµ I may lose you. ðŸŽµ

216
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,460
Do you like it?

217
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,990
ðŸŽµ The road home ðŸŽµ

218
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,220
I like it very much.

219
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,850
ðŸŽµ is cold and quiet. ðŸŽµ

220
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,960
ðŸŽµ The shadows under the street lamps ðŸŽµ

221
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,700
Ms. Su Bei,

222
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,530
ðŸŽµ fade away. ðŸŽµ

223
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,020
I know there are a lot of things

224
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,970
I don't do well.

225
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,270
ðŸŽµ Cold air is coming. ðŸŽµ

226
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,700
But I will try.

227
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,020
I'll try to do my best.

228
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,250
ðŸŽµ Leaves are falling. ðŸŽµ

229
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,770
ðŸŽµ When I turn around, ðŸŽµ

230
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,940
I can't promise to love you forever,

231
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,430
ðŸŽµ I wish I could see you. ðŸŽµ

232
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,060
because forever is too long.

233
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,660
But I can promise you that

234
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,500
as long as I live,

235
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,500
ðŸŽµ We're both glad, ðŸŽµ

236
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,330
I'll love you.

237
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,280
ðŸŽµ thinking it's better to have than to lose. ðŸŽµ

238
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,500
I know

239
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
it wasn't very pleasant

240
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,310
ðŸŽµ We naively let down our guard ðŸŽµ

241
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,290
when we met again.

242
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,170
ðŸŽµ and open our hearts. ðŸŽµ

243
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,220
So,

244
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,580
can you give me another chance

245
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,390
ðŸŽµ If we go back where we were, ðŸŽµ

246
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,500
to start over?

247
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,810
ðŸŽµ will we meet again? ðŸŽµ

248
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:24,740
Hello.

249
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:34,240
ðŸŽµ Will we still let waiting become an addiction? ðŸŽµ

250
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,300
My name is Lu Nan.

251
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,660
I am 29 years old.

252
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,300
Will you please marry me?

253
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,040
ðŸŽµ I can't figure out the ending yet. ðŸŽµ

254
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,950
ðŸŽµ I thought the story would continue. ðŸŽµ

255
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,600
ðŸŽµ Watching you leave, ðŸŽµ

256
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,220
Will you?

257
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,170
ðŸŽµ I lie to myself ðŸŽµ

258
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,080
ðŸŽµ that there's nothing I can do. ðŸŽµ

259
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,860
ðŸŽµ And I can't bear to hear from you anymore. ðŸŽµ

260
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:09,670
ðŸŽµ I'm rational, but missing has become an addiction. ðŸŽµ

261
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,350
[ONLY LOVE]

262
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,540
Stop it.

263
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Stop it.

264
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,660
Let's go to work.

265
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,780
Iâ€˜m the boss.

266
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
Can I skip the work today?

267
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,260
Yes, you can.

268
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,780
But the employees will think,

269
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,740
the company just went public and the boss is not doing his work;

270
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,060
so will the stock I bought fall?

271
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,900
Will I lose my job?

272
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,180
Will the original shares I bought depreciate?

273
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,700
Yun Fan will think:

274
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,900
will my lazy boss

275
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,460
send me to Africa?

276
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,020
My wife is a workaholic.

277
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,940
Looks like I can retire

278
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,210
and enjoy the life.

279
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,580
No way.

280
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,860
I'm telling you.

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,060
As long as we don't catch the big boss,

282
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,420
we can't be at ease at all.

283
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,420
So,

284
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,260
get up and fight, Mr. Lu!

285
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:47,860
Come here.

286
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,380
Don't worry.

287
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,620
I've got a plan.

288
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,580
Gu Yan will be brought to justice.

289
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,460
Trust me.

290
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,100
Then...

291
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,740
You don't think about retirement anymore?

292
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,180
Last night was a little exhausting.

293
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,780
I'll go to sleep.

294
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,740
Then you go to bed.

295
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,740
I have to work.

296
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,410
You...

297
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,300
Hello.

298
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,420
Yun Fan,

299
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,330
are you there?

300
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,860
OK.

301
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,620
Wait a minute.

302
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,450
Hello.

303
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,290
It's Su Bei.

304
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,340
Ms. Su, there was an accident at the Environmental Clothing warehouse.

305
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,760
[Environmental Clothing Materials Warehouse]

306
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,660
Mr. Yun,

307
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,540
this is our biggest banquet hall.

308
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,460
Have a look first.

309
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,660
OK, thanks.

310
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,620
Take your time.

311
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,700
I think.

312
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,700
We can set up

313
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,540
a flower door there.

314
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,100
And,

315
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,740
here,

316
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,180
roll out the red carpet.

317
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,260
And,

318
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,180
do you want a round stage over there?

319
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,090
I saw other couples having round stages.

320
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Couples can stand on it and worship each other,

321
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,340
with guests on both sides.

322
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,580
And we're gonna have a buffet reception.

323
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,740
Everyone is in their evening gowns,

324
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,780
chatting over red wine and champagne.

325
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,900
Can you be more tacky?

326
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,180
How's that tacky?

327
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,180
Ye Ting said she liked that

328
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,140
European

329
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,140
and exotic style.

330
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,780
It's me who get married,

331
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,260
not you and Ye Ting.

332
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,780
This is your second marriage.

333
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,100
Why do you care?

334
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,300
Or,

335
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,930
what about a group wedding?

336
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,260
It's very popular now.

337
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,930
Ye Ting and I can join too.

338
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,620
I'll pay for your wedding.

339
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,820
You'll find your own venue.

340
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,340
OK.

341
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,140
Let's go.

342
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,380
I'll take you back to the company now.

343
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,500
Let's go.

344
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,220
You go back to the company,

345
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,460
and I go to the factory to find Su Bei.

346
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,690
Didn't you just meet?

347
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,820
You want more?

348
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,900
Dirty.

349
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,420
I'm picking up my wife

350
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,860
and we're gonna have dinner with our son.

351
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,700
You have been married for seven years.

352
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,930
No more PDA please.

353
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,380
Fei.

354
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,060
Fei.

355
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,220
What do you want?

356
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,060
Lu Nan and I will give you everything you ask for.

357
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,940
You and Lu Nan?

358
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,340
How dare you mention Lu Nan!

359
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,690
Fei.

360
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,540
This is warehouse.

361
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,140
Nothing can go wrong with these orders.

362
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Calm down and put the lighter down.

363
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,820
Are you scared?

364
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
So you have things you're afraid of being destroyed, huh?

365
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,220
Fei.

366
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,020
Stay calm.

367
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,500
There's nothing

368
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,820
we can't talk about.

369
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,980
I have nothing to say to you.

370
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,860
You destroy my family.

371
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,460
How I wish I could have a family.

372
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,500
You destroyed my family

373
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,780
that I loved for more than ten years.

374
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,740
Don't you think you should pay for it?

375
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,980

00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,900
the blow to the head

569
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,060
exacerbated the whole condition.

570
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,700
And the clots now are

571
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,180
pressing against the nerves in the brain.

572
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,820
The temporary loss of vision after you woke up

573
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,460
was mainly caused

574
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,050
by emotional fluctuations.

575
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,300
How do you feel now?

576
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,020
It's blurry,

577
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,220
but I can still see something.

578
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,860
Do the surgery as soon as possible.

579
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,980
You can't wait any longer.

580
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,980
I have to think about

581
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,690
the surgery.

582
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,340
Director Wu,

583
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,900
can you keep a secret for me?

584
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,980
There's nothing to think about.

585
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,380
Bro,

586
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,500
I won't listen to you this time.

587
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,690
Director Wu,

588
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,620
we can...

589
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,180
Thank you, Director Wu.

590
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,460
Let's go.

591
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,620
Actually,

592
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,580
we can find

593
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,090
an internationally renowned doctor to do the surgery.

594
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,460
With his/her competence,

595
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,340
we can minimize the risk.

596
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,740
I know you're worried about me.

597
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,860
But you know,

598
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,140
the Gu's Group

599
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,660
is eyeing Eminence now.

600
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,180
If anything happens to me,

601
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,140
there's gonna be chaos in Eminence.

602
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,340
How can you bear

603
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,170
to see me give away

604
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,060
what I've worked so hard for?

605
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,410
Don't worry.

606
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,260
Even if I risk my life,

607
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,420
I'll keep Eminence safe for you.

608
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,460
As a friend,

609
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,860
you've done enough.

610
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,340
Thank you.

611
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,140
Don't change the subject.

612
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,460
You didn't do the surgery

613
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,810
because of Su Bei?

614
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,820
Our relationship

615
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,380
is still unstable.

616
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,700
After everything we have been through,

617
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,060
I don't know how to tell her.

618
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,690
What if

619
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,220
something happens during the surgery and I can't wake up?

620
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,180
I don't want her to be restrained by our relationship.

621
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,290
When a married couple has difficulties ahead,

622
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,860
they should overcome them together.

623
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,620
You two were separated for seven years because of misunderstandings.

624
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,900
Do you want another seven years like that?

625
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,170
Su Bei

626
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,420
is a woman who can stand by you.

627
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,900
And she's not as fragile as you think.

628
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,580
Don't tell her yet.

629
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,780
Don't tell me what?

630
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,860
What's going on with him?

631
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,180
He's all right.

632
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,940
The latter stage

633
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,340
may need

634
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,900
a longer period of observation.

635
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,740
During this period of time,

636
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,660
don't

637
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,260
provoke him again.

638
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,060
Doctor.

639
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,100
Doctor.

640
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,620
Thank you. Thank you.

641
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,900
Before,

642
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,780
Iâ€˜ve heard that

643
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,100
President Guo's business skill

644
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,660
is first-class.

645
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,140
I didn't expect

646
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,260
your golf skill is also first-class.

647
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,860
Whoever plays with you in the future

648
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,100
will be under a lot of pressure.

649
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,220
Mr. Gu,

650
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,380
you're kidding.

651
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,460
I'm not even

652
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,700
close to you.

653
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,540
Mr. Guo is too modest.

654
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,380
Mr. Gu's is usually very busy.

655
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,220
So I'm sure that you've invited me here

656
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,100
not because

657
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,090
you just want to play golf, right?

658
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,940
Mr. Guo is really straightforward.

659
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,450
Well, I'll be straightforward, too.

660
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,060
I asked you out today

661
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,420
because, first, I'd like to make friends with you.

662
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,380
Second,

663
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
I'd like to help you get Eminence.

664
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,020
Mr. Gu, you've got to be kidding.

665
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,780
Iâ€˜m just a small stakeholder of Eminence.

666
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,700
I'm not that ambitious.

667
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,700
Mr. Guo,

668
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,980
It's only you and me here.

669
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,900
Don't be nervous.

670
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,330
I just want to know:

671
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,660
are you really willing to take a back seat?

672
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,220
Mr. Gu,

673
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
what do you want?

674
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,260
It's nice to talk to smart people.

675
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,940
My request is very simple.

676
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,620
Destroy the hero,

677
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,700
and win the beauty.

678
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm sure you've heard a lot about

679
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,500
Su Bei and me.

680
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,500
Yes.

681
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,460
I have a crush on her.

682
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,060
And my brother

683
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,380
was framed by Lu Nan.

684
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,580
Our family

685
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,460
can't just take such an insult.

686
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,980
That's why I came to you.

687
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,020
I want to work with you

688
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,820
to take over Eminence.

689
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,700
In this way,

690
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,140
you'll not only receive more money.

691
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,290
Maybe,

692
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,660
there will be more surprises.

693
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,570
This

694
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,500
is not easy.

695
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,700
You see,

696
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,820
Eminence is on a roll now.

697
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,580
Taking it down won't be easy.

698
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,900
But you will help me with it, right?

699
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,580
Let's go.

700
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:03,980
Let's go.

701
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,739
[How to treat the sequela of a cerebral hemorrhage in a car accident?]

702
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,020
How's it going?

703
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,980
Is it serious?

704
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,139
But Lu Nan still won't tell me the truth.

705
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:22,980
Do you have time tomorrow?

706
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,650
Yes.

707
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,690
Then,

708
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,100
I need you to get Yun Fan out of there.

709
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,780
If he's there, I can't get any information from Lu Nan.

710
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,139
Don't worry.

711
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,820
Looks like

712
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,580
he's willing to do whatever you tell him.

713
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Are you sure you want to be with him?

714
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,060
N...

715
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,020
Not yet.

716
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,540
I don't like him.

717
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,940
He's short, stupid and weak.

718
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,219
He's too easy to deal with.

719
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,580
Silly,

720
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,659
if he doesn't like you,

721
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,139
how could you do that to him?

722
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,500
He has dignity too!

723
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,620
Yezi,

724
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,060
it's not easy to meet someone you like.

725
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,140
When you have it, cherish it.

726
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,580
I regret that

727
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,580
there were so many misunderstandings between Lu Nan and I

728
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,180
that we wasted so many years.

729
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,540
Never mind.

730
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,340
I'll read it to you.

731
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,420
It says...

732
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,010
Come out.

733
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,220
I need to talk to you.

734
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,740
No.

735
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,860
Mr. Lu wants to see me,

736
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,420
right?

737
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,620
Yes.

738
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,780
Yun Fan has something to tell me.

739
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,780
What are you doing?

740
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,900
Ye Ting won't hurt him.

741
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,220
Besides,

742
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,060
it's their relationship,

743
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,450
and you can't meddle in it.

744
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,100
Mr. Lu.

745
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,340
Yes.

746
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,170
Come out.

747
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,540
Lu Nan, what kind of friend are you!

748
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,500
This is the follow-up cooperation contract

749
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,780
with Sia.

750
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,260
If there's no problem, just sign it.

751
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,460
Well,

752
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,020
I've been reading just now,

753
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,940
so my eyes don't feel good.

754
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,700
Can I take a break first?

755
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,420
This is urgent.

756
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,130
