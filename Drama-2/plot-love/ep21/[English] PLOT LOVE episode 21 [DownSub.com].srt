00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,540
You just let Su Bei

193
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,580
humiliate me like that?

194
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,780
I told you

195
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,740
to be careful,

196
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,740
but you still got yourself into trouble.

197
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,380
If I hadn't reacted quickly

198
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,580
and pretended to reprimand you,

199
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,980
Su Bei would have found out.

200
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,500
Su Bei, Su Bei, Su Bei.

201
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,140
You just can't stop talking about her.

202
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,260
Have you forgotten that

203
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,660
this is all an act?

204
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,050
Of course I remember.

205
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,580
I told you

206
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,740
to be patient for a bit longer,

207
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,940
just a bit longer,

208
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,180
and then you can do whatever you want.

209
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,770
Patient, patient, patient.

210
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,100
How long do I have to be patient for?

211
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,580
You're not

212
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
really in love with Su Bei, are you?

213
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,380
It's all in your head.

214
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,700
How could I possibly love her?

215
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,780
I'm doing all this to get back at Lu Nan.

216
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,980
You know that.

217
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,180
Alright.

218
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,300
Everything will be fine. Okay?

219
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,100
When this is done,

220
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,740
will you really marry me?

221
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,660
Of course,

222
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,460
silly.

223
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,740
Who else will I marry?

224
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,700
By then,

225
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,220
you'll be Mrs. Gu of the Gu's Group.

226
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,820
I don't care if I'm Mrs. Gu or not.

227
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,500
I only care about you.

228
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,020
I care about that!

229
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,460
You've done so much for me

230
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,940
and helped me through the darkest times.

231
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,660
I won't let you down.

232
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,220
I really look forward to this day.

233
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,340
I can't believe Yu Jia has been plotting against us with Gu Yan.

234
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,020
I should have known that before.

235
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,500
So she was his spy in our company.

236
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,580
Then it all makes sense.

237
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,660
I hate myself for failing to find out earlier.

238
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,500
She must have had something to do with what happened to Auntie Lan.

239
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,380
But

240
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,820
I've planned very well today.

241
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,220
I'm sure he'll make a move.

242
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,340
We'll just have to wait until we get him.

243
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,890
[Eminence Group]

244
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,220
What are you doing?

245
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,360
[Lu Nan]

246
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,500
Anything unusual today?

247
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,420
I'm working.

248
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,860
[Su Bei]

249
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,860
Nothing unusual.

250
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,540
What do you want to know, Mr. Lu?

251
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,660
What are you going to have for lunch?

252
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,060
[Lu Nan]

253
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:35,900
Hello?

254
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,580
Hello?

255
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,460
Sister Su Bei.

256
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,010
The bank has finished the clearing

257
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,580
of the matters of Auntie Lan's factory.

258
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,660
They need your signature.

259
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,020
There's something else

260
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,860
I want to tell you in private.

261
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,340
Can you come over?

262
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Send me your address

263
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,580
and I'll be there in a minute.

264
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,770
Alright.

265
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,180
Where are you?

266
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,920
[Lu Nan]

267
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
Why don't you reply to my messages?

268
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,500
I think

269
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,120
[Su Bei]

270
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,620
it's time to bring those people to justice.

271
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,140
Fish for lunch.

272
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,460
Please enjoy it.

273
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,460
Sis.

274
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,980
I know you like sweet drinks,

275
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,220
so I asked them to add more sugar.

276
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,580
I'm glad you remember that.

277
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,850
You and Master are the closest people to me

278
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,300
and the ones I've spent the most time with.

279
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,300
I remember all your preferences.

280
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,940
Why do you want to see me?

281
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,580
This is the clearing statement

282
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,620
that needs your signature.

283
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,700
The bank wants this urgently

284
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,860
and I have to deliver it this afternoon.

285
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,460
You're always very attentive.

286
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
That's what Auntie Lan liked about you.

287
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,300
I've never received any compliments from Master,

288
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,220
but working with you,

289
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,580
I've received a lot of compliments.

290
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,300
More than I had in the past ten years.

291
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,060
Sis.

292
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,180
I want to apologize to you.

293
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,860
For what?

294
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,740
Sit down please.

295
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,180
I betrayed the trust you placed in me.

296
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,260
In what way?

297
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,460
Last time, I didn't do the cutting well.

298
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,100
That's it?

299
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,420
Sis.

300
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,260
Whether you'll forgive me or not,

301
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,540
I must apologize to you.

302
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,940
No matter what has happened between us,

303
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,740
I've always treated you

304
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,700
like my own sister.

305
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,940
Don't take it personally.

306
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,450
We both work for Gu.

307
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,820
I was a bit harsh on you

308
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,140
because I wanted to show them my professionalism.

309
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,900
I hope you won't hold a grudge against me.

310
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,330
Sis,

311
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,780
I won't.

312
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,460
I hope you won't hold a grudge against me, either.

313
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,820
Sis,

314
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,580
the bank really wants this urgently.

315
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,730
I'll send it to them.

316
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,260
I'm off.

317
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,340
Goodbye.

318
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,620
They're more patient than I thought.

319
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,660
Nothing will happen today.

320
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,020
That's it.

321
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:15,810
Bye.

322
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,450
[Share location]

323
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,900
Don't you think you're being ridiculous?

324
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,540
Aren't you afraid that Lu Nan will take revenge on you for doing this?

325
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
All I want is ruin Su Bei.

326
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,580
When I make it,

327
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,100
I won't care about his retaliation.

328
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,140
Out!

329
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,180

00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,260
Are you all right?

334
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,980
Gu Yan!

335
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,780

336
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:04,940
Out of my way!

338

Believe it or not,

339
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,339
I was tricked by Lu Fei'er to come here too.

Brother!

341
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,339
I can explain!

342
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,220
I didn't do it!

take her away.

346
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,859
From now on, I don't want to see you again.

347
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,940
And don't use Lu as your family name anymore.

348
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,500
Take her away!

I'll let you pay the price for what happened today.

How come...

358
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,980
How come I'm home?

359
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,380
From tomorrow on,

360
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,380
you're not going to the Gu's Group.

361
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,220
Stay at Eminence.

362
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,900
But...

363
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,780
There's no but.

364
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,050
Do you know

365
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,380
how scared I was

366
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,220
when I saw you lying there?

367
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
If something had happened to you,

368
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,740
what was I gonna do?

369
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Maybe there's another way

370
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,260
to find out the truth.

371
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,460
Leave it to me.

372
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,900
I...

373
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,540
I was drugged by Yu Jia.

374
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,940
I was too rash this time.

375
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,620
I won't do it again.

376
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,740
Never again.

377
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,620
I promise.

378
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,220
It won't happen again.

379
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,940
Besides,

380
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,980
I knew you'd come to rescue me.

381
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,780
It was an emergency,

382
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,500
but I was sure of it.

383
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,380
What if I was late?

384
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,620
Su Bei,

385
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,410
I'm your man.

386
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,860
I can handle everything.

387
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,140
I don't want you to take the risk,

388
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,020
okay?

389
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,740
Okay,

390
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,170
it's my fault.

391
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,980
I'll do whatever you say.

392
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,220
Where's Lu Fei'er?

393
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,540
I asked Yun Fan to take her away.

394
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,730
I want to ask grandma's opinion

395
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,540
before I make the decision.

396
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,700
I don't think I've ever

397
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,500
asked about her story.

398
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,340
Lu Fei'er

399
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,290
was a sweet girl

400
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,380
after my parents adopted her

401
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,700
from the orphanage.

402
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,380
My parents loved her

403
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,460
and told me to look after her.

404
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,180
When they died,

405
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,140
they told me

406
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,380
to take care of her.

407
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,620
Until

408
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,260
I found out she had a crush on me.

409
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,820
When did you find out?

410
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,660
Once she forgot her diary

411
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,900
and I accidentally saw it.

412
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,460
I've been keeping my distance from her ever since.

413
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,020
I even found an excuse to move out of the house,

414
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,020
thinking she'd gradually get over me

415
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,260
as long as I didn't see her.

416
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,980
But she turns out

417
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,140
to go to such extremes

418
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,180
and set you up.

419
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,570
It's all my fault.

420
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,220
No it's not.

421
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,930
If she's keen to do it,

422
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,060
nobody can stop her.

423
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,890
When that thing happened

424
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,900
seven years ago,

425
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,500
I shouldn't have gone soft on her.

426
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,540
You were doing it for grandma's sake.

427
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm afraid that this time

428
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,500
I'll have to let grandma know.

429
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,420
I'm afraid she won't be able to cope with the shock

430
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,180
if I tell her the truth.

431
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,820
I'll calm her down.

432
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,940
But Gu Yan

433
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,700
got away with it again.

434
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,340
He's blaming everything

435
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,460
on Lu Fei'er.

436

I'm sure that

437

justice will be done

438

How could she do that?

444
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,660

445

and sweet girl.

446
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,900
How could she possibly do that?

And you.

Why didn't you tell me before?

449
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,900
Grandma, I'm sorry.

450
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,330
I didn't want to break your heart.

Grandma misunderstood you.

you miscarried because of Fei'er,

458
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,860
I would be so guilty!

459

I'm sorry

462
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,900
it's not your fault.

463
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,980
You didn't know about it at the time.

464
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,980
You can't let her get away with it.

465

She's an adult.

466
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,900
She's got to take responsibility

467
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,660
for her own mistakes.

468

what to do next.

I wonder what Lu Fei'er would think

479
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,260
if she knew what happened to grandma.

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,450
and my life.

571
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,700
And then she acted like my savior

572
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,020
and gave me a job.

573
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,580
Isn't that oppression?

574
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,380
Is that how you think of Auntie Lan?

575
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,490
Do you know why

576
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,420
she didn't let you study design?

577
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,140
Because she knew

578
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,500
you didn't have a talent for design.

579
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,820
She didn't want you to make the wrong choice,

580
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,820
so she asked you to study tailoring.

581
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,500
She knew you were hard-working and motivated to learn.

582
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,980
She thought you could do well

583
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,900
in tailoring.

584
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,860
Auntie Lan didn't want you to go abroad

585
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,300
because she wanted you to stay with her,

586
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,500
to follow in her footsteps

587
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,340
and pass on the skills of brocade-making.

588
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,450
Stop it.

589
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,060
You're all liars.

590
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,420
Liars!

591
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,690
She said she mortgaged the Fragrance Brocade

592
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,820
was to save the factory,

593
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,540
but she left it to you instead.

594
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
I was with her for the past ten years,

595
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,420
watching over her and taking care of her.

596
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,420
What did you do, Su Bei?

597
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,100
Let me ask you.

598
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,860
Apart from your good looks,

599
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,500
what makes you better than me?

600
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,820
Why does everyone like you so much?

601
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,900
Why did she leave the Fragrance Brocade to you?

602
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,380
Fragrance Brocade...

603
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,180
So you did this to Auntie Lan

604
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,420
to get the Fragrance Brocade?

605
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,780
I didn't do it.

606
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,620
She did it to herself.

607
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,100
If she hadn't been greedy

608
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,380
and refused to give up the factory,

609
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,620
she wouldn't have ended up like this.

610
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,580
Eminence will invest in the factory,

611
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
and you can continue to manage Sanglan Costume.

612
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,860
But we have one condition.

613
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,580
That is

614
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,700
we'll use machines to make clothes.

615
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,660
And we will use the technology of the brocade

616
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,940
for mass production.

617
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,060
I just can't stand

618
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,330
how petty you are.

619
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,860
Sell the Fragrance Brocade to Gu.

620
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,980
We'll pay whatever you want.

621
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,380
And we'll give you a bonus

622
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,220
that's more than you can make in this shabby factory for 20 years.

623
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,010
You don't have to worry about the business. What do you think?

624
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,220
Mr. Gu,

625
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,060
please watch your language.

626
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,260
Since you think so poorly of my factory,

627
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,820
please leave

628
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,100
and don't waste our time.

629
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,860
This factory is worthless.

630
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,260
We give you the offer because we feel sorry for you.

631
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,380
Jia Jia,

632
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,380
send them away.

633
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,660
Mr. Gu, this way.

634
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,500
Who do you think you are?!

635
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,090
Let's see.

636
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,100
I'm sorry

637
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,460
I can't accept

638
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,820
any of the conditions of your offer.

639
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,180
If we were to use machines,

640
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,780
it would run contrary

641
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,100
to the very idea of our craftsmanship

642
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,340
and we would lose the beauty of hand-made clothes.

643
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,100
Also,

644
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,500
if we were to use mass production machines,

645
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,060
that would do harm to the environment.

646
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,770
The core of fragrance brocade

647
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,220
is natural, green and handmade.

648
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,300
I'm firm on this,

649
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,540
and there's no room

650
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,780
for negotiation.

651
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,500
The lack of production

652
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,300
means that

653
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,980
you will have to survive

654
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,340
as a small workshop.

655
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,460
With all due respect,

656
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,060
if you don't change

657
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,100
your business model,

658
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,140
this factory will fail in competition.

659
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,260
In that case,

660
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,620
we have nothing more to talk about.

661
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,260
Jia Jia, send him away.

662
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,540
Mr. Lu, please.

663
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,460
Master,

664
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,570
we've been told

665
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,780
to pay all the utility bills in three days.

666
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,930
Also,

667
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,940
the factory hasn't paid workers

668
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,420
for three months.

669
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,420
They're complaining.

670
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,620
Hello?

671
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,060
Hello,

672
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,460
I'd like to order a batch of double-Zhou silk and double-Gong silk.

673
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,180
Can you do that?

674
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,020
Yes yes yes.

675
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,820
Can you come so we can talk about it?

676
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,500
That's great. We've got an order!

677
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,580
Great!

678
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,620
Master, sign it.

679
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,740
As long as we deliver on time

680
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,140
and don't violate the contract,

681
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,660
the penalty

682
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,220
doesn't mean anything.

683
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,020
With the profits of this order,

684
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,460
our factory will survive

685
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,940
and we'll be able to pay their wages.

686
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,240
[Party B: Yu Qinglan]

687
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,620
Master!

688
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,660
The factory is on fire!

689
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,140
I thought the factory would go down and out.

690
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,690
But she mortgaged

691
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,260
the Fragrance Brocade!

692
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,860
I can tolerate

693
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,620
everything.

694
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,340
But the brocade

695
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,620
is supposed to be mine.

696
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,140
Where's the money?

697
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,940
Why is it gone?

698
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:47,980
Master,

699
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,610
why did Eminence transfer money

700
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,780
to the factory account?

701
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,100
How did you know about the transfer?

702
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,420
Tell me

703
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,980
why Eminence gave money to the factory!

704
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,420
I borrowed it from Lu Nan.

705
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,210
You borrowed it?

706
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,170
Why did Lu Nan lend you money?

707
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,020
You sold the Fragrant Brocade, didn't you?

708
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,420
You sold it to him, didn't you?

709
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,500
It wasn't a sale.

710
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,300
It was a loan.

711
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,739
Now we're in the worst of times.

712
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,420
With this money,

713
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,420
we can save our factory.

714
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,850
So

715
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,699
you still sold it, right?

716
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,420
You hypocrite!

717
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,850
You acted like you valued the Fragrance Brocade more than your own life,

718
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,739
but it's just because

719
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,020
you didn't get a more generous buyer.

720
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,060
Jia Jia.

721
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,060
What are you talking about?

722
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,300
He just transferred the money.

723
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,900
You haven't given him the Fragrance Brocade yet, have you?

724
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,260
You want to save the factory, don't you?

725
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,100
I have the money now.

726
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,100
I'll give you the money

727
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,620
if you give me the brocade.

728
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,060
You transferred the money?

729
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,940
Why?

730
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,580
Why?

731
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,660
I've been your apprentice for more than ten years,

732
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,340
and I never complain

733
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,380
and working tirelessly.

734
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,180
I do

735
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,540
whatever you ask me to.

736
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,700
But you've never really

737
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,930
trusted me.

738
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,780
You only treat me like your slave.

739
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,700
Tell me

740
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,380
where the brocade is!

741
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Stop it!

742
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,170
Stop it!

743
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,580
Give me the brocade,

744
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,740
and it's for your own good and mine too.

745
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,210
I'm not gonna lie.

746
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,980
I've joined forces with Gu Chengze.

747
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,140
I'm going to get the brocade!

748
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,820
So you did all this.

749
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,660
Yes!

750
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,660
From the order to the fire,

751
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
I was behind everything.

752
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,940
You're crazy!

753
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,940
Yes I am!

754
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,940
But you made me do it.

755
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,340
I'm telling you.

756
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,860
If you don't give me the brocade today,

757
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,210
you can't walk out this door!

758
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:04,620
You...

759
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,580
You...

760
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,780
Fragrance brocade.

761
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,820
Yu Jia.

762
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,060
If you wanted it so badly,

763
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
no one would compete with you for that.

764
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,260
But why did you do this to Auntie Lan?

765
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,660
Because you made me do it!

766
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,140
Su Bei,

767
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,580
don't act like

768
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,780
you're such a decent person.

769
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,730
You'll only make me feel even more disgusted.

770
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,260
I'll give you one last chance.

771
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,170
Did Gu Yan put you up to this?

772
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,820
Gu Yan?

773
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,620
What does this have to do with him?

774
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,780
I was just trying

775
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,100
to get back what's mine.

776
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,020
She ends up like this

777
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,340
because she deserves it!

778
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,340
I suspected that you worked for Gu Yan

779
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,820
the day the design was leaked.

780
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,500
The person you met in hospital that day

781
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,260
was Lu Fei'er, right?

782
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,860
Well,

783
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,180
now that

784
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,140
we've met,

785
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,700
I won't bother you.

786
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,900
Looking forward to hearing from you.

787
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,260
Don't let Mr. Gu down.

788
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,140
It's Lu Fei'er.

789
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,140
So what?

790
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,820
I stole your design

791
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,820
and gave it to her.

792
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,060
But it has nothing to do with Mr. Gu.

793
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,980
I didn't even know him

794
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,700
before I started working at Gu.

795
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,690
Yu Jia,

796
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,020
you're hopeless.

797
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,700
That day, I used the dress as an excuse

798
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,300
to confront you.

799
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,500
And then you went to Gu Yan on the same day.

800
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,060
In fact, Gu Yan has been using you all along.

801
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,900
He tried to frame Lu Nan

802
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,580
in terms of what happened to the factory.

803
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,300
He also wanted to frame Gu Chengze

804
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,740
to try to pitch him against Lu Nan

805
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,460
and drive him out of Gu's business

806
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,060
to consolidate his power in the company.

807
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,500
Yu Jia.

808
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,500
As long as you give me the evidence against Gu Yan,

809
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,530
I'll apply to the court

810
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,100
for leniency.

811
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
I did all this

812
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,500
on my own.

813
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,740
No one else was involved.

814
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,130
Besides,

815
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,900
Gu Yan isn't the way you think he is.

816
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,540
Didn't you say you didn't know Gu Yan?

817
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,380
You like him, don't you?

818
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,380
Jia Jia, don't be silly.

819
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,580
Gu Yan doesn't love you at all.

820
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,740
He confessed his love to me the other day.

821
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,340
He tried to lie to me and use me like the way he did to you.

822
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,900
Su Bei, you bitch!

823
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,500
It's not enough for you to have Lu Nan.

824
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,860
You try to seduce Gu Yan!

825
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,700
I'm the one Gu Yan loves.

826
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,020
He wouldn't confess to you.

827
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,460
It's your fault.

828
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,250
You seduced him.

829
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,900
You tricked him, didn't you?

830
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,340
Look at you now.

831
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,780
Auntie Lan will be disappointed if she sees this.

832
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,060
I never expected her

833
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,460
to have any expectations of me.

834
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,660
So I don't care

835
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,980
if she's disappointed in me or not.

836
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
I just want to take back

837
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,380
what's mine.

838
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,220
You know what?

839
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,820
The Fragrance Brocade never belongs to me.

840
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,660
Auntie Lan left it to you.

841
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,860
You think I'm a 3-year-old kid?

842
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,820
The way you act now

843
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,780
is exactly like a 3-year-old kid.

844
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:14,900
Yes.

845
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,210
Auntie Lan mortgaged the brocade to Lu Nan,

846
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,330
but it was to save the factory.

847
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,660
You don't know this yet.

848
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,860
The password and code to keep the brocade

849
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,340
are your name and birthday.

850
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,780
Also,

851
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,930
Auntie Lan made a will

852
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,580
to leave the factory to you too.

853
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,260
That's impossible.

854
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,300
You're lying to me.

855
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,940
No way!

856
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,620
I don't have to

857
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,770
lie to you now.

858
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,340
Auntie Lan raised you

859
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,860
with care and attention,

860
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,900
but look what you did to her.

861
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,860
Even if she could forgive you,

862
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,460
I won't.

863
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,900
I must tell you the truth,

864
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,860
and I'm going to make you live with shame and guilt.

865
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,410
I want you to suffer for the rest of your life.

866
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,100
Please stop!

867
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,220
I can't forgive you,

868
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,940
but I know

869
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,540
Auntie Lan doesn't want you to make the same mistakes again.

870
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,540
You should turn yourself in,

871
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,940
confess everything,

872
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,020
and plead for leniency.

873
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,900
I'm sure

874
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,340
Auntie Lan wants you back as soon as possible.
