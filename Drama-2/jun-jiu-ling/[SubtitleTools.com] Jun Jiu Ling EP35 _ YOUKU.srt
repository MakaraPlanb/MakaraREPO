00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:15,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 35

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
We can't make full preparations for everything,

18
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,800
and the commitments won't remain unchanged forever.

19
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,470
Are you going to deceive yourself still?

20
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,910
You know

21
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,160
His Majesty dispatched him

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,670
not just to watch the Fang family

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,160
but also to uproot the Fang family.

24
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,750
Miss Jun.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Lady Jinxiu.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How is grandma?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
From the day she got the news,

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
she can't eat or drink.

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,030
The doctor said she is too anxious.

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,720
Let's check her.

31
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,100
Fang Mansion

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,030
Senior Madame Fang,

33
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,080
take care.

34
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,440
My condolence.

35
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,600
Please take care, Senior Madame.

36
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,470
My condolence.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,360
Grandma.

38
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,360
Grandma.

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,390
Grandma.

40
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,360
Chengyu

41
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,880
is gone.

42
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,720
He said in the letter that

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,880
you're the blessing

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,240
of our Fang family.

45
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,200
You're the bane of our Fang family.

46
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,040
Senior Madame.

47
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,720
Senior Madame.

48
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,600
It's my fault.

49
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,040
I didn't protect him.

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,110
You knew it clearly,

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,230
but you still did things intolerable,

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,880
causing a great calamity

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,350
to our Fang family.

54
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,270
Grandma, calm down.

55
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,830
Madame.

56
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,040
Grandma, calm down.

57
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,920
Grandma.

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,270
Senior Madame.

59
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,160
Grandma, calm down.

60
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,000
It's you.

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,920
You harmed our Fang family.

62
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,350
-You harmed my son. -Stop.

63
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,830
Senior Madame, stop.

64
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,390
Stop.

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,600
Senior Madame.

66
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,110
Your Ladyship.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,670
Butler Gao,

68
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,390
may you ask

69
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,480
those who come to mourn to leave first?

70
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,390
Yes.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,070
Excuse me.

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,230
Due to a family matter,

73
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,440
we can't receive you today.

74
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,270
Excuse me.

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Due to a family matter,

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,760
we can't receive you today.

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
-Chengyu. -Well.

78
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,880
Please leave.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Please go back.

80
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,880
Please go back.

81
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,510
Please.

82
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,790
Take care.

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,070
Take care.

84
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,920
Take care.

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,200
-My condolence. -Be careful.

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,720
My condolence.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,350
-My condolence. -Take care.

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,110
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,440
Due to a family matter,

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,200
we can't receive you today.

91
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,950
Please pardon us.

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,920
Please pardon us.

93
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,320
Take care. Take care.

94
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,720
Sun,

95
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,350
what happened?

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,070
They fought inside.

97
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,070
-They fought? -Senior Madame

98
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,110
was so angry that

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
she beat Miss Jun.

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,920
The own mother of Young Master Fang

101
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
also beat her.

102
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,510
They were in a mess.

103
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,390
They're one family.

104
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,110
Why did

105
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,040
they fight?

106
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,670
I don't know.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,790
I was too far away

108
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,160
to hear clearly what they said.

109
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,350
They seemed to say

110
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,110
"you harmed Chengyu."

111
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,640
Wasn't Young Master Fang killed

112
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,230
in a fire at the post?

113
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,230
Why is it

114
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,070
related to Miss Jun?

115
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,200
I don't know.

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
Go. Go. Go.

117
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,760
Go. Go. Go.

118
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,790
Go.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,350
OK.

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,350
Grandma,

121
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,830
Chengyu is still alive.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,880
Chengyu is still alive.

123
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,600
Chengyu

124
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,790
-is still alive? -He is still alive.

125
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,040
Grandma,

126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Chengyu and I made the plan in the capital city

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
to help him slip away.

128
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,790
But it happened suddenly,

129
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,390
so we had no time to discuss with you and aunt.

130
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,070
Grandma,

131
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,720
I must

132
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,550
put on the show

133
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
to the public.

134
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Only in this way

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,230
can we make Chu Rang believe that

136
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,270
Chengyu is dead.

137
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,000
Where is Chengyu?

138
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,390
He is safe.

139
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,110
Don't worry.

140
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
His Lordship has sent him

141
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,390
to the North,

142
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
the domain of Lord Cheng.

143
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,920
But now

144
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
we can't communicate with him.

145
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,640
Grandma.

146
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,640
Grandma.

147
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,320
Senior Madame.

148
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,550
Mother.

149
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,670
I'm sorry

150
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,920
I slapped you in the face.

151
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,920
Never mind.

152
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,230
As long as it can

153
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,110
make Chu Rang believe that

154
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,000
Chengyu is dead.

155
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,720
Does it hurt?

156
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,600
No.

157
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,320
I made you angry.

158
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,920
It serves me right.

159
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,040
Silly girl.

160
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,920
Should I say you were smart

161
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,880
or cruel?

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,040
You even made yourself part of the plan

163
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,720
at the risk of being hurt.

164
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,200
Grandma,

165
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,510
calm down.

166
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,640
You two are so crazy

167
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,880
that you came up with the idea of playing dead.

168
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,760
Yes.

169
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,790
Your Ladyship,

170
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,200
both you and His Lordship were good at keeping secret.

171
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
I thought,

172
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,670
I thought Young Master was gone.

173
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,440
We had no choice in haste.

174
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,480
Grandma,

175
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,880
this is Zhu Zan,

176
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,480
son of Lord Cheng.

177
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,270
My respect, Senior Madame.

178
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,390
Don't stand on ceremony.

179
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,760
We couldn't inform you in time that

180
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,200
Chengyu is playing dead.

181
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,550
We really had no choice.

182
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,160
Please forgive us.

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,550
Senior Madame,

184
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,000
please take care.

185
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,200
You've overstated.

186
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,270
I should thank you.

187
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,350
Grand...

188
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,150
We haven't seen each other for over a year.

189
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,590
Don't you know how to call me?

190
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,230
Grandma.

191
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,790
Grandma.

192
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,960
Grandma.

193
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,710
It's great that you come back.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,670
Don't cry.

195
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,110
It's great that you come back.

196
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,150
Grandma.

197
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,200
It's great that you come back.

198
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,670
Today I found His Lordship quite liked you.

199
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,350
You said your engagement was fake.

200
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,080
Is it still fake?

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,880
If he can always be there with you

202
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,710
no matter what happens,

203
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,790
I'll be relieved.

204
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,790
Grandma,

205
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,080
now

206
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,520
Chengyu can slip away by playing dead,

207
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,520
but the Fang family

208
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,880
is still in crisis.

209
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,150
Chu Rang will settle

210
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,030
the deal he made

211
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,910
with the Fang family back then.

212
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,840
So besides that seal,

213
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,910
did he leave anything else?

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,520
Grandma,

215
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,790
the emperor is unpredictable.

216
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,080
If you want to protect the Fang family completely and hinder Chu Rang,

217
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,790
the key lies in

218
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,280
that batch of silver.

219
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,280
Follow me.

220
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,840
This is the second time I've come in.

221
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,320
I was led here by your grandpa before he died

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,280
for the first time.

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
He told me all the secrets.

224
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,230
I haven't

225
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,520
dared to come in again.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
The third year of the Taiyan period?

227
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,880
Yeah.

228
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,470
In the third year of the Taiyan period,

229
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,710
the Fang family

230
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,790
melt the silver

231
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,200
and cast it into

232
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,440
ordinary silver ingots.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,790
The official silver became private one

234
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,230
and was kept here.

235
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,350
I never dared to use it.

236
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,710
Chu Rang plotted for years

237
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,000
even at the cost

238
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,520
of lives of three generations of men of the Fang family.

239
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,880
Now he restrained you with the imperial decree

240
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,790
and tried to do harm to you.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,080
If grandpa didn't leave this batch of silver behind,

242
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,670
this matter

243
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,320
would never come to light.

244
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,150
We must obey

245
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,960
His Majesty,

246
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,400
but it depends on whether he is

247
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,960
qualified to be an emperor.

248
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,880
If he is unqualified to be an emperor,

249
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,960
he'll be punished.

250
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,030
Your grandfather wasn't innocent.

251
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,230
If I had known that

252
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,350
Deshengchang made a fortune

253
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,960
with this batch of silver,

254
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,960
I would have stopped him.

255
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,910
He killed the emperor's father indirectly

256
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,320
and was killed by others.

257
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,550
He got his just deserts.

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
Damn him!

259
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,550
But our Fang family doesn't have a day of peace.

260
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,840
Punishment.

261
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,150
Punishment.

262
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,550
This is a shame.

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
This is also

264
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,350
the will of God.

265
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,880
Grandfather.

266
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,440
Father.

267
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,840
I promise,

268
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,150
the truth

269
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,880
will soon come to light.

270
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,110
I'll justify for you.

271
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,960
Grandma,

272
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm not Zhenzhen.

273
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm Chu Jiuling.

274
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,230
You,

275
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,880
you're the princess.

276
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,000
You didn't die.

277
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,110
I didn't die.

278
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,760
We harmed you.

279
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,280
It was our fault.

280
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,470
We were greedy.

281
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,640
We're sinful.

282
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,200
It was our fault.

283
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,280
It was our fault.

284
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,110
Grandma, stand up.

285
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,030
We harmed you.

286
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,230
The Fang family

287
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,350
harmed you.

288
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,960
Grandma,

289
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,030
it wasn't your fault.

290
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,470
You don't owe me anything.

291
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,280
I was saved

292
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,520
by Zhenzhen.

293
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm sorry, grandma.

294
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,000
I didn't tell you that before.

295
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,080
Grandma,

296
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,230
the Fang family has protected me

297
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,790
and you have treated me sincerely.

298
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,550
If you don't mind,

299
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll always be Zhenzhen.

300
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,790
No wonder we couldn't find the clue.

301
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,110
It was hidden in the room of Senior Madame.

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,080
If Chu Rang hadn't

303
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,590
hidden the silver,

304
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,550
my grandfather and father

305
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,030
wouldn't have been involved.

306
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,639
Beiqi wouldn't have fought against us

307
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,070
for so many years.

308
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,880
Beiqi is ambitious.

309
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,560
Coveting our prosperity,

310
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,760
they fought all the way

311
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,590
to the capital city and took your grandfather away.

312
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,430
They even asked us to pay a large ransom.

313
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,109
This was

314
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,640
a shame.

315
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
Such a shame can only

316
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,230
be washed away by bloody wars.

317
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,190
Even if we had paid the ransom

318
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,109
and your grandfather came back,

319
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,310
Beiqi would still treat Tianyou

320
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,000
as sheep to be slaughtered

321
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,040
if Tianyou remains weak.

322
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,760
Therefore, Tianyou must be guarded

323
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,230
by those capable.

324
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
The silver

325
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,590
and the seal

326
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,430
are enough to prove

327
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,310
what Chu Rang did back then.

328
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,400
The Fang family has been having a funeral recently.

329
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
With so many people,

330
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,310
it's difficult to send the silver

331
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,640
back to the capital city without being noticed.

332
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,560
I know that.

333
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,400
So I've discussed with grandma.

334
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,310
When Deshengchang sends goods

335
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,070
to the capital city,

336
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,920
they'll send it together.

337
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,350
It's safer to do that.

338
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
Good idea.

339
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,470
It hurts. It hurts.

340
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,040
Will you stop hugging me

341
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,000
when you're tired of doing that?

342
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,830
Yes.

As Chengyu escaped by playing dead,

379
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,470
it's time to deal with Deshengchang.

380
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,640
But with dozens of

381
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,000
Deshengchang shops in the country,

382
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,400
how can we

383
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,680
deal with them?

384
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,640
Divide

385
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,710
and reduce gradually.

386
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,680
You mean divide it up.

387
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,520
Yes.

388
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,470
Divide Deshengchang into three parts.

389
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,470
The bigger the noise, the better.

390
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,230
What people like most

391
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,830
is the secret story of a family feud.

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,880
Storytellers love it, too.

393
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,070
Before long,

394
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,470
the separation of the Fang family

395
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,830
will cause a sensation in Zezhou.

396
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,430
The more attention the Fang family gets,

397
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the safer it will be.

398
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,800
OK.

399
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,710
Just do what Jiuling said.

400
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,520
But I'm afraid that

401
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,400
Jinxiu needs to act as a villain.

402
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,920
As long as I can protect the Fang family,

403
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,920
I don't mind that.

404
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Deshengchang
20
00:21:50,250 --> 00:02:18,520
County Government of Zezhou

405
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,230
Butler Gao.

406
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,830
Butler Gao,

407
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,350
something happened.

408
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,190
Calm down. What's it?

409
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,830
Lady Yuxiu closed shops.

410
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,760
Closed shops?

411
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,880
I was just in the Fang family.

412
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Old Master didn't mention that.

413
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,590
She just

414
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,520
closed the dozen shops

415
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,920
she managed before.

416
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,880
The rest Deshengchang shops

417
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
are doing business as usual.

418
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,920
Butler Gao.

419
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,760
Butler Gao,

420
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,920
go check it.

421
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,230
Lady Jinxiu went to the county government office

422
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,280
to beat the yamen drum and appeal for justice.

423
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,430
She said she will ask His Excellency County Magistrate

424
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,040
to help recover her share of property.

425
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,280
Go and check it.

426
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,310
It's a big deal!

427
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,590
She is beating the drum.

428
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,280
What's wrong?

429
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,190
What's wrong?

430
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,800
How serious the lawsuit is?

431
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,830
Who is she going to sue?

432
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,400
This is Lady Jinxiu of the Fang family, right?

433
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,920
Yes.

434
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,350
Who is she going to sue by beating the drum?

435
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,280
Didn't you notice?

436
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,160
The gate hasn't open yet.

437
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,710
She's suing the Fang family,

438
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,430
her grandma and mother.

439
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,230
How ungrateful!

440
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm ungrateful?

441
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,470
I started learning accounting at 6

442
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,800
and working in the bank at 8.

443
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,070
I was too short,

444
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,920
so I stood on chairs

445
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,000
to study on the account.

446
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
For more than ten years,

447
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,560
I had never dared to slack off,

448
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,520
let alone playing games

449
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,070
like other girls did,

450
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,110
because we were told to shoulder

451
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,280
the business and responsibility

452
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,950
of the Fang family in childhood.

453
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,110
You think

454
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
as the eldest daughter of the Fang family,

455
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,710
I can live

456
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,590
a rich life.

457
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
But who I envy most is Sanya,

458
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,560
who sells tofu jelly at the entrance of West Street.

459
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,040
As long as she sells tofu jelly for half a day,

460
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,190
she can go fishing happily

461
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,070
with a basket by the river,

462
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,430
but we can't.

463
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,950
The whole family relies on us.

464
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,800
We don't dare to relax at all.

465
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,070
It's hard for them.

466
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,880
When their peers

467
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,230
were still spoiled by their mothers,

468
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,230
they began to shoulder all this for their brother

469
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,760
and had shouldered it for over a decade.

470
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,160
It's difficult.

471
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,830
It's hard.

472
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,230
Fang Jinxiu,

473
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,000
you bastard.

474
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't make a fool of yourself here.

475
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,190
Don't talk nonsense.

476
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,880
Go home now.

477
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,190
It isn't nonsense.

478
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm telling the truth.

479
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,560
Chengyu was weak since childhood.

480
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,800
You asked me and Yuxiu to support the family business.

481
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,070
You asked us to refuse others' proposal

482
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,470
and recruit a husband at home.

483
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,640
You know

484
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,800
what kind of man

485
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,040
I can recruit.

486
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,710
A decent man

487
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,430
doesn't want to be a live-in son-in-law.

488
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,920
Now we're getting old.

489
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,310
For Chengyu,

490
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,160
Yuxiu and I

491
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
accepted that.

492
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,520
But,

493
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,830
but Chengyu is dead now.

494
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,470
Shouldn't we divide

495
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,430
Deshengchang?

496
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,310
Fang Jinxiu,

497
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,310
how dare you mention that as a girl!

498
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,950
Who instigated you

499
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,160
to do such an evil thing?

500
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,640
Grandma,

501
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,830
Madame,

502
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
frankly speaking,

503
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I've worked

504
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,760
for the Fang family for 10 years.

505
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,830
During which,

506
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,040
Deshengchang has kept growing

507
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,000
and developing.

508
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,310
Is it not our credit?

509
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,070
What's wrong with us

510
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,950
getting back the property

511
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,160
we've earned?

512
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,590
Ladies and gentlemen,

513
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,520
do you think

514
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,000
it's unreasonable for me to ask for

515
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,160
property from my family

516
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,160
as a daughter?

517
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,640
Are we ineligible

518
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,920
to inherit the family business?

519
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,800
Yes.

520
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,880
Yes. Yes.

521
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,000
You're eligible.

522
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,560
A daughter is eligible to inherit the family business.

523
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,160
OK.

524
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,040
Now that you've made it a mess,

525
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,470
the life can't go on.

526
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,400
From now on,

527
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,760
the Fang family

528
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
is divided.

529
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,400
Just say what you want to say.

530
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,640
It's unhealthy

531
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,950
to bottle it up.

532
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,350
Well,

533
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
the Fang family got together

534
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,640
for wealth.

535
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,310
Now

536
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,640
they're separated by wealth.

537
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,560
Do you think it's fate?

538
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,110
I tend to believe that

539
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,950
man is the master of his own fate.

540
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,560
Look.

541
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
After meeting you,

542
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,680
their fates

543
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,640
have been changed.

544
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,070
Chengyu survives.

545
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,710
The Fang family isn't harmed secretly by Chu Rang.

546
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,920
And

547
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,110
we decided

548
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,280
what is happening now.

549
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,470
No need to worry.

550
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,230
What matters

551
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,520
is man,

552
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,000
but not money.

553
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,000
Man is the master of his own fate.

554
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,190
It's getting late.

555
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,110
Let's go.

556
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,680
Jiuling.

557
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,710
Nothing.

558
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,230
Jiuling.

559
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,230
What's wrong?

560
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,800
Just want to call you.

561
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,430
Come on.

562
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,040
Jiuling. Jiuling. Jiuling.

563
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,400
What's wrong with you today?

564
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,760
I like your name,

565
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,760
so

566
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,230
I called you for more several times.

567
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,350
And you're a doctor.

568
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,230
If anything goes wrong with me,

569
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,110
you have to save me.

570
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,830
Dr. Jun,

571
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,040
check me, OK?

572
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,310
I think you are terminally ill

573
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,160
and incurable.

574
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,400
That's great.

575
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,160
Thus, you'll always stay with me

576
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,880
and heal me all this life.

577
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,520
Only you can

578
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,070
heal me.

579
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,640
Really?

580
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,040
Let's go.

581
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
When he was buried,

582
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,230
the women of the Fang family cried sadly and loudly.

583
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,190
They said it was unfair

584
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,110
as nobody would carry on the Fang family.

585
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,160
I don't think they could

586
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,310
pretend to be so sad.

587
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,190
By the way,

588
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,070
a few days after the burial,

589
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,190
the Fang family was divided.

590
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,760
What?

591
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,800
Those women

592
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,800
in the Fang family,

593
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,560
young and old,

594
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,800
caused a big scandal.

595
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,950
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

596
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,830
Those women in the Fang family

597
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,400
can't cause great trouble.

598
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
OK.

599
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,710
Did Zhu Zan and Jun Jiuling

600
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,560
come back?

601
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,920
A few days after the burial,

602
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,230
His Lordship came back

603
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,470
with Jun Jiuling.

604
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,430
Your Majesty,

605
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,760
Commander Lu wants to see you.

606
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,040
Let him in.

607
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,560
Where are they now?

608
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,190
Your Excellency,

609
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,000
after passing Xin'an,

610
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,040
Miss Jun and His Lordship

611
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,400
separated from the convoy.

612
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,680
His Lordship shook our men off.

613
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,680
We don't know

614
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,430
where he is now.

615
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,640
But I think that servant girl Liu'er

616
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,040
can get to the capital city

617
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,880
in three days.

618
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,640
Both of them can ride,

619
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,760
so they should arrive today.

620
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,040
Commander Lu,

621
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,040
His Majesty wants to meet you.

622
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,760
Please.

623
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,760
Your Majesty,

624
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
I just intercepted a secret letter

625
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,680
sent by Lord Cheng to the North.

626
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,880
Please read it.

627
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,160
What?

628
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,640
A secret letter to the North?

629
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,280
Yes.

630
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,040
He hasn't given up yet.

631
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,160
He is still pointing fingers

632
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,560
at the affairs in the North.

633
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,950
Does he,

634
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,070
does he think

635
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,310
he is necessary

636
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,920
to the court?

637
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,880
My right eyelid

638
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,920
has been twitching recently.

639
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,830
I can't sleep well at night.

640
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,230
I don't know what's wrong.

641
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,520
Well,

642
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,190
of all the civil and military officials

643
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,680
kneeling before me every day,

644
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,880
I can't tell

645
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,230
who do that

646
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,590
with sincerity.

647
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,070
Just go.

648
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,350
I want to be alone.

649
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,520
Yes.

650
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,190
When you saw your grave just now,

651
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,880
what did you think?

652
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,230
Come have a look. Flower umbrellas.

653
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,190
Come have a look.

654
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,160
Flower umbrellas.

655
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,400
I'm afraid few people in the world

656
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,040
can see

657
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,950
their own graves like me.

658
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,110
I don't know

659
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,280
when I can tear it down.

660
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,950
Soon,

661
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,000
because I'm here.

662
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,190
When I put northern manjusaka

663
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,710
in front of your tomb,

664
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,560
where did you hide?

665
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,190
I was right behind you,

666
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,590
in a corner you couldn't see.

667
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,350
When seeing me come all the way

668
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,190
to send you a bunch of flowers,

669
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,640
were you moved?

670
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,190
I wanted to

671
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,760
rush up and beat you up.

672
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,830
It's a kind of precious medicinal material,

673
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,520
but you wasted it

674
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,760
for the blossoming moment.

675
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,560
The flower

676
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,040
is medicinal material to you,

677
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,190
because you're a doctor.

678
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,920
But to me,

679
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,070
it was a promise.

680
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,680
Is it beautiful?

681
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,190
Yes.

682
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Really?

683
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,830
I'll take you to the North

684
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,520
to see the sea of flowers.

685
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,950
That's really beautiful.

686
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,400
We'll be busy in the North.

687
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,640
Busy?

688
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,590
Why?

689
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,470
Think about it.

690
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,040
You said you'll

691
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,280
enjoy sea of flowers,

692
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,920
starry sky and grassland with me.

693
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,070
You...

694
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,800
Have you forgotten it?

695
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,710
No.

696
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,520
It's here.

697
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,350
In the future,

698
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,920
wherever you want to go,

699
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll be there

700
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,040
and go with you.

701
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,800
We'll experience suffering together

702
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,710
and see

703
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,190
great mountains and rivers together.

704
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,950
Keep your promise.

705
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,040
What's wrong?

706
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,670
What's this?

707
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,910
Come here.

708
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:45,599
Conduct yourself.

709
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,870
You always

710
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,190
fooled me.

711
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,230
It's my turn today.

712
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,280
Young people now are...

713
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,230
Sanbing,

714
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,760
they're at the gate,

715
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,320
but they don't go in

716
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,120
and sit here.

717
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:06,189
We know it.

718
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,520
We know it clearly.

719
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,120
I told you not to pick me up.

720
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,670
If we hadn't come,

721
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,150
we would have missed the wonderful scene.

722
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,840
Get down to business.

723
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,519
Is there any news?

724
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,280
There is still no news from the North.

725
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,760
Lord Cheng has made several secret reports,

726
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,470
but he hasn't got a reply.

727
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,630
Is Earl of Qinghe going to launch an attack?

728
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,360
We've sent someone to the North

729
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,150
to get information,

730
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,080
but it may not be so soon.

731
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,000
Be patient.

732
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,430
That's all we can do.

733
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,150
It's not convenient to negotiate here.

734
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,320
Let's go back to the mansion first.

735
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,150
OK.

736
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,040
Jiuling,

737
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,150
where will you go, Jiuling Drugstore

738
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,080
or my home?

739
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,230
Jiuling Drugstore.

740
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,800
Go discuss business

741
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,840
with Lord Cheng.

742
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,560
OK,

743
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,150
or I'll have no place to sleep.

744
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,600
How can you say that?

745
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,600
Come on.

746
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,870
Can such an indecent thing

747
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,320
be discussed in public now?

748
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,470
Is it indecent?

749
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,150
We're talking something serious.

750
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,560
Miss Jun just said

751
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,760
she'll sprawl all over the bed

752
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,950
when sleeping,

753
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,470
so there is no space for you.

754
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,230
He means

755
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,600
if I go home with him,

756
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,760
he needs to sleep in the guest room.

757
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,870
I see.

758
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,600
I believe that.

759
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,280
I believe that.

760
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,760
Go.

761
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:53,910
Go.

762
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,950
I do believe that.

763
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,120
You...

764
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,840
Miss Jun and you are great.

765
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,840
Your Excellency,

766
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,120
shall we take action?

767
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,040
Of course,

768
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,670
but not now.

769
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,360
Mother,

770
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm back.

771
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,430
You're back, Zan.

772
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,040
Where is father?

773
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,120
He was summoned to the palace by His Majesty early in the morning

774
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,040
and hasn't come back yet.

775
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
What for?

776
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,360
Nothing else

777
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,630
but retiring from office

778
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,950
to be a person not concerned.

779
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,320
Is it not enough to give up the military power?

780
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,600
Must he resign

781
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
from the court?

782
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,430
His Majesty, but not us

783
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,670
has the final say.

784
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,760
Lord Cheng,

785
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,560
do you admit your guilt?

786
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,670
No.

787
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,670
You secretly ordered the officers and soldiers

788
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,600
to discord with Beiqi

789
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,280
and incited them to conflict with Beiqi.

790
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,560
Don't you admit that?

791
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,670
Is that true?

792
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,430
Yes.

793
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,520
I've always

794
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,630
done this.

795
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
I don't know the secret letter Your Majesty is talking about,

796
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,000
but I always told the officers and soldiers in the North

797
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,360
to always

798
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,870
guard against Beiqi.

799
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,080
I've been dealing with Beiqi all my life.

800
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,150
I know their nature.

801
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,710
Offering kindness

802
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,760
won't make them surrender.

803
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,120
If they offer kindness,

804
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,230
it must be out of wild ambition.

805
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,870
We can't cede our territory

806
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,910
even by an inch.

807
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
If we cede the three counties,

808
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,560
we'll lose more counties.

809
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,800
It's easy to make peace now,

810
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,280
but it'll be cruel to fight in the future.

811
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,230
Your Majesty,

812
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,710
the situation today

813
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,040
is more critical than that before.

814
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,470
Your Majesty, please rectify military affairs

815
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,150
and strictly guard against Beiqi.

816
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,390
We can't be gentle

817
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,360
to them at all.

818
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,390
If they attack us,

819
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,080
we must fight back.

820
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,950
I see.

821
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,470
Lord Cheng has always disagreed with the peace talk.

822
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,320
Your Majesty,

823
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,760
in the war against us,

824
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,950
Beiqi gathered troops

825
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,950
and spent a lot.

826
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,430
Now we should go on

827
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,560
dampening their spirit.

828
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,600
Don't give them a chance to breathe.

829
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,670
Your Majesty,

830
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,230
don't always

831
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,430
give in to Beiqi.

832
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,280
Your Majesty,

833
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,910
let alone the border dispute caused by the disagreement

834
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,390
between the officers and soldiers and Beiqi,

835
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,760
the secret order means that

836
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,190
Lord Cheng

837
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,600
is still running the army privately

838
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,910
against your order.

839
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,760
Lord Cheng boasts of his prowess in battle,

840
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,040
but he ignores the policy of defending inside and making an empty show of strength outside.

841
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,630
He is greedy and warlike.

842
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,390
We've lost tens of thousands

843
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,760
of soldiers in Beiqi

844
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,840
and suffered great economic losses.

845
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,230
Luckily, with the peace talk,

846
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,520
the people can live and work in peace and contentment.

847
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,560
But he still wants to fight.

848
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,600
Is he going to send

849
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,190
Tianyou to Beiqi?

850
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,470
Your Majesty,

851
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,840
since Lord Cheng returned to the capital city,

852
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,280
I've received many memorials

853
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,760
from officials in the North.

854
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,190
They put pressure on the court

855
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,190
and ignored the government officials' orders.

856
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,470
Earl of Qinghe can do nothing in the North.

857
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,800
Officials agree outwardly but disagree inwardly.

858
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,710
Your Majesty,

859
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,520
as long as Lord Cheng is still there,

860
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,950
the border will never be peaceful.

861
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,080
Your Majesty,

862
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,430
please remove Lord Cheng

863
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,670
from the military service

864
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,760
and punish him

865
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,800
for his abuse of power

866
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,760
and action without authorization.

867
