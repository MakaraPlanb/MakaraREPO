00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:15,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 28

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,190
Your Excellency,

18
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,360
I've sent them

19
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,440
to Ghost Hand as you required.

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,030
How will we

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,720
explain it if His Majesty or the Imperial Academy of Medicine

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,000
asks about them?

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,960
A prisoner

24
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,390
suffered from a serious disease,

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
and Imperial Doctor Jiang

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,630
was always responsible,

27
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,390
so

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,190
he lived in the prison.

29
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,910
Do you know

30
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,080
what to say about the rest?

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,110
Imperial Doctor Jiang did his best to treat the prisoner

32
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,720
but suffered from an incurable disease in the prison

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,470
and then died.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,190
You can go.

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,440
You shouldn't try to hurt my woman.

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,550
Your Excellency,

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
Miss Jun has left Zezhou

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
and headed north.

39
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,160
I don't think

40
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
she would bring too many men on the way.

41
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,600
I will take some people

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,670
to bring Miss Jun back for you.

43
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,880
But

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,910
you must do it

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,240
after she settles the problem.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,030
Yes.

47
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,110
Let's go.

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,240
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,520
please let me

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,270
return to the North.

51
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,390
How dare you talk about the war!

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,080
OK,

53
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,960
let me show you something.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,910
This one

55
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,000
accuses your father

56
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,600
of delay of military plan.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Read it.

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,520
This one

59
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,880
accuses your father

60
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,240
of cheating and disloyalty.

61
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,080
This one accuses you and your father

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,910
of occupying and spending the military expenditure in expanding your mansion.

63
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,080
You can read them.

64
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,800
How dare you mention the war?

65
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,110
Do you want to take this opportunity

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,520
to go on occupying the military expenditure?

67
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,670
Read them.

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,320
Read!

69
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,880
Read them carefully!

70
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,470
All are to impeach you and your father.

71
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,630
I trust you,

72
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
so I don't believe the contents in these memorials.

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
How could you repay me in this way?

74
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,240
No wonder people in the North say that

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,670
there is an emperor in the South,

76
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,200
while there is Lord Cheng in the North.

77
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,109
Your Zhu's army

78
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,040
is really awesome!

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,230
Your Majesty,

80
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,160
these rumors

81
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,950
are baseless.

82
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,440
You're the guardian god and the belief

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,950
of the North.

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,670
People always say,

85
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,270
without you,

86
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,390
my father won't be there

87
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,830
guarding the peace and prosperity of the North.

88
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,950
Your Majesty,

89
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,950
my father Zhu Shan is dedicated.

90
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,200
He'll risk his life for the court at any time.

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,230
He is loyal.

92
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,390
Your Majesty,

93
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
you're wise.

94
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,830
Don't hear and believe slanders.

95
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,230
That's what you say!

96
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,040
Tell me.

97
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,720
Don't you know

98
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,950
why I kept you in the capital city?

99
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,920
Do you know?

100
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,110
I'm trying to shut up those

101
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,640
who have impeached you.

102
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
I want to make them believe that

103
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,110
as you're under my control,

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,600
your father will be afraid.

105
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,760
I put on a show for them.

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Your Majesty.

107
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,920
Fine.

108
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,950
Go to feed horses

109
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,760
in the Pasturage Department.

110
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,480
Your Majesty,

111
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,200
I want to redeem myself by good service.

112
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,550
I want to go out to battle with my father.

113
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,920
I want to go out to battle with my father.

114
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,440
I want to go out to battle with my father.

115
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,950
I want to go out to battle with my father.

116
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,390
Miss Jun,

117
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,880
those of Arm Moral Department are following us.

118
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,230
They've done

119
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,550
nothing to us so far.

120
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,720
Just let them be.

121
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,600
What should we do?

122
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,000
Return to Zezhou?

123
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,480
Keep heading north.

124
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,040
We managed to come here.

125
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,550
I want to check if it's alright with the vaccine.

126
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:51,870
Jiuling Drugstore

127
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,320
Lady Jinxiu,

128
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Miss Jun sent a letter here.

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,040
Well,

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,600
let me have a look.

131
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,110
What,

132
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,480
what did she say?

133
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,350
Is it

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
about the vaccine?

135
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,920
Something went wrong with the vaccine,

136
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,110
but it has nothing

137
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,950
to do with ours.

138
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,000
It's false.

139
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,950
False?

140
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,350
What,

141
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,670
what's the matter?

142
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,110
Blinded by greed,

143
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,000
several doctors

144
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,070
who know how to vaccinate,

145
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,790
extracted vaccine from those

146
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,550
who got vaccinated.

147
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,000
However, they did it in a wrong way.

148
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,950
With strong toxicity,

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
the vaccine went wrong.

150
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,830
I see.

151
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
Luckily, it's solved.

152
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,790
Yes. Yes.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,720
Luckily, it's solved.

154
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,550
Luckily, it's solved.

155
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,480
His Majesty doesn't let me go back,

156
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,830
but I must go back.

157
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,670
If you go out now,

158
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,950
more people will want to kill you.

159
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,670
Zan,

160
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,640
be careful.

161
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,040
By the way,

162
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,280
how about the vaccine in the southwestern Hebei?

163
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,199
Miss Jun has solved it,

164
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:02,349
but

165
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,400
she is missing.

166
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,880
I think she is

167
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,110
hiding from those of Lu Yunqi.

168
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,470
Your Lordship.

169
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,000
Your Lordship.

170
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,150
Someone is calling you.

171
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,280
I'll let you know

172
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,400
as soon as I get her news.

173
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,350
How troublesome she is!

174
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,550
Coming.

175
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,150
Your Excellency,

176
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
the princess is fine.

177
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,760
She just got a cold.

178
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,030
I'll take good care

179
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,080
of the princess.

180
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,030
Don't make any mistakes.

181
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't worry.

182
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,710
I'll try my best.

183
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,150
I'll prescribe now.

184
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,640
Your Highness

185
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,230
needs to take good care of yourself,

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,590
even if

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
it's for His Highness Prince Huai.

188
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,000
He has lost Jiuling.

189
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,880
He can't afford to lose you.

190
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,880
I know.

191
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,280
Back then,

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,080
did Jiuling

193
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,110
ask you to take care of us?

194
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,760
No.

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,640
Then I have to be grateful to you.

196
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,910
Please have more rest.

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,840
Jiuling,

198
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,110
Princess Jiuli

199
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
thanked me for taking care of her and Jiurong.

200
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,960
She asked if you asked me to do that.

201
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
If you know that

202
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,080
I have done all this for you,

203
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,110
will you be moved?

204
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,320
Fine.

205
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,790
As I like you,

206
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll try my best

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,840
to catch anyone

208
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,440
who is a bit like you.

209
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I won't miss them.

210
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,080
Old Master,

211
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
His Excellency Yu is here.

212
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,960
Let him in.

213
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,760
Minister Huang,

214
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,670
thank you for your strategy.

215
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
It seems that

216
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,710
we'll get

217
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,520
the three counties in Zhending soon.

218
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,400
You got benefit

219
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,200
in this deal,

220
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,230
but

221
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,350
I got nothing.

222
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,960
Lord Cheng

223
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,280
wasn't killed by Beiqi.

224
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,840
He even defeated Beiqi

225
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,030
and recovered Hejian Prefecture.

226
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,280
Minister Huang,

227
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,880
we were sure that

228
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
we would get Hejian Prefecture.

229
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,200
However,

230
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,150
Lord Cheng

231
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,910
rushed to the rescue quickly.

232
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,350
Your handwriting

233
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,880
lives up to its reputation.

234
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,960
You can write beautiful regular scripts in Academy Style.

235
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,880
I admire you.

236
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,230
I admire you.

237
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,790
We still want to

238
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
make up with you,

239
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
so please

240
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,640
pass that on.

241
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,590
Zhu Zan

242
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
killed my son.

243
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,440
I'll make him and his father pay with their lives.

244
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,910
I wanted to kill Zhu Zan

245
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,790
through Lu Yunqi,

246
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,440
but it was in vain.

247
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,880
You want peace as you lost.

248
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,110
Who will

249
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,350
avenge my son?

250
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,520
His Excellency Junior Huang

251
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,710
was nice to me,

252
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,710
but

253
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,790
I can't go against the imperial order.

254
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,400
If you want to make peace at this time,

255
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,470
the credit will go to Lord Cheng.

256
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,710
In this case,

257
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,840
Lord Cheng will be known

258
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,350
not only in the North,

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,910
but also around the country.

260
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,440
What do you mean?

261
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,520
Whether you offer counties,

262
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,670
money or treasures,

263
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,910
they're external wealth.

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,640
You're

265
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,520
in good faith,

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,110
but that's far from enough.

267
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,440
Dare you

268
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,440
fight to death?

269
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,790
Express your sincerity

270
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,150
with lives

271
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
of Beiqi generals and soldiers.

272
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,550
It's such a big thing

273
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,910
that I can't decide.

274
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,230
Leave it to His Majesty.

275
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,150
A long delay may cause trouble.

276
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,880
Be quick.

277
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,400
Yes.

278
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,440
Minister Huang,

279
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,030
I'm

280
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,200
leaving.

281
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,440
I'll go north.

282
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,000
Your Ladyship,

283
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,880
are we going to travel again?

284
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,110
I wonder where we're going first.

285
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,200
Your Ladyship,

286
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,350
something happened.

287
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,080
Beiqi has waged

288
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,200
a war against our country.

289
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,760
Wage a war?

290
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,230
Beiqi has thrown down the gauntlet.

291
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,640
It has gathered its generals and soldiers

292
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,670
and attacked from east and west.

293
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,280
Lord Cheng has ordered

294
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,590
all prefectures to prepare for war.

295
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,110
The Yongxing Army and the Guangcheng Army

296
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,960
are currently being mobilized.

297
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,760
People's life

298
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,550
goes as usual.

299
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,550
They have reserved food

300
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,230
and reduced going out

301
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,000
as required,

302
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,030
but

303
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,400
the North

304
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,790
is not as peaceful as before.

305
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,000
We'd better not go north

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
for the time being.

307
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Yes.

308
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,280
It'll be dangerous once the war is started.

309
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,200
Your Ladyship,

310
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,200
why don't we turn back?

311
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,910
Whether to Zezhou

312
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,280
or the capital city,

313
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,280
we'll follow you.

314
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,910
No.

315
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,760
In this case,

316
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,110
we must go to the North

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,710
and visit all prefectures.

318
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
Only when the vaccination is arranged

319
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,710
can Lord Cheng

320
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,550
fight again the enemies

321
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,320
without worrying the people.

322
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,350
But we...

323
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,230
-We… -Just do it.

324
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,670
Go pack things now.

325
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,710
We'll leave today.

326
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:20,910
Yes.

327
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:34,759
I didn't expect the war has become stalemated.

328
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Get ready to move.

329
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,520
Gather those

330
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,710
of the Sky Pavilion in the southwestern Hebei.

331
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,640
We'll meet there.

332
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,470
How will you get out?

333
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:43,229
I have my ways.

334
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,000
Zan,

335
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
there is news of Miss Jun.

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,160
She went north from Qingyuan Prefecture.

337
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,830
Go find out about her first

338
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,000
and then meet us.

339
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,830
OK.

340
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,520
Minister Huang,

341
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,230
this is a jade seal that the emperor of Beiqi

342
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,230
asked skilled craftsmen to make.

343
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,800
You can use it after all is done.

344
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,590
Please have a look.

345
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Do you like it?

346
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,160
It's too early

347
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,280
to talk about that.

348
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
The war situation

349
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,830
is unfavorable to Beiqi.

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,230
Lord Cheng is so brave.

351
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
We suffered heavy losses

352
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,430
in the battle in Xiongzhou.

353
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,760
I know

354
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,520
you can't handle him.

355
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,950
That's why we need your strategy.

356
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,800
Raid Kaide Prefecture.

357
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,310
It's

358
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,950
the sore spot of my country.

359
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
His Majesty will

360
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,830
recall Zhu Shan for help.

361
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
If he doesn't come back,

362
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,280
he acts against the order.

363
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,920
If he comes back...

364
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,830
Good idea.

365
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,640
Minister Huang, it's a good idea.

366
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,230
As soon as I go back,

367
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
I'll start a military action.

368
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,760
Be quick.

369
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,920
Don't worry.

370
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
It'll be foolproof.

371
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,560
As

372
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,880
the prime minister,

373
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,830
I feel sorry

374
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,920
for my country.

375
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,920
With civil and military skills,

376
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,280
you should be

377
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,350
the emperor of the country.

378
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,430
Governor,

379
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,830
remember.

380
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,470
I must get Zhu Shan and his son killed.

381
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,190
Don't expose your wound to water these days.

382
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,800
Be sure to wrap it up.

383
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,560
Your Ladyship,

384
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,520
here is Fuxi powder.

385
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,520
Right.

386
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,520
Give him Siwu powder

387
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,710
and decoct it with 1.5g of pseudo-ginseng

388
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,110
to take the decoction.

389
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,590
OK.

390
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,110
Fuxi powder.

391
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,880
Well.

392
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,710
Be careful.

393
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
-Let me support you. -Thanks, Dr. Jun.

394
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,470
Take this.

395
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,830
Your Ladyship,

396
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,350
those seriously injured have been arranged properly.

397
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,520
The vaccination has begun

398
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,350
over there.

399
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,590
OK. Thanks.

400
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,760
Liu'er,

401
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,110
conditions are tough here.

402
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,190
-Be careful. -You've worked hard.

403
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,680
I like

404
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,560
working with you.

405
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,230
Go.

406
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,310
Let's check over there.

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Dr. Jun. Dr. Jun. Dr. Jun.

408
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,830
Dr. Jun is here.

409
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,560
It's my turn.

410
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,400
Dr. Jun.

411
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,680
Fellow citizens,

412
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,920
Lord Cheng asked me

413
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,230
to vaccinate you.

414
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,190
He knows clearly

415
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,950
your sufferings

416
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,710
and fear

417
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,280
in the intrusion,

418
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,070
so he specially

419
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,830
asked me to cure you here.

420
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,800
This is the blessing

421
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
of the people and the North.

422
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,110
Now

423
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,000
I've taught local doctors

424
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,590
how to vaccinate.

425
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,160
Please cooperate with them on the treatment.

426
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,640
Thanks, Dr. Jun.

427
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,520
His Highness Lord Cheng is so kind.

428
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,160
He is so kind.

429
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,520
Thanks, Dr. Jun.

430
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Don't stand on ceremony.

431
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,400
Living in the North,

432
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,920
we're one big family.

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,280
Let's continue the vaccination.

434
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,230
Kids under 10 come first.

435
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,560
Well. Please.

436
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,520
Liu'er,

437
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,680
go help Mr. Lei.

438
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,680
OK.

439
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,350
Betel nut tastes bitter.

440
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,470
It's warm, astringent and non-toxic.

441
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,430
It promotes digestion and relieves diuresis.

442
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,560
It can eliminate phlegm, kill worms,

443
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,710
cure hidden diseases

444
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,110
and kill pinworm. It grows in the south coast.

445
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,680
What are you doing, Mr. Lei?

446
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,880
Miss Jun said,

447
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,040
after years of wars in the North,

448
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,680
food and drinking water here

449
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,920
have become so dirty.

450
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,470
In addition, there is miasma.

451
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,950
The people are certainly

452
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,680
breeding diseases and worms.

453
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,560
Betel nuts

454
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,920
can promote qi, kill worms,

455
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,880
eliminate accumulation and relieve diuresis.

456
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,400
It's a good medicine supplement.

457
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,470
Now that

458
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Miss Jun has left the important task

459
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
of sorting medicinal materials to me,

460
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,400
I must not make mistakes.

461
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,350
I need to know the efficacy

462
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,710
of these herbs.

463
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,110
You're so attentive.

464
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,510
Danfengmen
19
00:30:12,250 --> 00:02:11,720
Lord Cheng's wife Yu Lan

465
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,590
Your Majesty,

466
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
we can't let Kaide Prefecture fall.

467
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,710
Back then, Beiqi

468
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,310
attacked from there

469
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
and went all the way south

470
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
to surround the capital city.

471
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,000
Nobody could rescue.

472
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
The then emperor's father was captured.

473
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,230
At last,

474
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,400
he died in Beiqi.

475
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,070
Are they

476
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,710
going to

477
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,070
repeat it?

478
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,040
Your Majesty,

479
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,470
please order Lord Cheng

480
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,470
to protect Kaide Prefecture.

481
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,070
The same route.

482
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,280
The same strategy.

483
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,880
What a coincidence!

484
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,000
Your Majesty, please don't.

485
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,560
Lord Cheng is fighting

486
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,430
against Beiqi in the North.

487
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,070
If he is recalled at this point,

488
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,760
the North

489
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,520
will be trampled upon at will.

490
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,190
Minister Ning,

491
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,400
you mean we can ignore

492
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,590
the safety of the capital city?

493
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,070
I don't mean that.

494
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,680
Minister Huang, don't take this out of context.

495
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,430
I care about Your Majesty.

496
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,280
It's all for your safety.

497
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,800
Your Majesty, please recall

498
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,760
Lord Cheng to protect Kaide Prefecture.

499
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,430
Your Majesty,

500
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,430
even if you don't worry about your safety,

501
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,470
think about all the people in the city.

502
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,640
Your Majesty.

503
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,880
Please recall Lord Cheng to protect Kaide Prefecture.

504
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,560
Please recall Lord Cheng to protect Kaide Prefecture.

505
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,400
Yaozi Pass.

506
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,110
Qingpa River.

507
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,400
Liangcheng City.

508
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,880
The capital of my country.

509
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,400
It's risky to raid

510
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,470
Kaide Prefecture alone.

511
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,560
It doesn't seem like

512
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,830
fighting to get into the interior.

513
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,230
What a coincidence!

514
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,350
All marching routes

515
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,350
are like those

516
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,680
in the third year of the Taiyan period.

517
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,160
They want to

518
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,590
disturb the morale of our army.

519
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,710
What's wrong with the horses?

520
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,880
The horses are running away.

521
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,400
They're running away.

522
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,160
Stop them.

523
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,800
Hurry up.

524
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,950
I can't.

525
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,800
Don't let them run away.

526
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,350
Someone.

527
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,280
Stop them.

528
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,470
Someone.

529
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,680
Stop them.

530
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,880
Stop them.

531
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,710
Chase them.

532
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,400
Order

533
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,950
Lord Cheng

534
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,640
to dispatch troops immediately

535
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,470
to protect Kaide Prefecture.

536
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,070
Your Majesty,

537
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,280
I think

538
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,800
you can issue more edicts

539
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,430
to show your reliance on Lord Cheng

540
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,880
and to let him know that

541
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,310
it's serious,

542
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,160
so he'll return immediately.

543
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,280
Then issue another

544
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,520
two,

545
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,470
three...

546
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,470
No.

547
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,800
Issue ten edicts.

548
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,000
Your Majesty is wise.

549
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,560
Zhu,

550
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,920
Zhu Zan ran away.

551
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,710
Your Majesty,

552
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,230
Zhu Zan ran away.

553
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,590
How useless!

554
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,590
How can they let him run away?

555
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,830
What happened?

556
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,640
The horses were startled,

557
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,350
so he chased them.

558
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,880
However, as he whistled all the way,

559
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,470
the horses

560
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,470
followed him.

561
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,350
The horses

562
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,880
didn't fear swords and arrows.

563
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,190
Zhu Zan hid in them,

564
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,400
so no one could catch him.

565
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:12,880
Your Excellency,

566
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,590
it's my fault.

567
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,830
Though we were careful,

568
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,470
we didn't expect that

569
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,560
he ran away like this.

570
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,190
Pleas punish me.

571
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,920
Let it go

572
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,040
this time.

573
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,830
Do something for me.

574
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,230
Your Excellency,

575
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,040
what's your order?

576
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,640
Your Majesty has sent orders around the country.

577
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,190
Son of Lord Cheng fled to escape punishment.

578
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,160
Whoever sees him

579
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,350
can catch him.

580
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,560
Yes.

581
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,350
I'll notify men of all departments.

582
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:55,950
Your Ladyship.

583
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,800
OK.

584
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,590
Your Ladyship,

585
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,830
they've followed us all the way.

586
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,350
How persevering!

587
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,880
Let them go.

588
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,640
They've done nothing to us

589
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,430
all the way.

590
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
The North is uneasy now.

591
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,190
Take them as our body guards.

592
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,230
Go.

593
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,680
Go.

594
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,190
Go.

595
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,000
Protect madame.

596
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,560
Go.

597
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,950
Go.

598
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,950
Go.

599
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,400
There's a fight down there.

600
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,310
Your Ladyship,

601
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,710
shall we avoid it?

602
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,280
Help them.

603
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,040
Get on the horse.

604
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,710
Get on the horse.

605
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,830
Your Ladyship, be careful.

606
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,680
Your Excellency,

607
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,430
what should we do?

608
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,680
Laoba,

609
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,310
find a chance to escape,

610
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,350
or we'll be killed here.

611
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,110
Don't worry, madame.

612
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,470
I'll keep you safe.

613
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,760
Protect madame.

614
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,800
Laoba.

615
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,680
Madame Yu.

616
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,640
Leave.

617
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,160
Run.

618
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,710
I'm fine.

619
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,230
Be careful.

620
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,760
Madame.

621
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,800
Your Ladyship.

622
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,560
Your Ladyship.

623
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,830
Your Ladyship, are you alright?

624
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,950
I'm fine.

625
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,040
Are you alright?

626
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,950
What's wrong, madame?

627
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,760
Well, be careful.

628
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,710
Well.

629
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,110
Madame,

630
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,590
your feet may hurt a bit these days.

631
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,920
Hold on.

632
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,070
If it doesn't hurt,

633
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,920
it'll be troublesome.

634
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,040
Leave it to me.

635
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,880
Well.

636
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,950
Be careful.

637
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,560
Are you alright?

638
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,190
Yes.

639
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,640
What's your surname, young lady?

640
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,350
My surname is Jun.

641
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,350
Miss Jun.

642
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,470
Where are you going, madame?

643
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,430
Daming Prefecture.

644
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,430
He wasn't a robber.

645
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,190
He just killed and robbed us of nothing.

646
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,400
I think he was

647
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,110
from Beiqi.

648
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,230
Miss Jun.

649
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,470
Please wait, madame.

650
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,190
Mr. Lei,

651
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,430
what's going on there?

652
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,400
Your Ladyship,

653
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,520
they weren't robbers,

654
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,230
but Beiqi soldiers in disguise.

655
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,230
I see.

656
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
That makes sense.

657
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,800
Mr. Lei,

658
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,400
change our route to Daming Prefecture.

659
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,590
Daming Prefecture?

660
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,040
Yes.

661
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,680
Why?

662
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,830
I have no time to explain.

663
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,590
I'll tell you later.

664
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,350
Get ready and go.

665
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,920
OK.

666
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,590
Go

667
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,310
Everyone,

668
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,430
Clean up now

669
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,280
and get ready to go.

670
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,110
Madame,

671
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,590
I'll escort you to Daming Prefecture.

672
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,310
It seems that

673
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,950
you have no other choice now.

674
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,310
Your Excellency Jin,

675
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,350
thank you all the way.

676
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,760
What do you mean, Miss Jun?

677
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,640
I wonder when His Excellency Lu

678
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,590
will capture me to the capital city.

679
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,560
You misunderstand.

680
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,160
I don't mean to do that.

681
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,920
So you're escorting me.

682
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,910
In this case,

683
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,870
I have to trouble you in the following journey.

684
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,320
Coming.

685
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,120
Come on. Come on. Come on.

686
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,630
Hurry up.

687
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,870
Come on. Come on. Come on.

688
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,600
Is it ready?

689
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,470
A moment. A moment.

690
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,320
Well, here you are.

691
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,800
Pour.

692
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,560
Why are you crying?

693
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,390
Pour.

694
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,320
Give me one.

695
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,320
Beauty,

696
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,430
let me have a look.

697
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,360
Let me have a look.

698
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,870
Come on.

699
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,710
Come on. Come on. Come on.

700
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,600
Pour. Pour. Pour.

701
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,390
Pour.

702
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,150
Fill it. Fill it.

703
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,710
Is it ready?

704
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,800
A moment. A moment.

705
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,840
Be patient.

706
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,870
I haven't eaten.

707
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,430
Someone is there.

708
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,390
Run.

709
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,430
How are you?

710
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm fine.

711
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,040
Where is Baotang?

712
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,280
He gathered brothers in northwest

713
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,120
and went to Kaide Prefecture directly.

714
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,950
No news of Miss Jun.

715
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,470
Let's go

716
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,080
to Kaide Prefecture.

717
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,320
He has refused

718
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,520
ten of my edicts.

719
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,190
Damn Zhu Shan!

720
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,840
Your Majesty,

721
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
please punish

722
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,120
Zhu Shan, Lord Cheng,

723
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,950
for being treacherous.

724
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,080
Your Majesty,

725
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,280
please punish

726
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,800
Zhu Shan, Lord Cheng,

727
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,910
for being overbearing.

728
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,470
Your Majesty,

729
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,560
please punish

730
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,320
Zhu Shan

731
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,190
for being overbearing.

732
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,320
Your Majesty,

733
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,840
as Zhu Zan escaped,

734
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,280
Lord Cheng fears nothing.

735
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,670
How dare they

736
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,040
do that!

737
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,280
Your Majesty,

738
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,950
I've sent out wanted orders around the country.

739
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,190
We'll catch Zhu Zan

740
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,080
as soon as possible.

741
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,560
Your Majesty,

742
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,560
we just see that as his son

743
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,150
escaped,

744
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,470
Lord Cheng fears nothing.

745
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,430
But think about it.

746
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,360
As son of Lord Cheng escaped to the North,

747
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,280
the wanted orders will spread all over the country.

748
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,320
It's dangerous to him.

749
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,470
As a father,

750
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,670
the easiest choice for Lord Cheng

751
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,040
is to send troops back to defend.

752
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,710
Thus, your edicts will be obeyed

753
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,390
and his son will be saved.

754
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,430
It's the best way to achieve both.

755
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,190
But Lord Cheng

756
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,150
doesn't mind that his son

757
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,080
is in danger.

758
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,230
He just sees that

759
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,390
if he leads troops back to defend,

760
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,760
the North will be in chaos,

761
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,760
the people there will suffer

762
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,430
and the country will be destroyed.

763
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,470
Your Majesty,

764
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,710
Lord Cheng

765
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,000
seems to go against you,

766
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,320
but he is actually refusing to do

767
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,360
what a father should do.

768
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,390
He puts the North above everything,

769
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,870
Your Majesty.

770
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,600
It's alright now.

771
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,630
You mean

772
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,390
I'm inferior

773
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,760
to Lord Cheng.

774
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,230
Your Majesty,

775
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,870
I don't mean that.

776
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,390
It's my country.

777
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,470
Don't tell me

778
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,870
what to do.

779
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,840
Your Majesty,

780
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,280
please think carefully.

781
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,910
How arrogant you are!

782
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,840
I will suspend your position

783
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,870
and punish you

784
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,470
by pondering over your mistakes in solitude

785
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,150
for three months.

786
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,400
♫Outline in my dream♫

787
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,840
