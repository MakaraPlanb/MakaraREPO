00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:15,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 25

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,360
Chengyu,

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,600
why did Childe Ning

19
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,520
help Jiuling?

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,030
I said it just now.

21
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,670
That was Jiuling's idea.

22
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,520
But how about Childe Ning?

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,080
Actually, you also guessed it.

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,520
You just said

25
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,550
Jiuling and Childe Ning discussed it.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,360
However,

27
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,960
neither Shopkeeper Liu

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
nor Jiuling mentioned that.

29
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,080
So the matter

30
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,830
happened suddenly.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
In this case,

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
they couldn't think carefully.

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,880
Perhaps he likes her a bit,

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,600
so he made the impulsive decision.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,750
That's the most reasonable explanation.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
That's possible.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,110
Chengyu,

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,550
Childe Ning helped Jiuling.

39
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,720
Do you feel happy with that?

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,550
I like her.

41
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,440
With such a person

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,630
who likes her and protects her,

43
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,960
certainly I'm happy.

44
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,670
Even if you aren't that person?

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,550
Even if it isn't me,

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,360
as long as she is protected,

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,110
that's fine.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,110
You aren't

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,190
what you used to be.

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,470
It's an ordinary day.

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,080
Is there a wedding?

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
According to the date,

53
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,000
it should be the congratulations of the No. 1 Scholar.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,670
Congratulations.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,960
Mrs. Ning

56
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,190
must be very happy.

57
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,880
Yes.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
It should be congratulated.

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,470
It's nothing to be ecstatic about.

60
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,920
The county makes it extravagant.

61
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,509
He is the No. 1 Scholar.

62
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,440
Only one in three years.

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,600
It's normal

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,830
to make it lively.

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,200
By the way,

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Yunzhao is old enough to marry.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,510
He said

68
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,070
he wouldn't marry until he passed the exam.

69
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,200
It has been postponed until now.

70
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,920
Mrs. Ning,

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,720
is there a favorite candidate?

72
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,950
Don't be hasty.

73
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,270
Mrs. Ma.

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,830
Congratulations.

75
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,390
Two happy events come at the same time.

76
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,510
Take a seat.

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,390
Mrs. Ma,

78
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,920
only Yunzhao

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,670
is No. 1 Scholar this year in the Ning family.

80
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,040
How come there are two happy events?

81
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,600
Haven't you received a family letter

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
from the capital city?

83
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,720
I mention it in advance.

84
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,160
Sorry, madam.

85
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,510
Now Childe Ning is No. 1 Scholar

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
and Miss Jun is

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,390
known for treating smallpox.

88
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,760
If they get married earlier,

89
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,720
you can rest assured.

90
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,040
What do you mean?

91
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
Will Jun Zhenzhen marry Yunzhao?

92
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,670
What you said

93
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,440
is a mistake.

94
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,160
There was

95
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,670
an engagement,

96
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,230
but it was broken off.

97
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,760
You don't need to hide it.

98
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,600
The matter of the Fang family has been settled.

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,440
No need

100
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,670
to disguise.

101
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,510
The day after the ranking of the imperial examination was released,

102
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,830
Childe Ning said in public

103
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,950
the engagement is still valid.

104
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,000
They agreed to marry

105
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,070
after returning to hometown.

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
That's not true.

107
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,230
Yunzhao won't marry her.

108
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,830
Congratulations.

109
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,830
Congratulations. Congratulations.

110
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,670
Congratulations, No. 1 Scholar.

111
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,760
Please say hello to Miss Jun for us.

112
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,320
After getting married,

113
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,760
will you let Miss Jun continue to work as a doctor?

114
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,640
Please say hello to Miss Jun for us.

115
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,350
Your Ladyship,

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,550
you know as you appear,

117
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,350
they'll kick up a fuss.

118
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,320
Why do you come?

119
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,040
Childe Ning dared to help me out in public,

120
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,070
so I'll support him in the public.

121
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,880
Moreover,

122
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,480
the more people know it,

123
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,760
the more Lu fears it.

124
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,720
No. 1 Scholar.

125
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,880
Zan,

126
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
how do you feel?

127
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,070
What do you want to say?

128
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,550
Pah.

129
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,350
Great.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,510
You just

131
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,200
made it

132
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,230
very impressive.

133
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,320
You're either affected

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,830
or pretentious.

135
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,040
You don't give blessing or give up.

136
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,670
It's

137
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,550
man's true temperament.

138
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,270
Pah.

139
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,720
They're engaged,

140
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,790
but they haven't got married.

141
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,950
I think Miss Jun is nice to you.

142
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:06,880
Pah.

143
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,510
Stop.

144
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,510
I agree with Sanbing.

145
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,790
Pah.

146
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,720
Sanbing,

147
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,670
why is someone

148
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,790
so abnormal?

149
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
You're too young

150
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,920
to understand that.

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,830
I see.

152
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,110
Well.

153
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,270
Go to the point.

154
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,640
Any news?

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,480
No prisoner has been

156
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,110
sent secretly to the imperial prison recently.

157
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,880
We searched the capital city,

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,230
but we haven't found Wan Qing.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,550
You were hit

160
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,440
because of Dr. Jun, right?

161
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,880
Zhu Zan?

162
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,040
His Lordship?

163
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,000
He fought because you want to

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,910
marry Dr. Jun.

165
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,670
I'm sure he likes

166
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,080
Dr. Jun a bit.

167
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,590
Though she has a humble origin,

168
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,550
it doesn't matter.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,880
Lord Cheng isn't punctilious.

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
Generally, he doesn't care.

171
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,150
In this case,

172
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,840
Miss Jun

173
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,110
can marry His Lordship.

174
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,080
That's impossible.

175
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,200
Ning Yunzhao said

176
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,230
Jun Jiuling is his fiancée.

177
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,760
Ning Yunzhao?

178
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,230
No. 1 Scholar.

179
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,670
If Dr. Jun can marry him,

180
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,640
that'll be great, too.

181
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,670
That's impossible.

182
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,200
She is such a good girl.

183
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,470
Let her live as she likes.

184
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,230
Isn't that great?

185
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,550
You like her very much, right?

186
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll let her accompany you every day,

187
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,350
OK?

188
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,790
No.

189
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
I don't like her.

190
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,520
She isn't my sister.

191
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,080
My sister

192
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,670
is dead.

193
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,710
Now that she is like the princess,

194
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,880
she should live like the princess.

195
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,470
If she doesn't want that,

196
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,520
since Princess Jiuling is dead,

197
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,960
why can

198
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,080
she still be alive?

199
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,670
Dr. Jun,

200
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,230
what's wrong with my wife?

201
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,400
Don't worry, Your Excellency Wang.

202
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,880
It doesn't matter.

203
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,440
I've applied acupuncture

204
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,400
and prescribed.

205
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,710
She'll recover after a period of nursing.

206
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,790
You need to comfort Mrs. Wang

207
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,760
to let her calm down.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,550
Great.

209
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,910
What you said

210
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
will comfort her best.

211
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
Your words work

212
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,000
better than ours.

213
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,670
You flattered me, Your Excellency Wang.

214
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,400
This way, please.

215
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,320
Master.

216
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,670
Oh, no, Master.

217
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,400
Well.

218
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,440
What are you doing?

219
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,200
Wang Lian,

220
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,960
you were accused of corruption.

221
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,960
We were ordered to search your mansion.

222
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:49,790
Non...

223
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,880
Nonsense.

224
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,670
Do you

225
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,760
have the search order?

226
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,840
This is enough.

227
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,470
How base!

228
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,640
How base!

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Master,

230
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,280
madam fainted.

231
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,200
Stop.

232
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,080
We're working.

233
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,910
People unrelated should avoid.

234
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,640
I'm a doctor. Let me save her.

235
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,350
I wonder if you want to save her

236
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,710
or escape with things.

237
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,320
His Excellency Wang

238
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
is a popular official,

239
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
but those of Arm Moral Department

240
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
accused him of ganging up for selfish interests.

241
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
Why?

242
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,710
They searched his mansion

243
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,350
showing no respect for him at all.

244
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,150
After Scholar Han,

245
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,400
it's His Excellency Wang.

246
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,640
And both happened

247
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,110
during my consultation.

248
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
Do they have anything to do with us?

249
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,440
I think they aim at me.

250
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,910
Is it

251
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,550
the trick of His Excellency Lu?

252
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,710
Liu'er,

253
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,670
tell them

254
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,880
to prepare the prescription quickly.

255
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,910
Choose the best

256
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,230
rhizome of lagehead atractylodes and betel nut

257
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,520
and send them to His Excellency Wang

258
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,080
without delay.

259
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,960
I'll meet Lu Yunqi.

260
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,590
OK.

261
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,320
Don't worry.

262
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,320
You refused his proposal,

263
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,590
but you go to meet him.

264
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,320
Is that proper?

265
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,230
I have no time to think about that.

266
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:08,840
Go now.

267
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,110
OK.

268
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,850
Arm Moral Department

269
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,080
His Excellency Lu.

270
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,710
Finally,

271
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,150
you seem to understand what I mean.

272
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,470
I don't understand.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,080
What don't you understand?

274
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm embarrassing you.

275
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,760
I don't understand

276
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,590
what you want to do.

277
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,640
I'm engaged.

278
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,550
So what?

279
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,790
I like you

280
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,150
and want to marry you. Is that wrong?

281
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
You want me to be

282
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,880
like Third Madame.

283
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,080
No.

284
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,880
You're different.

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,590
You know clearly

286
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,880
we'll never marry.

287
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,840
His Excellency Lu,

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,960
remember that

289
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm a doctor,

290
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,350
and it's my duty to heal and the sick and save people.

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,280
If you want to embarrass me,

292
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,640
don't get others involved.

293
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:47,470
Li Mansion

294
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,000
Be careful, Minister Huang.

295
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Mind the threshold.

296
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,200
Who is he?

297
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
His Excellency Junior Huang.

298
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,080
He is His Excellency Junior Huang.

299
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,710
OK.

300
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,630
Son of Huang Cheng Huang Ziqing

301
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,710
I remember what you said.

302
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,520
Thank you, Minister Huang.

303
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,200
Working hard day and night for the country,

304
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,960
you should take more supplements.

305
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,520
I cooked some health soup

306
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,710
in person.

307
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,790
Please taste it.

308
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,590
Soup?

309
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,320
I didn't expect that

310
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,440
you can make soup.

311
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,640
Well,

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
my family was poor when I was young.

313
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,030
And my mom was weak and ill.

314
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,520
I did laundry and cooked by myself

315
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,440
to be barely fed.

316
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,670
Well,

317
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,440
you did work hard.

318
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,200
Minister Huang,

319
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,520
you did work hard.

320
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,640
With a low rank,

321
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,840
I can't share burden with His Majesty,

322
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,150
but I can work for you.

323
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,350
-It's really my... -OK.

324
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,550
I see.

325
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,910
Please take

326
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,150
this health soup.

327
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,280
Please.

328
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,790
The soup

329
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,280
is really nutritious.

330
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,880
OK.

331
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,350
If there is a job opening in the palace later,

332
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,080
I'll make you fill it.

333
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,640
After all,

334
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,590
it must be hard

335
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,640
for you to copy books for so many years

336
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,670
in the Ministry of Official Personnel Affairs.

337
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,230
Yes.

338
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,640
Here you are.

339
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,030
Minister Huang.

340
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,670
Excuse me.

341
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,400
Is that His Excellency Prime Minister Huang?

342
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
-Minister Huang, take care. -Young lady,

343
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,200
you just came to the capital city, right?

344
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,350
-See you, Minister Huang. -He isn't His Excellency Prime Minister Huang,

345
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,320
but His Excellency Junior Huang,

346
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,280
the son of Prime Minister Huang.

347
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,320
Get away.

348
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,760
Get away.

349
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,280
Get away.

350
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,080
Get away.

351
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,590
You,

352
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,910
get way.

353
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,350
Get away.

354
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,640
Get away.

355
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,230
Your Ladyship,

356
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,110
who is he?

357
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,110
He is domineering.

358
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,760
Huang Ziqing, Huang Cheng's son.

359
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,030
It looks lively over there.

360
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,200
Let's go and have a look.

361
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,000
Liu'er,

362
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,470
remember to stay away from him

363
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,590
when you see him.

364
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,320
Why?

365
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,080
Is he more scaring than Lu Yunqi?

366
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,200
Many officials are said to be killed by Arm Moral Department.

367
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,590
Actually, most of them

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,080
were killed by him.

369
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,110
He is so terrible.

370
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,109
Luckily, we don't connect with him,

371
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:30,709
so we won't offend him.

372
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:31,469
Let's detour.

373
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,520
-I'm sorry. -Sorry.

374
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:41,159
Young lady,

375
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,830
your flowers.

376
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,640
Your flowers.

377
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,349
Isn't she Wan Qing,

378
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:47,069
the granddaughter of Wan Dachun?

379
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,559
Why does she look so strange?

380
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,430
Let's have a look.

381
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
There are so many people today.

382
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:55,640
The mansion of Minister Huang...

383
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,190
Minister Huang.

384
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,280
Minister Junior Huang.

385
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,920
Minister Junior Huang.

386
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,350
Minister Tang, you look hasty.

387
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,350
What's wrong?

388
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,400
The memorial to the throne from the office of imperial censors to impeach Lord Cheng

389
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,760
was stopped by Minister He again.

390
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,560
People tend to be stubborn

391
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,520
when getting old.

392
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,710
Yes.

393
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
He even said

394
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,560
we are stupid to impeach Lord Cheng

395
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,430
for colluding with Beiqi.

396
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,830
He said the censor

397
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,190
reported mechanically

398
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,560
without any reasons.

399
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,110
How can

400
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,800
he say that?

401
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Indeed.

402
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,590
Many people have heard

403
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,400
the news from the North.

404
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,310
He is suspicious anyway.

405
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,520
Well.

406
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,040
Give me the memorial.

407
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,110
I'll report to my father.

408
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,160
His Majesty will decide

409
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,000
whether it's stupid or funny.

410
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,070
We can't

411
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,280
do that for His Majesty.

412
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,640
Do you think so,

413
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,310
Minister Tang?

414
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,830
Yes.

415
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,680
Yes.

416
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,640
Take it here.

417
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,230
So many memorials.

418
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,110
Well,

419
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
if just one

420
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
or two people have impeached him,

421
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,880
it's possible that

422
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,920
they want to frame him up.

423
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,760
However,

424
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,710
as so many people have impeached him,

425
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,070
it's...

426
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,760
Thank you, Minister Junior Huang.

427
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,640
It's my duty to share the burden

428
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
with His Majesty.

429
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,040
See you.

430
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,800
Excuse me.

431
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,560
Excuse me. Excuse me.

432
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,070
She has followed all the way.

433
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,040
Is she going to assassinate Huang Ziqing?

434
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,400
She has little chance of winning.

435
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,000
It's a dead end.

436
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,350
She is so young.

437
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,590
She shouldn't die casually.

438
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,000
Young Master,

439
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,760
only Commander Lu hasn't arrived yet.

440
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,760
Let's start dinner

441
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,920
without him.

442
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,560
Rubbish.

443
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,920
Young lady,

444
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,160
raise your head and let me have a look.

445
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,110
-Young Master. -She killed him.

446
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:37,760
Young Master.

447
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,590
She killed him.

448
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,590
Young Master.

449
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,000
What are you doing?

450
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Call Old Master.

451
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,310
Young Master.

452
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,800
Hold on, Young Master.

453
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,400
Stop.

454
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,040
The knife is in his chest now.

455
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,280
If you pull it out now,

456
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,470
he'll die.

457
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,470
Well.

458
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,000
So Young Master...

459
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,310
Young Master.

460
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,920
Young Master.

461
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,520
Well.

462
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,830
Son.

463
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,160
Ziqing.

464
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,830
-Old Master. -Ziqing.

465
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,470
Young Master is...

466
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,880
Ziqing.

467
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,950
Who are you?

468
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,430
Wan Qing,

469
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,040
the granddaughter of Wan Dachun of the Ministry of Works.

470
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,680
Kill me.

471
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,640
He killed all my family members,

472
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,040
so I killed him.

473
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,190
Damn it.

474
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,110
You brat,

475
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,800
how can you be tricked by her?

476
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,950
Imperial doctor,

477
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,950
save him.

478
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,640
Hurry up.

479
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,830
Minister Huang,

480
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,590
I can save him if other parts are cut.

481
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
However, his heart is cut.

482
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,470
Once the knife is pulled out,

483
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,590
he'll

484
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,160
surely die.

485
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,710
You must find a way.

486
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,000
Imperial doctor,

487
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,560
he is my only son.

488
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,590
You must find a way.

489
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,110
As long as you can save him,

490
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,070
I'll guarantee you a life of wealth and rank.

491
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,520
I can't.

492
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,920
Please forgive me.

493
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,190
What should we do?

494
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,710
Young Master. Young Master.

495
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,190
Ziqing.

496
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,160
Young Master.

497
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,350
Son.

498
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,000
My son.

499
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,830
Grandparents,

500
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,830
have you heard it?

501
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,430
Have you seen it?

502
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,280
I avenged you.

503
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,470
Finally I avenged

504
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,310
you.

505
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,800
Damn Huang Ziqing

506
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,880
is dead.

507
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,710
I avenged.

508
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,040
My wish has been fulfilled.

509
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,640
It's a great blessing

510
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,230
to die innocently

511
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,830
and happily.

512
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a pity that

513
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,430
I can't see the day when you're vindicated.

514
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,800
Minister Huang,

515
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,280
perhaps there is a doctor who can save your son.

516
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,560
Who?

517
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,160
Who can?

518
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Dr. Jun of Jiuling Drugstore said

519
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
she can cure

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,760
what we can't.

521
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,000
She is

522
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,230
here now.

523
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,710
Where?

524
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,230
Where is she?

525
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,430
Yeah.

526
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,000
Over there.

527
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,830
Dr. Jun,

528
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,590
can you save him?

529
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,760
Don't save him.

530
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,040
Please.

531
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,040
Don't save him.

532
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,000
Minister Junior Huang is dying.

533
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,430
If Dr. Jun can save him,

534
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,920
she can bring people back from death.

535
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,710
Miss Jun,

536
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
I've just kneeled to

537
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,430
heaven, earth, sovereign, parents and teacher.

538
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,640
No.

539
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,590
Today,

540
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,070
I kneel to you.

541
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,310
Please.

542
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,400
Save my son.

543
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,310
He is

544
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,400
my only son.

545
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,640
No.

546
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,760
We're late.

547
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,950
Don't save him.

548
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,760
Why is she here?

549
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,950
Miss Jun.

550
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,430
Dr. Jun,

551
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,000
can you save him?

552
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,710
Tell us.

553
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,590
We're waiting for you.

554
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,800
Don't save him. Please.

555
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,350
Please.

556
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,070
Please.

557
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,710
Don't save him.

558
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,470
Miss Jun.

559
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,680
Don't save him.

560
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,280
Please.

561
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,430
No.

562
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,710
No.

563
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,880
Miss Jun.

564
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,070
Don't save him. Please.

565
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,470
No.

566
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,640
No.

567
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,920
Miss Jun,

568
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,000
save my son.

569
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,710
I can.

570
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,590
Young Master.

571
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,760
You'll be saved, Young Master.

572
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,350
-Yes. -Young Master.

573
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,590
Why do you save him?

574
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,800
No.

575
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,590
No.

576
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,400
No.

577
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,280
Please. No.

578
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,680
No.

579
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,190
Don't save him.

580
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,830
No.

581
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,680
Please. Don't save him.

582
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,190
Miss Jun is going to save Huang Ziqing.

583
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,710
What do you want to do?

584
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,350
I'll stop her.

585
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,560
If she saves him,

586
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,680
she'll be criticized.

587
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,800
If he is saved,

588
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,920
he'll kill more people.

589
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,160
Have you thought clearly?

590
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,190
Huang Cheng targets Lord Cheng.

591
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,000
Once you stand up,

592
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,830
there will be hell to pay.

593
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,590
Zan, calm down.

594
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,400
Wait here.

595
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,110
Zan.

596
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,920
Wait here.

597
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Son,

598
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,590
Miss Jun will save you.

599
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,070
He is a murder.

600
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,680
If you save him,

601
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,760
he'll kill more people.

602
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,070
You're an accomplice in murder.

603
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,000
He is a murderer.

604
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,430
You're an accomplice in murder.

605
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,280
Your Ladyship.

606
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,760
Get away. Get away.

607
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,430
Old Master.

608
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,190
It's dangerous.

609
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,400
Son.

610
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,160
Son.

611
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,470
-Young Master. -Punishment.

612
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,760
It serves you right, corrupt official.

613
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,830
Son.

614
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,520
Young Master.

615
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,350
Young Master.

616
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,350
Minister Huang, my condolences.

617
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,230
Wan Qing is dead.

618
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,160
A life for a life.

619
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,800
Is her life as valuable

620
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,430
as that of my son?

621
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,760
Miss Jun,

622
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,920
you can bring a patient back to life, right?

623
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,310
You can bring a patient back to life, right?

624
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
She isn't King of Hell.

625
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,000
Must she bring all patients back to life?

626
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,560
His Excellency Huang,

627
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,230
none of us

628
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,950
wants to see that.

629
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,560
My condolences.

630
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,000
Zhu Zan.

631
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,710
Zhu Zan.

632
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,520
You killed my son.

633
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,920
Don't pretend to be innocent.

634
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,160
You scared the horse.

635
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,800
You killed my son.

636
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,920
You killed my son.

637
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,560
What are you doing?

638
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,950
Go.

639
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,920
Go.

640
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,760
Stop.

641
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,830
His Majesty ordered

642
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,280
to arrest him.

643
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,680
-Eunuch. -Investigate him strictly.

644
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520
You just come in time.

645
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,950
He is the murderer.

646
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,400
I've got many memorials

647
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,160
impeaching Zhu Shan.

648
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,880
I'll send them to His Majesty.

649
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,830
I'll make both him

650
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,230
and his father

651
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,520
pay with their life.

652
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,520
I dare you to hurt my father.

653
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,000
Don't try to slander him,

654
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,680
Huang Cheng.

655
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,520
You...

656
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,470
Your Lordship,

657
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,920
talk with

658
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,230
His Majesty in the palace.

659
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,280
Take him away.

660
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,000
Go.

661
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,070
His Excellency Lu,

662
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,520
please go with me.

663
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,110
His Excellency Huang is furious today.

664
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,920
If he says anything wrong

665
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,470
before His Majesty,

666
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,880
you may correct it.

667
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,230
His Excellency Huang,

668
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,830
please.

669
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,800
Pull that bitch out

670
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,920
to feed the dog.

671
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,760
Yes.

672
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,830
My son.

673
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,950
He is son of Lord Cheng.

674
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,430
Yes.

675
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,970
Jiuling Drugstore
21
00:35:53,420 --> 00:02:11,720
Ghost doctor of Arm Moral Department Ghost Hand

676
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,520
Be careful.

677
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,880
Don't be hasty.

678
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,520
Why did Wan Qing

679
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,800
chose this place to avenge?

680
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,520
Clearly, she didn't want to live.

681
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,190
Don't talk nonsense.

682
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,800
We don't know what happened yet.

683
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,430
So there is no justice in the world.

684
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,560
People exchange justice

685
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
with their lives.

686
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,160
Do you agree, Your Ladyship?

687
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,350
Jiuling,

688
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,590
is it a coincidence that

689
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,400
the horse was startled?

690
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,880
Baotang, Sanbing,

691
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,280
help me.

692
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,230
Follow Wan Qing.

693
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,470
When those of the Huang family leave,

694
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,190
send her out of the city.

695
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,400
She is alive?

696
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,190
Yes.

697
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,190
I gave her a pill

698
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,160
to hold her breath for the time being.

699
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,280
She will wake up tomorrow morning.

700
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,280
Wan Qing,

701
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,830
Huang Ziqing is dead.

702
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,470
They won't let you go.

703
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,800
Did he startle

704
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,950
the horse deliberately?

705
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,070
Ask Zan yourself.

706
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,560
Why is it His Lordship?

707
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,400
How is it going, Sanbing?

708
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,800
Don't worry.

709
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,760
Baotang has sent Wan Qing out of the city.

710
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,190
How is His Lordship?

711
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,680
I've got no news.

712
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,040
He didn't want me

713
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,280
to save Huang Ziqing,

714
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,680
so he did that risking his life.

715
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,520
Zan insisted on doing that.

716
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,920
I couldn't stop him.

717
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,800
Huang Ziqing was going

718
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
to impeach Lord Cheng.

719
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,520
No matter how eloquent Zhu Zan is,

720
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm afraid it's hard for him to get out.

721
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,470
Will it threaten his life?

722
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,710
Your Majesty,

723
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Zhu Zan killed my son.

724
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,070
The Zhu family killed my only son.

725
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,310
As I've been

726
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,710
working diligently for the court,

727
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,560
Your Majesty, please help me.

728
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,520
Where is Zhu Zan?

729
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,880
His Lordship

730
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,230
is out of the palace.

731
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,310
Do you want to see him?

732
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,830
No.

733
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,800
Put him into the imperial prison.

734
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,280
Behead him some day

735
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,830
without the joint trial

736
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,560
of three departments.

737
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

738
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,470
Calm down, Your Majesty.

739
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,640
It happened

740
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,280
suddenly.

741
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,350
Both Lord Cheng and Minister Huang are involved.

742
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,230
To avoid discussion of ministers,

743
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,000
it's proper to first

744
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,680
check and verify it.

745
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,760
Huang Cheng has only one son.

746
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,000
What His Lordship did

747
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,160
cuts off their family's blood,

748
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,070
so Huang Cheng will

749
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,310
try to kill His Lordship for sure.

750
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,190
What I fear most is that

751
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,560
Lu Yunqi may help Huang Cheng.

752
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,280
Thus, His Lordship will be doomed.

753
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,600
I'll save Zan

754
00:33:35,469 --> 00:33:36,909
at the cost of my life.

755
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,230
Li Sanbing,

756
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:39,799
calm down.

757
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,429
First try to find out

758
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:44,759
news of His Lordship.

759
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,429
What to check and verify?

760
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:50,839
Your Majesty,

761
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,470
I saw it with my own eyes.

762
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,840
Minister Lu was also there.

763
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,760
He can prove it.

764
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,430
Your Majesty,

765
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,760
I did

766
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,870
see a scared horse

767
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,760
breaking into the crowd

768
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,910
and making

769
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,150
deadly steps on Minister Junior Huang.

770
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,430
And then,

771
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,910
His Lordship appeared

772
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
and subdued the scared horse.

773
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,759
Zhu Zan startled

774
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,909
the horse,

775
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,599
so it stepped on my son.

776
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,910
Your Majesty,

777
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,079
he just retaliated against

778
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,840
my impeachment of Zhu Shan.

779
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,390
You must help me, Your Majesty.

780
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,870
Calm down.

781
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,800
I'll handle it fairly.

782
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,630
Deliver my order.

783
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,560
Put Zhu Zan in the imperial prison

784
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,470
and hit him for 100 times.

785
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:36,470
Yes.

786
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,150
Say it or not?

787
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,320
Hurry up.

788
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,120
Hurry up.

789
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:47,910
Say it.

790
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,870
Continue to beat him.

791
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,320
Say it or not?

792
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,320
I really don't know.

793
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,800
Tell me now.

794
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,630
Ghost Hand,

795
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,120
stop.

796
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,000
A big shot will be sent here later.

797
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,280
His Excellency told us

798
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,280
to take good care of him.

799
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,910
No matter who he is,

800
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,360
it's

801
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,670
the same to me,

802
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,430
just a pile of fresh.

803
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,870
It's different this time.

804
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,800
When, when will he be sent here?

805
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,430
I'm looking forward to it.

806
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,320
The punishment of flogging will end soon.

807
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,040
How many times?

808
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,800
100 times.

809
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,000
That'll

810
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,870
almost kill him.

811
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,080
What can I do?

812
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,150
Perhaps others can't bear that,

813
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,190
but he is extraordinary.

814
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,280
He kept silent at first.

815
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,230
Later when he was badly mutilated,

816
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,040
he just groaned once in a while.

817
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,630
Well,

818
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,670
I look forward to it even more.

819
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,230
His Excellency Lu,

820
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,950
His Lordship seems to fall asleep.

821
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,390
Here is the notorious imperial prison

822
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,870
of Arm Moral Department.

823
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,910
I wish

824
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,950
you can laugh later.

825
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,630
Your Lordship,

826
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,760
I'll

827
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,080
treat you.

828
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,840
May I say no?

829
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,630
No.

830
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,320
Is Dr. Jun here?

831
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,190
His Highness Prince Xian is visiting Dr. Jun.

832
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,430
Twelfth Uncle?

833
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,080
What is he doing here?

834
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,120
Your Highness.

835
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,840
You're Jun Jiuling,

836
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,320
the highly skilled doctor

837
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,190
known in the capital city.

838
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,280
Thank you.

839
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,470
You flattered me.

840
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,760
I don't feel well these days.

841
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,390
The imperial doctors

842
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,840
can't tell why.

843
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
They just asked me to drink

844
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,520
bitter decoction that doesn't work.

845
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,760
As a highly skilled doctor,

846
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,600
how about checking it for me?

847
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,040
Your Highness Prince Xian, please.

848
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,630
I thought no one would come,

849
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,670
but a prince came in the early morning.

850
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,470
Shut up.

851
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,120
The medicine flavor in your drugstore

852
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,950
smells good.

853
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,430
Your Highness, don't worry.

854
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,870
Nothing is wrong with you.

855
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,630
Yes.

856
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,080
Now that you said that,

857
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,470
I'll be relieved.

858
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
However,

859
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,190
though I'm fine,

860
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,190
I wonder if

861
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,280
those in my mansion

862
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,630
are alright.

863
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,320
How about

864
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,950
going to my mansion

865
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,950
to check them?

866
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,950
Anyone who is ill in your mansion

867
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,470
will be treated by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

868
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
He and Zhu Zan are friends.

869
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,600
He must come here

870
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,630
for Zhu Zan.

871
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,840
Dr. Jun?

872
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,080
OK.

873
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,870
I'll collect things

874
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,710
and prepare for it.

875
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,840
Thanks.

876
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,760
Zhu Zan,

877
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,800
if it hurts,

878
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,360
shout loudly.

879
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,630
You can't call me by my name.

880
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,710
You didn't need to kill Huang Ziqing.

881
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,670
Even if they impeach you and your father,

882
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,710
His Majesty may not believe them.

883
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,670
Be careful.

884
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,320
Don't let His Lordship

885
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,470
look down upon Arm Moral Department.

886
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,760
Wait.

887
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,430
Don't be hasty.

888
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,080
I haven't applied medicine yet.

889
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,910
He can't bear it.

890
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,630
He may be beat to death.

891
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,230
Ghost,

892
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
what's the medicine?

893
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,870
Now palace eunuchs

894
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,120
are more and more good at punishing.

895
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,950
Look at the injury.

896
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,360
It's

897
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,600
so beautiful.
