00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

Episode 21

17
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
More than 100 patients have been arranged

18
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,000
in Qingshan Court recently.

19
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,520
By yesterday,

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,960
a dozen of them died

21
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,630
and few of them were cured.

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,000
Clinics nearby the capital city have reported 

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,720
one after another that

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,240
smallpox is prevailing,

25
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,390
causing 

26
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,550
innumerable deaths.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,390
And 

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,470
according to the report of Arm Moral Department,

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Jun Jiuling has tested

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,110
on a few cattle

31
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,470
led to Qingshan Court lately.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,630
Doctors of the Imperial Academy of Medicine didn't hear about such a test,

33
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,720
so they don't know whether it works.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,960
It has been nearly half a month.

35
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,720
There're many discussions from the whole court.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,670
They say Jun Jiuling

37
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,000
can be executed to death

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,960
for her failure in test

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,550
but the delay

40
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,960
causes the spread of smallpox,

41
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,270
which will endanger

42
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,910
the whole capital city.

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,550
We can't wait for a month.

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,550
Send a secret decree to Lu Yunqi that

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,030
I only give Jun Jiuling the last seven days.

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,470
If she can't find the way seven days later,

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,390
ask him to kill her.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,600
Yes,

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,800
Your Majesty.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,320
This is a secret letter I just received.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,830
Miss Jun.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,080
Guo'er.

53
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,160
Wait a moment.

54
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,470
Miss Jun,

55
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,800
you don't wear your veil,

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,720
so I can't approach you.

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,190
Can you approach me now?

58
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,440
Guo'er,

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,390
what's up?

60
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,080
Miss Jun,

61
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
my mom said you're the highly skilled doctor who protects us.

62
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,160
You protect my mom and me,

63
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,549
so surely I should protect you.

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,230
Why do you

65
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,320
come to me so late?

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,480
Where's your mom?

67
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,600
Miss Jun,

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,510
please cure

69
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,270
my mom quickly.

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,790
She has been crying lately.

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,270
She must suffer much pain.

72
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,350
I promise you

73
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,790
I'll let you and your mom

74
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,000
go home healthily,

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,040
OK?

76
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,000
Miss Jun.

77
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,200
Miss Jun.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,950
My mom said it can secure people,

79
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,880
so I give it to you.

80
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,670
Test your new medicine on me.

81
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm very brave.

82
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,320
Thank you, Guo'er.

83
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you know?

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,390
You're the same age

85
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,830
as my brother.

86
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,390
Do you miss him?

87
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,040
Yes.

88
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,600
But 

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,110
we can't go home

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
and get together with our families

91
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,350
until we eliminate smallpox.

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
So

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,110
you should 

94
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,000
receive treatment actively.

95
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,790
Look,

96
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,230
there're fewer smallpox marks on your face.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,160
You may go home soon.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,600
Go back,

99
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,830
or your mom worries about you.

100
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,230
Miss Jun, I'm leaving.

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,160
Miss Jun.

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,070
Miss Jun.

103
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,830
The new prescription has worked.

104
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,390
Our severe patients here

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,200
have shown obvious signs of improvement.

106
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,160
Good.

107
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,550
But there're

108
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,790
more and more new patients

109
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,760
from various places.

110
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,070
I'll try smallpox viruses.

111
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,040
Miss Jun.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,230
Miss Jun,

113
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,510
it's inadmissible.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You should take the general situation into account,

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,390
so you can't take the risk.

116
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,440
To cure patients, Shennong tried hundreds of herbs

117
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,720
and Hua Tuo tried Powder for Anesthesia.

118
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,640
And 

119
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,720
it's my duty to eliminate smallpox.

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,550
We're short of doctors.

121
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,600
Let's 

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
think out other ways.

123
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,950
No need.

124
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,760
I've decided it.

125
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,510
Miss Jun,

126
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,600
think it over.

127
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,230
Jun.

128
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,000
Your Lordship.

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,440
Then I'll leave.

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,000
Go on with your work.

131
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,790
What's the matter?

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,270
I believe

133
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,790
what you said today.

134
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,830
I haven't touched any patients,

135
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,320
so you can test smallpox viruses on me.

136
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,040
No way.

137
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,830
Why?

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,950
Stop joking.

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,350
I'm not sure I can make it.

140
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,160
If there is any error,

141
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,880
you'll die.

142
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,440
I see.

143
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,230
As I said,

144
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,760
if we're doomed to perdition,

145
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,160
I'll be in.

146
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,110
No way, anyhow.

147
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,880
Don't talk with me.

148
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,550
You have something important to do,

149
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,200
but I also want to do something for the people all over the country.

150
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,760
This isn't your…

151
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,510
Let me finish my words.

152
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,880
As the son of Lord Cheng,

153
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,790
I should set an example.

154
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,440
If the test on me turns effective,

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,390
people won't

156
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,390
fear it.

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,040
You save them,

158
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,640
and I appease them.

159
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,760
No.

160
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,790
Listen to me in this matter.

161
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,790
What…

162
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,040
Why are you here?

163
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
At His Majesty's order,

164
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,830
I come to watch here.

165
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,640
Well then, why

166
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,720
are you here?

167
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,160
Did His Majesty

168
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,880
ask you to eavesdrop

169
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,270
outside a girl's room

170
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,110
at night?

171
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,760
The same to you.

172
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,830
You're also running about

173
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,880
at night.

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,550
Your Excellency Lu,

175
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,160
unlike you,

176
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm here to talk

177
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,440
about business with her openly.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,790
Tell me

179
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,270
what your business is.

180
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,670
This is the person that you want.

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,030
The person I want?

182
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,909
You want

183
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,839
to test smallpox viruses on someone.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,670
He can be tested.

185
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,639
Your Excellency, show mercy to me.

186
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,760
Your Excellency, show mercy to me.

187
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,840
Your Excellency, show mercy to me.

188
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,590
It seems

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,230
you're going to show your merit to His Majesty

190
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,320
at the cost of your subordinate's life.

191
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,640
I'm helping you.

192
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,470
Get out of here.

193
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,640
He committed a crime,

194
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
so he'll be put in prison sooner or later.

195
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,080
I just 

196
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,670
advance his punishment time.

197
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,760
Your Excellency Lu,

198
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,590
what crime did he commit?

199
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,400
Dr. Jun,

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
Li Ze stole

201
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,440
all the items of the dead patients

202
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,550
you buried in the backyard

203
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,590
when he was on duty

204
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,960
and wanted to sell them down the hill.

205
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,790
Your Excellency Lu,

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,320
I did that

207
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,550
out of greediness.

208
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,790
Spare me.

209
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,590
Spare…

210
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,150
If 

211
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,790
he sold those items with smallpox viruses

212
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,710
to the capital city,

213
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,440
the consequences would be too ghastly to contemplate.

214
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,880
Isn't it reasonable for me

215
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,350
to let you test on him?

216
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,150
Dr. Jun,

217
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,550
I was wrong.

218
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,320
Dr. Jun.

219
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,550
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

220
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,000
I was wrong.

221
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

222
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,280
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

223
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,200
I was wrong.

224
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,470
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

225
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,080
Your Excellency,

226
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,520
I don't force anyone to be tested.

227
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,080
I only test on those volunteers.

228
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,760
Please leave here.

229
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,000
Since so,

230
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
I don't need to put such a bum

231
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,880
in prison.

232
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,280
Go.

233
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Spare me, Your Excellency.

234
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,910
Spare me.

235
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,470
Your Excellency, spare me.

236
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,590
Good at small tricks,

237
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,640
your subordinates

238
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,670
are really like you.

239
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,790
All of you should be killed.

240
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,520
He's more useful than you.

241
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,760
Why not 

242
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,590
let Dr. Jun test on you?

243
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,350
Your Excellency Lu,

244
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,550
unlike you,

245
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't have so many subordinates,

246
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,000
so I can only volunteer to be tested.

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,670
Your Lordship.

248
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,200
Your Excellency Lu,

249
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,640
do you 

250
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,030
also want to be a volunteer?

251
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,710
Dr. Jun,

252
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,590
you only have the last seven days.

253
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,520
Time is urgent.

254
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,080
You have no choice.

255
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,440
Have you really decided it?

256
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,350
Come on.

257
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
Do you do this for me?

258
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,960
My father has devoted himself to the country all his life.

259
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,230
I've inherited

260
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,080
both his blood and virtues.

261
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,880
As his son,

262
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,150
I don't care about high position and great wealth

263
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
but the people 

264
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,640
all over the country.

265
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,960
People within the capital city are free from the pain of smallpox,

266
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,150
but people outside the capital city

267
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,840
are in peril.

268
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Without a preventive way,

269
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,910
how can I say I'll repay the country?

270
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,790
If you were me,

271
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,790
would you feel relieved?

272
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,840
Come on.

273
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,760
Zhu Zan,

274
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,710
once the smallpox viruses are blown into your body,

275
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,550
I can't control them.

276
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,030
How do

277
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,280
you feel?

278
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I feel a bit thirsty.

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,590
Thirsty?

280
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,000
I'd like to eat this.

281
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,640
Orange?

282
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,440
I'll peel one for you.

283
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Reach out your hand.

284
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,790
♫Outline in my dream♫

285
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,270

I'm fine.

307
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,790
Do you feel hot?

308
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,440
No.

309
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,710
Listen carefully.

310
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,960
Go to sleep

311
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
to build up your energy.

312
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,230
I'll stay here.

313
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,520
Tell me if you feel unwell.

314
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,080
Got it?

315
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,200
Would you like more?

316
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,110
Your Excellency Lu,

317
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,520
I come to reinforce your army by imperial decree.

318
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,670
Act in 

319
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,710
two groups.

320
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,230
Your Excellency,

321
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,520
they said 

322
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
they come to reinforce us.

323
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,760
We won't be spared, will we?

324
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,950
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

339
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,640
Jiuling,

340
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,590
smallpox is terrible.

341
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,280
Luckily, you're a clever girl.

342
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,760
As usual,

343
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,640
you can

344
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,200
eliminate it

345
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,790
and bring those patients back to life.

346
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,110
Miss Jun,

347
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,590
you can get out of the jaws of danger every time.

348
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,950
I'm sure you'll eliminate smallpox this time.

349
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,280
-Go on sleeping. -Miss Jun.

350
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,560
How is he?

351
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,830
I just checked him.

352
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,310
His Lordship has still had a fever.

353
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,110
Luckily, we can see smallpox marks on his body.

354
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,110
Is it

355
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,950
good news?

356
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,760
It's good news

357
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
at present.

358
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,680
Miss Jun,

359
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,760
you're tired to take care of patients and His Lordship

360
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
these days.

361
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,560
Why not go and have a rest?

362
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,350
I stay here.

363
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,350
You haven't slept.

364
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,470
Go to sleep now.

365
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,350
I'll take care of him.

366
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,560
Miss Jun.

367
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,110
Dr. Jun.

368
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:50,950
Dr. Jun.

369
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,070
Dr. Jun.

370
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,040
There's a new patient.

371
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,230
What's wrong?

372
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,430
Her symptoms are out of my knowledge,

373
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,070
so I don't know what to do.

374
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,190
Let us go now.

375
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,560
Don't touch his scabs

376
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,350
when bringing his fever down.

377
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,760
Tell me if he has any problem.

378
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,470
OK, Miss Jun.

379
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,110
Let's go.

380
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,190
Dr. Jun, this way.

381
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,830
Here comes Dr. Jun. Excuse me.

382
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,040
Excuse me.

383
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,830
Dr. Jun,

384
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,070
this new patient

385
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,470
who keeps foaming at the mouth

386
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,190
is different from other patients in symptom.

387
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,560
She suffers from cold diarrhea.

388
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,920
Don't prescribe periostracum cicada for her,

389
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
or her exterior deficiency will worse.

390
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
What can we prescribe then?

391
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,590
We should keep her condition steady first.

392
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,520
Use Radix Aucklandiae Powder.

393
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
Mill radix aucklandiae into powder, add a cup of water

394
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,590
and boil it to get four-fifths cup of decoction. Go now.

395
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,520
OK, I'll go.

396
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
First control her condition.

397
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,190
There have been no deaths recently.

398
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,800
Does it mean we've controlled the smallpox?

399
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,830
Don't let down guard.

400
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,920
Strengthen the monitoring for all patients.

401
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,310
Yes,

402
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,470
I'm Jun Jiuling.

403
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,160
Here is your prescription.

404
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,160
You 

405
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,800
never dreamed about her, right?

406
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,310
Who are you actually?

407
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,950
Your Excellency,

408
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,310
it's the deadline tomorrow.

409
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,520
I've prepared

410
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
oil wood for ignition.

411
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,310
You can leave.

412
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,560
Yes.

413
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,280
Dr. Feng,

414
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,070
add some ginseng and angelica sinensis

415
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,230
to his Neituo Powder

416
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,350
so that more pus in his smallpox

417
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,230
will be discharged.

418
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,760
Thanks for your help today.

419
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,310
Miss Jun.

420
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,040
Miss Jun.

421
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,800
His Lordship's condition aggravates.

422
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,590
Go and have a check.

423
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,920
Please take care of here for me.

424
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,470
OK.

425
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,470
Zhu Zan.

426
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,710
Zhu Zan.

427
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,560
What happened?

428
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
He was well.

429
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,560
But he has felt pain suddenly.

430
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,160
His smallpox viruses haven't been fully discharged.

431
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,160
What does it show?

432
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,800
They're still in his body.

433
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,070
Will His Lordship die?

434
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,160
It depends on him.

435
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,920
He has to fight alone.

436
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,160
Zhu Zan.

437
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,430
Zhu Zan.

438
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,000
Your Lordship.

439
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,830
Zhu Zan.

440
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,680
Zhu Zan.

441
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,430
Zhu Zan.

442
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,590
Your Lordship.

443
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,800
Miss Jun.

444
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Miss Jun, what will you do?

445
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,110
Miss Jun.

446
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,280
Zhu Zan.

447
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,000
Zhu Zan.

448
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm beside you.

449
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,950
You promised me

450
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,920
you would save the people all over the country

451
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,800
after you overcame smallpox viruses.

452
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,430
You promised me

453
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,470
you would stay with me this time.

454
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,560
You can't go back

455
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,760
on your word promise.

456
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
Zhu Zan.

457
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,520
Jiuling.

458
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Jiuling.

459
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,920
I'm here.

460
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,680
Ling Jiu.

461
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,470
Ling Jiu.

462
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,070
I'm here.

Ling Jiu, promise me

to be safe.

507
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,350
You haven't finished

508
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,470
your Map of Capital City.

509
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,560
The bean curd cakes you introduced aren't tasty at all.

510
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,430
And I want to

511
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,560
eat in that rotisserie

512
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,110
we went to last time.

513
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,470
I'm waiting for you to take me there.

514
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,710
I still have many places to go with you.

515
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,800
I have a lot of words to tell you.

516
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,280
I thought I feared nothing

517
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,880
after narrowly escaping death.

518
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,470
But I'm

519
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,590
very afraid now.

520
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.

521
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,800
Do you know?

522
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,280
As long as you can come to yourself,

523
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,800
I'll listen to you in everything.

524
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,110
Ling Jiu,

525
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,040
promise me

526
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,830
to come to yourself soon

527
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,920
and tough it out.

528
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,350
I still have lots of words to tell you.

529
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,070
Sorry 

530
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,070
to keep you waiting for so long.

531
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,590
I see everything you have done for me.

532
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,280
If you can come to yourself,

533
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,470
I will tell you everything,

534
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,800
okay?

535
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,400
In Zezhou,

536
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,830
you saved me

537
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,070
from a startled horse.

538
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,110
At Jinyun Restaurant,

539
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,950
you saved me

540
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,190
and helped me get rid of the assassin.

541
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,350
At the cliff side of Runan,

542
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,880
you saved me.

543
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,280
When Yuan Bao was nearly spotting me,

544
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,680
you saved me again.

545
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,710
You saved me

546
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,950
when Lu Yunqi made trouble in my drugstore.

547
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,280
Zhu Zan,

548
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,000
you've saved me many times.

549
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,590
Let me save you this time.

550
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,280
Let me save you this time,

551
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
okay?

552
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,310
Ling…

553
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:53,880
Zhu…

554
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,590
Zhu Zan.

555
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,160
Zhu Zan.

556
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,880
You finally came to yourself.

557
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,800
All your smallpox viruses are discharged.

558
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,190
All your smallpox viruses are discharged.

559
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,470
When I was asleep,

560
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,070
you must have often pushed my clothes aside

561
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,560
to check my body.

562
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,710
You're doing this with ease.

563
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,160
Did you hear all that I said?

564
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,880
I don't know.

565
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,710
I had a nightmare,

566
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,880
in which I saw

567
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,520
Jiuling in the big fire.

568
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
She must 

569
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,920
hurt a lot

570
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,560
at that moment.

571
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,680
Let me wet the towel for you.

572
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,830
Your Excellency Lu.

573
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,520
Chu Jiuling,

574
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,160
you're back.

575
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,950
I don't know what you're talking about.

576
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,710
Surely you know it.

577
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,350
Do you believe reincarnation?

578
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,680
No.

579
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,310
But I believe it.

580
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,400
You're Chu Jiuling.

581
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,160
I'm Jun Jiuling.

582
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,470
Chu Jiuling,

583
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,350
why don't you dare to admit your identity?

584
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't know what you mean.

585
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,110
You've long known it.

586
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,950
You're still alive,

587
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,800
aren't you?

588
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,920
You ignore your duties.

589
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,430
Aren't you afraid His Majesty punishes you?

590
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,400
Is it important?

591
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,040
I just care about you.

592
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,920
It has nothing to do with me.

593
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,190
I'm not the one you're looking for.

594
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm boiling medicinal materials.

595
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,310
Please don't bother me.

596
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,430
Did Zhu Zan name you Jiuling?

597
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,880
When he was in a coma,

598
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,920
did you admit it?

599
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,950
You ignore your duties

600
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,470
and even like to eavesdrop.

601
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,590
Yes,

602
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,280
I did

603
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
admit it.

604
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,430
Even if I'm not Chu Jiuling,

605
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,520
it's forgivable for me

606
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,830
to admit it as he risks his life 

607
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,920
trying smallpox viruses for people.

608
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
You came here from afar

609
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,230
to open Jiuling Drugstore.

610
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,760
I threatened you to change the name by force many times,

611
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,830
but you refused.

612
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,310
The characters on your prescription

613
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,710
are the same as hers in style.

614
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,590
When I was in the Mansion of Prince Huai,

615
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,880
you seemed more worried

616
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,640
than Her Highness Princess of Jiuli.

617
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,520
Don't try to hide it.

618
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm fed up with guess.

619
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,190
Your Excellency Lu,

620
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,190
all is your delusional speculation.

621
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,310
I'm not Chu Jiuling.

622
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,110
I don't need to explain

623
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,000
whatever I do to you.

624
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,470
You can cheat others,

625
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,230
but you can't cheat me.

626
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,230
How can you

627
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,040
let me go?

628
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,520
I won't let you go

629
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,400
this life.

630
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,160
I know you're obsessed with her,

631
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,070
but she's gone.

632
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,950
Anyhow,

633
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,560
she must dislike the way you treat me.

634
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,950
Your Excellency Lu,

635
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,920
be realistic.

636
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Did you fall in love with someone?

637
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,310
Zhu Zan actually survived

638
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,590
from the smallpox viruses test.

639
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,710
Is it

640
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,590
good news?

641
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,710
I'm

642
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,800
slow-witted.

643
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,000
Your Majesty,

644
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,920
I follow

645
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,230
your idea

646
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,520
in this matter.

647
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,190
They eliminate smallpox

648
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,520
and save many people.

649
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,920
Surely it's good news.

650
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,110
Thank God.

651
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,560
Zhu Zan did a deed of great merit.

652
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,880
If I reward him generously,

653
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,920
what will Lord Cheng do?

654
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,680
According to His Lordship's character,

655
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,640
he'll refuse it

656
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,950
and say it's Zhu Zan's duty.

657
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,430
Though he is a military officer,

658
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,880
few people are as sensible as him

659
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
in the court.

660
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,710
Throughout the ages,

661
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,230
there have been few military officers

662
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,350
with excellent combat achievements

663
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,760
and widespread fame.

664
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,950
Clever as His Lordship is,

665
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,430
only you can see him through.

666
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,310
Your Majesty,

667
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,350
you're the most sensible person 

668
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,350
in the world.

669
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,160
Such people

670
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,160
are the most terrible.

671
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,880
Dr. Jun.

672
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,520
Thank you.

673
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,830
Dr. Jun,

674
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,710
check the ratio of medicinal materials on this prescription.

675
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,190
Is it that prescription we discussed yesterday?

676
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,800
It's workable.

677
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,560
Dr. Jun,

678
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,230
check whether this prescription

679
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,310
lacks any medicinal materials.

680
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,190
Add two more qian of ginseng and angelica sinensis.

681
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,070
Go to handle it.

682
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,230
OK, next.

683
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,040
Take it.

684
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,430
Take it.

685
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,280
Be careful not to burn yourself. Thanks.

686
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,560
Please line up one after another.

687
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,920
Why are you here?

688
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Without a veil, you should go back now.

689
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,160
You…

690
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,110
I tried smallpox viruses.

691
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,230
Do you forget it?

692
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,230
Yes.

693
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,830
How do you feel?

694
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,800
I feel much better.

695
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,560
You haven't slept for several nights.

696
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,950
Thank you.

697
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,430
We're in public.

698
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,000
Don't do this.

699
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,950
I'm checking your smallpox.

700
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,880
Don't misunderstand.

701
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,400
You've recovered obviously.

702
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
It seems this prescription is effective.

703
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,640
So did we make it?

704
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,160
Not exactly.

705
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,830
I still need kid volunteers.

706
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,710
Will you also let kids try smallpox viruses?

707
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,430
Yes.

708
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,910
Please do me a favor later.

709
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,230
It's my pleasure.

710
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,080
His Lordship's smallpox

711
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,230
is less dangerous

712
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,280
and terrible.

713
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,430
Remember

714
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,870
to take bright

715
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,670
and big smallpox marks

716
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,760
as samples.

717
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,080
Bright smallpox marks.

718
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,520
I see.

719
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,560
Big smallpox marks.

720
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,600
Then

721
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:28,869
please take samples

722
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,600
from His Lordship.

723
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,710
OK.

724
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,190
OK.

725
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,520
Don't worry.

726
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,840
Come on.

727
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,520
Come on.

728
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:39,999
Everyone,

729
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
please be gentle.

730
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,800
Don't be afraid.

731
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,870
-Don't worry. -It doesn't hurt at all.

732
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,390
It doesn't hurt at all.

733
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:45,869
Come on.

734
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,320
Come on.

735
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,950
Jun.

736
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,470
Jun.

737
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,390
Your Majesty.

738
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,430
His Lordship Zhu wants to present himself to you.

739
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,280
What?

740
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,280
Why is he here?

741
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,710
He may bring smallpox here.

742
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,870
Who asked him here?

743
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,080
It's bold for Lu Yunqi

744
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,150
to neglect his duties

745
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,190
and let him out without authorization.

746
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,390
Those guards outside

747
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,190
are also a bunch of bums.

748
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,470
I don't see him.

749
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,190
Let him go.

750
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,040
Your Majesty,

751
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,710
he said

752
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,670
what you worry about

753
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,560
won't happen.

754
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,280
He comes to discuss something important with you.

755
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,230
It's 

756
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,870
about the criminal official Zhou Bentang.

757
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,390
Let him in.

758
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,470
Yes.

759
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,470
Those guards

760
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,430
are so thoughtless.

761
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,000
Your Lordship,

762
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,000
just say here.

763
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,040
Your Majesty,

764
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,950
I already overcame smallpox viruses,

765
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,280
so I won't be infected with

766
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,870
or spread smallpox.

767
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,800
Come in.

768
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes.

769
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,670
Your Lordship, never mind.

770
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,910
The smallpox

771
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,950
is really terrible.

772
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,870
Did you survive

773
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,710
from smallpox viruses?

774
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,190
It's really good news.

775
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:56,910
Zhu Zan,

776
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,040
you've done a deed of great merit.

777
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,630
It's not

778
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,950
my merit,

779
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,630
but Dr. Jun's.

780
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,430
I'll 

781
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,870
reward both of you.

782
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,360
Your Majesty,

783
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,190
I don't come to ask for reward.

784
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,950
I have something to bother you.

785
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,670
Please allow me

786
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,870
to take away Zhou Bentang's descendants.

787
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,600
Why?

788
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,430
Let them try smallpox viruses

789
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,360
in Qingshan Court.

790
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,600
The kids of the Zhou family…

791
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,760
They did commit 

792
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,040
the capital crime of betraying our country.

793
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,710
If you take out

794
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,800
their descendants,

795
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,710
they have 

796
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,630
the hope to survive.

797
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,360
Your Majesty, you're insightful.

798
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,080
I do so to find a way to eliminate smallpox

799
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,190
rather than out of selfish motives.

800
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,390
Didn't you survive from smallpox viruses?

801
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,600
Your Majesty,

802
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,080
yes, I did.

803
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,600
But it's a successful test on the adult.

804
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,710
There are physical differences between kids and adults,

805
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,760
so the dosage and treatment vary.

806
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,670
So, 

807
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,560
we still need to make a test.

808
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,320
There're many condemned prisoners.

809
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,150
You may choose two.

810
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,600
Why do you

811
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,190
choose kids of the Zhou family?

812
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,190
Your Majesty,

813
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,600
Dr. Jun said

814
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,080
she needs

815
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,520
kid volunteers under 10 this time.

816
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,630
In the dead cell,

817
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,840
only Zhou Bentang's descendants

818
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,040
are qualified.

819
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,000
Your Lordship,

820
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,150
it's easy.

821
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Buy two kids

822
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,600
on the border market.

823
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,470
Your Majesty,

824
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,760
it's unfeasible.

825
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,080
The kids on the border market

826
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,520
are healthy.

827
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,710
If we're censured by people

828
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,800
due to failure,

829
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,280
it'll affect Your Majesty's fame.

830
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,710
Descendants of the Zhou family are doomed to be executed to death.

831
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,670
It's more meaningful

832
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,760
to let them die

833
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,040
for the smallpox viruses test.

834
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,080
It's you who go to buy kids from the border market.

835
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,430
It won't affect His Majesty's fame.

836
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,390
Stop arguing.

837
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,710
It isn't a big deal.

838
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,840
I agree

839
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,320
to your request.

840
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,040
As long as you can eliminate smallpox,

841
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,710
more kids will be saved.

842
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,190
Go and lead them.

843
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

844
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,280
I'll

845
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,430
leave.

846
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,280
Miss Jun,

847
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,150
this is the prescription of restorative medicinal materials

848
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,040
I prepare as you ordered.

849
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,430
Come.

850
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,040
Look.

851
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,320
It's feasible.

852
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,390
Prepare more.

853
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,080
OK.

854
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,600
Go.

855
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,230
He who left Qingshan Court without authorization

856
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:29,910
has to be killed

857
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,430
for disobedience to the imperial decree.

858
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,230
Your Excellency Lu, what brings you here?

859
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,390
You know it.

860
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm discussing

861
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,470
with them in the hall,

862
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,390
so I don't know.

863
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,150
OK.

864
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,150
Call Zhu Zan out.

865
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,560
I have something to ask him.

866
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,080
Since you want to see His Lordship,

867
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,150
go and find him.

868
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,120
Why do you come to ask me?

869
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,040
Won't you

870
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,150
call him out?

871
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,430
So did

872
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,190
we make it?

873
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,080
Not exactly.

874
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,840
I still need kid volunteers.

875
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,560
Will you also let kids try smallpox viruses?

876
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,430
Does 

877
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,710
he go to find kid volunteers?

878
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,150
Since you all help Zhu Zan,

879
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,120
you'll be executed to death

880
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,760
due to disobedience to the imperial decree.
