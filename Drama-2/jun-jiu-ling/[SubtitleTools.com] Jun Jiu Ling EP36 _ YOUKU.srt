00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:15,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 36

17
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,390
Is he going to send

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
Tianyou to Beiqi?

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,270
Your Majesty,

20
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,630
since Lord Cheng returned to the capital city,

21
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,080
I've received many memorials

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,550
from officials in the North.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,000
They put pressure on the court

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,000
and ignored the government officials' orders.

25
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,270
Earl of Qinghe can do nothing in the North.

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,600
Officials agree outwardly but disagree inwardly.

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,520
Your Majesty,

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
as long as Lord Cheng is still there,

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,750
the border will never be peaceful.

30
00:01:59,390 --> 00:01:59,880
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,240
please remove Lord Cheng

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,470
from the military service

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,550
and punish him

34
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,600
for his abuse of power

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,550
and action without authorization.

36
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,110
Agreed.

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,830
Agreed.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,550
Your Majesty,

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,630
please make a final decision.

40
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,800
We can't make presumptuous speculations.

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,720
God knows

42
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,960
my loyalty

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,830
to Your Majesty

44
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,440
and the court.

45
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,390
I don't want to explain today.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
I just

47
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,190
have a request.

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,830
I'm old

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,110
and suffer from dull pain

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
because of the injuries

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,390
in this battle,

52
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,270
so I hope Your Majesty

53
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,360
can agree to my resignation

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,520
from my military post.

55
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,670
Well,

56
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,270
you share

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,750
the same idea with me.

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,550
I know

59
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,000
you've fought outside throughout the year

60
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,440
and worked for the nation with great merits.

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,390
You also suffer from injuries.

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,880
Well,

63
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,550
recuperate

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,790
from them

65
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,950
in the capital city.

66
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,670
Take care of yourself.

68
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,790
I wish you get well soon.

69
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,350
Your Majesty,

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,550
if the court still needs me,

71
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,950
I'll

72
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,480
shrink from no sacrifice.

73
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,550
Lord Cheng resigned from the post?

74
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,440
To be exact,

75
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,950
he was actually demobilized.

76
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,000
To save his face,

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
His Majesty didn't fire him directly.

78
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,040
Lord Cheng must

79
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,200
have his own consideration.

80
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,550
He gets nothing

81
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,270
but an empty title.

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,670
All his powers were deprived.

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,320
Lord Cheng is a minister of high position.

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,920
By rights, he should at least take a post with very little to do,

85
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,830
but His Majesty

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,720
deprived all his powers.

87
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,720
His Majesty wants to tell the public

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,510
Lord Cheng's resignation

89
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,720
isn't a normal resignation

90
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,230
but punishment.

91
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,110
There're many discussions on the streets.

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
People say Lord Cheng is greedy for combat achievements

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,230
and eager to provoke a battle between our state and Beiqi

94
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,160
to force His Majesty

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,270
to return his military power to him,

96
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,640
and His Majesty had to

97
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,230
dismiss him in disguise.

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,110
I'll go and meet Lord Cheng.

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,350
Miss Jun.

100
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,200
Jiuling.

101
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,230
I was about to meet you.

102
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,950
How is your father?

103
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,880
After resignation, he feels carefree

104
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,880
and relaxed.

105
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,230
Will you leave?

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,070
They'll leave.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,230
Won't you leave?

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,600
No,

109
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,320
I'll stay to protect you.

110
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,390
Zhu Zan,

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,550
though your father handed over his military power,

112
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
His Majesty and Huang Cheng

113
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,640
won't let him go.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
It's vital for you

115
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,200
to escort your father and mother

116
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,510
to leave safely.

117
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,200
Easy.

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm fine.

119
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,830
I don't revenge

120
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,200
rashly.

121
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,200
Jiuling.

122
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,510
Father, mother.

123
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,070
Your Grace.

124
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,350
Miss Jun,

125
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,270
don't worry about me.

126
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,550
I had long thought of this day.

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,320
You leave your credit to me,

128
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,440
which will give a handle to others.

129
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,510
You deserve it.

130
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,600
And they aim at me

131
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,320
and my credit

132
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,600
can't be erased.

133
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,830
But His Majesty

134
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,040
is weakening your reputation.

135
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,000
If you

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
leave your credit to me now,

137
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,390
I'm afraid…

138
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,390
Never mind.

139
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,160
I'd rather you accept the credit.

140
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,350
I'm afraid His Majesty

141
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,350
won't let me enjoy it for long.

142
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,720
It's long enough for you

143
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,270
to complete your matter.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,830
With some reputation,

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,070
you can become more popular

146
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,230
and do something greater.

147
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
You're a doctor

148
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,510
who cures the sickness and saves the patient.

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,230
Even if His Majesty dislikes you,

150
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,200
he can't go against

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,640
the will of the people in the end.

152
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,230
Miss Jun,

153
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,790
some people from the imperial palace went to Jiuling Drugstore,

154
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,440
saying Her Majesty Empress wants to see you.

155
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,600
Shopkeeper Chen's carriage is waiting outside.

156
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,950
Okay, I see.

157
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,350
Yes.

158
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,070
Your

159
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,110
Graces,

160
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,440
see you.

161
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,920
May you a safe journey.

162
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,230
We'll leave first.

163
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,790
Jiuling,

164
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,350
promise me something.

165
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,080
Just say.

166
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,230
Don't act as impulsively

167
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,710
as you did last time.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
Now I know

169
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,840
it's the most important to live.

170
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
If I live, there'll be more chances.

171
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,910
After narrowly

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
escaping death,

173
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,470
I won't act impulsively again.

174
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,080
Slowly.

175
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,710
Miss Jun,

176
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,590
please go.

177
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,640
I'm waiting for you here.

178
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,710
OK.

179
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:08,850
Danfengmen

180
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,840
We're urgently summoned to the imperial palace again by His Majesty

181
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,840
after the morning court session just ended.

182
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,840
Perhaps something big will happen.

183
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,230
This hypocritical emperor

184
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,960
finally shows his true face.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,470
He stabilizes his throne

186
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,670
and eliminates dissidents,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
so he don't have scruples

188
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
or need to pretend to be benevolent.

189
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,590
Childe Ning,

190
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,550
protect yourself.

191
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,590
It's good for Lord Cheng

192
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
to resign at the height of his prosperity.

193
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,030
I worry his concessions

194
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,910
may drive himself to desperation.

195
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,110
Jiu Ling,

196
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,400
you've closely related to Lord Cheng,

197
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,840
so you should be more careful.

198
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,520
Everyone wants to protect himself

199
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,790
in the chaotic court.

200
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,670
I admire your courage

201
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
to fight in the court.

202
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,550
I should lose no time

203
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,110
pacifying the popular feelings in the crisis.

204
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Loyal ministers are bitterly disappointed

205
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,110
and treacherous ones are in power,

206
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,030
leading to the unstable state situation

207
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,080
and disturbed life of the people.

208
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,670
I'll try my best

209
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,640
to save the people and our state

210
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,350
from falling into danger.

211
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,000
Your Majesty,

212
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,150
please

213
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,670
punish Zhu Shan

214
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,840
for his treason.

215
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,790
What?

216
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,150
Minister Huang,

217
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,280
don't make irresponsible remarks

218
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,350
before obtaining evidence.

219
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,200
Your Majesty,

220
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,550
I have evidence.

221
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,520
After Zhu Shan left the North,

222
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
officers and soldiers there

223
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,320
have been no longer oppressed by him,

224
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,440
so they submit their memorials

225
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,790
to report his evil deeds one after another.

226
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,440
I know it.

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,670
There were

228
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,350
many memorials

229
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,960
about his impeachment.

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,550
Your Majesty,

231
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,000
the past impeachments

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,110
were launched

233
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,440
by the civil officials in the North,

234
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,790
while this one

235
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,320
it's launched by officers and soldiers there.

236
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,670
I

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
didn't want to report to Your Majesty

238
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,880
because I didn't believe

239
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,590
he's so bold

240
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,840
and Your Majesty

241
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,590
was rewarding him generously.

242
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,030
So I investigated him

243
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
in private,

244
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,470
only to find

245
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,000
more and more his evil deeds have emerged.

246
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,670
He is so rampant

247
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,960
that he even wants to provoke the battle between our state and Beiqi.

248
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,640
I

249
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
don't dare to conceal it.

250
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,320
No, no, no.

251
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,470
Lord Cheng

252
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,440
is a military officer favored by the late emperor.

253
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,790
He's of noble character and high prestige.

254
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't believe

255
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,640
he could do such a thing.

256
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,230
Your Majesty,

257
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,790
I have the evidence of his crime.

258
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,150
Please read it.

259
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,440
Your Majesty,

260
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,710
this is a letter

261
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,710
between him and the Crown Prince of Beiqi.

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,790
It can prove

263
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,470
his crime of colluding with the enemy state

264
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,550
and rebelling against our state.

265
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,880
Jiuling is in the imperial palace.

266
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,960
As the future daughter-in-law of His Grace,

267
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,150
will she be implicated?

268
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,670
That's incredible.

269
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,000
How bold

270
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,400
Zhu Shan is.

271
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,910
I request

272
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,710
to capture Zhu Shan immediately.

273
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,550
I request

274
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,840
to capture Zhu Shan immediately.

275
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,520
There's nothing serious with Her Majesty.

276
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,840
Take good care of her.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,230
Thank you, Dr. Jun.

278
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,960
Huixin,

279
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,550
Her Majesty wants to see you.

280
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,350
Go with me now.

281
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,440
Dr. Jun,

282
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I'll go to report on completion.

283
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,350
Go ahead.

284
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,350
I know the way to leave the imperial palace.

285
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,110
Chu Jiuling,

286
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,670
how do you like your revisit?

287
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

288
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:01,870
Danfengmen

289
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,790
What happened?

290
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,760
Miss Jun.

291
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,310
Danfengmen

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,710
Minister Ning,

293
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,000
where will you go

294
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,400
in a hurry?

295
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,350
Minister Huang, stop kidding.

296
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,230
Surely I'll go to the Imperial Academy.

297
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:47,230
Danfengmen

298
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,070
Lord Cheng's Mansion

299
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,080
Your Excellency,

300
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,640
there's no one inside.

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,470
Go chase them.

302
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,280
Go chase them.

303
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,910
Lord Cheng's Mansion

304
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,030
Lord Cheng's Mansion
24
00:26:57,000 --> 00:02:09,190
Danfengmen

305
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,760
You finally came to yourself.

306
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,310
Where is this?

307
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,640
This is our marital room.

308
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,070
Help.

309
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,350
Help.

310
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,160
Is there anyone?

311
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,310
Help.

312
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,760
Help.

313
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,800
Help.

314
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,280
Don't shout in vain.

315
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,920
I locked the doors and windows.

316
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,760
Jiuling,

317
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,110
do you know

318
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,950
I feel as if I were in a dream

319
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,040
during the over one year when you left me?

320
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:20,640
It's

321
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,520
our wedding day today.

322
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,710
And

323
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,560
I've prepared a wedding dress for you.

324
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,110
It's the same

325
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,520
as that you wore when we got married that day.

326
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,470
Do you like it?

327
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,470
You're such a madman.

328
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,760
Madman?

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm just a madman.

330
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,310
I only love you, forever and ever.

331
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,040
I am just crazy about you alone.

332
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,000
I just love you.

333
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,350
Don't come over.

334
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,560
Okay.

335
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,350
I won't come to you.

336
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,160
Jiuling,

337
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,190
why are you so indifferent to me?

338
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Wearing a different face,

339
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,230
you don't know me?

340
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,280
Can you accept me

341
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,000
as long as I release you?

342
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,800
You're so cruel.

343
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,430
You stand before me

344
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,640
with a different face.

345
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,880
Lu Yunqi,

346
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,190
we're always enemies.

347
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,920
Both of us know it clearly.

348
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,350
Don't be self-sentimental.

349
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,230
Do you blame me

350
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,880
for not saving you

351
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,520
when you

352
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,230
tried to assassinate His Majesty?

353
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
I did that to protect you,

354
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,920
-or… -Don't come over.

355
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,680
No.

356
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,350
No. No. No.

357
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,520
You aren't her incarnation.

358
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,190
You're just her.

359
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,760
Jiuling,

360
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,680
-you're back. -What a madman.

361
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,640
-Don't come over. -Jiuling.

362
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,190
-Don't come over. -You're back.

363
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,560
You're back.

364
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,830
-Don't come over. -You're back.

365
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,280
Don't come to me.

366
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:58,950
Okay.

367
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,560
I won't come to you.

368
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,760
Do you know?

369
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,230
His Majesty has suspected you.

370
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,880
You're safe with me.

371
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,280
Only I can protect you.

372
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,920
Chu Rang is

373
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,230
everything to you.

374
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,400
Just kill me now.

375
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,040
You're everything to me.

376
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,640
You are my beloved girl

377
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,110
and my dead wife.

378
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,350
I don't kill you.

379
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,920
Don't you

380
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,000
like the atmosphere here?

381
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,560
Do you dislike here?

382
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,040
It doesn't matter.

383
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
If you dislike here,

384
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,280
we can go anywhere

385
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,070
you like.

386
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,070
You're crazy.

387
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,000
To please you,

388
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,190
-I can go to the ends of the earth with you. -You're crazy.

389
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,560
If you dislike here,

390
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,470
-I can take you to other places. -Don't come over.

391
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,160
Give me this.

392
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,230
Don't come over.

393
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,000
Jiuling.

394
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,070
I'm not mad.

395
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,280
I'm not mad.

396
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
Even if I get mad,

397
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,760
I still love you.

398
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,230
How long do you want to lock me here?

399
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,280
No,

400
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,000
I do this to protect you.

401
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,160
See what I prepared for you.

402
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,070
I tried hard to restore the scene

403
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,760
when we got married that day.

404
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,070
Do you dislike that scene?

405
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,590
Never mind.

406
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,640
I'll design it

407
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,190
according to the atmosphere in the Mansion of Prince Huai

408
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,040
as you're familiar with there.

409
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,230
I'll take you to the ends of the earth.

410
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,680
As long as I can be with you,

411
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,000
I'd like to go to the ends of the earth.

412
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,640
Jiuling.

413
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,950
Jiuling.

414
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,070
Okay.

415
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,190
Okay.

416
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,710
I don't come to you.

417
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,310
I don't come to you.

418
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,110
I just stay here.

419
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,760
I just stay here.

420
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
I just stay here with you.

421
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,710
Halt.

422
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,070
Halt.

423
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,640
Your Grace,

424
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,400
please go back to the capital city with me.

425
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,640
Whose order?

426
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,040
His Majesty's.

427
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,190
Please receive your punishment

428
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,110
in the capital city.

429
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,760
Receive my punishment?

430
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,680
What crime?

431
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,800
Treason.

432
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,590
Treason?

433
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,950
We've worked for the court for a dozen years.

434
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,800
How can you trump up

435
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,560
our treason?

436
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,190
Zan.

437
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,160
Father.

438
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,760
Will we go back?

439
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,680
I've wielded

440
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,640
this sword, red with blood,

441
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,310
for most of my life,

442
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,680
but I've always used it

443
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,880
to kill those invaders of Beiqi.

444
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,000
I've been driven into an impasse.

445
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,400
I just want to keep my fame.

446
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,590
If you're driven into an impasse,

447
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,190
do you want to be humiliated?

448
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,400
I only use my sword to kill the enemy

449
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,920
rather than our own men.

450
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,800
If you force me hard,

451
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,830
I'd rather die

452
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,350
than be humiliated in the capital city.

453
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,640
Your Grace,

454
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,830
do you know

455
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,950
what your leaving means?

456
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,110
It means I'll become

457
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,800
a traitor as you say.

458
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,310
Yes.

459
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,110
It means you flee to escape punishment.

460
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,710
It means

461
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,230
your treason is confirmed.

462
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,520
Your Grace,

463
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,160
you'll lose your military prestige,

464
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,350
be cast aside by the people

465
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,070
and erase

466
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,230
your military exploits of a dozen years.

467
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,310
I've protected the nation and the people most of my life.

468
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,520
I don't do that to gain high official positions and riches.

469
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,470
Your Grace,

470
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,350
since you're frank and selfless,

471
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,280
please go back to the capital city with me and make it public to the people.

472
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
Please don't escape.

473
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,640
People hate traitors to the marrow.

474
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,400
In my lifetime,

475
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,110
I hate disloyal, unfaithful

476
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,590
and disobedient people most.

477
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,880
Unexpectedly, I become

478
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,350
a traitor today.

479
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,230
But do you really believe

480
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
I am

481
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,830
a traitor?

482
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,920
I've fought for the safety of Tianyou

483
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,710
most of the life.

484
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,640
I've gone through fire and water

485
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,640
and braved untold danger numerous times,

486
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,350
hoping our people

487
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
can have a rich and healthy life.

488
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,880
I am forced to leave the capital city

489
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,800
and accept

490
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,640
the infamy of traitor.

491
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,560
God

492
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,160
and I know

493
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,560
whether I am

494
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,710
a loyal minister

495
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,310
or a traitor.

496
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,590
I have a clear conscience.

497
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,110
Your Grace,

498
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,880
if you can go back with me,

499
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
I'll try my best

500
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,950
to speak for you before His Majesty.

501
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,710
Don't choose this wrong way.

502
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,920
I've decided

503
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,040
to hold on

504
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,400
to this way.

505
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Our safety today

506
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,430
all attributes to Your Grace's credit.

507
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,470
Your Grace, may you be safe throughout the journey.

508
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,950
Make way.

509
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,190
Miss Jun.

510
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,280
Miss Jun.

511
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,280
Chen Qi.

512
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,070
Have you got

513
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,190
Miss Jun's news?

514
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,590
I asked several people in private.

515
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,760
They all said

516
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,590
Miss Jun had left

517
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,950
from the south gate at about 4 p.m.

518
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,760
Impossible.

519
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,680
She knows I'm waiting for her here.

520
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,040
If she didn't come here,

521
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,470
she would ask someone to tell me.

522
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,190
She wouldn't ask me

523
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,110
to keep waiting for her here.

524
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,040
Is it because

525
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,160
she had something urgent to deal with

526
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,000
and didn't

527
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,310
have time to tell us in advance?

528
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,680
We worried about her the whole night

529
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,400
as she didn't come back in time

530
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,760
and slept outside last time

531
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,590
when she went to collect herbs

532
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,800
outside the city for young master.

533
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
From that time, she has kept telling us

534
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
her whereabouts.

535
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,520
How could this be possible?

536
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,070
Well…

537
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,880
Look

538
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,560
around.

539
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,280
She may come back to meet you.

540
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,310
Go and check her information.

541
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,430
OK.

542
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,160
Shopkeeper Liu.

543
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,680
Um.

544
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,040
Shopkeeper Liu,

545
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
It's inconvenient for me to talk to you at the gate of the imperial palace,

546
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,110
so I call you here.

547
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,350
Your Excellency Ning, what's the matter?

548
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,350
Is Jiuling missing?

549
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
How do you know it?

550
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,310
When I left the imperial palace,

551
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,680
I saw Chen Qi waiting anxiously.

552
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,160
After going back, I couldn't rest assured,

553
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,760
so I asked my servant to inquire at the gate of the imperial palace.

554
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,400
Seeing you're still waiting there,

555
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,640
I know there must be something wrong.

556
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,190
Your Excellency Ning,

557
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,040
to be honest,

558
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,640
Miss Jun is indeed missing.

559
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm put in a quandary now.

560
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,430
Can you

561
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,070
find a chance to go to the imperial palace

562
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,640
and help us inquire about her information?

563
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,590
No need.

564
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,640
I know where she is.

565
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,110
It must be related

566
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,160
to Lu Yunqi.

567
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,280
His Excellency Lu?

568
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,710
What shall we do?

569
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,920
His Grace isn't in the capital city,

570
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,280
so no one can go to save her.

571
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,310
Well…

572
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,070
Shopkeeper Liu,

573
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,680
relax.

574
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,160
I'll ask him about her tomorrow.

575
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,280
Let's talk about it after that.

576
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,400
Thank you, Your Excellency Ning.

577
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,520
I'm sorry

578
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,880
for my previous poor attitude to you.

579
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,040
Shopkeeper Liu,

580
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,800
forget it.

581
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,590
It's just a play

582
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,560
agreed by Jiuling and me.

583
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,350
Without doubt,

584
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,710
I still need to keep away from her

585
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,000
before others.

586
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,350
If there is any news about her,

587
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,710
I'll ask my servant to tell you.

588
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,040
Ok.

589
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,800
I'll go back and wait for your news.

590
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,680
Shopkeeper Liu, see you.

591
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,590
Wanton.

592
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,640
Your Majesty, please calm down.

593
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,070
I believed him firmly

594
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,070
and rewarded him generously.

595
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,760
Did I treat him badly?

596
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,000
How could he betray me?

597
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,400
Your Majesty,

598
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,230
Zhu Shan has long planned to revolt.

599
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,310
Please don't

600
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,520
show mercy to him.

601
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,920
Please order

602
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,760
to capture him at once

603
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,310
and kill him on the spot.

604
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,280
Agreed.

605
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,280
Did you take her away?

606
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,190
Minister Lu,

607
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,310
it's improper.

608
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,920
Lord Cheng disobeyed His Majesty's decree and escaped,

609
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,430
confirming his treason.

610
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,950
She disappeared

611
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,070
all of a sudden.

612
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,470
In your opinion, what does His Majesty think?

613
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,160
Is this a threat?

614
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,640
No.

615
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Listen up.

616
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,110
Don't meddle

617
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,710
in our matter.

618
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,310
Minister Lu,

619
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,950
I know you don't hurt her.

620
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,760
Now that you love her,

621
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,920
why not

622
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
let her be happy?

623
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,590
It's just

624
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,800
your idea.

625
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,110
This is a note

626
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,160
Mr. Ning asked his servant to send to us.

627
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
Lu Yunqi did hide Miss Jun.

628
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,800
I'll go to save her

629
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,680
in Arm Moral Department.

630
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,950
Chen Qi,

631
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,640
calm down.

632
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,520
There's no use in going now.

633
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,680
Be cool.

634
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,590
Then what shall we do?

635
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
We can make public Miss Jun's news

636
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,590
and pressurize him by the public opinion.

637
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,160
It was feasible before,

638
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,280
but we can't use it now.

639
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,640
Lord Cheng's treason

640
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,560
is confirmed,

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,560
which

642
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,000
will be made public soon.

643
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,230
Consequently,

644
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,880
Lord Cheng will be slandered by people.

645
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,280
Miss Jun

646
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,000
is closely related to their family.

647
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,230
I'm afraid some ill-intentioned people

648
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,760
may make an issue of

649
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,070
her disappearance.

650
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,640
By then,

651
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,590
it's harder to save her.

652
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,000
All

653
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,800
can't work.

654
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,110
What shall we do now?

655
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
We can just wait.

656
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,920
Luckily,

657
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,760
Miss Jun is fallen into the hand of Lu Yunqi

658
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,950
rather than His Majesty.

659
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,280
Well,

660
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,400
is there any difference?

661
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,040
His Excellency Lu works for His Majesty.

662
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,760
He has a deep obsession with Jiuling,

663
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,110
so he doesn't

664
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,470
hurt her,

665
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,640
but the demon may kill her.

666
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,400
Dr. Jun.

667
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,880
Is Dr. Jun here?

668
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,590
No.

669
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,000
Didn't she just come back?

670
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,880
My master asked me to invite her,

671
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,350
but why isn't she here?

672
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,430
She has something to deal with in Zezhou,

673
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,520
so she hasn't come back.

674
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,350
When can she come back?

675
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,350
I don't know.

676
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,640
How about

677
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,110
you go to another drugstore?

678
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,040
Terribly sorry.

679
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,880
Okay.

680
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,160
I can't

681
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,680
keep lying to them.

682
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,470
How is Jinxiu in Zezhou?

683
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,680
Your Lordship.

684
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,590
Liu'er.

685
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,040
Your Lordship.

686
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,640
Don't shout.

687
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,190
Chen Qi.

688
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,350
I'm looking for Her Lordship.

689
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,110
Why are you so anxious?

690
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,470
Go to the back yard with me.

691
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,430
I'll tell you slowly.

692
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,830
Go.

693
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,680
Have a look.

694
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,520
Minister Lu.

695
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,040
Minister Lu.

696
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,070
Will you go home

697
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,160
or go to Arm Moral Department?

698
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,590
Minister Lu.

699
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,190
Guess what

700
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,830
they're thinking.

701
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,880
They're probably thinking that

702
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm quite bold.

703
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,560
Minister Lu,

704
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,760
can I see her?

705
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,150
Jiuling,

706
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,800
sorry.

707
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,870
I come late.

708
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,430
You must be hungry.

709
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,910
I remember

710
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,800
you liked

711
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,120
the food of Cao's Restaurant.

712
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,710
You said their food is tasty last time,

713
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,190
so I specially bought you some.

714
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,280
Have a taste.

715
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,470
Let me out.

716
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,280
They open late

717
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
in the morning.

718
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,630
I'm afraid

719
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,910
they couldn't make tasty food

720
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,280
if I urged them,

721
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,230
so I waited

722
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,320
for a long time.

723
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,520
Are you hungry?

724
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,670
Come on.

725
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,080
Have a bite.

726
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,870
It's tasty.

727
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,230
I know

728
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,150
you want to know the information of Lord Cheng.

729
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,470
He has been convicted of treason by His Majesty.

730
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,910
He'll be sentenced to death

731
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,520
when taken back to the capital city.

732
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,910
Treason?

733
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,800
It's impossible.

734
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,670
Nothing is impossible.

735
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,120
After he dies,

736
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,560
this won't be important.

737
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,320
Lord Cheng can no longer

738
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,280
monopolize the North.

739
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,470
It's His Majesty

740
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,080
who controls the whole state.

741
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,150
The North doesn't belong to him

742
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,150
but the people in the state.

743
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,150
That's not important.

744
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,710
Their competition

745
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,320
has nothing to do with us.

746
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,040
Have a bite,

747
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,080
or it'll get cold

748
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,910
and taste bad.

749
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,760
Let me out.

750
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,560
Have a bite.

751
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,630
Have a bite and then we can talk about it.

752
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,870
Jiuling,

753
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,150
I'm your husband.

754
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,190
Just call me Yunqi.

755
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,390
You can't win my heart.

756
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,870
You make me sick.

757
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,870
It doesn't matter.

758
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,870
Anyhow,

759
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,870
I'm your family, right?

760
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,120
I can protect you.

761
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,520
I'll secure you in the future.

762
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,600
Go out.

763
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,840
You become thin.

764
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,280
Eat some.

765
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,910
Have a shrimp,

766
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,760
okay?

767
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Go out, okay?

768
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,000
Calm down.

769
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,760
By the way,

770
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,560
to protect you,

771
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,150
people of Jiuling Drugstore

772
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,040
tell others you're in Zezhou.

773
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,320
Today,

774
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,000
Ning Yunzhao

775
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,950
asked me

776
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
whether he could come to see you.

777
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,520
How funny.

778
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,630
I know

779
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,520
he likes you.

780
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,280
And he

781
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,280
likes

782
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,630
both your appearance

783
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,280
and your soul.

784
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,320
As expected,

785
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,630
he, a scholar,

786
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,630
is more insightful than me.

787
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,430
Get out.

788
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,360
You can't find his whereabouts.

789
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,840
Does he demonically vanish?

790
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,150
Your Majesty,

791
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,320
being a minister for several decades,

792
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,840
Lord Cheng has had many friends.

793
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,120
Many people

794
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,800
have covered him

795
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,670
all the way,

796
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,120
so he can escape smoothly.

797
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,320
Go check

798
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,470
who helped him in private.

799
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,630
Your Majesty, don't worry.

800
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,430
Minister Lu

801
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,470
will capture him

802
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,870
sooner or later.

803
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,360
Your Majesty,

804
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,710
our men found his whereabouts

805
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,230
nearby Malüe Pass the last time.

806
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,320
He should head for Baozhou.

807
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,520
The North?

808
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,000
How dare he go to the North?

809
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,320
Will he go to bite the hook?

810
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,080
Your Majesty,

811
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,040
I'll go and inform His Grace Earl of Qinghe.

812
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,320
Minister Huang,

813
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,320
you can leave.

814
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:40,950
Yes.

815
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,080
Have you

816
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,670
completed the task?

817
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,630
Because of the division of Deshengchang,

818
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,670
Jun Jiuling

819
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,120
has returned to Zezhou.

820
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,080
I

821
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,430
have ordered Jin Shiba to go there.

822
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,000
The Fang family failed,

823
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,000
and the Zhu family lost their power.

824
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,470
This is a great chance.

825
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,190
You can't miss it.

826
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,470
I got it.

827
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,880
