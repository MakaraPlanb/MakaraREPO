00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12

♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 21

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
More than 100 patients have been arranged

18
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,000
in Qingshan Court recently.

19
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,520
By yesterday,

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,960
a dozen of them died

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,630
and few of them were cured.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,000
Clinics nearby the capital city have reported

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,720
one after another that

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,240
smallpox is prevailing,

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,390
causing

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,550
innumerable deaths.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,390
And

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,470
according to the report of Arm Moral Department,

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,800
Jun Jiuling has tested

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,110
on a few cattle

31
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,470
led to Qingshan Court lately.

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,630
Doctors of the Imperial Academy of Medicine didn't hear about such a test,

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,720
so they don't know whether it works.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,960
It has been nearly half a month.

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,720
There're many discussions from the whole court.

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,670
They say Jun Jiuling

37
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,000
can be executed to death

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,960
for her failure in test

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,550
but the delay

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,960
causes the spread of smallpox,

41
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,270
which will endanger

42
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,910
the whole capital city.

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,550
We can't wait for a month.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,550
Send a secret decree to Lu Yunqi that

45
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,030
I only give Jun Jiuling the last seven days.

46
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,470
If she can't find the way seven days later,

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,390
ask him to kill her.

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,600
Yes,

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Your Majesty.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,320
This is a secret letter I just received.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,830
Miss Jun.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,080
Guo'er.

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,160
Wait a moment.

54
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,470
Miss Jun,

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,800
you don't wear your veil,

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,720
so I can't approach you.

57
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,190
Can you approach me now?

58
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,440
Guo'er,

59
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,390
what's up?

60
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,080
Miss Jun,

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
my mom said you're the highly skilled doctor who protects us.

62
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,160
You protect my mom and me,

63
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,549
so surely I should protect you.

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,230
Why do you

65
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,320
come to me so late?

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,480
Where's your mom?

67
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,600
Miss Jun,

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,510
please cure

69
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,270
my mom quickly.

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,790
She has been crying lately.

71
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,270
She must suffer much pain.

72
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,350
I promise you

73
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,790
I'll let you and your mom

74
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,000
go home healthily,

75
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,040
OK?

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,000
Miss Jun.

77
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,200
Miss Jun.

78
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,950
My mom said it can secure people,

79
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,880
so I give it to you.

80
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,670
Test your new medicine on me.

81
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm very brave.

82
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,320
Thank you, Guo'er.

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you know?

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,390
You're the same age

85
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,830
as my brother.

86
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,390
Do you miss him?

87
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,040
Yes.

88
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,600
But

89
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,110
we can't go home

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,040
and get together with our families

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,350
until we eliminate smallpox.

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
So

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,110
you should

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,000
receive treatment actively.

95
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,790
Look,

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,230
there're fewer smallpox marks on your face.

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
You may go home soon.

98
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,600
Go back,

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,830
or your mom worries about you.

100
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,230
Miss Jun, I'm leaving.

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,160
Miss Jun.

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,070
Miss Jun.

103
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,830
The new prescription has worked.

104
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,390
Our severe patients here

105
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,200
have shown obvious signs of improvement.

106
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,160
Good.

107
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,550
But there're

108
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,790
more and more new patients

109
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,760
from various places.

110
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,070
I'll try smallpox viruses.

111
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,040
Miss Jun.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,230
Miss Jun,

113
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,510
it's inadmissible.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You should take the general situation into account,

115
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,390
so you can't take the risk.

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,440
To cure patients, Shennong tried hundreds of herbs

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
and Hua Tuo tried Powder for Anesthesia.

118
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,640
And

119
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,720
it's my duty to eliminate smallpox.

120
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,550
We're short of doctors.

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,600
Let's

122
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,600
think out other ways.

123
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,950
No need.

124
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,760
I've decided it.

125
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,510
Miss Jun,

126
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,600
think it over.

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,230
Jun.

128
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,000
Your Lordship.

129
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,440
Then I'll leave.

130
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,000
Go on with your work.

131
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,790
What's the matter?

132
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,270
I believe

133
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,790
what you said today.

134
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,830
I haven't touched any patients,

135
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
so you can test smallpox viruses on me.

136
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,040
No way.

137
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,830
Why?

138
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,950
Stop joking.

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,350
I'm not sure I can make it.

140
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,160
If there is any error,

141
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
you'll die.

142
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,440
I see.

143
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,230
As I said,

144
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,760
if we're doomed to perdition,

145
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,160
I'll be in.

146
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,110
No way, anyhow.

147
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,880
Don't talk with me.

148
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,550
You have something important to do,

149
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,200
but I also want to do something for the people all over the country.

150
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,760
This isn't your…

151
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,510
Let me finish my words.

152
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,880
As the son of Lord Cheng,

153
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,790
I should set an example.

154
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,440
If the test on me turns effective,

155
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,390
people won't

156
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,390
fear it.

157
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,040
You save them,

158
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,640
and I appease them.

159
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,760
No.

160
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,790
Listen to me in this matter.

161
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,790
What…

162
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,040
Why are you here?

163
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
At His Majesty's order,

164
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,830
I come to watch here.

165
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,640
Well then, why

166
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,720
are you here?

167
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,160
Did His Majesty

168
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,880
ask you to eavesdrop

169
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,270
outside a girl's room

170
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,110
at night?

171
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,760
The same to you.

172
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,830
You're also running about

173
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,880
at night.

174
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,550
Your Excellency Lu,

175
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,160
unlike you,

176
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm here to talk

177
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,440
about business with her openly.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,790
Tell me

179
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,270
what your business is.

180
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,670
This is the person that you want.

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,030
The person I want?

182
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,909
You want

183
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,839
to test smallpox viruses on someone.

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,670
He can be tested.

185
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:04,639
Your Excellency, show mercy to me.

186
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,760
Your Excellency, show mercy to me.

187
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,840
Your Excellency, show mercy to me.

188
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,590
It seems

189
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,230
you're going to show your merit to His Majesty

190
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,320
at the cost of your subordinate's life.

191
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,640
I'm helping you.

192
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,470
Get out of here.

193
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,640
He committed a crime,

194
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
so he'll be put in prison sooner or later.

195
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,080
I just

196
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,670
advance his punishment time.

197
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,760
Your Excellency Lu,

198
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,590
what crime did he commit?

199
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,400
Dr. Jun,

200
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,200
Li Ze stole

201
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,440
all the items of the dead patients

202
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,550
you buried in the backyard

203
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,590
when he was on duty

204
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,960
and wanted to sell them down the hill.

205
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,790
Your Excellency Lu,

206
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,320
I did that

207
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,550
out of greediness.

208
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,790
Spare me.

209
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,590
Spare…

210
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,150
If

211
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,790
he sold those items with smallpox viruses

212
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,710
to the capital city,

213
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,440
the consequences would be too ghastly to contemplate.

214
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,880
Isn't it reasonable for me

215
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,350
to let you test on him?

216
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,150
Dr. Jun,

217
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,550
I was wrong.

218
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,320
Dr. Jun.

219
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,550
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

220
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,000
I was wrong.

221
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

222
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,280
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

223
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,200
I was wrong.

224
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,470
I was wrong, Dr. Jun.

225
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,080
Your Excellency,

226
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,520
I don't force anyone to be tested.

227
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,080
I only test on those volunteers.

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,760
Please leave here.

229
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,000
Since so,

230
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
I don't need to put such a bum

231
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,880
in prison.

232
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,280
Go.

233
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Spare me, Your Excellency.

234
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,910
Spare me.

235
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,470
Your Excellency, spare me.

236
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,590
Good at small tricks,

237
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,640
your subordinates

238
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,670
are really like you.

239
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,790
All of you should be killed.

240
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,520
He's more useful than you.

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Why not

242
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,590
let Dr. Jun test on you?

243
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,350
Your Excellency Lu,

244
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,550
unlike you,

245
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't have so many subordinates,

246
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,000
so I can only volunteer to be tested.

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,670
Your Lordship.

248
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,200
Your Excellency Lu,

249
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,640
do you

250
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,030
also want to be a volunteer?

251
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,710
Dr. Jun,

252
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,590
you only have the last seven days.

253
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,520
Time is urgent.

254
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,080
You have no choice.

255
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,440
Have you really decided it?

256
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,350
Come on.

257
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,200
Do you do this for me?

258
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,960
My father has devoted himself to the country all his life.

259
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,230
I've inherited

260
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,080
both his blood and virtues.

261
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,880
As his son,

262
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,150
I don't care about high position and great wealth

263
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,440
but the people

264
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,640
all over the country.

265
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,960
People within the capital city are free from the pain of smallpox,

266
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,150
but people outside the capital city

267
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,840
are in peril.

268
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Without a preventive way,

269
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,910
how can I say I'll repay the country?

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,790
If you were me,

271
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,790
would you feel relieved?

272
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,840
Come on.

273
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,760
Zhu Zan,

274
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,710
once the smallpox viruses are blown into your body,

275
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,550
I can't control them.

276
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,030
How do

277
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,280
you feel?

278
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I feel a bit thirsty.

279
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,590
Thirsty?

280
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,000
I'd like to eat this.

281
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
Orange?

282
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,440
I'll peel one for you.

283
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Reach out your hand.

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,590
you can get out of the jaws of danger every time.

346
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,950
I'm sure you'll eliminate smallpox this time.

347
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,280
-Go on sleeping. -Miss Jun.

348
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,560
How is he?

349
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,830
I just checked him.

350
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:54,310
His Lordship has still had a fever.

351
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,110
Luckily, we can see smallpox marks on his body.

352
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,110
Is it

353
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,950
good news?

354
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,760
It's good news

355
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
at present.

356
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,680
Miss Jun,

357
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,760
you're tired to take care of patients and His Lordship

358
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
these days.

359
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,560
Why not go and have a rest?

360
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,350
I stay here.

361
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,350
You haven't slept.

362
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,470
Go to sleep now.

363
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,350
I'll take care of him.

364
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,560
Miss Jun.

365
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,110
Dr. Jun.

366
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:15,950
Dr. Jun.

367
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,070
Dr. Jun.

368
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,040
There's a new patient.

369
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,230
What's wrong?

370
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,430
Her symptoms are out of my knowledge,

371
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,070
so I don't know what to do.

372
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,190
Let us go now.

373
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,560
Don't touch his scabs

374
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,350
when bringing his fever down.

375
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,760
Tell me if he has any problem.

376
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,470
OK, Miss Jun.

377
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,110
Let's go.

378
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,190
Dr. Jun, this way.

379
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,830
Here comes Dr. Jun. Excuse me.

380
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,040
Excuse me.

381
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,830
Dr. Jun,

382
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,070
this new patient

383
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,470
who keeps foaming at the mouth

384
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,190
is different from other patients in symptom.

385
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,560
She suffers from cold diarrhea.

386
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,920
Don't prescribe periostracum cicada for her,

387
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
or her exterior deficiency will worse.

388
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
What can we prescribe then?

389
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,590
We should keep her condition steady first.

390
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,520
Use Radix Aucklandiae Powder.

391
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,640
Mill radix aucklandiae into powder, add a cup of water

392
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,590
and boil it to get four-fifths cup of decoction. Go now.

393
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,520
OK, I'll go.

394
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,760
First control her condition.

395
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,190
There have been no deaths recently.

396
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,800
Does it mean we've controlled the smallpox?

397
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,830
Don't let down guard.

398
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,920
Strengthen the monitoring for all patients.

399
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,310
Yes,

400
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,470
I'm Jun Jiuling.

401
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,160
Here is your prescription.

402
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,160
You

403
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,800
never dreamed about her, right?

404
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,310
Who are you actually?

405
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,950
Your Excellency,

406
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,310
it's the deadline tomorrow.

407
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,520
I've prepared

408
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
oil wood for ignition.

409
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,310
You can leave.

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,560
Yes.

411
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,280
Dr. Feng,

412
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,070
add some ginseng and angelica sinensis

413
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,230
to his Neituo Powder

414
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,350
so that more pus in his smallpox

415
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,230
will be discharged.

416
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,760
Thanks for your help today.

417
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,310
Miss Jun.

418
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,040
Miss Jun.

419
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,800
His Lordship's condition aggravates.

420
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,590
Go and have a check.

421
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,920
Please take care of here for me.

422
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,470
OK.

423
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,470
Zhu Zan.

424
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,710
Zhu Zan.

425
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
What happened?

426
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
He was well.

427
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,560
But he has felt pain suddenly.

428
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,160
His smallpox viruses haven't been fully discharged.

429
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,160
What does it show?

430
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,800
They're still in his body.

431
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,070
Will His Lordship die?

432
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,160
It depends on him.

433
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,920
He has to fight alone.

434
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,160
Zhu Zan.

435
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,430
Zhu Zan.

436
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,000
Your Lordship.

437
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,830
Zhu Zan.

438
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,680
Zhu Zan.

439
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,430
Zhu Zan.

440
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,590
Your Lordship.

441
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,800
Miss Jun.

442
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Miss Jun, what will you do?

443
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,110
Miss Jun.

444
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,280
Zhu Zan.

445
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,000
Zhu Zan.

446
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,520
I'm beside you.

447
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,950
You promised me

448
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,920
you would save the people all over the country

449
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,800
after you overcame smallpox viruses.

450
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,430
You promised me

451
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,470
you would stay with me this time.

452
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,560
You can't go back

453
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
on your word promise.

454
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,520
Zhu Zan.

455
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,520
Jiuling.

456
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,520
Jiuling in the big fire.

565
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,000
She must

566
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,920
hurt a lot

567
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,560
at that moment.

568
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,680
Let me wet the towel for you.

569
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,830
Your Excellency Lu.

570
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,520
Chu Jiuling,

571
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,160
you're back.

572
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,950
I don't know what you're talking about.

573
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,710
Surely you know it.

574
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,350
Do you believe reincarnation?

575
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,680
No.

576
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,310
But I believe it.

577
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,400
You're Chu Jiuling.

578
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,160
I'm Jun Jiuling.

579
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,470
Chu Jiuling,

580
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,350
why don't you dare to admit your identity?

581
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't know what you mean.

582
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,110
You've long known it.

583
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,950
You're still alive,

584
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:33,800
aren't you?

585
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,920
You ignore your duties.

586
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,430
Aren't you afraid His Majesty punishes you?

587
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,400
Is it important?

588
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,040
I just care about you.

589
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,920
It has nothing to do with me.

590
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,190
I'm not the one you're looking for.

591
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm boiling medicinal materials.

592
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,310
Please don't bother me.

593
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,430
Did Zhu Zan name you Jiuling?

594
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,880
When he was in a coma,

595
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,920
did you admit it?

596
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,950
You ignore your duties

597
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,470
and even like to eavesdrop.

598
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,590
Yes,

599
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,280
I did

600
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
admit it.

601
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,430
Even if I'm not Chu Jiuling,

602
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,520
it's forgivable for me

603
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,830
to admit it as he risks his life

604
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,920
trying smallpox viruses for people.

605
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,280
You came here from afar

606
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,230
to open Jiuling Drugstore.

607
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
I threatened you to change the name by force many times,

608
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,830
but you refused.

609
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,310
The characters on your prescription

610
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,710
are the same as hers in style.

611
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,590
When I was in the Mansion of Prince Huai,

612
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,880
you seemed more worried

613
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,640
than Her Highness Princess of Jiuli.

614
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,520
Don't try to hide it.

615
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
I'm fed up with guess.

616
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,190
Your Excellency Lu,

617
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,190
all is your delusional speculation.

618
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,310
I'm not Chu Jiuling.

619
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,110
I don't need to explain

620
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,000
whatever I do to you.

621
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,470
You can cheat others,

622
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,230
but you can't cheat me.

623
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
How can you

624
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,040
let me go?

625
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,520
I won't let you go

626
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,400
this life.

627
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,160
I know you're obsessed with her,

628
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,070
but she's gone.

629
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,950
Anyhow,

630
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,560
she must dislike the way you treat me.

631
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,950
Your Excellency Lu,

632
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,920
be realistic.

633
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Did you fall in love with someone?

634
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,310
Zhu Zan actually survived

635
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,590
from the smallpox viruses test.

636
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,710
Is it

637
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,590
good news?

638
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,710
I'm

639
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,800
slow-witted.

640
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,000
Your Majesty,

641
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,920
I follow

642
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,230
your idea

643
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,520
in this matter.

644
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,190
They eliminate smallpox

645
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,520
and save many people.

646
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,920
Surely it's good news.

647
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,110
Thank God.

648
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,560
Zhu Zan did a deed of great merit.

649
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,880
If I reward him generously,

650
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,920
what will Lord Cheng do?

651
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,680
According to His Lordship's character,

652
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,640
he'll refuse it

653
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,950
and say it's Zhu Zan's duty.

654
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,430
Though he is a military officer,

655
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,880
few people are as sensible as him

656
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
in the court.

657
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,710
Throughout the ages,

658
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,230
there have been few military officers

659
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,350
with excellent combat achievements

660
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,760
and widespread fame.

661
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,950
Clever as His Lordship is,

662
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,430
only you can see him through.

663
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,310
Your Majesty,

664
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,350
you're the most sensible person

665
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,350
in the world.

666
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,160
Such people

667
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,160
are the most terrible.

668
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:04,880
Dr. Jun.

669
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,520
Thank you.

670
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,830
Dr. Jun,

671
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,710
check the ratio of medicinal materials on this prescription.

672
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,190
Is it that prescription we discussed yesterday?

673
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,800
It's workable.

674
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,560
Dr. Jun,

675
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,230
check whether this prescription

676
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,310
lacks any medicinal materials.

677
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,190
Add two more qian of ginseng and angelica sinensis.

678
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,070
Go to handle it.

679
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,230
OK, next.

680
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,040
Take it.

681
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,430
Take it.

682
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,280
Be careful not to burn yourself. Thanks.

683
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,560
Please line up one after another.

684
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,920
Why are you here?

685
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,000
Without a veil, you should go back now.

686
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,160
You…

687
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,110
I tried smallpox viruses.

688
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,230
Do you forget it?

689
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,230
Yes.

690
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,830
How do you feel?

691
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,800
I feel much better.

692
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,560
You haven't slept for several nights.

693
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:04,950
Thank you.

694
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,430
We're in public.

695
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,000
Don't do this.

696
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,950
I'm checking your smallpox.

697
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,880
Don't misunderstand.

698
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,400
You've recovered obviously.

699
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,000
It seems this prescription is effective.

700
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,640
So did we make it?

701
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,160
Not exactly.

702
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,830
I still need kid volunteers.

703
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,710
Will you also let kids try smallpox viruses?

704
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,430
Yes.

705
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,910
Please do me a favor later.

706
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,230
It's my pleasure.

707
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,080
His Lordship's smallpox

708
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,230
is less dangerous

709
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,280
and terrible.

710
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,430
Remember

711
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,870
to take bright

712
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,670
and big smallpox marks

713
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,760
as samples.

714
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,080
Bright smallpox marks.

715
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,520
I see.

716
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
Big smallpox marks.

717
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,600
Then

718
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:53,869
please take samples

719
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,600
from His Lordship.

720
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,710
OK.

721
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,190
OK.

722
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,520
Don't worry.

723
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:00,840
Come on.

724
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,520
Come on.

725
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:04,999
Everyone,

726
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,560
please be gentle.

727
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,800
Don't be afraid.

728
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,870
-Don't worry. -It doesn't hurt at all.

729
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,390
It doesn't hurt at all.

730
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:10,869
Come on.

731
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,320
Come on.

732
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,950
Jun.

733
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,470
Jun.

734
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,390
Your Majesty.

735
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,430
His Lordship Zhu wants to present himself to you.

736
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,280
What?

737
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,280
Why is he here?

738
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,710
He may bring smallpox here.

739
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,870
Who asked him here?

740
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,080
It's bold for Lu Yunqi

741
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,150
to neglect his duties

742
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,190
and let him out without authorization.

743
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,390
Those guards outside

744
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,190
are also a bunch of bums.

745
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,470
I don't see him.

746
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,190
Let him go.

747
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,040
Your Majesty,

748
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,710
he said

749
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,670
what you worry about

750
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,560
won't happen.

751
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,280
He comes to discuss something important with you.

752
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,230
It's

753
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,870
about the criminal official Zhou Bentang.

754
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,390
Let him in.

755
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,470
Yes.

756
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,470
Those guards

757
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,430
are so thoughtless.

758
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,000
Your Lordship,

759
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,000
just say here.

760
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,040
Your Majesty,

761
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,950
I already overcame smallpox viruses,

762
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,280
so I won't be infected with

763
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,870
or spread smallpox.

764
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,800
Come in.

765
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:07,800
Yes.

766
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,670
Your Lordship, never mind.

767
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,910
The smallpox

768
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,950
is really terrible.

769
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:13,870
Did you survive

770
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,710
from smallpox viruses?

771
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,190
It's really good news.

772
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,910
Zhu Zan,

773
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,040
you've done a deed of great merit.

774
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,630
It's not

775
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,950
my merit,

776
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,630
but Dr. Jun's.

777
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,430
I'll

778
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,870
reward both of you.

779
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,360
Your Majesty,

780
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,190
I don't come to ask for reward.

781
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,950
I have something to bother you.

782
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,670
Please allow me

783
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,870
to take away Zhou Bentang's descendants.

784
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,600
Why?

785
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,430
Let them try smallpox viruses

786
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,360
in Qingshan Court.

787
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,600
The kids of the Zhou family…

788
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,760
They did commit

789
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,040
the capital crime of betraying our country.

790
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,710
If you take out

791
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,800
their descendants,

792
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,710
they have

793
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,630
the hope to survive.

794
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,360
Your Majesty, you're insightful.

795
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,080
I do so to find a way to eliminate smallpox

796
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,190
rather than out of selfish motives.

797
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,390
Didn't you survive from smallpox viruses?

798
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,600
Your Majesty,

799
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,080
yes, I did.

800
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,600
But it's a successful test on the adult.

801
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,710
There are physical differences between kids and adults,

802
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
so the dosage and treatment vary.

803
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,670
So,

804
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,560
we still need to make a test.

805
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
There're many condemned prisoners.

806
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,150
You may choose two.

807
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,600
Why do you

808
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,190
choose kids of the Zhou family?

809
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,190
Your Majesty,

810
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,600
Dr. Jun said

811
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,080
she needs

812
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,520
kid volunteers under 10 this time.

813
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,630
In the dead cell,

814
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,840
only Zhou Bentang's descendants

815
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,040
are qualified.

816
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,000
Your Lordship,

817
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,150
it's easy.

818
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Buy two kids

819
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,600
on the border market.

820
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,470
Your Majesty,

821
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,760
it's unfeasible.

822
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,080
The kids on the border market

823
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,520
are healthy.

824
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,710
If we're censured by people

825
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,800
due to failure,

826
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,280
it'll affect Your Majesty's fame.

827
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,710
Descendants of the Zhou family are doomed to be executed to death.

828
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,670
It's more meaningful

829
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,760
to let them die

830
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,040
for the smallpox viruses test.

831
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,080
It's you who go to buy kids from the border market.

832
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,430
It won't affect His Majesty's fame.

833
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,390
Stop arguing.

834
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,710
It isn't a big deal.

835
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,840
I agree

836
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,320
to your request.

837
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,040
As long as you can eliminate smallpox,

838
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,710
more kids will be saved.

839
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,190
Go and lead them.

840
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

841
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,280
I'll

842
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,430
leave.

843
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,280
Miss Jun,

844
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,150
this is the prescription of restorative medicinal materials

845
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,040
I prepare as you ordered.

846
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,430
Come.

847
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,040
Look.

848
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,320
It's feasible.

849
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,390
Prepare more.

850
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,080
OK.

851
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,600
Go.

852
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,230
He who left Qingshan Court without authorization

853
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,910
has to be killed

854
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,430
for disobedience to the imperial decree.

855
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,230
Your Excellency Lu, what brings you here?

856
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,390
You know it.

857
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm discussing

858
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,470
with them in the hall,

859
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,390
so I don't know.

860
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,150
OK.

861
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,150
Call Zhu Zan out.

862
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,560
I have something to ask him.

863
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,080
Since you want to see His Lordship,

864
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,150
go and find him.

865
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
Why do you come to ask me?

866
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,040
Won't you

867
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,150
call him out?

868
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,430
So did

869
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,190
we make it?

870
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,080
Not exactly.

871
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,840
I still need kid volunteers.

872
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,560
Will you also let kids try smallpox viruses?

873
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,430
Does

874
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,710
he go to find kid volunteers?

875
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,150
Since you all help Zhu Zan,

876
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,120
you'll be executed to death

877
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,760
due to disobedience to the imperial decree.
