00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 25

17
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,850
Arm Moral Department

18
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:22,470
Li Mansion

19
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,630
Son of Huang Cheng Huang Ziqing

20
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,970
Jiuling Drugstore

21
00:35:53,420 --> 00:02:11,720
Ghost doctor of Arm Moral Department Ghost Hand

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,360
Chengyu,

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,600
why did Childe Ning

24
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,520
help Jiuling?

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,030
I said it just now.

26
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,670
That was Jiuling's idea.

27
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,520
But how about Childe Ning?

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,080
Actually, you also guessed it.

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
You just said

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,550
Jiuling and Childe Ning discussed it.

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,360
However,

32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,960
neither Shopkeeper Liu

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,320
nor Jiuling mentioned that.

34
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,080
So the matter

35
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,830
happened suddenly.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
In this case,

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
they couldn't think carefully.

38
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,880
Perhaps he likes her a bit,

39
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,600
so he made the impulsive decision.

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,750
That's the most reasonable explanation.

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
That's possible.

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,110
Chengyu,

43
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,550
Childe Ning helped Jiuling.

44
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,720
Do you feel happy with that?

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,550
I like her.

46
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,440
With such a person

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,630
who likes her and protects her,

48
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,960
certainly I'm happy.

49
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,670
Even if you aren't that person?

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,550
Even if it isn't me,

51
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,360
as long as she is protected,

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,110
that's fine.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,110
You aren't

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,190
what you used to be.

55
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,470
It's an ordinary day.

56
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,080
Is there a wedding?

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
According to the date,

58
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,000
it should be the congratulations of the No. 1 Scholar.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,670
Congratulations.

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,960
Mrs. Ning

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,190
must be very happy.

62
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,880
Yes.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
It should be congratulated.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,470
It's nothing to be ecstatic about.

65
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,920
The county makes it extravagant.

66
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,509
He is the No. 1 Scholar.

67
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,440
Only one in three years.

68
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,600
It's normal

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,830
to make it lively.

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,200
By the way,

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Yunzhao is old enough to marry.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,510
He said

73
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,070
he wouldn't marry until he passed the exam.

74
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,200
It has been postponed until now.

75
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,920
Mrs. Ning,

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
is there a favorite candidate?

77
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,950
Don't be hasty.

78
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,270
Mrs. Ma.

79
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,830
Congratulations.

80
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,390
Two happy events come at the same time.

81
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,510
Take a seat.

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,390
Mrs. Ma,

83
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,920
only Yunzhao 

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,670
is No. 1 Scholar this year in the Ning family.

85
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,040
How come there are two happy events?

86
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
Haven't you received a family letter

87
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
from the capital city?

88
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,720
I mention it in advance.

89
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,160
Sorry, madam.

90
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,510
Now Childe Ning is No. 1 Scholar

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
and Miss Jun is

92
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,390
known for treating smallpox.

93
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,760
If they get married earlier,

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,720
you can rest assured.

95
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,040
What do you mean?

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,480
Will Jun Zhenzhen marry Yunzhao?

97
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,670
What you said

98
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,440
is a mistake.

99
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,160
There was

100
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,670
an engagement,

101
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,230
but it was broken off.

102
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,760
You don't need to hide it.

103
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,600
The matter of the Fang family has been settled.

104
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,440
No need

105
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,670
to disguise.

106
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,510
The day after the ranking of the imperial examination was released,

107
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,830
Childe Ning said in public

108
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,950
the engagement is still valid.

109
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,000
They agreed to marry

110
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,070
after returning to hometown.

111
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
That's not true.

112
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,230
Yunzhao won't marry her.

113
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,830
Congratulations.

114
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,830
Congratulations. Congratulations.

115
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
Congratulations, No. 1 Scholar.

116
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,760
Please say hello to Miss Jun for us.

117
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,320
After getting married,

118
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,760
will you let Miss Jun continue to work as a doctor?

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,640
Please say hello to Miss Jun for us.

120
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,350
Your Ladyship,

121
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,550
you know as you appear,

122
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,350
they'll kick up a fuss.

123
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,320
Why do you come?

124
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,040
Childe Ning dared to help me out in public,

125
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,070
so I'll support him in the public.

126
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,880
Moreover,

127
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,480
the more people know it,

128
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,760
the more Lu fears it.

129
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,720
No. 1 Scholar.

130
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,880
Zan,

131
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
how do you feel?

132
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,070
What do you want to say?

133
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,550
Pah.

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,350
Great.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,510
You just

136
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,200
made it

137
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,230
very impressive.

138
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,320
You're either affected

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,830
or pretentious.

140
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,040
You don't give blessing or give up.

141
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,670
It's

142
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,550
man's true temperament.

143
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,270
Pah.

144
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,720
They're engaged,

145
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,790
but they haven't got married.

146
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,950
I think Miss Jun is nice to you.

147
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:41,880
Pah.

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,510
Stop.

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,510
I agree with Sanbing.

150
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,790
Pah.

151
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,720
Sanbing,

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,670
why is someone

153
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,790
so abnormal?

154
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
You're too young

155
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,920
to understand that.

156
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,830
I see.

157
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,110
Well.

158
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,270
Go to the point.

159
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,640
Any news?

160
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,480
No prisoner has been

161
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,110
sent secretly to the imperial prison recently.

162
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,880
We searched the capital city,

163
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,230
but we haven't found Wan Qing.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,550
You were hit

165
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,440
because of Dr. Jun, right?

166
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,880
Zhu Zan?

167
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,040
His Lordship?

168
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,000
He fought because you want to 

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,910
marry Dr. Jun.

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,670
I'm sure he likes

171
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,080
Dr. Jun a bit.

172
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,590
Though she has a humble origin,

173
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,550
it doesn't matter.

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,880
Lord Cheng isn't punctilious.

175
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,840
Generally, he doesn't care.

176
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,150
In this case,

177
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,840
Miss Jun

178
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,110
can marry His Lordship.

179
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,080
That's impossible.

180
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,200
Ning Yunzhao said

181
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,230
Jun Jiuling is his fiancée.

182
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,760
Ning Yunzhao?

183
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,230
No. 1 Scholar.

184
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,670
If Dr. Jun can marry him,

185
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,640
that'll be great, too.

186
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,670
That's impossible.

187
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,200
She is such a good girl.

188
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,470
Let her live as she likes.

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,230
Isn't that great?

190
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,550
You like her very much, right?

191
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll let her accompany you every day,

192
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,350
OK?

193
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,790
No.

194
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I don't like her.

195
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,520
She isn't my sister.

196
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,080
My sister

197
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,670
is dead.

198
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,710
Now that she is like the princess,

199
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,880
she should live like the princess.

200
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,470
If she doesn't want that,

201
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,520
since Princess Jiuling is dead,

202
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,960
why can

203
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,080
she still be alive?

204
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,670
Dr. Jun,

205
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,230
what's wrong with my wife?

206
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,400
Don't worry, Your Excellency Wang.

207
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,880
It doesn't matter.

208
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,440
I've applied acupuncture

209
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,400
and prescribed.

210
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,710
She'll recover after a period of nursing.

211
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,790
You need to comfort Mrs. Wang

212
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,760
to let her calm down.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,550
Great.

214
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,910
What you said

215
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
will comfort her best.

216
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,080
Your words work

217
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,000
better than ours.

218
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,670
You flattered me, Your Excellency Wang.

219
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,400
This way, please.

220
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,320
Master.

221
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,670
Oh, no, Master.

222
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,400
Well.

223
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,440
What are you doing?

224
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,200
Wang Lian,

225
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,960
you were accused of corruption.

226
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,960
We were ordered to search your mansion.

227
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,790
Non...

228
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,880
Nonsense.

229
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,670
Do you 

230
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,760
have the search order?

231
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,840
This is enough.

232
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,470
How base!

233
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,640
How base!

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,640
Master,

235
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,280
madam fainted.

236
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,200
Stop.

237
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,080
We're working.

238
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,910
People unrelated should avoid.

239
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm a doctor. Let me save her.

240
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,350
I wonder if you want to save her

241
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,710
or escape with things.

242
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,320
His Excellency Wang

243
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,880
is a popular official,

244
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
but those of Arm Moral Department

245
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
accused him of ganging up for selfish interests.

246
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,200
Why?

247
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,710
They searched his mansion

248
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,350
showing no respect for him at all.

249
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,150
After Scholar Han,

250
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,400
it's His Excellency Wang.

251
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
And both happened

252
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,110
during my consultation.

253
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,000
Do they have anything to do with us?

254
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,440
I think they aim at me.

255
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,910
Is it

256
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,550
the trick of His Excellency Lu?

257
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,710
Liu'er,

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,670
tell them 

259
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,880
to prepare the prescription quickly.

260
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,910
Choose the best

261
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,230
rhizome of lagehead atractylodes and betel nut

262
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,520
and send them to His Excellency Wang

263
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,080
without delay.

264
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,960
I'll meet Lu Yunqi.

265
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,590
OK.

266
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,320
Don't worry.

267
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,320
You refused his proposal,

268
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,590
but you go to meet him.

269
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,320
Is that proper?

270
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,230
I have no time to think about that.

271
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,840
Go now.

272
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,110
OK.

273
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,080
His Excellency Lu.

274
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,710
Finally,

275
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,150
you seem to understand what I mean.

276
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,470
I don't understand.

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,080
What don't you understand?

278
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm embarrassing you.

279
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,760
I don't understand

280
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,590
what you want to do.

281
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,640
I'm engaged.

282
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,550
So what?

283
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,790
I like you

284
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,150
and want to marry you. Is that wrong?

285
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,000
You want me to be

286
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,880
like Third Madame.

287
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,080
No.

288
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,880
You're different.

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,590
You know clearly

290
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,880
we'll never marry.

291
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,840
His Excellency Lu,

292
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,960
remember that

293
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm a doctor,

294
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,350
and it's my duty to heal and the sick and save people.

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,280
If you want to embarrass me,

296
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,640
don't get others involved.

297
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,000
Be careful, Minister Huang.

298
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Mind the threshold.

299
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Who is he?

300
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
His Excellency Junior Huang.

301
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,080
He is His Excellency Junior Huang.

302
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,710
OK.

303
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,710
I remember what you said.

304
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,520
Thank you, Minister Huang.

305
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,200
Working hard day and night for the country,

306
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
you should take more supplements.

307
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,520
I cooked some health soup

308
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,710
in person.

309
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,790
Please taste it.

310
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,590
Soup?

311
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,320
I didn't expect that

312
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,440
you can make soup.

313
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,640
Well,

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
my family was poor when I was young.

315
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,030
And my mom was weak and ill.

316
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,520
I did laundry and cooked by myself

317
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,440
to be barely fed.

318
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,670
Well,

319
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,440
you did work hard.

320
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,200
Minister Huang,

321
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,520
you did work hard.

322
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,640
With a low rank,

323
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,840
I can't share burden with His Majesty,

324
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,150
but I can work for you.

325
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,350
-It's really my... -OK.

326
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,550
I see.

327
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,910
Please take

328
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,150
this health soup.

329
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,280
Please.

330
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,790
The soup

331
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,280
is really nutritious.

332
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,880
OK.

333
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,350
If there is a job opening in the palace later,

334
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,080
I'll make you fill it.

335
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,640
After all,

336
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,590
it must be hard

337
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,640
for you to copy books for so many years

338
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,670
in the Ministry of Official Personnel Affairs.

339
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,230
Yes.

340
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,640
Here you are.

341
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,030
Minister Huang.

342
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,670
Excuse me.

343
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Is that His Excellency Prime Minister Huang?

344
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,760
-Minister Huang, take care. -Young lady,

345
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,200
you just came to the capital city, right?

346
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,350
-See you, Minister Huang. -He isn't His Excellency Prime Minister Huang,

347
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,320
but His Excellency Junior Huang,

348
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,280
the son of Prime Minister Huang.

349
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,320
Get away.

350
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,760
Get away.

351
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,280
Get away.

352
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,080
Get away.

353
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,590
You,

354
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,910
get way.

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,350
Get away.

356
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,640
Get away.

357
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,230
Your Ladyship,

358
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,110
who is he?

359
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,110
He is domineering.

360
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,760
Huang Ziqing, Huang Cheng's son.

361
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,030
It looks lively over there.

362
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,200
Let's go and have a look.

363
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,000
Liu'er,

364
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,470
remember to stay away from him

365
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,590
when you see him.

366
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,320
Why?

367
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,080
Is he more scaring than Lu Yunqi?

368
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,200
Many officials are said to be killed by Arm Moral Department.

369
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,590
Actually, most of them

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,080
were killed by him.

371
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,110
He is so terrible.

372
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,109
Luckily, we don't connect with him,

373
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:05,709
so we won't offend him.

374
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,469
Let's detour.

375
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,520
-I'm sorry. -Sorry.

376
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,159
Young lady,

377
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,830
your flowers.

378
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,640
Your flowers.

379
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,349
Isn't she Wan Qing,

380
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,069
the granddaughter of Wan Dachun?

381
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,559
Why does she look so strange?

382
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,430
Let's have a look.

383
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,880
There are so many people today.

384
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,640
The mansion of Minister Huang...

385
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,190
Minister Huang.

386
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,280
Minister Junior Huang.

387
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,920
Minister Junior Huang.

388
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,350
Minister Tang, you look hasty.

389
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,350
What's wrong?

390
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,400
The memorial to the throne from the office of imperial censors to impeach Lord Cheng

391
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,760
was stopped by Minister He again.

392
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,560
People tend to be stubborn

393
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,520
when getting old.

394
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,710
Yes.

395
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
He even said

396
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,560
we are stupid to impeach Lord Cheng

397
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,430
for colluding with Beiqi.

398
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,830
He said the censor

399
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,190
reported mechanically

400
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,560
without any reasons.

401
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,110
How can

402
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,800
he say that?

403
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Indeed.

404
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,590
Many people have heard

405
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,400
the news from the North.

406
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,310
He is suspicious anyway.

407
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,520
Well.

408
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,040
Give me the memorial.

409
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,110
I'll report to my father.

410
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,160
His Majesty will decide

411
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,000
whether it's stupid or funny.

412
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,070
We can't

413
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,280
do that for His Majesty.

414
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,640
Do you think so,

415
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,310
Minister Tang?

416
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,830
Yes.

417
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,680
Yes.

418
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,640
Take it here.

419
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,230
So many memorials.

420
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,110
Well,

421
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,040
if just one

422
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
or two people have impeached him,

423
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,880
it's possible that

424
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,920
they want to frame him up.

425
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,760
However,

426
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,710
as so many people have impeached him,

427
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,070
it's...

428
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,760
Thank you, Minister Junior Huang.

429
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,640
It's my duty to share the burden

430
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,000
with His Majesty.

431
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,040
See you.

432
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,800
Excuse me.

433
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,560
Excuse me. Excuse me.

434
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,070
She has followed all the way.

435
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,040
Is she going to assassinate Huang Ziqing?

436
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,400
She has little chance of winning.

437
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a dead end.

438
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,350
She is so young.

439
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,590
She shouldn't die casually.

440
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,000
Young Master,

441
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,760
only Commander Lu hasn't arrived yet.

442
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,760
Let's start dinner

443
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,920
without him.

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,560
Rubbish.

445
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,920
Young lady,

446
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,160
raise your head and let me have a look.

447
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,110
-Young Master. -She killed him.

448
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,760
Young Master.

449
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,590
She killed him.

450
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,590
Young Master.

451
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,000
What are you doing?

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Call Old Master.

453
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,310
Young Master.

454
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,800
Hold on, Young Master.

455
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,400
Stop.

456
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,040
The knife is in his chest now.

457
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,280
If you pull it out now,

458
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,470
he'll die.

459
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,470
Well.

460
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,000
So Young Master...

461
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,310
Young Master.

462
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,920
Young Master.

463
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,520
Well.

464
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,830
Son.

465
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,160
Ziqing.

466
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,830
-Old Master. -Ziqing.

467
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,470
Young Master is...

468
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,880
Ziqing.

469
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,950
Who are you?

470
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,430
Wan Qing,

471
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,040
the granddaughter of Wan Dachun of the Ministry of Works.

472
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Kill me.

473
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,640
He killed all my family members,

474
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
so I killed him.

475
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,190
Damn it.

476
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,110
You brat,

477
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,800
how can you be tricked by her?

478
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,950
Imperial doctor,

479
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,950
save him.

480
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,640
Hurry up.

481
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,830
Minister Huang,

482
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,590
I can save him if other parts are cut.

483
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
However, his heart is cut.

484
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,470
Once the knife is pulled out,

485
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,590
he'll

486
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,160
surely die.

487
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,710
You must find a way.

488
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,000
Imperial doctor,

489
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,560
he is my only son.

490
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,590
You must find a way.

491
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,110
As long as you can save him,

492
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,070
I'll guarantee you a life of wealth and rank.

493
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,520
I can't.

494
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,920
Please forgive me.

495
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,190
What should we do?

496
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,710
Young Master. Young Master.

497
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,190
Ziqing.

498
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,160
Young Master.

499
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,350
Son.

500
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,000
My son.

501
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,830
Grandparents,

502
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,830
have you heard it?

503
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,430
Have you seen it?

504
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
I avenged you.

505
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,470
Finally I avenged

506
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,310
you.

507
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,800
Damn Huang Ziqing

508
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,880
is dead.

509
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,710
I avenged.

510
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,040
My wish has been fulfilled.

511
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,640
It's a great blessing

512
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,230
to die innocently

513
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,830
and happily.

514
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,000
It's a pity that

515
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,430
I can't see the day when you're vindicated.

516
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,800
Minister Huang,

517
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,280
perhaps there is a doctor who can save your son.

518
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,560
Who?

519
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,160
Who can?

520
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Dr. Jun of Jiuling Drugstore said

521
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,000
she can cure

522
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,760
what we can't.

523
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,000
She is

524
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,230
here now.

525
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,710
Where?

526
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,230
Where is she?

527
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,430
Yeah.

528
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,000
Over there.

529
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,830
Dr. Jun,

530
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,590
can you save him?

531
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,760
Don't save him.

532
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,040
Please.

533
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,040
Don't save him.

534
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,000
Minister Junior Huang is dying.

535
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,430
If Dr. Jun can save him,

536
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,920
she can bring people back from death.

537
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,710
Miss Jun,

538
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
I've just kneeled to

539
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,430
heaven, earth, sovereign, parents and teacher.

540
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,640
No.

541
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,590
Today,

542
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,070
I kneel to you.

543
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,310
Please.

544
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,400
Save my son.

545
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,310
He is

546
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,400
my only son.

547
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,640
No.

548
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,760
We're late.

549
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,950
Don't save him.

550
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,760
Why is she here?

551
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,950
Miss Jun.

552
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,430
Dr. Jun,

553
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,000
can you save him?

554
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,710
Tell us.

555
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,590
We're waiting for you.

556
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,800
Don't save him. Please.

557
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,350
Please.

558
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,070
Please.

559
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,710
Don't save him.

560
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,470
Miss Jun.

561
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,680
Don't save him.

562
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,280
Please.

563
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,430
No.

564
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,710
No.

565
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,880
Miss Jun.

566
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,070
Don't save him. Please.

567
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,470
No.

568
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,640
No.

569
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,920
Miss Jun,

570
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,000
save my son.

571
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,710
I can.

572
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,590
Young Master.

573
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,760
You'll be saved, Young Master.

574
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,350
-Yes. -Young Master.

575
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,590
Why do you save him?

576
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,800
No.

577
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,590
No.

578
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,400
No.

579
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,280
Please. No.

580
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,680
No.

581
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,190
Don't save him.

582
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,830
No.

583
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,680
Please. Don't save him.

584
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,190
Miss Jun is going to save Huang Ziqing.

585
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,710
What do you want to do?

586
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,350
I'll stop her.

587
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,560
If she saves him,

588
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,680
she'll be criticized.

589
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,800
If he is saved,

590
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,920
he'll kill more people.

591
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,160
Have you thought clearly?

592
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,190
Huang Cheng targets Lord Cheng.

593
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,000
Once you stand up,

594
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,830
there will be hell to pay.

595
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,590
Zan, calm down.

596
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,400
Wait here.

597
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,110
Zan.

598
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:41,920
Wait here.

599
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,000
Son,

600
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,590
Miss Jun will save you.

601
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,070
He is a murder.

602
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
If you save him,

603
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,760
he'll kill more people.

604
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,070
You're an accomplice in murder.

605
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,000
He is a murderer.

606
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,430
You're an accomplice in murder.

607
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,280
Your Ladyship.

608
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,760
Get away. Get away.

609
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,430
Old Master.

610
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,190
It's dangerous.

611
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,400
Son.

612
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,160
Son.

613
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,470
-Young Master. -Punishment.

614
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,760
It serves you right, corrupt official.

615
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,830
Son.

616
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,520
Young Master.

617
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,350
Young Master.

618
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,350
Minister Huang, my condolences.

619
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,230
Wan Qing is dead.

620
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,160
A life for a life.

621
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,800
Is her life as valuable

622
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,430
as that of my son?

623
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,760
Miss Jun,

624
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,920
you can bring a patient back to life, right?

625
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,310
You can bring a patient back to life, right?

626
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,160
She isn't King of Hell.

627
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,000
Must she bring all patients back to life?

628
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,560
His Excellency Huang,

629
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,230
none of us

630
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,950
wants to see that.

631
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,560
My condolences.

632
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,000
Zhu Zan.

633
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,710
Zhu Zan.

634
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,520
You killed my son.

635
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,920
Don't pretend to be innocent.

636
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,160
You scared the horse.

637
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,800
You killed my son.

638
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,920
You killed my son.

639
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,560
What are you doing?

640
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,950
Go.

641
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,920
Go.

642
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,760
Stop.

643
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,830
His Majesty ordered

644
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,280
to arrest him.

645
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,680
-Eunuch. -Investigate him strictly.

646
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
You just come in time.

647
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,950
He is the murderer.

648
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,400
I've got many memorials

649
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,160
impeaching Zhu Shan.

650
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,880
I'll send them to His Majesty.

651
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,830
I'll make both him

652
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,230
and his father

653
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,520
pay with their life.

654
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,520
I dare you to hurt my father.

655
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't try to slander him,

656
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,680
Huang Cheng.

657
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,520
You...

658
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,470
Your Lordship,

659
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,920
talk with

660
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,230
His Majesty in the palace.

661
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,280
Take him away.

662
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,000
Go.

663
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,070
His Excellency Lu,

664
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,520
please go with me.

665
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,110
His Excellency Huang is furious today.

666
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,920
If he says anything wrong

667
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,470
before His Majesty,

668
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,880
you may correct it.

669
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,230
His Excellency Huang,

670
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,830
please.

671
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,800
Pull that bitch out

672
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,920
to feed the dog.

673
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,760
Yes.

674
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,830
My son.

675
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,950
He is son of Lord Cheng.

676
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,430
Yes.

677
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,520
Be careful.

678
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,880
Don't be hasty.

679
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,520
Why did Wan Qing

680
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,800
chose this place to avenge?

681
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,520
Clearly, she didn't want to live.

682
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,190
Don't talk nonsense.

683
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,800
We don't know what happened yet.

684
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,430
So there is no justice in the world.

685
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,560
People exchange justice

686
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
with their lives.

687
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,160
Do you agree, Your Ladyship?

688
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,350
Jiuling,

689
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,590
is it a coincidence that

690
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,400
the horse was startled?

691
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,880
Baotang, Sanbing,

692
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,280
help me.

693
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,230
Follow Wan Qing.

694
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,470
When those of the Huang family leave,

695
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,190
send her out of the city.

696
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,400
She is alive?

697
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,190
Yes.

698
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,190
I gave her a pill

699
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,160
to hold her breath for the time being.

700
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,280
She will wake up tomorrow morning.

701
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,280
Wan Qing,

702
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,830
Huang Ziqing is dead.

703
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,470
They won't let you go.

704
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,800
Did he startle

705
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,950
the horse deliberately?

706
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,070
Ask Zan yourself.

707
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,560
Why is it His Lordship?

708
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,400
How is it going, Sanbing?

709
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:27,800
Don't worry.

710
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,760
Baotang has sent Wan Qing out of the city.

711
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,190
How is His Lordship?

712
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,680
I've got no news.

713
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,040
He didn't want me

714
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,280
to save Huang Ziqing,

715
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,680
so he did that risking his life.

716
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,520
Zan insisted on doing that.

717
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
I couldn't stop him.

718
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,800
Huang Ziqing was going

719
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
to impeach Lord Cheng.

720
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,520
No matter how eloquent Zhu Zan is,

721
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm afraid it's hard for him to get out.

722
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,470
Will it threaten his life?

723
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,710
Your Majesty,

724
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Zhu Zan killed my son.

725
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,070
The Zhu family killed my only son.

726
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,310
As I've been

727
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,710
working diligently for the court,

728
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,560
Your Majesty, please help me.

729
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,520
Where is Zhu Zan?

730
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,880
His Lordship

731
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,230
is out of the palace.

732
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,310
Do you want to see him?

733
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,830
No.

734
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,800
Put him into the imperial prison.

735
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,280
Behead him some day

736
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,830
without the joint trial

737
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,560
of three departments.

738
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

739
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,470
Calm down, Your Majesty.

740
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,640
It happened

741
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,280
suddenly.

742
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,350
Both Lord Cheng and Minister Huang are involved.

743
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,230
To avoid discussion of ministers,

744
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,000
it's proper to first

745
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,680
check and verify it.

746
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,760
Huang Cheng has only one son.

747
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
What His Lordship did

748
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,160
cuts off their family's blood,

749
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,070
so Huang Cheng will

750
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,310
try to kill His Lordship for sure.

751
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,190
What I fear most is that

752
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,560
Lu Yunqi may help Huang Cheng.

753
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,280
Thus, His Lordship will be doomed.

754
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,600
I'll save Zan

755
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,909
at the cost of my life.

756
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,230
Li Sanbing,

757
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:14,799
calm down.

758
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,429
First try to find out

759
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,759
news of His Lordship.

760
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,429
What to check and verify?

761
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,839
Your Majesty,

762
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,470
I saw it with my own eyes.

763
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,840
Minister Lu was also there.

764
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,760
He can prove it.

765
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,430
Your Majesty,

766
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,760
I did

767
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,870
see a scared horse

768
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,760
breaking into the crowd

769
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,910
and making

770
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,150
deadly steps on Minister Junior Huang.

771
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,430
And then,

772
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,910
His Lordship appeared

773
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,120
and subdued the scared horse.

774
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,759
Zhu Zan startled

775
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,909
the horse,

776
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,599
so it stepped on my son.

777
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,910
Your Majesty,

778
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,079
he just retaliated against

779
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,840
my impeachment of Zhu Shan.

780
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,390
You must help me, Your Majesty.

781
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,870
Calm down.

782
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,800
I'll handle it fairly.

783
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,630
Deliver my order.

784
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,560
Put Zhu Zan in the imperial prison

785
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,470
and hit him for 100 times.

786
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,470
Yes.

787
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,150
Say it or not?

788
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,320
Hurry up.

789
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,120
Hurry up.

790
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:22,910
Say it.

791
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,870
Continue to beat him.

792
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,320
Say it or not?

793
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,320
I really don't know.

794
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,800
Tell me now.

795
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,630
Ghost Hand,

796
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,120
stop.

797
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,000
A big shot will be sent here later.

798
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,280
His Excellency told us

799
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,280
to take good care of him.

800
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,910
No matter who he is,

801
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,360
it's

802
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,670
the same to me,

803
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,430
just a pile of fresh.

804
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,870
It's different this time.

805
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,800
When, when will he be sent here?

806
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,430
I'm looking forward to it.

807
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,320
The punishment of flogging will end soon.

808
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,040
How many times?

809
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,800
100 times.

810
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
That'll

811
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,870
almost kill him.

812
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,080
What can I do?

813
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,150
Perhaps others can't bear that,

814
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,190
but he is extraordinary.

815
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,280
He kept silent at first.

816
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,230
Later when he was badly mutilated,

817
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,040
he just groaned once in a while.

818
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,630
Well,

819
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,670
I look forward to it even more.

820
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,230
His Excellency Lu,

821
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,950
His Lordship seems to fall asleep.

822
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,390
Here is the notorious imperial prison

823
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,870
of Arm Moral Department.

824
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,910
I wish

825
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,950
you can laugh later.

826
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,630
Your Lordship,

827
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,760
I'll

828
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,080
treat you.

829
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,840
May I say no?

830
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,630
No.

831
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,320
Is Dr. Jun here?

832
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,190
His Highness Prince Xian is visiting Dr. Jun.

833
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,430
Twelfth Uncle?

834
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,080
What is he doing here?

835
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,120
Your Highness.

836
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,840
You're Jun Jiuling,

837
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,320
the highly skilled doctor

838
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,190
known in the capital city.

839
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,280
Thank you.

840
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,470
You flattered me.

841
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,760
I don't feel well these days.

842
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,390
The imperial doctors

843
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,840
can't tell why.

844
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
They just asked me to drink

845
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,520
bitter decoction that doesn't work.

846
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,760
As a highly skilled doctor,

847
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,600
how about checking it for me?

848
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,040
Your Highness Prince Xian, please.

849
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,630
I thought no one would come,

850
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,670
but a prince came in the early morning.

851
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,470
Shut up.

852
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,120
The medicine flavor in your drugstore

853
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,950
smells good.

854
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,430
Your Highness, don't worry.

855
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,870
Nothing is wrong with you.

856
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,630
Yes.

857
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,080
Now that you said that,

858
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,470
I'll be relieved.

859
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
However,

860
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,190
though I'm fine,

861
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,190
I wonder if

862
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,280
those in my mansion

863
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,630
are alright.

864
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
How about

865
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,950
going to my mansion

866
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,950
to check them?

867
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,950
Anyone who is ill in your mansion

868
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,470
will be treated by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

869
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,320
He and Zhu Zan are friends.

870
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,600
He must come here

871
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,630
for Zhu Zan.

872
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,840
Dr. Jun?

873
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,080
OK.

874
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,870
I'll collect things

875
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,710
and prepare for it.

876
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,840
Thanks.

877
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,760
Zhu Zan,

878
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,800
if it hurts,

879
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,360
shout loudly.

880
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,630
You can't call me by my name.

881
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,710
You didn't need to kill Huang Ziqing.

882
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,670
Even if they impeach you and your father,

883
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,710
His Majesty may not believe them.

884
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,670
Be careful.

885
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,320
Don't let His Lordship

886
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,470
look down upon Arm Moral Department.

887
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,760
Wait.

888
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,430
Don't be hasty.

889
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,080
I haven't applied medicine yet.

890
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,910
He can't bear it.

891
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,630
He may be beat to death.

892
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,230
Ghost,

893
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
what's the medicine?

894
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,870
Now palace eunuchs

895
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,120
are more and more good at punishing.

896
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,950
Look at the injury.

897
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,360
It's

898
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,600
so beautiful.
