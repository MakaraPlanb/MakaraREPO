00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:15,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 27

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,830
Jiuling.

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,320
Chengyu?

19
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,030
You're finally back.

20
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,830
Yes, I'm back.

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,600
Long time no see.

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,520
You get thin.

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,800
Long time no see.

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
You are

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,360
more and more handsome.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,110
It's far from home.

27
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,520
Aren't others worried about you?

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,440
No, they're not worried.

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,800
No matter how far you are,

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,830
I'll come to meet you.

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,800
You had

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,750
a long journey,

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,520
so you must be tired.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,440
-Your Ladyship. -Your Ladyship.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,240
Young Master.

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,360
Why do you come together?

37
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,550
Your Ladyship,

38
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,190
Young Master Fang went to meet you,

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,320
but he didn't expect that

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,600
you would go alone.

41
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah.

42
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,550
Young Master Fang even brought you

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,720
sweet plums,

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,030
but I ate them up.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,470
Young Master Fang

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,670
looked very happy

47
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,390
when he met us,

48
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,000
but after he only saw Chen Qi and me,

49
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,880
his expression

50
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,800
changed in an instant,

51
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,960
and he became

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,720
cool and poker-faced.

53
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,910
Liu'er,

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,360
why not go out first?

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,550
I want to have a long chat with Jiuling.

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,000
OK. OK. OK.

57
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,630
Your Ladyship,

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,550
we're going to put the stuff away.

59
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,550
OK.

60
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,670
-Let's go. -Let's go.

61
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,750
Why are you looking at me?

62
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,190
I have a lot of questions for you.

63
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,190
Go ahead.

64
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,670
When staying in the capital city,

65
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,830
you did so many good deeds.

66
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,000
Did you have a hard time?

67
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,390
Nothing is easy to do.

68
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,880
Moreover,

69
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,270
we shouldn't be afraid of hardships outside.

70
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,000
You're right.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
But you did them very well.

72
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,190
You're awesome.

73
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,080
By the way,

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,270
I did something

75
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,390
without your consent.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,670
Please don't blame me.

77
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,960
What did you do?

78
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,000
Well,

79
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,470
in my opinion,

80
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,440
our families

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,320
and I were happy

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,440
about your return.

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,790
So do

84
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,760
the people of Zezhou.

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,040
So

86
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:46,199
I dispatched someone

87
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,720
to tell them that

88
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,550
you're back.

89
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,110
You're

90
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,880
naughty.

91
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,160
Grandma.

92
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,270
Aunt.

93
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,270
Yuxiu.

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,070
You're finally back.

95
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,440
Long time no see.

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,600
You look

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,480
more and more beautiful.

98
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,950
As a natural beauty,

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,830
you look more and more impressive.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,640
Yuxiu,

101
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,920
don't make fun of me.

102
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,160
Grandma is healthier and healthier.

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,200
As an old woman,

104
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,790
I can't be compared with you.

105
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,070
Only a year has passed,

106
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
but I change a lot.

107
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,350
I'm older.

108
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,480
Grandma,

109
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,070
aunt,

110
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,000
I bring you

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,510
some good medicinal materials to nourish your bodies

112
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,830
from the capital city.

113
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,230
Liu'er.

114
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,550
Jinxiu

115
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,670
also prepared you

116
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,880
some good things in the capital city.

117
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,350
How is Jinxiu

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,480
in the capital city?

119
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,920
Senior Madame,

120
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,950
Lady Jinxiu lives

121
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,070
at ease and happily

122
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,920
in the capital city.

123
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,390
And she manages

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,480
the Jiuling Drugstore well

125
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,510
by virtue of her ability.

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Really?

127
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,070
She is still

128
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,350
as confident as a lady.

129
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,270
I invited her to come back with me before leaving,

130
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,670
but she refused.

131
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,040
Why does she suddenly come back?

132
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,790
Yunzhao.

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,160
Father.

134
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,510
You're wronged.

135
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,440
Have a seat.

136
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,790
Your mother is

137
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,760
always good-tempered,

138
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,760
but this time

139
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,510
she was strange.

140
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,350
It's my fault.

141
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,440
I shouldn't have acted rashly.

142
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,510
Her irritation is understandable.

143
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,000
However,

144
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,200
I think it's a good thing that

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,640
you like her.

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,950
Do you also think that she's a good girl?

147
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,160
Such a magic skill as vaccination

148
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,600
will go down in history.

149
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,670
Have a think.

150
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,350
If you marry her,

151
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,270
how great glory it'll be!

152
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,110
It turns out that you mean this.

153
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,600
But

154
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,640
it's the Jiuling Drugstore

155
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,000
that should go down in history.

156
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,160
Even so,

157
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,950
the Jiuling Drugstore also belongs to Ningjun Jiuling.

158
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,350
Father,

159
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,070
our engagement was canceled.

160
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,440
Our marriage

161
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
was still false.

162
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,830
Your marriage was false,

163
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,070
but your love

164
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,390
is true.

165
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,480
I told her

166
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
my love once,

167
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,390
but she

168
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,950
refused me.

169
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,950
You've given up?

170
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,880
Zan,

171
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,830
the Pasturage Department

172
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,110
is managed by the follower of Huang Cheng.

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
You must suffer a lot here.

174
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,830
Here is much better than the North.

175
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,070
Did anything happen in the bookstore?

176
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,110
Did Huang Cheng meet the mysterious man again?

177
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,000
Huang Cheng didn't go to the bookstore again.

178
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,320
But

179
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,640
we found out the bookstore's owner.

180
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,790
Its owner is a scholar named Zhang Siming.

181
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,830
We suspect,

182
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,830
we suspect that

183
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,320
he is likely

184
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,280
to be the spy dispatched by Beiqi in the capital city.

185
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,230
We went there twice in two days,

186
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,110
but we just saw

187
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,670
the workers of the bookstore,

188
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,110
and the owner

189
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,230
never showed up.

190
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:09,590
It's abominable to open the door

191
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,440
to a dangerous enemy.

192
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,470
You write to my father

193
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,640
to let him beware of it.

194
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,200
Sanbing,

195
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,640
keep an eye on the bookstore.

196
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,550
In case of any abnormity,

197
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,230
come to tell me immediately.

198
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,840
OK.

199
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,960
Zan,

200
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,150
Miss Jun reached Zezhou safely.

201
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,910
You can be relieved.

202
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,200
You can't let her

203
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
be controlled by Lu Yunqi.

204
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,110
There are many people here.

205
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,000
You go first.

206
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,440
Be careful.

207
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,930
Deshengchang
18
00:15:50,510 --> 00:02:23,240
Ning Mansion

208
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,470
Young Master.

209
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,440
Butler Gao,

210
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,150
I finished checking today's accounts.

211
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,030
Do you have any other account books?

212
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,520
They haven't been sent here yet.

213
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,150
Young Master,

214
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,350
you've been checking all morning.

215
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:15,960
How about

216
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,030
going back to have a rest?

217
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,280
After the noon,

218
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,840
I can send the account books to the mansion.

219
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,520
OK.

220
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,030
I'll go back

221
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,960
after Santao comes back.

222
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,150
Santao usually

223
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,880
follows you.

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,880
Where did he go?

225
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,110
I asked him to buy something for me.

226
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Young Master!

227
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,960
Young Master,

228
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,710
I bought them back.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,590
-They're freshly steamed. -Give me.

230
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,080
Be careful not to be scalded.

231
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,350
They won't be delicious when getting cold.

232
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,760
You said you didn't plan to leave the capital city.

233
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,840
Why did you come back so suddenly?

234
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,030
Because of Lu Yunqi?

235
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,710
Yes.

236
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,230
But not for him only.

237
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,110
If you don't want to tell me,

238
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,550
you can keep silent.

239
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,030
-Jiuling. -I…

240
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,030
Jiuling,

241
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,670
I'm back.

242
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,960
I brought you something.

243
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,840
Young Master.

244
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
You're entertaining the guest?

245
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,150
Do I bother you?

246
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,110
Young Master Fang,

247
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,350
I'm Ning Yunzhao.

248
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,000
You're Childe Ning.

249
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,960
I've long heard of

250
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,350
but never seen you.

251
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,880
Thank you for helping Jiuling

252
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,520
in the capital city.

253
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,520
You're welcome.

254
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,440
Miss Jun

255
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,230
thanked me.

256
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,550
Even if Jiuling

257
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,790
thanked you,

258
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,110
I also need to thank you.

259
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,150
Well,

260
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,640
I told you that

261
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
the steamed buns of a newly-opened shop

262
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,440
are very delicious.

263
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,000
Come on.

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,590
Have a taste when they're hot.

265
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,350
Otherwise they'll be cold.

266
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,790
Childe Ning, would you like to try one?

267
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,030
Come on.

268
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
You eat one,

269
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,550
and I can share one with Jiuling.

270
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,080
Here you are,

271
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,550
Jiuling.

272
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,440
OK.

273
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,760
Childe Ning, how about going back after having lunch?

274
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,080
Will your matter be delayed?

275
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,590
No need.

276
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,550
I specially came to ask about something,

277
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,590
and then I'll go back.

278
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,910
Ask about something?

279
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,280
What's it?

280
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,400
He wondered

281
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,150
why I suddenly came back.

282
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,880
Yes.

283
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,150
Childe Ning, don't worry.

284
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,640
Even if our engagement can't stop Lu Yunqi,

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,280
we aren't afraid of him.

286
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,760
Yes,

287
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,030
we aren't afraid of him.

288
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,880
And

289
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,000
we still need to go back to the capital city.

290
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,790
Shall we go back to

291
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,230
the capital city together some days later?

292
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,230
You want to do me justice?

293
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
Now that he doesn't give up,

294
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,030
we don't need to wrong ourselves.

295
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,080
Childe Ning,

296
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,640
can you return to the capital city some days later?

297
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,880
Your mother is still ill.

298
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,710
If you leave in a hurry,

299
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,960
will you

300
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,670
be accused of impiety

301
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,760
by the censor?

302
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,880
I don't know it.

303
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,110
I'm just talking nonsense.

304
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,790
Chengyu's words make sense.

305
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:21,840
After all,

306
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,550
your time for coming to see parents is still long.

307
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,320
If you return to the capital city,

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,590
I'm afraid others will take it as a handle against you.

309
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,760
And now

310
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,000
we're on a boat.

311
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,910
We've become the enemies of many people.

312
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm sorry to implicate you.

313
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:35,960
Miss Jun…

314
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,790
If you want to return to the capital city early,

315
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,230
you should

316
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,670
relieve your mother's worries first.

317
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,550
I think,

318
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,030
I think we should cancel our engagement

319
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,710
as soon as possible,

320
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,880
which will be good for you.

321
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,150
It will

322
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,320
be worse.

323
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,670
My mother is ill.

324
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
If we cancel our engagement now,

325
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm afraid others will think that I'm unfilial,

326
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,470
and,

327
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,110
and our family

328
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,880
is perfidious.

329
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,670
After all,

330
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,520
our family still

331
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,590
gets your favor.

332
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm sorry to keep troubling you.

333
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,320
You helped me first,

334
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,710
so I should thank you.

335
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,670
Then I'm leaving.

336
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,710
Jiuling.

337
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,790
Chengyu.

338
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,790
I saw through you

339
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,110
just now.

340
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,840
I just dislike him

341
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
for your previous suffering in the Ning's mansion.

342
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,030
Forget it.

343
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,350
Moreover,

344
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,230
in terms of the engagement,

345
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,320
Childe Ning helped me.

346
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,790
You shouldn't have done it.

347
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,000
I see.

348
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,400
I won't do so again.

349
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,230
Go on enjoying it.

350
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,670
OK.

351
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,350
Come on.

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,440
Here you are.

353
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,470
Eat more.

354
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,000
Your Lordship,

355
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,880
you mean

356
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,350
Young Master Fang dislikes you?

357
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,550
It's

358
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,550
obvious.

359
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,760
He has no reason to like me.

360
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,710
Because of the canceled engagement?

361
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,840
It happened a long time ago.

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,230
He still bears a grudge for it?

363
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,760
No.

364
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,080
So why?

365
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,080
Because

366
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,790
Young Master Fang also likes her.

367
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,280
It's not as simple as you think.

368
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,960
Miss Jun

369
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,840
and the Fang family don't agree,

370
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,760
and

371
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,550
my mom once

372
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,030
annoyed Senior Madame Fang.

373
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,200
You're right.

374
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,200
How about this?

375
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,230
You invite Miss Jun and her families

376
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,470
to have a talk.

377
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,110
I'll go with you by then.

378
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,470
Father,

379
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,710
we can't do so.

380
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Why not?

381
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,790
You're engaged to Miss Jun,

382
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,030
so it's reasonable for us to get together for a meal and talk.

383
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,640
I'll write to inform them.

384
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,710
It's scheduled for

385
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,110
tomorrow noon and Shunde Teahouse.

386
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,200
Father.

387
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
I've decided it.

388
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,590
Jiuling.

389
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,840
Jiuling,

390
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,520
here is a letter to you.

391
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,470
A letter to me?

392
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a letter from Jinxiu.

393
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Zhu Zan went out of the imperial prison

394
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,400
and is pondering upon his fault in the Pasturage Department.

395
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,110
Lu Yunqi didn't break his promise.

396
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,000
What's up?

397
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,960
Did anything happen in the capital city?

398
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,110
Not the capital city.

399
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,470
In the southwestern Hebei,

400
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,280
a dozen kids died from vaccination.

401
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,350
And

402
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,280
Beiqi has sent additional troops to the border.

403
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,520
How many invaders are there?

404
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,430
Tens of thousands of soldiers and horses.

405
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,310
They're Beiqi's cavalries.

406
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,710
Then it's not an intrusion from skirmishers

407
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,229
but troops' expedition instead.

408
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,760
The North

409
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,400
remains stable for less than 10 years.

410
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,040
I hope Lord Cheng can overcome it.

411
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,760
Chengyu,

412
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,760
I'm going to the southwestern Hebei.

413
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,640
Go to the…

414
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,520
Are you mad?

415
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,310
Jiuling,

416
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,110
Beiqi is not far from there.

417
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,070
It's very dangerous.

418
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,760
Now Lord Cheng leads the troops to resist the foreigners' invasion.

419
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,680
His attention can't be diverted

420
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,110
by the vaccination now.

421
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,560
Was there anything wrong

422
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,430
with the vaccinators?

423
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,070
I don't know.

424
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,640
So I must go to find it out.

425
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,640
OK.

426
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,560
I'll make preparations for you.

427
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,400
The North is not safe now.

428
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,880
I'll arrange more manpower for you.

429
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,710
OK.

430
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,800
Your Ladyship.

431
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,310
Young Master.

432
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,350
Senior Madame asked you to see her.

433
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,710
The letter from the Ning's mansion says that

434
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,400
they want to discuss the marriage in Shunde Teahouse tomorrow.

435
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,560
Discuss the marriage?

436
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,640
Yuxiu.

437
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,070
Are you tired?

438
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,590
I've brought you

439
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,040
your favorite pastries.

440
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,470
I'm not tired.

441
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,560
Don't worry.

442
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,400
How do you still stay here?

443
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,880
Do you know where she is?

444
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,040
I know it.

445
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,160
Shunde Teahouse.

446
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,640
Every day,

447
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,190
you always follow her.

448
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,760
Today,

449
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,110
grandma and mother both went there,

450
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,760
but you didn't.

451
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,350
They just wrote to

452
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,070
invite grandma,

453
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,190
mother and Jiuling.

454
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,590
I don't

455
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,430
have the cheek to go there.

456
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,920
Would you like to go?

457
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,880
Yes.

458
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,230
Of course I'd like to go.

459
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,160
Actually,

460
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,680
I really want to go.

461
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,560
In fact, as long as you said you wanted to go,

462
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,470
Jiuling would agree.

463
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,350
However,

464
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,950
if you go on pretending to be a good cousin,

465
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,040
you'll be always just a cousin.

466
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,950
But if not,

467
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm afraid

468
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,470
I can't even get close to her.

469
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,280
The guests are coming.

470
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,110
Senior Madame,

471
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,560
it's really my honor that

472
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,190
you can come as agreed.

473
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,350
It's a surprise

474
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,000
to receive your invitation.

475
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,280
It's really hard

476
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,400
to see you.

477
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,590
It's pity that

478
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,710
I didn't see you last year.

479
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm sorry

480
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,950
for my wife's impoliteness

481
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,800
and inhospitality.

482
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,880
Today she has a typhoid fever,

483
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,280
so she can't come out.

484
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,110
Please forgive her

485
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,070
for her inhospitality.

486
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,560
Childe Ning is the favorite son of your wife.

487
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,640
So I can understand her.

488
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,710
Isn't Childe Ning here?

489
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,800
As his father,

490
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,950
I should ask

491
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,190
about something clearly

492
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,880
for him

493
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,710
before he comes.

494
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,070
Do you agree with me?

495
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,590
I also think so.

496
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,350
Then,

497
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,110
don't stand on ceremony.

498
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,310
Let's go in

499
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,560
to have a seat and talk.

500
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,350
Please.

501
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,920
Today your father sees my grandma

502
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,280
for our engagement?

503
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,920
Yes.

504
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,560
It's good.

505
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,800
They have their own ideas.

506
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,230
If they can take this opportunity to clear up the misunderstanding,

507
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,680
it'll be good.

508
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,430
It is

509
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
our engagement.

510
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
We should

511
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,000
deal with it personally.

512
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,520
In fact, today I ask you out

513
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,520
for something else.

514
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,040
What is it?

515
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,710
Say goodbye to you.

516
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,590
Say goodbye?

517
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,800
Senior Madame, please.

518
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,830
Madame, please.

519
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,230
Then,

520
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,710
I'll

521
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
come to the point.

522
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,430
Before Yunzhao returns to the capital city,

523
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,350
let's confirm

524
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,800
their marriage as soon as possible.

525
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,230
What do you think about it?

526
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,470
The time is not yet ripe.

527
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,920
What if others think

528
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,400
it's true?

529
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,680
Whether it's true

530
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,430
depends on us.

531
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,800
You're here to say goodbye to me,

532
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,640
so you must not

533
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,110
go to the capital city.

534
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,070
I'm going to the North.

535
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,280
Do you know Beiqi has sent additional troops?

536
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,920
I don't know.

537
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,110
Why have they suddenly sent troops?

538
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,920
A battle is inevitable.

539
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,830
And

540
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,680
there is something wrong with the vaccines of the southwestern Hebei.

541
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,110
It seems that this world

542
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,830
will be chaotic again.

543
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,280
So tomorrow I'll go north

544
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,520
to find out the matter about vaccines.

545
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,830
I must prevent

546
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,000
the smallpox outbreak in the rear.

547
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,160
Only when the people are not attacked by the smallpox

548
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,190
can the morale of the troops be stable

549
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,110
and the country be in peace.

550
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,190
Your journey will be full of setbacks,

551
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,000
but you still dare to move forward.

552
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Let me toast your concern for the country

553
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
and the people and wish you a good journey

554
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,310
with this cup of tea.

555
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,760
Jiuling now is promoted to County Princess Shanyang

556
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,110
by His Majesty.

557
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm her grandma,

558
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
but it's still inappropriate for me

559
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,160
to make a decision.

560
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,430
Our family is a scholarly family,

561
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,400
and Yunzhao

562
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,040
becomes the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam.

563
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,430
They're really

564
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,640
perfectly matched.

565
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,640
Yunzhao stands out as the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam,

566
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,160
but mutual love

567
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,880
is also required in a marriage.

568
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,470
Miss Jun and Yunzhao

569
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,040
had many contacts in the capital city.

570
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,040
So

571
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,590
they must like each other.

572
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,560
As far as I am concerned,

573
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,040
Childe Ning indeed

574
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,230
likes Jiuling,

575
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,830
but Jiuling

576
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,800
doesn't like him.

577
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,950
She said

578
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,830
their engagement had been canceled,

579
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,070
so she has put it down completely.

580
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,190
Well,

581
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,800
Yunzhao didn't know that their engagement

582
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,310
had been canceled,

583
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,160
but today

584
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,110
Yunzhao

585
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,310
has told me his thought.

586
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,560
Senior Madame, I'm telling the truth.

587
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,470
To be honest,

588
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,470
the engagement…

589
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,590
Let's not

590
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,190
talk about the engagement today.

591
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,680
Master,

592
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,190
today is an important day.

593
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,920
How can I be absent?

594
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,190
Senior Madame,

595
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,000
long time no see.

596
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,430
You look much better than

597
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,430
you were in our mansion.

598
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,160
But you look

599
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,760
much paler

600
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,070
than you were last time.

601
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,000
Does anything bother you?

602
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,560
Many matters bother me.

603
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,800
I heard that someone renamed herself to seduce Yunzhao

604
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,590
after he became the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam.

605
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,640
I'm afraid Mrs. Ning is not only bothered

606
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,040
by this.

607
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,880
Your family spends a lot of money

608
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,230
in booking Shunde Teahouse.

609
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,710
Do you know it?

610
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,190
Honey.

611
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,760
Of course.

612
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,110
So

613
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,560
I come to speak for Yunzhao.

614
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,830
Senior Madame,

615
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,040
won't you drive me away?

616
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,470
Of course I welcome you.

617
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,430
You come to speak for Childe Ning

618
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,800
or laugh at us?

619
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,640
As a saying goes,

620
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,710
every dog has his day.

621
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,470
I'm afraid

622
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,950
you'll ask for an insult today.

623
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,470
You're straightforward.

624
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,800
But don't draw

625
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,680
a conclusion early.

626
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,950
I didn't want to

627
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,190
say something,

628
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,310
but today

629
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,920
I must tell you.

630
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,310
When Jiuling was a nobody,

631
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,920
your family kept away from her.

632
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,280
Now Jiuling is famous all over the world,

633
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,680
but Childe Ning always

634
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,880
comes to see her.

635
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,160
Only saints can stick to

636
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,400
their conscience.

637
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,430
What are you

638
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
going to do in the future?

639
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,310
When my mother recovers,

640
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,800
I'll return to the capital city.

641
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,800
Now you're the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam,

642
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,560
and your uncle is the Ceremonial Master,

643
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,070
so you must be very promising after returning to the capital city.

644
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,880
I'm afraid it's not so simple.

645
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,350
I thought

646
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,760
it's joyful

647
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,070
to be an official,

648
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,520
but now it seems

649
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,560
very hard to protect myself

650
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,070
in the court.

651
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,470
You haven't become an official,

652
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,310
but why do you sigh for it?

653
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,190
After studying hard for a decade,

654
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,280
I will have to concentrate on making profits.

655
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,280
It's really disappointing.

656
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,710
In my opinion,

657
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,560
officials should serve the people

658
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,280
from the heart.

659
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,350
Only after keeping a foothold

660
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,760
can you make contributions,

661
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,470
and there is no need to care too much about the process.

662
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
Sometimes the indirect approach

663
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,710
is the best policy.

664
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,640
Jiuling,

665
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,000
if you were a man,

666
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,280
you would be a trustworthy minister

667
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,800
whose name will go down in history.

668
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,350
But

669
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,230
you have become famous,

670
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,230
and you'll be praised by later generations

671
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,760
by virtue of the vaccination.

672
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,280
I'm flattered.

673
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,830
Miss Jun is otherworldly.

674
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,710
So

675
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,430
Commander Lu came into conflict with His Lordship Zhu

676
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,560
for her in the street.

677
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,680
Men usually don't come into conflict

678
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,950
for a common woman in the street.

679
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,920
So shameless.

680
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,640
Shut up!

681
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,430
-Master Ning, don't be angry. -Senior Madame.

682
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,070
Your wife is energetic,

683
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,000
so she must recover.

684
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,760
You should be happy.

685
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,710
Thank you for your invitation,

686
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,590
but our two families won't be united by marriage.

687
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,760
Jiuling is my granddaughter,

688
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,470
and I love her very much.

689
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I can't tolerate that she will be wronged.

690
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,560
If she marries a good husband

691
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,160
but has

692
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,350
a domineering mother-in-law,

693
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
how can I explain

694
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,710
to her dead parents?

695
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,800
No need to explain it.

696
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,040
Even if Miss Jun

697
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,800
personally comes to ask for the marriage,

698
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,560
I won't agree to it.

699
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,590
Yunzhao is not sophisticated,

700
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,710
so he can't see through many matters.

701
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,110
As her mother,

702
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,950
I should see through them for him.

703
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,400
Has Mrs. Ning done it?

704
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,680
Back then,

705
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,160
Jiuling asked for 5,000 taels of silver to cancel the engagement.

706
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,430
It shows that

707
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,040
we abandoned your family,

708
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,400
but I couldn't refuse Master Ning's kindness,

709
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,110
so I'm here.

710
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,640
Now that Mrs. Ning has such an attitude,

711
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,560
we don't acknowledge the engagement,

712
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,640
and Jiuling won't absolutely marry beneath her.

713
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,760
Marry beneath her?

714
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,190
Our family has produced officials for several generations.

715
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,160
If Yunzhao is really engaged to a woman from the merchant family,

716
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,950
it'll be a big joke.

717
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,230
For several generations?

718
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,350
Mrs. Ning knows it

719
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,680
better than I do.

720
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,680
You…

721
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,230
It seems that Mrs. Ning doesn't have a typhoid fever

722
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,520
but is hot-tempered instead.

723
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,560
This is excellent green tea,

724
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,560
and your husband has paid for it.

725
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,070
Mrs. Ning, don't waste it.

726
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,040
See you.

727
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,830
Senior Madame.

728
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,350
Senior Madame.

729
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,920
Childe Ning,

730
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,590
what do you want to say?

731
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,280
I want to ask you

732
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,430
a same question.

733
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,160
We always meet some people

734
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,230
and then part from them

735
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,040
when we move forward

736
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,800
in life.

737
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
I'm always alone

738
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,350
in my life.

739
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,710
I thought

740
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,830
I would

741
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,680
die alone.

742
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,110
But, unexpectedly,

743
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,760
I met you

744
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,950
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

745
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,040
Unconsciously,

746
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,400
I found that I really like you

747
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,350
and it's harder for me to control myself.

748
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,000
Jiuling.

749
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,710
Childe Ning,

750
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,040
please don't say so.

751
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,310
In the world,

752
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,400
I have few confidants

753
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,470
but you're one.

754
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,760
I know

755
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,190
you've helped me a lot,

756
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,190
and I also know your love.

757
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,950
But

758
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,430
I can only

759
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,430
refuse you.

760
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,190
I'm sorry.

761
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,710
Should I say some harsher words?

762
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,710
I should

763
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,950
refuse you cruelly

764
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,350
to make you give up,

765
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
which is really good for you.

766
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,920
No need.

767
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,430
I'm not

768
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,920
a stubborn man

769
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,800
and won't give myself up as hopeless.

770
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,110
Moreover,

771
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,520
the love for someone

772
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,070
is a gift from God

773
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,520
but not pain.

774
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,160
Miss Jun, you can be relieved.

775
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,950
Childe Ning,

776
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,230
I'm sorry.

777
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,590
Love

778
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
is unexplainable.

779
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,590
But I'm

780
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,160
much luckier.

781
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,560
Jiuling,

782
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,310
I wish I can have a chance

783
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,920
to do some things with you.

784
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,760
It's better than let you move forward alone.

785
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,430
It's enough

786
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,350
to have such a confidant as you

787
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,950
in my life.

788
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,710
Remember to take good care of yourself.

789
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,800
Take care.

790
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,710
We will

791
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,040
meet again,

792
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,680
but you can't forget me.

793
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,760
Send additional troops here?

794
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,640
It means that Beiqi is preparing for a battle.

795
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,110
Come on.

796
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,280
Lord Cheng

797
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
will defeat them.

798
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,520
If the late emperor were still alive,

799
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,430
he would absolutely resist and never yield an inch of territory.

800
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,760
But His Majesty is different.

801
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,310
He is mortally afraid of death

802
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,160
and cherishes his life very much.

803
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,400
If Huang Cheng advises him,

804
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,950
I'm afraid they will make peace.

805
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,350
I'm going to see His Majesty.

806
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,830
If I can't persuade him,

807
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,350
I'll go back to the North.

808
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,280
Your marriage

809
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,000
is also related to our family's future.

810
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,000
But now

811
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,520
a good marriage has been

812
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,760
completely destroyed by your mother.

813
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,110
We two families are in an embarrassing situation.

814
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,520
So it's impossible for you

815
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,950
to marry Miss Jun.

816
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,560
It's not only my mother's fault.

817
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,310
If Miss Jun doesn't like me,

818
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,230
I won't be able

819
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,470
to marry her, either.

820
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,950
Even if you can't marry her,

821
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,160
you can also become old friends

822
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,520
and help each other

823
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,560
in the capital city in the future.

824
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,470
Father, forget it.

825
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,230
I've felt relieved.

826
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,110
Even if you've

827
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,640
studied hard for a dozen years,

828
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,560
you're not a pedantic scholar.

829
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,350
Then I can be relieved when seeing you

830
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,350
take your ups and downs

831
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,430
in the future officialdom lightly.

832
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,760
Here you are, Jiuling.

833
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,230
Take my tent with you.

834
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,710
You can use it outdoors.

835
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,880
OK.

836
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
Why not go with a chef?

837
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,710
After all, enjoying yourself

838
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,110
won't delay your journey.

839
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,920
I go to solve the problem

840
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,230
but not to have a trip.

841
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,800
How about going with me?

842
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,310
Then I can

843
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
talk with you all the way.

844
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,590
I can also talk with Her Ladyship.

845
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,070
I'm better at pleasing Jiuling than you are.

846
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,430
Moreover,

847
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,350
you're not as good-looking as me.

848
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,310
When it comes to the appearance,

849
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,520
Childe Ning and His Lordship Zhu

850
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,350
are both good-looking,

851
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
and even His Excellency Lu

852
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,590
who always found fault with our lady

853
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,830
is also good-looking.

854
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,470
Stop.

855
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,520
Don't talk nonsense.

856
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Clean up the desk for me.

857
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,070
Jiuling,

858
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,760
what did you say to Childe Ning?

859
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,190
Little cousin, you don't need to ask about it.

860
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,190
Why do you still treat me as a child?

861
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,560
In my eyes,

862
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,920
you're always a child.

863
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,070
Why do your words sound strange today?

864
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,040
After you leave,

865
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:35,669
I don't know when I'll see you again.

866
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,280
Jiuling,

867
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:40,709
after reaching the North,

868
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:41,949
if you have any difficulties,

869
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,869
just go to the local Deshengchang.

870
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:47,149
If you need anything,

871
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:48,229
you can write to me,

872
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,670
and I'll arrange everything

873
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,470
for you.

874
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,710
OK.

875
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,040
Vegetables.

876
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,760
Fresh vegetables.

877
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,840
Mr. Lei.

878
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,910
Miss Jun,

879
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,710
you lied to me.

880
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
But I'm

881
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,040
grateful to you.

882
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,950
Forget it.

883
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,390
That's what we should do.

884
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,710
Chengyu said that

885
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,080
he had dispatched a reliable man.

886
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,520
It's actually you.

887
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,040
Thank Mr. Fang for thinking highly of me.

888
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,840
We won't make trouble for you.

889
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,360
Time flew in the past year.

890
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,760
How is your escort agency now?

891
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,360
Not bad.

892
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,470
Do you find that

893
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,430
our current escort formation

894
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,000
is the one

895
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,910
taught by Mr. Ling back then?

896
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,600
He didn't stay with us for long,

897
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,390
but he taught us a useful way.

898
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,150
This year

899
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,520
we even survived from a great crisis

900
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,390
in this way.

901
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,670
That's good.

902
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,840
His way

903
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,080
was learnt from the dangerous battlefield.

904
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,080
Of course it's useful.

905
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,470
He should know that

906
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,760
the North is not stable.

907
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,630
He must be anxious to return.

908
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,910
She has left.

909
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,320
Let's go back.

910
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,760
I really envy Liu'er.

911
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,320
Everyone envies her.

912
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,600
She enjoys herself

913
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,230
and can laugh or scold at will.

914
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,120
She can bully others,

915
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,670
but nobody can bully her.

916
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,430
Even if she does something wrong,

917
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,520
Jiuling will also make it up for her.

918
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,950
Did you tell her that

919
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,630
you like her last night?

920
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,320
No.

921
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,630
I guess it.

922
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
You're afraid of knowing the answer?

923
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm contented enough that

924
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,710
I can write to

925
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,230
and talk to her

926
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,840
and act as her cousin all my life.

927
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,670
However,

928
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,150
if I ask her,

929
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,600
maybe I won't

930
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,230
be so lucky anymore.

931
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,600
Master!

932
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,430
Master!

933
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,080
It's true.

934
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,040
There is really something wrong with the vaccines?

935
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
The news is concealed,

936
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,360
but I heard that

937
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,320
a dozen kids are dead,

938
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,560
and the families of those kids

939
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,280
are going to the capital city to accuse Miss Jun of it.

940
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,080
How can such an event

941
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,190
be concealed

942
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,670
and not reported to the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

943
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,390
Yeah.

944
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,230
Dr. Feng

945
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,280
needs to draw a conclusion

946
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,080
after investigations.

947
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,520
Of course he conceals it.

948
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,470
He has benefited

949
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,190
from the vaccination.

950
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,280
But the families of the dead kids

951
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,800
are really poor.

952
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,840
As doctors who cure diseases and save patients,

953
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,760
we should speak for these poor people.

954
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,320
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

955
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,760
what are you going to?

956
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,320
It's our duty

957
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,560
to share the cares and burdens of His Majesty

958
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,000
and benefit the people.

959
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,520
Even if she is popular,

960
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,710
we can't let

961
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,950
such killings occur.

962
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,910
I see.

963
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,520
Your Excellency,

964
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
please speak for us in the court tomorrow.

965
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,230
See you.

966
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,910
Imperial Doctor Jiang.

967
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,670
I want you to do me a favor.

968
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,230
Confess or not?

969
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,150
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

970
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,190
thank you.

971
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,430
Please.

972
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,950
His Excellency ordered you

973
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
to teach him a good lesson.

974
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,840
-OK. -Why do you lock the door? Open the door!

975
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,150
Master!

976
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,840
Lu Yunqi!

977
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,470
What do you want to do?

978
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,600
How dare you put me into the prison

979
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,630
without permission!

980
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,190
Aren't you afraid of being punished by His Majesty?

981
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,670
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

982
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,760
don't waste your energy.
