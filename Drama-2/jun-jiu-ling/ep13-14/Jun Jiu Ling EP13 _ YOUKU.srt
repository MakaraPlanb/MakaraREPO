00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,990
Your Ladyship,

37
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,790
you're back.

38
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,070
I woke you up?

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,990
Where did you go last night?

40
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,990
I was worried about you.

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,840
Didn't I tell you?

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,230
I went to meet an old friend.

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,510
I forgot it.

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,990
It's great as you're back.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,040
Are you hungry?

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,150
I'll prepare some food for you.

47
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,230
Let's dine out later.

48
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,480
OK.

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,590
A restaurant next to us

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,430
makes delicious Runan dishes.

51
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,560
How about having a try there?

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,870
Besides, I want dried tofu in chicken sauce,

53
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,480
OK?

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,230
Sure, if you like it.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,510
After the meal,

56
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,630
I want to see the shop.

57
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,840
OK.

58
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,430
I'll help you wash up.

59
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,630
Why did you resist?

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,990
You were right out of the capital city.

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,510
Why did you go back?

62
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,230
Your Majesty,

63
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,680
I heard that

64
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,870
a group of bandits from the North

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,590
robbed the people of their possession.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
That day I heard by accident

67
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,590
from the conversation

68
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,430
of several passers-by that

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,320
the bandits showed up in suburbs of the capital city.

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,200
I didn't want

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,040
to miss the chance.

72
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,230
To find it out,

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I left the man I guarded

74
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,400
and tailed after the bandits.

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,400
Later I eliminated them.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,870
You were in the North,

77
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
but you got the news about suburbs of the capital city.

78
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,960
Both you and your father are great.

79
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,710
Though you were in the North,

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
you cared about the capital city so much.

81
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,280
Sanbing,

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,920
what shall we do now?

83
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,230
I know why Zan asked me in the letter

84
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,230
to eliminate

85
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,680
all bandits on the run

86
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,590
on Mount Yang.

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
He expected that

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
he'd be inquired today.

89
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,990
It's a double gain plan.

90
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,560
It helps him get out

91
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,320
and eliminate the  bandits.

92
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,840
However, it may be

93
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,190
seen through by the suspicious emperor.

94
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,630
It isn't a time to celebrate.

95
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,279
Wait and see

96
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,999
if Zan can make it.

97
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,190
I think he can make it.

98
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,030
Your Majesty,

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,160
my father knows nothing.

100
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,680
I planned to capture their leader secretly,

101
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,750
so I noticed news

102
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,350
about them in suburbs of the capital city.

103
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,030
However,

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,600
fearing that it would bother you,

105
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,350
I decided to

106
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,070
eliminate them on my own.

107
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,000
Back then,

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,630
why didn't you chase them

109
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,790
with those from Arm Moral Department,

110
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,350
so as to capture all of them?

111
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,000
Your Majesty,

112
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,350
if I had gone with  those from Arm Moral Department,

113
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,400
the bandits would have

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
escaped seeing the suits.

115
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,280
Fine.

116
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,160
I don't want to hear it anymore.

117
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,680
Ask

118
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,230
Tan Song of the Supreme Court,

119
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,120
Han Feng

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,310
of the Ministry of War

121
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,720
and Lu Yunqi

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
for the joint trial of three departments.

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,910
Explain to them

124
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,600
whatever it is.

125
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

126
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,960
Your Ladyship,

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,790
this is an old shop.

128
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
Yes.

129
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,030
However,

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,470
it's in a good location.

131
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,750
But it's near the palace.

132
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,720
Those living around are high officials and noble lords.

133
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,070
If they are ill,

134
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,120
they'll turn to the Imperial Academy of Medicine

135
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,750
instead of Jiuling Drugstore.

136
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
I think

137
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,720
it's better to open in the downtown area

138
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,600
with many people like that in Runan.

139
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,630
It's difficult to live in the capital city.

140
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,280
It requires more than

141
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,000
curing several patients

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,880
to keep a foothold here.

143
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,230
We should get to know high-ranking officials.

144
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,750
Let's go

145
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,000
to have a look in the firm.

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,910
Go.

147
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,400
Leave it to Deshengchang.

148
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,310
Don't worry.

149
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,720
OK.

150
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,230
See you. Bye.

151
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,680
Shopkeeper Liu,

152
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,470
Miss Jun is here.

153
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,960
Miss Jun,

154
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,470
finally you're here.

155
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm Shopkeeper Liu

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,560
of Deshengchang in the capital city.

157
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,160
Young Master said in the letter that

158
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,750
you would be here a few days ago.

159
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,680
However,

160
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,720
you didn't show up.

161
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,960
I didn't know

162
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,190
where to find you

163
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,510
and worried

164
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,350
if anything went wrong on the way.

165
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,030
It's thoughtless of me

166
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,880
to worry you.

167
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,790
We spent a few days visiting

168
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,280
the capital city before coming here.

169
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,630
Young Master sent something to you.

170
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,790
Please check it.

171
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,400
We can buy anything here.

172
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,880
Why bother?

173
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,750
Jiuling Drugstore.

174
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,790
It,

175
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,720
it...

176
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,880
Young Master is prophetic.

177
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,190
Your Ladyship,

178
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,960
while you just select the shop,

179
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,600
he has sent the plaque here in advance.

180
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,910
And the characters

181
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,470
are painted with gold again.

182
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,510
Did you

183
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,840
tell him in advance

184
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,960
you would open Jiuling Drugstore?

185
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,630
I made the decision on the way.

186
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,840
I didn't tell the Fang family.

187
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,510
Young Master is so clever.

188
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Besides,

189
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
he is considerate.

190
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,910
Your Ladyship,

191
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,350
a letter from Young Master.

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,560
Your Ladyship,

193
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,600
you've selected a shop?

194
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,040
Yes.

195
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,599
It'll be opened on the 18th day of this month.

196
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,550
You're awesome.

197
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,430
The 18th day?

198
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,509
So there are only

199
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,750
5 days left?

200
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm afraid there isn't enough time

201
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,310
to make a good preparation.

202
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,600
Never mind.

203
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,160
We only need to

204
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,190
clean the house,

205
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,280
hang the plaque

206
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,960
and set a desk.

207
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,510
You shouldn't open quietly

208
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,600
the drugstore.

209
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,110
Though you're

210
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
a famous doctor

211
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,990
in Runan and Zezhou,

212
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,400
if you don't

213
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,670
make it grand

214
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,160
to let more people

215
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,110
know you in the capital city

216
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,600
with famous doctors everywhere,

217
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,550
I fear that

218
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,600
you even can't

219
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,070
get a chance to amaze others.

220
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,400
Your Ladyship,

221
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,480
it's difficult to live

222
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,630
in the capital city.

223
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,630
Yeah,

224
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,480
that's true.

225
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,750
But it's difficult to do everything.

226
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,310
Don't worry, Shopkeeper Liu.

227
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,160
I know what to do.

228
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,360
Just do as I said.

229
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,510
Your Lordship,

230
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,920
it's

231
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,280
the joint trial of three departments.

232
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,840
Be serious.

233
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,750
Ministers,

234
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,960
let's begin.

235
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,600
Let's start from Map of Capital City.

236
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,110
It's the reason

237
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,310
why His Majesty

238
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,110
summoned you back.

239
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,360
Your Highness,

240
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,670
tell us

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,430
whether you did it or not.

242
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,750
I'd like to remind you.

243
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,870
We've got human testimony and material evidence.

244
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,550
You can't deny it.

245
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,110
I'm not denying.

246
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,400
I did it.

247
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,960
Do you know what crime you committed?

248
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,550
No.

249
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,480
Let me tell you.

250
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,040
By abusing your power

251
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,840
and using military strength,

252
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,310
you ordered post soldiers to sell the map of capital city.

253
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
Don't shift the blame on me.

254
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,510
The people need the map to get to the capital city.

255
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,750
Post soldiers along the way

256
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,280
can sell it to make money

257
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,190
and improve the posts.

258
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,960
You don't believe that?

259
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,600
Ask the Ministry of War

260
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,840
if they've saved

261
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,110
a lot of money.

262
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,960
Yes.

263
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,280
It did ease our funding.

264
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,750
Most obviously,

265
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,670
the post horses are much better.

266
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,400
If Lord Lu doesn't believe it,

267
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,670
check the account book.

268
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,360
Does it make sense

269
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,160
whether your account book is true or not?

270
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,720
What do you mean?

271
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,240
You mean we make false account?

272
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,310
Aren't you

273
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,430
questioning me today?

274
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,070
Lord Tan,

275
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,400
say something.

276
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,960
Ministers,

277
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,040
we're colleagues.

278
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,430
Calm down.

279
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,870
Be friendly.

280
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,920
Go ahead.

281
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,920
All people

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,430
can buy the map

283
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,870
as long as they have money.

284
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,280
The map has spread to Beiqi.

285
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,990
It's too dangerous.

286
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,840
Your Lordship,

287
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,720
as a general protecting the country,

288
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,840
don't you know

289
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,630
what it means?

290
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,750
Your Excellency,

291
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,750
just because I'm a general,

292
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I know

293
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,550
what to do

294
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,750
and what not to do.

295
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,920
Everything in this map

296
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,310
is about dining and entertaining.

297
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,070
It doesn't involve the city defense,

298
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,480
the government offices and the imperial city at all.

299
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,630
Without precise measurement,

300
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,160
Beiqi people can't

301
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,550
use it to do anything.

302
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,840
But it's the map of the capital city.

303
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,750
As the enemies get it...

304
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,510
Yes.

305
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,480
On the map is

306
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
the prosperity and richness of the capital city.

307
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,630
Beiqi people

308
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,750
will covet it

309
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,550
so much

310
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,630
that they may

311
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,480
be driven crazy.

312
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,840
So

313
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,960
you provide them

314
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,990
with the map.

315
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,990
See?

316
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,110
In every state dogs bite.

317
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,510
When seeing great things,

318
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,870
you always want to

319
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,990
rob it.

320
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,800
Your Lordship,

321
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
now that you know

322
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,990
it's so attractive to Beiqi people,

323
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,040
why did you...

324
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,190
So what?

325
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,040
I want Beiqi people

326
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,600
and the rest of the world

327
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,750
to know how prosperous Tianyou is.

328
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,400
Many people

329
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,960
in the North

330
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,430
get no chance to visit the capital city this life.

331
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,550
It's impossible for them to come here.

332
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,630
Only through this map

333
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
can they see how prosperous

334
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,510
the capital city

335
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,800
of Tianyou, the state they protect, is.

336
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,510
The prosperity is

337
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,280
shared by the people

338
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,070
and makes their

339
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,360
fighting on the front line

340
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,510
meaningful.

341
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,110
How can we bear

342
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,550
to let it be invaded?

343
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,920
We'll never

344
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,310
let that happen.

345
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,400
Your Excellencies,

346
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,870
if you think

347
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,240
this map makes

348
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,400
Beiqi army go south,

349
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,630
what do you think of

350
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,800
the generals and  soldiers stationed on the front line,

351
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,040
the Ministry of War of Tianyou

352
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,630
and the authority of His Majesty?

353
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,040
If Beiqi people want to come,

354
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,190
let them come.

355
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,960
If they dare to come,

356
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
they'll be eliminated.

357
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:58,040
Eliminated.

358
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,240
Later,

359
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,800
Lord Tan said the case shall

360
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,400
be submitted to Your Majesty for judgment.

361
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,190
Both Lord Lu and Lord Han agreed.

362
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,240
As to Map of Capital City,

363
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,630
have they found it out?

364
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,630
Lord Zhu did it wrong

365
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,800
in this regard.

366
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,990
Those of the Department of City Defense checked it.

367
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
But this matter

368
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,360
can be serious or trivial.

369
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,360
Your Majesty,

370
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,040
even if you don't convict him,

371
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,400
you can't let him go.

372
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,070
As Lord Cheng has achieved gradually in the North,

373
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,960
keeping his son in the capital city

374
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,360
can check

375
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,550
the duke.

376
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,750
I didn't expect

377
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,990
the joint trial of three departments

378
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,040
would end like this.

379
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,190
This is the end of the matter?

380
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,670
It doesn't end completely.

381
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,070
This is fine.

382
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,600
One is merciless

383
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,400
and the other is  arrogant.

384
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,920
Just let His Lordship and Governor Lu of Arm Moral Department

385
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,400
check each other in the capital city.

386
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,670
If Zhu Zan

387
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,990
stays in the capital city,

388
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,510
it'll be troublesome.

389
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,670
Yunzhao,

390
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,040
whatever happens  in the capital city

391
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
has nothing to do with you.

392
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
Your top priority

393
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,400
is to study

394
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,240
and to prepare for the exam.

395
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,920
I got it,

396
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,550
uncle.

397
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,240
Master.

398
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,960
Aunt.

399
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,920
Master,

400
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,920
this is the gift list

401
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,190
I drew up

402
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,160
for Commander Lu's wedding.

403
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,040
Check it

404
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,870
to see if it is proper.

405
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,840
Uncle,

406
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,480
aunt,

407
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,670
I'll go back to my room.

408
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,720
Why is he

409
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,119
so strange

410
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,999
these days?

411
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,999
Perhaps study makes him tired.

412
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,790
Don't worry.

413
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,390
Remove some more.

414
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,430
We don't have much

415
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,790
connection with Lu Yunqi.

416
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,520
OK.

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,480
Miss Jun,

418
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,760
a guest wants to meet you.

419
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,030
Miss Jun,

420
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,480
are you there?

421
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,600
Coming.

422
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,310
Childe Ning.

423
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,360
Miss Jun.

424
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,270
How did you find me?

425
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,600
You told me in the daytime

426
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,190
you stay in an inn not far from the city gate,

427
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,790
so I asked inns around

428
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,000
one by one.

429
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,520
Is there any urgent matter?

430
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,640
Yes.

431
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,880
Well.

432
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,310
Please come in.

433
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,240
Excuse me.

434
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,390
Sit down.

435
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,760
OK.

436
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,880
Miss Jun,

437
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,070
I heard that

438
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,070
your clinic in Runan was called Jiuling Drugstore.

439
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,760
Will the new clinic opened in the capital city

440
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,150
use the same name?

441
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,310
You know all things.

442
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,600
Yes.

443
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,270
Miss Jun,

444
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,150
there is something wrong with the name.

445
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,430
It's the name of the late Princess Jiuling.

446
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,430
The name Jiuling Drugstore is from my father.

447
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,070
It has nothing to do with the princess.

448
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,480
So I think

449
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,790
the government won't punish me for that.

450
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,030
Miss Jun,

451
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,790
Princess Jiuling

452
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,840
was the late wife of Commander Lu of Arm Moral Department.

453
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,120
Commander Lu is odd

454
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,120
and unpredictable.

455
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,240
It's fine for you to open Jiuling Drugstore in Runan,

456
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
but you're in the capital city now.

457
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,360
What's more,

458
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,600
the opening day

459
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
is the wedding day of Commander Lu.

460
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
It may cause trouble.

461
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,390
Miss Jun,

462
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,270
change the name.

463
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,600
You mean

464
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,150
Lu Yunqi may purposely make difficulties for me.

465
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

466
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,190
If so,

467
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,550
Jiuling Drugstore

468
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,480
will be known to more people.

469
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,430
Miss Jun,

470
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,120
but...

471
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,640
Childe Ning,

472
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,600
I know you meant well to remind me,

473
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
But I've made up my mind.

474
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,000
In this case,

475
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,640
I will not persuade you any more

476
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,360
Perhaps I think too much.

477
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,270
It's difficult to live in the capital city,

478
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,910
so it'll better to be prudent.

479
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
It's difficult to live in the capital city.

480
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,390
I've heard it for  times

481
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,150
since I have been here.

482
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,520
It may not be easy at first,

483
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,030
but you'll find a way

484
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,310
to make it easy.

485
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,120
It's late.

486
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,550
I'm leaving.

487
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,390
Thank you for your reminder.

488
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

489
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,270
Jiuling Drugstore is opened today.

490
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,360
Yes. She is coming out.

491
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,030
She is beautiful.

492
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,920

it's me.

533
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,150
I'm Jiuling, sister.

534
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,840
Sister.

535
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,520
Your Highness.

536
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,030
Sister, come back.

537
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,640
Your Highness.

538
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,190
Sister, come back.

539
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,670
Your Highness.

540
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,030
Sister, don't go.

541
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,430
Jiurong.

542
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,360
Your Highness. Sister.

543
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,720
Your Highness.

544
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,390
Sister.

545
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,390
Your Highness.

546
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,640
Sister Jiuli, come back.

547
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,430
Your Highness.

548
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,120
Jiuli

549
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,720
and Jiuling left.

550
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,390
They abandoned me.

551
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,910
Sister, come back.

552
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,600
Your Highness.

553
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,430
Sister.

554
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,310
My Jiurong.

555
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,070
Sister.

556
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,640
Sister.

557
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
I'll go to my sister.

558
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,480
My Jiurong.

559
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,310
I'll avenge faster

560
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
and faster.

561
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,270
Wait for me.

562
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,270
Come back.

563
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,070
Jiurong.

564
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,390
Your Highness. Sister.

565
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,670
Her Highness will come back to see you.

566
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,880
The wind is strong outside.

567
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,960
You may catch cold.

568
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,430
Let's

569
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,190
go back.

570
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,480
-Sister. -Your Highness.

571
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,840
Go back, Your Highness.

572
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,150
Why are you in the capital city?

573
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,430
Because of...

574
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,430
...you.

575
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,600
Nonsense.

576
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,880
You left Zezhou without telling me

577
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,840
to get here

578
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
before Jiuli gets married,

579
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,430
right?

580
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,150
And in the crowd,

581
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,190
only you looked at Jiuling with different feelings.

582
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
You even cried

583
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,840
when seeing Jiurong.

584
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,840
How do you

585
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,880
explain all this?

586
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,760
Just for this?

587
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
I remember I told you,

588
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,190
Princess Jiuling and I were sisters,

589
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,670
so her family members are my close relatives.

590
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
Seeing Jiuli get married today,

591
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,270
I can't help being excited.

592
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,150
Moreover,

593
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,550
seeing Jiurong

594
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,190
so lonely at the gate,

595
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,270
I felt emotional.

596
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,910
Is it hard to understand?

597
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,430
How do you explain meeting with Yuan Bao?

598
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,880
He is an imperial eunuch.

599
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Ordinary people can't see him.

600
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And he disguised himself.

601
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,910
How did you recognize him?

602
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,120
I forgot to tell you that.

603
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,000
I met him when I went for

604
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,790
a banquet in the palace with my father.

605
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,640
Any more questions?

606
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,520
I feel that

607
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,880
you hide many things from me.

608
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,720
People often say our eyes betray us.

609
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,120
I want to see

610
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,360
if that's true.

611
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,840
Naive.

612
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,960
Jiuling Drugstore will be opened today.

613
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,430
I am busy.

614
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,430
Childish.

615
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,270
Zan,

616
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,070
though Jiuling Drugstore has been opened,

617
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,910
the door is closed.

618
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,070
It's strange.

619
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,070
She may do

620
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,190
anything expected.

621
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,270
Those around her drugstore

622
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,640
are royal relatives and nobles.

623
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,550
None will turn to her for a treatment.

624
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,480
She didn't come here

625
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,640
for business.

626
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,670
And her

627
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,270
drugstore shares the same name

628
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,070
with the princess.

629
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,910
If she is targeted,

630
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,000
it'll be troublesome.

631
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,480
I think she is asking for troubles.

632
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,030
She wants others to know the drugstore.

633
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,720
I'll keep an eye on Jiuling Drugstore.

634
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,670
I said nothing.

635
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,520
I think she came here

636
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,880
to avenge her father.

637
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,880
Hurry up.

638
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,480
Jiuling Drugstore.

639
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,910
Your Ladyship,

640
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,430
we've walked

641
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,150
on this street for 3 times.

642
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,310
Can we go to another street?

643
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,030
Are you tired?

644
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,790
Let's take

645
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,760
a break ahead.

646
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,430
OK.

647
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,430
Mrs. Zhou and relatives

648
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,520
of Marquis of Dingyuan are friends.

649
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,960
If I can cure his relatives,

650
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,070
I'll get a chance

651
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,520
to get chose to him

652
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,670
to find out about Jiurong and Jiuli.

653
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,880
Sister,

654
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,430
do you sell candies?

655
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,120
No,

656
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,070
but

657
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,360
if you want candies,

658
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,640
I have candies.

659
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,480
Great.

660
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,520
I want candies.

661
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,240
Liu'er.

662
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,640
I want. It's yummy.

663
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,550
Well.

664
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,070
One for each.

665
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,720
OK.

666
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,480
These are for you.

667
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,190
Well, be careful.  Be careful.

668
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,880
Be careful. Be careful.

669
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,790
One for each.

670
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,670
Be careful. All are for you.

671
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,390
Be careful. Be careful.

672
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:14,910
Does it taste good?

673
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,550
Yes.

674
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,360
Be careful.

675
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,390
Does it taste good?

676
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,360
Be careful.

677
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,310
What are you doing?

678
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,270
What are you doing?

679
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,150
Who are you?

680
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,720
Mother.

681
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,550
Bao'er, come here. Look, candy.

682
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,310
Kids, come here.

683
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,430
Kids, come here.

684
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,670
What's this in your hand?

685
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,310
Throw it away.

686
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,960
What are you doing?

687
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
These are preserves

688
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,640
specially made by Jiuling Drugstore.

689
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,550
They are precious.

690
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,520
I've never heard of

691
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,640
such a drugstore.

692
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,550
You frauds.

693
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,910
Throw it away.

694
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,480
Throw it away.

695
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,720
Don't eat it.

696
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:40,960
Excuse me.

697
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,600
We're hand-bell doctors.

698
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,640
Look.

699
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,520
I can't read.

700
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,030
Look at you two.

701
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,840
You're pretty.

702
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,360
Take a decent job.

703
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,430
Don't cheat others.

704
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,480
Let's go.

705
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,790
Well.

706
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,030
Listen.

707
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,360
Neither talk to strangers like them

708
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,240
nor take their things,

709
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:03,880
or

710
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,150
you may be hurt.

711
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,720
OK.

712
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,310
Throw it away.

713
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,880
Go. Go.

714
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,840
Go home. Go.

715
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,030
She goes too far.

716
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,640
Don't be fooled

717
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,070
by others easily.

718
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,120
Yes.

719
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,000
Your Ladyship,

720
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,120
instead of treating patients in the drugstore,

721
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,640
you work as a hand-bell doctor.

722
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,190
It's tiring and annoying.

723
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,270
It doesn't matter.

724
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,790
It takes a process.

725
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,520
Go.

726
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,150
Ding.

727
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,240
Young Master.

728
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,840
Have you sent my gift?

729
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,430
It was sent early in the morning.

730
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,030
Young Master,

731
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,480
you've told me many times.

732
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
I won't forget it.

733
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,790
Go.

734
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,430
Let's have a look

735
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,150
and congratulate her in person.

736
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,190
Young Master,

737
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,000
you've been caring

738
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,640
much about Miss Jun.

739
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,150
Your engagement

740
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,910
was broken off.

741
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,270
It's improper

742
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,760
to go there, right?

743
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,720
Can't we be friends as the engagement was broken off?

744
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,550
We were engaged out of our parents'  will

745
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,720
instead of that of our own.

746
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,880
It doesn't matter.

747
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,600
Let's go.

748
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,120
Young Master,

749
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,760
it's here.

750
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,120
Hot steamed buns.

751
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,000
Yes,

752
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
it's here.

753
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,120
It was open when I sent

754
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,880
gift here this morning.

755
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,240
Why is it closed now?

756
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,960
Steamed buns.

757
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,190
Sir,

758
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,270
excuse me.

759
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,480
Isn't Jiuling Drugstore

760
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,760
just opened today?

761
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,070
Why is it closed?

762
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,150
I feel puzzled, too.

763
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,430
After all these years in business,

764
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,120
it's the first time I've seen that

765
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,190
a store is closed

766
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,640
on its first day of opening.

767
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:51,960
Thanks.

768
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,430
You're welcome.

769
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,840
Young Master,

770
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,030
what shall we do?

771
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,480
Shall

772
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,310
we wait?

773
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,360
Forget it.

774
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,910
She must have her own reasons

775
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,000
for closing it.

776
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,360
Let's come another day.

777
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,760
Hot steamed buns.

778
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,190
Highly skilled doctor

779
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,760
of Jiuling Drugstore

780
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,719
can work miracles

781
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,239
and cure

782
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,390
all kinds of complicated diseases.

783
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,350
Highly skilled doctor

784
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,000
of Jiuling Drugstore

785
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,869
can work miracles…

786
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,909
Your Ladyship,

787
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,999
though I try hard,

788
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,560
no one turns to us for help.

789
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,149
I'm starving.

790
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,960
I've seen that

791
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,190
you're hungry.

792
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,720
Thank you for your hard work today.

793
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,280
Tell me

794
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,910
what you want to eat.

795
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,670
Meat.

796
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,799
Meat?

797
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,150
I know a restaurant offering tasty meat.

798
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,000
Where is it?

799
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,560
Is it far away?

800
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,870
It's just ahead.

801
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,520
Let's yell and go.

802
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Highly skilled doctor

803
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,560
of Jiuling Drugstore

804
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,190
can work miracles…

805
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,430
Jiuling.

806
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,320
Lord Lu,

807
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,830
I'm Jiuli.

808
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,560
Your Highness.

809
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,630
She never drank.

810
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,590
Your Ladyship,

811
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,320
I didn't expect that you can drink a lot.

812
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,350
You may not believe it,

813
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,000
actually

814
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,430
this is the first time

815
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,800
I drink.

816
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,320
Then don't drink so fast,

817
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,760
or,

818
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,150
or you'll be drunk.

819
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,350
Well.

820
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,520
Cheers.

821
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,080
You,

822
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,350
you drink so much.

823
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,150
Is there anything upsetting you?

824
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,720
I'm upset.

825
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,320
What upset you?

826
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,280
I can't protect those

827
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,320
who are the most important to me.

828
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,110
I'm useless.

829
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,670
Your Ladyship.

830
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:13,960
Your,

831
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,240
Your Ladyship, what did you say?

832
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,870
I didn't hear clearly.

833
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,350
Nothing.

834
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,110
We have drunk it all.

835
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,960
Liu'er, buy

836
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
more liquor for me.

837
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,670
I can't leave you along here.

838
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,670
Waiter, a jug of liquor.

839
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,590
Coming. Don't worry.

840
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,000
I'll

841
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,240
roast this meat

842
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,720
for you

843
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,800
and

844
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
wait for you

845
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,280
to eat.

846
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,080
It's hot. Don't get hurt.

847
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,480
I promise,

848
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,520
when you come back,

849
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,150
all meat will be ready.

850
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,670
The meat is not important.

851
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,480
Be careful not to get hurt.

852
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,630
Can you stay here alone?

853
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,830
Relax. Just go.

854
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,870
I'll be back soon. Don't worry.

855
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,560
Wait for me.

856
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,040
OK.

857
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,080
Go.

858
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,520
Wait for me here.

859
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,560
Sir, see you.

860
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,480
Your Highness,

861
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,190
rest early.

862
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,030
