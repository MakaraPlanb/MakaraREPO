00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14

Sir,

this way, please.

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,160
Please.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
It smells good.

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,470
Why are you here?

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,670
Why can't I be here?

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,720
What's going on?

37
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,270
It's a long story.

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,190
Well,

39
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,670
this way.

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,550
This way, please.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,630
Sit. Sit.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,910
And this one.

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,320
You

44
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,830
followed me

45
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,750
to Zezhou,

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,910
and to

47
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,720
the Mansion of Prince Huai.

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,240
You still follow me

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,800
when I'm here to drink.

50
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,240
What do you mean?

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,080
Answer me.

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you mean?

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,110
You must feel bad coming here alone 

54
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,160
to avenge your family.

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,910
I feel bad too.

56
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,080
Miss Jun,

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
are you in a bad mood?

58
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,720
People drink

59
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,470
for a better mood.

60
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,520
We can drink,

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,190
but it's better not to drink too much.

62
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,320
Sanbing.

63
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,390
How much should we drink

64
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,440
in a good mood?

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,080
How much

66
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,470
should we drink

67
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,440
in a bad mood?

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,160
It varies

69
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,110
from person to person.

70
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,800
Or

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
you may tell me your problem.

72
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,200
I will analyze it for you.

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,830
Only the wearer knows

74
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,110
where the shoes pain.

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
If you tell me,

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,000
I probably know.

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,390
Tell me.

78
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,830
Maybe I know it.

79
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,440
I…

80
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,270
I will not tell you.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,670
Oh, no.

82
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,600
Liu'er's roast meat

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,040
is charred.

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,350
Boss,

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,550
one more plate of meat.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,640
On me.

87
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,160
Okay.

88
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,040
Two plates of meat for Table 2.

89
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,000
I have money.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,670
It'll be served in a minute.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,670
I know.

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,200
I talked to you,

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,720
so the meat is charred.

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,830
Just take it as my apology.

95
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,600
Boss,

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
five plates of meat.

97
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,270
Okay.

98
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,070
Wait a minute.

99
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,830
Here is the meat.

100
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
You have this piece.

101
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
Do not let Liu'er see it.

102
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,510
When I was happy,

103
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,390
I never drank.

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,390
Do you know why?

105
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,390
Why?

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,880
Because I thought

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,950
I didn't need to drink

108
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,830
as I wasn't bothered by anything.

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,950
Right?

110
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,720
I was happy.

111
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,110
Why 

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,070
should I drink?

113
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,000
In the past,

114
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,070
I was so happy.

115
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,040
I was so happy

116
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,160
every day.

117
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,880
So I didn't need to drink.

118
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,550
No.

119
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,950
Well,

120
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,480
people may drink

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,390
in a good mood.

122
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,160
When the soldiers come back

123
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,040
in triumph,

124
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,550
they can drink for the victory.

125
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,670
When we are in a bad mood,

126
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,390
we should not drink alone,

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,070
cuz it will upset you more.

128
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,440
So you should drink with friends

129
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,600
to be happy

130
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,550
and leave all your worries behind.

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,270
That will be so good.

132
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,200
It makes sense.

133
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,230
Baotang.

134
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
Baotang.

135
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,880
Miss, Miss Jun.

136
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Drink with us.

137
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,270
Is it proper?

138
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,160
Okay, okay.

139
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,480
Come on.

140
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,040
Sanbing, come on.

141
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,830
Let me introduce.

142
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,480
This is Li Sanbing,

143
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,440
our elder brother.

144
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,670
He ranks first,

145
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,160
he ranks second

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,720
and I rank third in seniority.

147
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,110
Sanbing. This is Miss Jun.

148
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,350
Miss Jun,

149
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,070
I know you very well by reputation.

150
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,720
What's going on?

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,640
Drink this up,

152
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,390
Sanbing.

153
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,160
Well, well, Miss Jun.

154
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,230
Don't, don't drink so much.

155
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,950
Sit. Sit. Sit.

156
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,350
-Sanbing, I have drunk it up. -Drink it up.

157
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,070
Sanbing.

158
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,160
Your Ladyship, I've bought the liquor.

159
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,390
Liu'er.

160
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,270
You are back finally, Liu'er.

161
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,920
Mr. Ling, you…

162
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
Move the stool over.

163
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay, okay, okay.

164
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,720
Move the stool over. Move the stool over.

165
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,000
Move the stool over.

166
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,640
Let's drink together.

167
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,000
Fill Mr. Ling's bowl.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,760
Come on, Mr. Ling.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
Let me fill your bowl.

170
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,760
I'll do it. I'll do it.

171
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,550
Come on.

172
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,510
Drink.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,880
Drink. Drink.

174
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,760
Drink. Drink.

175
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,350
Chengyu,

176
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,520
eat more.

177
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,710
You will go to the firm for business later.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,760
Eat more.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,670
Thank, mother.

180
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,440
It's a letter from the capital.

181
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,150
It's from my cousin.

182
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,710
Give it to me.

183
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,280
Read it after the meal.

184
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,440
The dishes will be cold later.

185
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,030
Grandma,

186
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,640
I am full.

187
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,230
You enjoy it.

188
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,550
Jiuling Drugstore

189
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,550
is opened in the capital as expected.

190
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,550
How's the opening going?

191
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,150
The beginning is the most difficult part.

192
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,280
It will go smooth.

193
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
Give the letter to me.

194
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,640
Let me have a look.

195
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,000
It's not a letter from Jiuling,

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,590
but a complaint letter from Shopkeeper Liu.

197
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,790
Grandma,

198
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,230
what complaint?

199
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,910
On the first day of opening,

200
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,320
she closed the store

201
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,080
and walked on the street as a hand-bell.

202
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,350
On the second day of the opening,

203
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,440
she got drunk

204
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,550
and slept

205
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,470
till noon.

206
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,230
Grandma,

207
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,440
Jiuling must have

208
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,710
her reasons for these things.

209
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,230
What do you plan to do?

210
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,080
I plan to 

211
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,030
write to Shopkeeper Liu

212
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,520
to ask him to

213
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,760
follow all arrangements of Jiuling.

214
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,350
They should do

215
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,350
as Jiuling says

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,910
and should not

217
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,080
disobey her instructions.

218
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,960
In the past,

219
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,470
you were against her in everything.

220
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,000
Now

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,520
you trust her most.

222
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,880
Go to write to her.

223
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,910
Tell her

224
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,000
do as she wants.

225
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,110
Thank you, grandma.

226
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,350
Go.

227
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,670
Move to the left.

228
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,550
To the left.

229
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,110
Exert strength on your right hand.

230
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,320
Keep balance.

231
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,550
You…

232
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:48,880
You…

233
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,790
I taught you so many times.

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,280
Why haven't you learned it yet?

235
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,110
Shut up.

236
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,230
I've practiced it for long.

237
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,470
I also want to do it well.

238
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,910
I don't mean to blame you. Move to the left a little.

239
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,670
To the left.

240
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,640
How about

241
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,590
letting me push it?

242
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,030
It's the same.

243
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,350
We don't need to divide the duty so clearly.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,710
Your duty is 

245
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,230
to provide sugar figurine molds and materials,

246
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,080
while I will sell the figurines.

247
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,080
I didn't hire you to help me.

248
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,470
Well, go get busy.

249
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,400
Sell sugar figurines.

250
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Fine.

251
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,230
I'm going.

252
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,960
Just go.

253
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,520
Perfumed sachets.

254
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,550
Have a look.

255
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,280
Well.

256
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,520
Take it.

257
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,080
Okay.

258
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,470
Look, it's so fresh. I would like to buy some.

259
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,470
I planted all these on my own.

260
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,350
They are safe

261
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,320
and fresh.

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,110
Kites.

263
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,400
Okay.

264
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:43,910
Thank you.

265
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,910
Be careful.

266
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,710
Come again next time.

267
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,400
Okay.

268
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,400
Pick one.

269
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Come on. Have a look.

270
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,640
Have a look. Have a look.

271
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,350
It's cheap.

272
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,150
Come on.

273
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,670
Feather dusters.

274
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,760
Fresh cabbage.

275
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,640
Good feather dusters.

276
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,520
Fresh eggplants.

277
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,150
Come to have a look.

278
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,470
Have a look. Have a look.

279
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,230
There…

280
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,200
Yell for it.

281
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,670
I taught you many times.

282
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,030
Why don't you yell for it?

283
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,080
It's delicious and interesting.

284
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,150
Vegetables.

285
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,200
Have a look at the feather dusters.

286
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,350
I planted all the vegetables.

287
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,550
Preserved candied fruits.

288
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,590
Newly made perfumed sachets.

289
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,150
Have a look.

290
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,280
Yell.

291
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,590
Sugar…

292
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,400
Sugar figurines…

293
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,550
Girl,

294
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,150
would like a sugar figurine?

295
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,550
No, thanks.

296
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,400
I want this one.

297
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,880
Kid,

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,880
would you like a sugar figurine?

299
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,550
Yes, yes, yes.

300
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,880
Here you are.

301
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:50,910
Go.

302
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,110
Come again next time.

303
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,200
Be careful.

304
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,670
Come again next time.

305
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,760
Sir, come to have a look.

306
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,230
Yummy candies.

307
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,150
Sugar figurines!

308
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
Yummy sugar figurines!

309
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,910
Sweet and scented sugar figurines!

310
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,200
Fresh vegetables.

311
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,030
Look. Have a look.

312
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,590
Kid,

313
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,440
would you like a sugar figurine?

314
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,550
I want this one.

315
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,440
Look at the feather dusters.

316
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,150
Here you are.

317
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,150
Thank you.

318
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,590
How much?

319
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,110
Five cents.

320
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,000
Here you are.

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,030
Fresh vegetables.

322
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:22,840
Thank you.

323
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,590
Come again next time.

324
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,550
Go.

325
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,790
Come on, girl. Have a look.

326
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,670
Sugar figurines!

327
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,320
Sweet and scented sugar figurines!

328
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,440
Kid, be careful.

329
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,280
Would you like a sugar figurine?

330
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,670
-I want this one. -Which one do you like?

331
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,520
I like this one.

332
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,400
Five cents for one.

333
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,790
So cute.

334
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,640
Thank you.

335
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,350
Do you like it?

336
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,200
Here you are.

337
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,710
Thanks.

338
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,000
Come again next time.

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,470
Thank you.

340
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,150
Have a look.

341
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Sugar figurines!

342
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,470
Would you like a sugar figurine?

343
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,080
Sugar figurines!

344
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,470
Sweet and scented sugar figurines!

345
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,400
Cabbage!

346
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,200
Sugar figurines!

347
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,710
Sweet and scented sugar figurines!

348
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,080
You all will have one.

349
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Take it easy. Take it easy.

350
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,440
-Give me one. -You all will have one.

351
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,350
Be careful. Be careful.

352
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,080
Be careful.

353
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,960
You will have one.

354
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,110
You will have one. You will have one. You will have one.

355
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,880
Sister,

356
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,350
what are the  characters?

357
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,110
They are "Jiu Ling Tang".

358
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,520
It's the name of my drugstore.

359
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,520
Yummy.

360
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,550
Yummy?

361
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,790
I will bring you more candies in the future.

362
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,910
Yummy. Okay.

363
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,320
Look.

364
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,080
I will give you one more.

365
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,000
She is really a hand-bell doctor.

366
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
It has been several days.

367
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,280
They walk in the streets

368
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,840
and give candied fruits to kids.

369
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,760
Some parents went to them.

370
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,440
So,

371
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,400
they all know Jiuling Drugstore?

372
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,910
They know.

373
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,760
Each has two ones. But…

374
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,640
Only two.

375
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
But what?

376
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,200
Go on.

377
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,590
But they said

378
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,640
if Jiuling Drugstore

379
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
keeps disturbing residents,

380
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,960
-they… -Be careful. You all will have it.

381
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,550
They will report it to the government.

382
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,030
Yes.

383
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,590
Shopkeeper,

384
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,960
shall we stop her?

385
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,710
How can we stop her?

386
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Young Master wrote in reply that

387
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,760
we should follow Miss Jun's arrangements.

388
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,110
Without her instruction,

389
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,910
we can't act rashly.

390
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,320
Tomorrow?

391
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,790
-We will come again tomorrow. -Leave her alone.

392
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,230
Isn't she

393
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,280
the wife of

394
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,350
Lord Zhou?

395
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,590
You are so nice.

396
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,470
Your teeth will be decayed if you eat too much.

397
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,200
Be careful.

398
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
Give me two.

399
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,080
Be careful, madame.

400
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,280
Kids,

401
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,280
come on.

402
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,440
Play with me.

403
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,320
Come on.

404
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,030
Run.

405
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,200
I haven't played with you yet.

406
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,960
Lord Zhou

407
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,550
often makes trouble out of nothing.

408
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,710
Shopkeeper,

409
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,230
how about we

410
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,320
go to help them?

411
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,880
Wait.

412
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
Let's wait and watch.

413
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,550
They have all run away.

414
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,640
They don't play with me.

415
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,200
Madame.

416
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,110
Girl,

417
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,910
you have been walking in this street

418
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,230
ringing your bell

419
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,400
for several days.

420
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,840
What do you want to do?

421
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,910
Madame,

422
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,350
I'm a hand-bell doctor from Jiuling Drugstore.

423
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,000
Does anyone in your mansion

424
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,110
need interrogation for treatment?

425
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,320
Cure all kinds of complicated diseases?

426
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,960
Work miracles?

427
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Your herbs can bring about a cure?

428
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,790
You are so confident.

429
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,230
If I am not skilled,

430
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,350
I dare not become a doctor.

431
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,670
But,

432
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,080
since you have a clinic,

433
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,110
you should treat patients in the clinic.

434
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,960
If you are a hand-bell doctor,

435
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,550
you won't have a clinic.

436
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,350
Why do you

437
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,760
walk around

438
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,030
as a hand-bell doctor

439
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,150
in the name of your clinic?

440
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,200
Madame,

441
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
Jiuling Drugstore is just opened,

442
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,790
and many people don't know about it.

443
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:46,840
I go out

444
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,710
as a hand-bell doctor

445
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,280
so that people can come to me for treatment.

446
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,550
Girl,

447
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,200
tell you what?

448
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,150
You are in the capital.

449
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,960
There are three clinics

450
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,590
on this street only.

451
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,200
Though

452
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,760
the doctors are not famous,

453
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,790
they are highly skilled.

454
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,229
We may turn to them

455
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,000
when sick.

456
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,069
We don't need

457
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,949
a hand-bell doctor like you.

458
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,470
Madame,

459
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,680
I can cure

460
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,000
some diseases,

461
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,070
while other doctors may not.

462
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,000
For example,

463
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I see that you are netted by

464
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,310
an ill omen.

465
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,040
Pah, pah, pah.

466
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,350
So unlucky.

467
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,110
You fraud!

468
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,950
Leave. Leave.

469
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,640
What are you doing?

470
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,880
My lady said you are netted by an ill omen,

471
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,590
so it is the truth.

472
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,950
Madame,

473
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,430
you look depressed

474
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,310
with a dark ophryon,

475
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,430
and you can't walk very steadily.

476
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,950
I think you

477
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,230
can't sleep well recently.

478
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,520
If it is not improved,

479
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,880
you will fall apart.

480
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,310
Nonsense.

481
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,040
I'm telling you,

482
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,920
I,

483
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,400
I remind you out of kindness.

484
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,430
If you want to cure diseases and treat people,

485
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,470
you should go to

486
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,920
the countryside

487
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,190
where there is a lack of doctors and herbs.

488
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,680
Don't try to

489
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,760
fool people in the capital.

490
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,350
You can't win people's favor here.

491
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,920
Go, go, go.

492
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,560
Go.

493
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,040
Go.

494
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,470
You…

495
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,830
Ask someone to

496
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,800
clean this area.

497
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,310
Do not let everybody in.

498
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:12,920
Got it.

499
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,070
Go.

500
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,560
Be careful, madame.

501
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,950
Liu'er,

502
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,950
let's go.

503
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,640
Okay.

504
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,350
Well,

505
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,800
Miss Jun

506
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,110
is really patient

507
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,230
and tolerant.

508
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,430
Shopkeeper Liu,

509
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,190
shall we 

510
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,520
go on following them?

511
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,160
No.

512
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,310
Let's go back to Jiuling Drugstore.

513
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,430
When she goes back for lunch,

514
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,680
I will talk to her

515
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,040
in person.

516
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,560
Let me take it.

517
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,160
Be careful.

518
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,070
-Miss Jun. -Shopkeeper Liu.

519
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,470
You are back.

520
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,430
Yes.

521
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,520
Shopkeeper Liu.

522
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,950
I want to

523
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,110
have a talk

524
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,280
with you.

525
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,590
Go ahead.

526
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,680
Miss Jun,

527
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,190
you are a doctor.

528
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,520
You should not

529
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,470
say someone has an ill omen in the first meeting.

530
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,350
It is improper.

531
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,110
You know it?

532
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,350
Miss Jun,

533
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,560
pardon me for speaking frankly.

534
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,470
Did you

535
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,590
plan to

536
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,350
fool her

537
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,590
or try luck?

538
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,400
Shopkeeper Liu,

539
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,160
we did not fool her.

540
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,710
Liu'er,

541
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,400
I saw that.

542
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,830
Miss Jun said some unlucky

543
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,160
and mysterious words.

544
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,710
Ghost exists in people's heart.

545
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,520
God exists in people's belief.

546
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,800
When ill, one is upset.

547
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,000
When weak, one is attacked by evil things.

548
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,310
Mrs. Zhou

549
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,920
is absent-minded

550
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,830
as she is weak

551
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,760
and lacks

552
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,680
energy.

553
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,830
You mean

554
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,880
Mrs. Zhou

555
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
is really ill.

556
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,830
Yes.

557
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,190
Even so,

558
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
you can say that

559
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,070
she is ill

560
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,350
rather than that

561
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,350
she is netted by an ill omen.

562
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,190
A disease may kill a person.

563
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,110
This is an ill omen.

564
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,110
Let's go.

565
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,560
Those who need to see a hand-bell doctor

566
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,070
believe you.

567
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,190
Ding,

568
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,110
will Miss Jun go to the west of the city today?

569
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,040
I guess she will.

570
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,560
Miss Jun hasn't covered all parts

571
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,590
of the western city yesterday.

572
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,190
Foster-brother

573
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,520
of Eleventh's cousin

574
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,190
lives in the west of the city.

575
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,710
Go tell him

576
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,830
to let Miss Jun treat the disease.

577
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,680
Shall I tell him

578
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,110
you ask him to do it?

579
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,350
No.

580
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,920
You go to chat and drink with him,

581
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,830
telling him the matter in Runan.

582
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,400
You are so clever.

583
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,400
In this case,

584
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,590
he will not doubt it.

585
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,560
And

586
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,040
Miss Jun will not doubt it either.

587
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,800
Young Master,

588
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,920
you are so good to

589
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,880
Miss Jun.

590
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,880
It is because she is good.

591
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,680
If she does not have good skills,

592
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,110
I will not do this.

593
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,160
So,

594
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,880
if someone else has such good skills,

595
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,280
would you do the same?

596
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,950
Go.

597
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,800
Don't delay it.

598
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,230
Other people are not her.

599
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,070
Of course I wouldn't do the same.

600
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Highly skilled doctor

601
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,190
of Jiuling Drugstore

602
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,280
can work miracles

603
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,710
and…

604
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,520
Sister, I want a candy.

605
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,520
I want it too.

606
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,070
We did not bring candied fruits today.

607
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,880
We will bring some to you tomorrow.

608
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,070
Please give me one.

609
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,160
We will bring you some next time.

610
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,800
Girl,

611
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,190
are you Miss Jun?

612
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,560
Yes, I am.

613
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,230
You look so young.

614
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,190
Are you daughter of

615
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,280
miracle-working doctor Jun?

616
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,310
What I said to him

617
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,190
while drinking liquor is useful.

618
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,350
I have completed the task from young master.

619
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,400
Your Ladyship,

620
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,830
she knows master.

621
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,680
Yes.

622
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,800
I know.

623
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,590
The Jun family is famous.

624
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,590
Come on.

625
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,520
Check me

626
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,640
to see

627
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,520
if I have any problems.

628
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,430
Okay.

629
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
You are very healthy.

630
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,950
Impossible.

631
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,560
Check again.

632
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,040
Do I have an ill omen?

633
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,160
Do I need to take medicine?

634
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,280
Madame,

635
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,920
I took your pulse.

636
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,800
You are in good health

637
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,590
without an ill omen.

638
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,680
You don't deserve my treatment.

639
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,950
You…

640
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
How could you do this?

641
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,680
What a doctor!

642
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,710
I don't think you are skilled at all.

643
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,000
You even refuse to check carefully.

644
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,430
You are not a skilled doctor!

645
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,830
How arrogant!

646
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,040
You don't deserve to be a doctor.

647
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,000
Go.

648
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,800
I won't turn to her.

649
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,710
Madame,

650
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,710
you don't have an ill omen,

651
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,680
so you don't deserve my treatment.

652
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,230
Mrs. Wang Cao kept yelling in the street for hours.

653
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,160
Young Master,

654
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,280
you know

655
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,920
what kind of person Mrs. Wang Cao is.

656
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,350
She will keep that 

657
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,640
in mind for a lifetime.

658
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,430
Now all people in the capital

659
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,430
think Miss Jun

660
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,590
is a cheating doctor

661
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,110
without mercy.

662
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,590
Jiuling Drugstore

663
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,880
will really be closed

664
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,950
in the near future.

665
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,310
Young Master,

666
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,760
I did not finish the task well.

667
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,640
You are not to blame.

668
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,160
It is my fault.

669
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,000
What

670
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,280
shall we do now?

671
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,640
She is an extraordinary girl.

672
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,310
Maybe she is setting an exquisite trap.

673
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,710
I'd better not interfere.

674
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,230
I should wait and watch.

675
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,590
What did she say?

676
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,190
You don't have an ill omen,

677
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,190
so you don't deserve my treatment.

678
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Did she really say so?

679
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,040
Her original words.

680
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,640
Zan,

681
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,190
you have no idea.

682
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,350
In half a day,

683
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,920
all people

684
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,640
in the capital

685
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,760
know that.

686
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,710
Miss Jun

687
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,160
always does something unexpected.

688
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,920
Yes.

689
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,310
I think she

690
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,400
is really weird.

691
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,520
In fact…

692
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,350
Zan, I feel a pain in my arm suddenly.

693
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,280
Shall I

694
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,350
turn to Miss Jun?

695
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,160
Will she check me

696
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,070
to see if I have an ill omen?

697
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,310
It's easy.

698
00:24:59,310 --> 00:24:59,880
I will help you.

699
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,560
The pain is gone suddenly.

700
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,880
In fact, she did this

701
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,640
with a purpose.

702
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,400
What purpose?

703
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,190
In this way, all people in the capital

704
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,430
know Jiuling Drugstore.

705
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,830
Though most are bad remarks,

706
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,000
at least they know it.

707
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,310
I see.

708
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,760
She wants to be famous in this way.

709
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,230
And she may cure

710
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,280
a complicated disease,

711
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,110
so that people will forget the bad remarks

712
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,950
and praise her skills.

713
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:27,950
Zan.

714
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,800
It is a wise trick.

715
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,560
-It is a wise trick. -You know very well

716
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,560
about Miss Jun recently.

717
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,830
She was like this in Runan.

718
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,350
But this time,

719
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,280
her method is novel,

720
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,350
so it may cause her trouble.

721
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,830
Let's not talk about her.

722
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,310
What to eat?

723
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,640
I think 

724
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,710
the rotisserie where we dined last time is pretty good.

725
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,280
No.

726
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,230
What if we meet a drunken lady again?

727
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,710
That's exactly what you want.

728
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,520
Madame,

729
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,000
this is soup for soothing the nerves.

730
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,280
Madame,

731
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,560
are you tired?

732
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,280
Do you need to go to bed after drinking the soup?

733
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,350
I'm not tired.

734
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,710
I will sleep later.

735
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,950
Let me tell you

736
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,190
a joke.

737
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,590
It is interesting.

738
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,950
All people

739
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,880
are talking about it.

740
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,110
What joke?

741
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,190
Miss Jun 

742
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,560
who always walked in the street 

743
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,070
a couple days ago 

744
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,400
met a trouble today.

745
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,230
No one

746
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,830
turned to her

747
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,640
for curing disease.

748
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,560
Mrs. Wang Cao

749
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,520
asked her to see her,

750
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,400
but she refused,

751
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,110
saying that she did not have an ill omen

752
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,830
and did not deserve her treatment.

753
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,070
All people laughed at her.

754
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,680
Wet nurse,

755
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,280
shut up

756
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,590
and leave.

757
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,560
Did you tell anyone else

758
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,680
what Miss Jun told me a couple days ago?

759
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,470
Though

760
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,190
all men are born equal,

761
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,110
Buddha helps some people only.

762
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,640
A couple days ago, she stopped me

763
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,110
and told me I had an ill omen.

764
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,310
Did she

765
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,920
really see something?

766
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,230
Madame,

767
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,280
what are you looking for?

768
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,070
A kid is crying.

769
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
It is crying.

770
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,560
Don't you hear it?

771
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,800
I really don't hear anything.

772
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,110
It's there.

773
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,830
There.

774
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,880
There.

775
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,920
Go.

776
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,470
Go.

777
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,190
Go to ask that hand-bell doctor to come.

778
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Quickly!

779
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,400
I got it.

780
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,640
No.

781
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,190
No.

782
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,040
No, no, no!

783
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:52,920
No.

784
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,280
No. It won't happen.

785
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,760
No.

786
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,640
Is Dr. Jun here?

787
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,950
-Dr. Jun? -Coming.

788
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,040
It's late.

789
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,800
What's the matter?

790
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,710
I'm from Lord Zhou's mansion.

791
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,950
I'm here to invite Miss Jun to see a patient.

792
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,560
Okay, wait a minute.

793
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,590
I'm going to call our young lady.

794
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,400
Okay.

795
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,000
Your Ladyship.

796
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,110
Madame,

797
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,110
I will give you a prescription

798
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,430
and you will drink

799
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,400
the herbal decoction

800
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,760
for half a month to recover.

801
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,350
Half a month?

802
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,830
I have been tormented by this disease for several years.

803
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,280
Imperial doctors have tried to cure it,

804
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,710
but nothing has changed.

805
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,000
Half a month?

806
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,950
How can I recover in half a month?

807
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,160
A mental problem should be solved mentally.

808
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,760
Madame,

809
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,400
I can solve your ill omen

810
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,590
as I can see it.

811
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,430
Trust me.

812
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,000
Please forgive my rudeness,

813
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,800
but do you have a kid?

814
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,070
I really did not have a choice.

815
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,000
My husband was in mourning.

816
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,070
If I gave birth to this kid,

817
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,590
his official career would be ruined.

818
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,560
Tell him that

819
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,560
I really wanted to keep him.

820
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I really

821
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,710
did not have a choice.

822
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,800
Madame,

823
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,280
he just misses you

824
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,000
and comes to see you.

825
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,110
No.

826
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,830
Please ask him to leave.

827
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,310
Miss Jun, I beg you.

828
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,230
Please get up, madame.

829
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,230
I beg you.

830
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
Please get up, madame.

831
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,110
Sit.

832
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,310
Liu'er.

833
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,160
Let her take the pills and use the soothing incense

834
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,110
for half a month.

835
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,710
Miss Jun,

836
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,760
can it work?

837
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,880
If you can sleep well,

838
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,640
the problem can be solved.

839
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,230
Your Ladyship,

840
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,110
how did you know

841
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,310
about her kid?

842
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,430
Did you really see it?

843
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Of course not.

844
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,560
I told that from the four ways of diagnosis.

845
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,430
Besides,

846
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,350
she always takes the doll.

847
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,310
That is why I knew it.

848
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I see.

849
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,430
Congratulations on

850
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,800
your first consultation fee, Miss Jun.

851
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,280
I knew what happened

852
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,280
yesterday.

853
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,880
Shopkeeper Liu,

854
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,640
it is too early.

855
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,160
I did not receive

856
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,280
the consultation fee yesterday.

857
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,430
You didn't receive it?

858
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
What happened?

859
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,230
Dr. Jun,

860
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,520
this is the agreed consultation fee.

861
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,190
Well,

862
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,710
give it to me.

863
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,070
Thank Mrs. Zhou for me.

864
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,760
5,000 taels as the consultation fee.

865
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,400
The exact amount.

866
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,430
5…

867
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,430
5…

868
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,920
5,000 taels?

869
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,470
Miss Jun,

870
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,680
you got so much

871
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,760
as the consultation fee?

872
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,230
Yes.

873
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,110
Not all people could

874
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,430
invite her ladyship for treatment.

875
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,400
First,

876
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,040
the disease

877
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,400
should deserve her treatment.

878
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,560
The consultation fee is less important.

879
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,040
Next, Jiuling Drugstore

880
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,560
will be widely known.

881
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,430
Your Ladyship,

882
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,520
do we go to the street today?

883
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,400
Yes.

884
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
People from the Sky Pavilion said

885
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,350
Lord Huang did not go anywhere

886
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,040
besides going to court.

887
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,310
What about Huang Ziqing?

888
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,280
The same as usual.

889
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,800
Relying on his father's influence,

890
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,950
he sells offices, barters ranks,

891
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,710
and acts tyrannically.

892
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,680
He only does

893
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,350
all kinds of bad things.

894
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,520
He deserves a whacking.

895
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,230
When I meet him…

896
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,230
Zan,

897
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,560
do you want to see

898
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,760
how Miss Jun

899
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,110
treats people?

900
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,070
I'm not going.

901
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,350
So beautiful.

902
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,190
And this color.

903
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,800
Highly skilled doctor

904
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
of Jiuling Drugstore

905
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,190
can cure all kinds of complicated diseases.

906
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,350
Come to have a look.

907
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,830
Have a look.

908
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,560
So beautiful.

909
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,560
Have a look.

910
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,800
Pouches.

911
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,229
Your Lordship?

912
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,840
What a coincidence.

913
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,949
Yes.

914
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,869
What a coincidence,

915
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,600
Miss Jun.

916
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,670
There is 

917
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,320
no good food and amusement here.

918
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,560
What are you doing here?

919
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,190
Do I only care about food

920
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,430
and amusement in your eyes?

921
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,760
Can't I do anything serious?

922
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,040
You are quick-tempered recently.

923
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,840
Liu'er,

924
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,950
give his lordship some herbs.

925
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,519
No need.

926
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,950
Baotang is wounded in his arm.

927
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,950
Check his wound.

928
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,559
I have recovered these two days.

929
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Don't bother.

930
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,390
Miss Jun, how about checking me

931
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,280
to see if I am ill?

932
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:46,949
No,

933
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,360
I should say to see if I have an ill omen.

934
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Okay.

935
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,430
Mind your behavior.

936
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,840
Stop joking. Stop it.

937
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,040
You are in good health.

938
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,840
No worries.

939
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,800
Miss Jun,

940
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,080
are you flirting with me?

941
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,230
Sanbing,

942
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,600
you are also flirted with.

943
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,280
So this is how it feels to be flirted with.

944
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,470
Why did you say also?

945
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,280
I see.

946
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,760
Miss Jun also flirted with Zan.

947
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,280
That's why Zan

948
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,670
dislikes Miss Jun.

949
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,760
I'm a doctor.

950
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,190
It's my duty to look,  listen, question and feel the pulse.

951
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,360
It's not flirtation.

952
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,430
Indeed.

953
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,870
Besides generals fighting on the battlefield,

954
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,870
only Miss Jun

955
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,600
has such temperament of being so calm.

956
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,560
Temperament?

957
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
She is just thick-skinned

958
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,520
without sense of shame.

959
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,670
I think his lordship

960
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,630
is much more thick-skinned

961
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,320
than her ladyship.

962
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,470
Someone

963
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,320
broke into her ladyship's bridal chamber

964
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,280
on her wedding night

965
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,600
without shame.

966
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,040
Someone

967
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,120
climbed over the wall

968
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,360
into her ladyship's yard

969
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,760
from time to time.

970
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,390
We may know a man's exterior but not his heart.

971
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,870
Is he thick-skinned?

972
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,360
You two know

973
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,150
what I did there.

974
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,670
We don't know.

975
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,560
Like lady,

976
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,470
like maid.

977
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,190
Let's go.

978
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,040
Well,

979
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Baotang and Sanbing

980
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,430
invite you to drink.

981
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,560
Would you like to go?

982
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,950
Sanbing and I sincerely invite you to drink.

983
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,430
And Zan.

984
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,430
I'm very busy.

985
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,520
Thank you.

986
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,760
Dr. Jun.

987
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,710
Dr. Jun.

988
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,760
I found you finally.

989
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,600
Look at me.

990
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,670
Do I have an ill omen?

991
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,040
No, you don't.

992
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,040
No?

993
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,600
How about going to my home

994
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
to see who has an ill omen?

995
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,430
I heard that

996
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,950
you cured Mrs. Zhou

997
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,230
of her mental anxiety

998
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,760
which has troubled her for years.

999
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,520
It's because 

1000
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,520
you saw her ill omen

1001
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,320
at a glance.

1002
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,390
Miss Jun,

1003
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,710
please go with me.

1004
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,320
Okay.

1005
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,910
Please lead the way.

1006
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,630
Miss Jun really has

1007
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,080
a unique way to see a patient.

1008
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,470
Yes,

1009
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,870
she is still not serious.

1010
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:44,870
Sanbing,

1011
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,520
I'm a bit hungry.

1012
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,230
Let's go to eat.

1013
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,360
Go, go, go.

1014
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,760
Wait for me.

1015
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,840
Dr. Jun, this way.

1016
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,120
If people like her

1017
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,870
turn to me one by one,

1018
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,600
I can gather fame

1019
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
bit by bit

1020
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,760
in different mansions,

1021
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,560
going from here

1022
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,800
to the Mansion of Prince Huai

1023
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,430
and to Jiuli and Jiurong.

1024
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,870
This day

1025
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,360
will arrive soon.

1026
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,270
