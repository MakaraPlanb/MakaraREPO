00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,540
Episode 18

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,190
Where are you going?

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm going to decoct herbs for His Highness Prince Huai.

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,470
Why don't you let someone else do this?

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,110
Isn't that faster?

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,470
I don't trust others.

22
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,960
Your Excellency knows

23
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,550
I came uninvited.

24
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,440
A lot of people are waiting to laugh at my failure.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,110
If I lose,

26
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,830
it will be a shame for me.

27
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,720
By the way,

28
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,550
no one is allowed to touch

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,670
what I use to decoct the herbs.

30
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,320
Otherwise,

31
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,550
if His Highness Prince Huai can't be cured,

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,670
it won't be my responsibility.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
Including Your Excellency.

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,830
Your Highness.

35
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,160
He's clean.

36
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,830
Do you also believe that

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,110
he has scrofula?

38
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,670
I don't know medicine.

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,600
The doctors said it was,

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,240
and so did Dr. Jun.

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,110
Naturally, it may be true.

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,720
Do you know

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,750
the name of Dr. Jun's clinic?

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,910
No.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,880
It's called

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,670
Jiuling Drugstore.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,720
And her name is Jun Jiuling.

48
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,320
Do you think it's a coincidence?

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,910
Yes.

50
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,190
Originally,

51
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,470
I didn't think it was appropriate to change the name.

52
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,960
But I failed to persuade her.

53
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,080
So now trouble comes.

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
I think Zhenzhen is a good name.

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
But she changed it.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,800
Mother.

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
She changed her name

58
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,720
for the inheritance of the Jun family's ancestral business.

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,960
It's to show

60
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,390
her determination to shoulder the responsibility.

61
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,960
This is to show her ambition,

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
not just a joke.

63
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,520
She has always been working hard

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
for that name.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,510
Therefore,

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,070
she can't change the name now.

67
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,760
Are you really willing to pay so much for her,

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,230
even the imperial decree?

69
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,920
Yes.

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,270
She wrote for it

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
or you want to give it to her?

72
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,550
She didn't ask me for it.

73
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,040
I want to give her.

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,760
Grandma,

75
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,550
Mother,

76
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,830
Jiuling brings luck to our Fang family.

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,350
When she came,

78
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
she cured my illness

79
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,200
and made our enemy killed.

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,230
She and our family depend on each other.

81
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,550
We should do our best

82
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,320
to save her life.

83
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,550
Only in this way

84
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,270
can we save our own lives.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,600
Chengyu.

86
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,640
You said so much.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,390
Is it because you like her?

88
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,200
I can't hide anything from you.

89
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,600
I thought

90
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,230
I was hiding well.

91
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,320
Your eyes can't hide your mind.

92
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
When you mention her,

93
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,390
your eyes are shining.

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,160
We all know

95
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,480
you took the initiative to spread false marriage

96
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,070
for the sake of her.

97
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
Actually,

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,830
if you didn't expose it,

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,790
no one would know the truth.

100
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,270
Wouldn't it

101
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,480
be better for you?

102
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,880
The previous marriage

103
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,830
was your deal with her.

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,880
I really like her.

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,230
So,

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,000
when she comes back,

107
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,270
I hope I can really marry her.

108
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,550
But

109
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,230
the premise is

110
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,350
she wants to.

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,880
Chengyu,

112
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,670
send her the decree.

113
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,550
Ask her to keep it in the Jiuling Drugstore.

114
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,950
Thank you, grandma.

115
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,510
Then I'll arrange it first.

116
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,790
Mother.

117
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,830
If it were you,

118
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,230
would you give up the name of Jiuling Drugstore?

119
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,600
We had lived a tough life

120
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,720
for so many years.

121
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,000
Had you ever thought of giving up?

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,760
To be honest,

123
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,670
yes.

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,510
But you went it through

125
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,110
and didn't give up.

126
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,600
Why?

127
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,350
Because I was not reconciled.

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,670
Yes.

129
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,270
Not reconciled.

130
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,510
It's all for the name.

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,550
Why should we give up?

132
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,040
Grandma.

133
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,200
will Chengyu's

134
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,320
love be in vain?

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,350
How can it be?

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,070
As long as he does something for love,

137
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,830
it's worthwhile.

138
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
Or love

139
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,510
is just love.

140
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,640
Love without any efforts

141
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
is pathetic.

142
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,070
Our Chengyu

143
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,200
is not that kind

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,640
of men disturbed by native love.

145
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,350
I'll support Jiurong.

146
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,720
You feed him the medicine.

147
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,320
Okay.

148
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,950
Are you the only daughter in your family?

149
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,350
Yes.

150
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,950
This hospital

151
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,720
is handed down from your ancestors?

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,390
It's true

153
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
for the Jiuling Drugstore.

154
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,550
Jiuling Drugstore

155
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,040
is a nice name.

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,830
The reason for this name

157
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,760
is also because that Jiuling

158
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,230
means longevity.

159
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,710
I also hope His Highness Prince Huai longevity.

160
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,709
I hope so.

161
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,150
Sister.

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Sister.

163
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,030
Sister.

164
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,960
Jiurong.

165
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,110
Your Highness.

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,880
Jiurong.

167
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,350
You're awake.

168
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,470
You scared me.

169
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,880
You had slept for days.

170
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,790
Are you feeling all right now?

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,880
Sister.

172
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,550
I dreamed that you and second sister

173
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
stayed with me.

174
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm here with you.

175
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,230
I'm always with you.

176
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,840
It's great that you are awake.

177
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,760
It's great that you are awake.

178
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,550
Jiurong, be good.

179
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,550
If you don't feel well,

180
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,880
just tell me.

181
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,350
Are you hungry?

182
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,960
Is there anything you want to eat?

183
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,110
Jiurong.

184
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,150
You,

185
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
who are you?

186
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm a doctor

187
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,110
who came to treat you.

188
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,550
It's great that you are awake.

189
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,470
Sister, I'm hungry.

190
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,520
Hungry?

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,710
Dr. Jun.

192
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,150
Can he eat now?

193
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,520
His Highness has passed the most difficult test.

194
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,840
He can eat.

195
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,200
Just plain food.

196
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,910
Okay.

197
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,080
Jiurong, be good.

198
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,110
Lie down.

199
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,200
Lie down and rest.

200
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,520
Dr. Jun, please take care of him.

201
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,350
I'll make

202
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,710
your favorite noodle soup with vegetables for you.

203
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,200
Thank you, Dr. Jun.

204
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Your Highness, rest assured.

205
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,280
Your Highness.

206
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,320
Do you feel uncomfortable?

207
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,400
No.

208
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,230
You've been sleeping for so long.

209
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,710
You

210
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,710
must be a little tired.

211
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,200
But it's okay.

212
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,590
Later

213
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,080
when you're feeling better,

214
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,640
you can walk outside.

215
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm a little tired.

216
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,520
Dr. Jun, please go out.

217
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Okay.

218
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,670
Your Highness.

219
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,670
Have a good rest.

220
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,350
Jiurong.

221
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,230
I failed to save father back then,

222
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,440
but I finally save you now.

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,280
You have to hold on.

224
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,880
You have to live strongly.

225
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Wait for me.

226
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,150
Jiuli,

227
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,840
Jiurong.

228
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,910
I promise you

229
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,080
I'll come back.

230
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,790
Today I made

231
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,790
a large bowl of noddle soup with vegetables.

232
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,590
Let me see how much you can eat.

233
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Jiuli knows to make

234
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,080
just a few simple dishes.

235
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,400
So she can't make many

236
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,520
such exquisite snacks and dishes.

237
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,080
Your Highness, please wait a minute.

238
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,230
What's wrong?

239
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,710
I'd like to see if the food is available.

240
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,670
Dr. Jun,

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
what do you mean?

242
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,080
Are you suspecting about

243
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,000
the food of Prince Huai's mansion?

244
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,440
After all, His Highness is taking medicine now.

245
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,790
I'm afraid he can't eat some food.

246
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,590
Can you tell us

247
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,470
what food he can't eat?

248
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,710
We can avoid it by then.

249
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,030
That's too many.

250
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,550
I change medicine for him every day.

251
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,640
It's hard to say.

252
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,080
Your Highness.

253
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,670
It's safe.

254
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,320
Have a taste.

255
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,350
Is it good?

256
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,440
I haven't eaten

257
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
the noodle soup with vegetables you made for a long time.

258
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,640
Last time I ate it

259
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,550
on your wedding day.

260
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,840
Then eat more today.

261
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,710
On your wedding day,

262
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,320
you got up early and made me the soup.

263
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,320
You almost

264
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,200
missed the time to put on makeup.

265
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,790
Thinking that after I got married,

266
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,910
I couldn't always be with you,

267
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,470
so I seize the chance

268
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,150
to cook for you.

269
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,910
How I wish you didn't get married.

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,880
Eat and sleep

271
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,080
without speaking.

272
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,350
If you keep talking,

273
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,960
your food will be cold.

274
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,110
Your Highness,

275
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,080
I'd like to decoct medicine for Prince Huai.

276
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,000
Take a big bite.

277
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,590
Your Majesty.

278
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,910
Commander Lu asked for meeting you.

279
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,640
Let him in.

280
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,280
Yes.

281
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,790
Your Majesty.

282
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,030
Prince Huai

283
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,760
has been cured by Dr. Jun dispatched by you.

284
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,790
He is cured?

285
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,880
Yes.

286
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,280
She can even cure scrofula?

287
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,230
Jun Jiuling

288
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,440
has excellent medical skills.

289
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,670
Jun Jiuling

290
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,799
makes more trouble.

291
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,560
I think

292
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,709
this is not a bad thing.

293
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,000
If Prince Huai

294
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,470
dies from scrofula this time,

295
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,160
although

296
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,560
everyone knows

297
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,160
this disease is extremely dangerous,

298
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,000
there would be inevitably nosy people

299
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:23,950
who make up rumors about the truth.

300
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,430
Even if you

301
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,190
blame Dr. Jun for this,

302
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,950
it will inevitably affect your good reputation.

303
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,280
Now Prince Huai is cured,

304
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,680
and all people

305
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,640
will only praise you for your kindness

306
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,400
and mercy

307
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,760
for the late emperor's son.

308
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,400
Why do I think

309
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,710
you are speaking for

310
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,160
Prince Huai and Jun Jiuling?

311
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,590
I dare not.

312
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm just

313
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,640
loyal to you.

314
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,640
Really?

315
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,280
Prince Huai is weak.

316
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,590
After this serious illness,

317
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,430
he will be weaker naturally.

318
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,800
It's common

319
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,000
for such a kid

320
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
to die young.

321
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,520
By then, the others

322
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,190
will only regret his early death

323
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,760
instead of doubting

324
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,040
about Your Majesty.

325
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,520
Miss Jun is really great.

326
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,920
She is able.

327
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,190
That's scrofula.

328
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,310
She is a great doctor.

329
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,190
She can bring a patient back to life.

330
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,110
They didn't cheat me.

331
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,190
Cheers.

332
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,830
Cheers. Cheers.

333
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,350
Yes, cheers.

334
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
The same place,

335
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,160
the same barbecue.

336
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,470
Although it's not the same person,

337
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,470
we still have to drink the same

338
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,520
Meixin Wine of Sanyuan Store.

339
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,640
Where did you learn this? It's frivolous.

340
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,470
Zan,

341
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,430
You wronged me.

342
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,760
I'm talking about wine.

343
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,110
Are you talking about someone?

344
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,400
Don't make fun of me.

345
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,470
You are hiding something.

346
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,000
Miss Jun cured Prince Huai.

347
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,470
Will the emperor

348
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,800
let her go?

349
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,430
That's right.

350
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,280
Unless someone pleaded for her.

351
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,430
You'll never guess

352
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,470
who pleaded for her.

353
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,680
Someone really pleaded for her?

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,560
Who?

355
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,760
Lu Yunqi.

356
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,800
No way.

357
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,310
Aren't Miss Jun

358
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,710
one of his enemies

359
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,590
because of the plaque of Jiuling Drugstore?

360
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,680
It's good enough for him not to maltreat her.

361
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,830
And he risked his life to plead for her?

362
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,070
Why did he do this?

363
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,350
Is it because of Miss Jun

364
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,280
cured Prince Huai,

365
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,280
so he simply plead

366
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,640
to avoid the blame

367
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,160
of the emperor?

368
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
I always think

369
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,520
it has something to do with their talk in the Jiuling Drugstore.

370
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,920
I got it!

371
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,280
Absolutely,

372
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,350
that's because he's afraid

373
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,310
that once Miss Jun is punished,

374
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,310
no one will prevent him from bad omens.

375
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,400
You are getting…

376
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:08,950
Drink, drink.

377
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,160
…more and more harsh.

378
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,350
I'm telling the truth.

379
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,830
I hope Jiurong

380
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,710
can have a good sleep today.

381
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,350
He will.

382
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,560
Jiuling.

383
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,040
I have a younger sister

384
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,920
who is also called Jiuling.

385
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,950
But

386
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,160
she's not as obedient as you.

387
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,920
She is a troublesome child.

388
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,590
Nonsense.

389
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,590
I'm not like this.

390
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,920
Then,

391
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,710
Your Highness's sister

392
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,560
is…

393
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,680
Your Excellency Lu.

394
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,950
Your Highness.

395
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,430
Now that Prince Huai is much better

396
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,880
and you have been with him for so many days,

397
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,110
you should take a rest.

398
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,800
Please go home with me.

399
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,760
Okay.

400
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,000
I leave him to you, Dr. Jun.

401
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,110
Your Highness, rest assured.

402
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,160
So you believe

403
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,070
the soul reincarnation?

404
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,160
I don't know.

405
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,470
I didn't believe it before.

406
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,800
But now,

407
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,800
I'd love to believe it.

408
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,830
Same name.

409
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,110
Same age.

410
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,760
Did Lu Yunqi

411
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,430
refer to her?

412
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,950
Your Highness, you are awake.

413
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,190
My sister has left?

414
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,230
Yes, Your Highness.

415
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,520
By order of Her Highness,

416
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,160
we've prepared your favorite pastries.

417
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,430
I'll get them for you right away.

418
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,920
His Highness is still taking medicine.

419
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,590
Sweets should be eaten later.

420
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,350
Then wait until he gets better.

421
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,230
He can eat as he likes.

422
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,560
You are awake.

423
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,070
Are you

424
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,040
feeling better?

425
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,040
You can't lie like this all the time.

426
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,830
You should go out and take more walk.

427
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,190
Then you'll be stronger.

428
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,680
Well,

429
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,920
it's a fine day today.

430
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,800
How about

431
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,760
taking a walk outside?

432
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,920
Can,

433
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,880
can I?

434
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,040
Of course.

435
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,920
Okay.

436
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,350
Go and prepare some dress for His Highness.

437
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,280
Yes.

438
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,800
Then,

439
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,880
drink the medicine first.

440
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,560
Look out.

441
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,430
Your Highness,

442
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,070
do you want to play on the swing?

443
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,470
Can I do that?

444
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,110
Go.

445
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,230
Here.

446
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,040
Watch out.

447
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,110
Shall I push you?

448
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,880
Okay.

449
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,920
Look out.

450
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,710
Come here.

451
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,830
One.

452
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,000
Two.

453
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,040
Three.

454
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,470
Is that OK?

455
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,310
Are you scared?

456
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,520
It's fun.

457
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,560
Higher.

458
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,520
Higher.

459
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,800
You are not afraid?

460
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,110
All right.

461
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,230
Then I'll push you higher.

462
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,520
One.

463
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,950
Two.

464
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,230
You are so brave.

465
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,190
So high!

466
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,000
I used to

467
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,470
play this often.

468
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,590
Then why

469
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,710
didn't you play it later?

470
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,280
Because they said

471
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,830
I should be

472
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,400
as mature and steady as adults.

473
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,760
You haven't been 13 years old yet.

474
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,710
So

475
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,950
you can play for fun.

476
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,830
They all say I'm an adult.

477
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,400
But you said I'm a kid.

478
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,070
Yeah.

479
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,950
You'll have plenty of time to be an adult.

480
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,950
You should enjoy your time as a kid now.

481
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,470
Right?

482
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,560
Dr. Jun,

483
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,070
I used to hide a toy here.

484
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,160
Do you know where I hid it?

485
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,760
Let me guess.

486
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,280
Did you hide it

487
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,350
under the bamboo?

488
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,430
No.

489
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,760
No?

490
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,070
Did you hide it behind the stone?

491
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,350
No.

492
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,590
Back then…

493
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,350
Where did you hide it?

494
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,880
Back then,

495
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,830
my second sister and I

496
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
hid it under this swing.

497
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,830
You are smart.

498
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,880
Your Highness,

499
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,710
do you want to hear the story outside?

500
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,280
Yes.

501
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,230
You are like my second sister.

502
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,590
She would tell me stories outside

503
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,400
once she came back from the outside.

504
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,710
-Really? -Your Highness.

505
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,880
Your Excellency Lu.

506
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,110
The palace

507
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,400
sent someone here for a diagnosis.

508
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,400
How about

509
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,350
going back to your room first?

510
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,470
Prince Huai has never been close to others.

511
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,350
But he gets well along with you

512
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,230
as if you were an old acquaintance.

513
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,430
He may like me.

514
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,680
Really?

515
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,880
Yes.

516
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm going to decoct herbs for him.

517
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,520
Since that Prince Huai

518
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,560
is getting better and better,

519
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Her Ladyship

520
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,590
should be back soon.

521
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,190
No.

522
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,830
I'm going to change a suit of bedclothes for her.

523
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,710
The kind of medicine is right.

524
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,070
Check the quantity again.

525
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,110
Be careful not to make a mistake.

526
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,470
Chen Qi.

527
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,160
Jinxiu.

528
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,800
When are you leaving?

529
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,830
I can arrange the staff in advance.

530
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,070
After the Spring Festival.

531
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,280
I would arrive home before March 3.

532
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,190
You know

533
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,560
March 3 is more important

534
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
than the Spring Festival for our Chen family.

535
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,040
Chen Qi.

536
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
How much did they give you?

537
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,230
That's not up to them.

538
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,190
It depends on the business of Jinyun Restaurant that day.

539
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,470
I mean

540
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,310
the Fang family asked you to take care of me.

541
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,430
And how much did they give you?

542
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,040
Well, it…

543
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,640
The Fang family didn't give me money.

544
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,470
I'm the big shopkeeper of your sugar figurines.

545
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,400
Chen Qi.

546
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,070
Well,

547
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,830
not much money.

548
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,560
Young Master Fang said,

549
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,830
ten thousand taels of silver.

550
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,880
My brother is still not good at doing business.

551
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,350
He will lose.

552
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,520
Not at all.

553
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,950
You deserve more silver!

554
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,160
How is him, Imperial Doctor Jiang?

555
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,920
Prince Huai is well.

556
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,470
He needs to nurse his body slowly later.

557
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,830
His Majesty

558
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,710
can rest assured now.

559
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
I'm going back to the palace

560
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,000
to reply to His Majesty.

561
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,350
Dr. Jun can go back.

562
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,760
The Imperial Academy of Medicine

563
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,110
would be responsible for nursing his body.

564
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,560
Go.

565
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,920
Dr. Jun,

566
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,710
what else to be ordered?

567
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,310
I've cured

568
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,040
Prince Huai's scrofula.

569
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,430
But if anything goes wrong,

570
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,640
I hope you

571
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,880
won't blame me.

572
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,560
That's the responsibility for the Imperial Academy of Medicine by then.

573
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,950
How dare you!

574
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,280
Are you cursing Prince Huai?

575
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,560
I dare not.

576
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,920
But I know,

577
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,800
the curse will not make His Highness sick.

578
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,160
But shirking duty and incompetence of quacks

579
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,800
will make him die.

580
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,830
You!

581
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,920
Dr. Jun has excellent medical skills.

582
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,400
I'll ask for merits for you

583
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,470
in front of His Majesty.

584
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,950
Thank you for your painstaking help.

585
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,190
His Majesty's reward is generous.

586
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,590
Dr. Jun,

587
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,640
take it steadily.

588
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,560
Your Highness,

589
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,920
now that you're well,

590
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,470
I'm leaving.

591
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,920
From today on,

592
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,190
you should take good care of yourself.

593
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,470
Don't eat food indiscriminately.

594
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,680
I know.

595
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,830
After grinding this,

596
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,760
put it with that.

597
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,000
Liu'er.

598
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,110
Your Ladyship.

599
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,000
You're back.

600
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,830
Jiuling.

601
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,400
Your Ladyship.

602
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,040
You're back.

603
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,830
Jinxiu, Chen Qi.

604
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,160
Why didn't you tell us in advance?

605
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,040
We could pick you up.

606
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,040
It's not far.

607
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,070
So I walked back by myself.

608
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,760
Everyone is worried about you,

609
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,880
especially the young master.

610
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,590
He wrote many letters to ask about you.

611
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,760
Sorry for making you worried.

612
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,430
I'll write him back.

613
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,920
Your Ladyship, guess what,

614
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,430
young master actually

615
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,040
sent the imperial decree

616
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,230
to be kept in the Jiuling Drugstore.

617
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,190
Let me see

618
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,640
who dares to make trouble in the Jiuling Drugstore later.

619
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,470
Chengyu

620
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,590
sent the imperial decree here?

621
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,160
Yeah.

622
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,760
Grandma allowed him to do so?

623
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,680
Chengyu knows

624
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,680
what he is doing.

625
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,870
That I cured Jiurong

626
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,560
would annoy Chu Rang.

627
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
The Jiuling Drugstore keeps an imperial decree now.

628
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,870
Besides, this decree

629
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,670
can avoid many troubles made by Lu Yunqi

630
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,430
and protect the plaque of Jiuling Drugstore.

631
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,189
But I'm afraid

632
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,910
it would annoy Chu Rang more.

633
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,430
Why did the people

634
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,230
of the Fang family do this?

635
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,600
They even sent the decree to the Jiuling Drugstore.

636
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
This decree

637
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
can protect their Fang family.

638
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,840
If they lose it,

639
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,519
aren't they that Your Majesty

640
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,910
would kill them?

641
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,190
If the seal still exists,

642
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,910
it would be very troublesome.

643
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,910
The late emperor didn't find it,

644
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,600
so it wouldn't exist now.

645
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,560
Jun Jiuling

646
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,280
is just a granddaughter of the Fang family.

647
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,870
But that old lady took her

648
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,560
as someone more important

649
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
than her only grandson.

650
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,320
The Fang family

651
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,430
wouldn't be so bold

652
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,120
to tell her the secret of the year?

653
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,280
But this woman changed her name

654
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,360
and ran Jiuling Drugstore in the capital city

655
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,600
and asked to treat Prince Huai without any invitation.

656
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,670
Plus this decree,

657
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,120
all these

658
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,710
are coincidental.

659
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,390
Now she wins instant fame.

660
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,670
It's hard

661
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,360
to deal with her.

662
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,120
Miss Jun's medical skills are really excellent.

663
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,760
So I think

664
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,470
it may be true that

665
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,320
your grandfather was cured

666
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,630
by the old master of the Jun family.

667
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,600
I've never thought

668
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,080
what she said was a lie.

669
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,430
Uncle, did you think

670
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,560
she was lying?

671
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,950
Your mother mentioned it in her letter,

672
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,670
saying that she was impolite

673
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,080
and spoke carelessly

674
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,190
and acted in a disgraceful way.

675
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,000
It might be true for such a woman

676
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,560
to make up a lie

677
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
to cheat our family.

678
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,120
It's just a misunderstanding.

679
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,950
Our engagement

680
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,230
of course is true.

681
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,800
Of course,

682
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,760
it's also true that now the engagement

683
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,560
has been cancelled.

684
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,670
It's good that you know this.

685
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,390
Be clear about

686
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,360
what you can do

687
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,040
and what you cannot do.

688
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,800
Yes.

689
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,470
I will follow your instructions.

690
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,630
You will have an important exam.

691
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,150
How's your preparation?

692
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,600
Do you have any confidence in it?

693
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,710
I must do my best

694
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,150
to win glory and win fame

695
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,910
for the Ning family.

696
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,230
In your generation,

697
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,280
you are the one I value most.

698
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,760
I am old.

699
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,000
The burden of the Ning family

700
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,320
will be shouldered by you.

701
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,520
For the Ning family

702
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,390
and for yourself,

703
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,910
you should be steady

704
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,190
to win an promising future

705
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,710
to be a minister and even a marquis.

706
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:00,910
Yes.

707
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,670
I won't keep you for dinner.

708
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,710
Pack up a few

709
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,760
dresses for yourself

710
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,280
and return to the Imperial Academy as soon as possible.

711
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,150
Your time

712
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,560
can't be wasted.

713
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,000
Yes,

714
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,000
uncle.

715
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,430
Childe, childe.

716
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,470
Miss Jun has been back from Prince Huai's mansion.

717
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,710
Why don't we go and have a look

718
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
and congratulate her?

719
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,150
The Spring Festival is coming.

720
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,870
All people are busy.

721
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,190
Don't act at will

722
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,320
to disturb others.

723
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,320
But previously,

724
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,800
you often

725
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,120
acted at will.

726
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,800
What's wrong with them?

727
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,670
Are you here to see a doctor?

728
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,560
Can you show me

729
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,840
your symptoms?

730
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,280

♫You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind♫

766
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,560
♫It's me♫

767
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,080
♫You shuttle through the bottom of my heart♫

768
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,240
♫Has nature ever asked for any clues about the wind?♫

769
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,800
♫Any clues?♫

770
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,880
♫If my longing for you can be written down♫

771
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,920
♫Every word would be as strong as pouring rain falling down♫

772
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,640
♫You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again♫

773
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,920
♫Tears well up in my eyes♫
