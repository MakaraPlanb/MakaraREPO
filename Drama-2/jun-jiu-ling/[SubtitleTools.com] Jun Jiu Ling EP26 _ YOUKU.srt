1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:15,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 26

17
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,800
Windmills.

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,960
Come to have a look.

19
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,470
Windmills.

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,110
Pendants and gadgets.

21
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,740
Jiuling Drugstore

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,750
Come to have a look.

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,240
I think His Highness Prince Xian visited

24
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,800
Jiuling Drugstore with a hidden intention.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,160
You just found it?

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,320
He came in person.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,630
On one hand,

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,240
it shows that Jiuling has such excellent medical skills that

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,830
even relatives of His Majesty value.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,750
On the other hand,

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,670
if she can make him happy,

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,880
perhaps

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,910
she can ask him to see His Lordship.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
It's better than asking Lu Yunqi.

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,240
You can think of it.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I guess Miss Jun

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
already thought of it.

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,660
Jiuling Drugstore

39
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,800
She is so lucky.

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,270
Whenever she meets difficulties,

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,470
she gets help from others.

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,750
She gets help from herself.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,270
Go.

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Let's work.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,960
Come on.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,630
Let me kiss.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
Your Highness,

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
have a grape.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,550
Yes.

50
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,240
Well. Come on.

51
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,190
Well. Come on.

52
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,000
Have another one.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,390
Tasty.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,320
For Twelfth Uncle,

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,110
it's the safest to pretend to be

56
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,800
arrogant and extravagant,

57
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,550
or he will be killed

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
by Chu Rang

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,190
like my father.

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,320
Don't do that.

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
Twelfth Uncle

62
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,550
was studious and ambitious,

63
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,550
but he must pretend to be a loser.

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
Will Jiurong be like that?

65
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,160
Dr. Jun,

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,000
have,

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,720
have you finished?

68
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,550
Yes.

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,270
Thanks to Your Highness,

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,550
Her Highness is healthy.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,630
I brought some medicine for nourishing and conditioning.

72
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,390
I wrote down the usage.

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,670
You're so careful.

74
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,600
Thank you.

75
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,190
It's my duty.

76
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
Instead,

77
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,390
I should thank Your Highness.

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Thank me?

79
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,110
Why?

80
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,960
Why?

81
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
You may go.

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,270
Go.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,510
Your Highness.

84
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,390
Go. Go.

85
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,040
Just go.

86
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,790
Go ahead.

87
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,550
I guess

88
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,510
son of Lord Cheng asked

89
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,070
you to visit Jiuling Drugstore, right?

90
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,550
Nonsense.

91
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,000
Can anyone

92
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,390
order me?

93
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,950
I sent you over

94
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,350
for being aware of your reputation.

95
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,480
Moreover,

96
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,110
he is in the imperial prison.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
He couldn't talk to me.

98
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,920
Whether he asked you or not,

99
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,920
your visit at this point

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
meets the will of the public,

101
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,160
but not His Majesty.

102
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,000
So I'm grateful to you

103
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,350
for your sincerity

104
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
and help.

105
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,600
Unexpectedly,

106
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,110
honest Zhu Zan

107
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,000
has clever friends.

108
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,070
You can see my intention at once.

109
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,110
OK.

110
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,950
But

111
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,110
I should

112
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,600
help you.

113
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,440
You cured Prince Huai.

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,670
It's a great credit.

115
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,510
I feel grateful to you.

116
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,440
Prince Huai has been weak since childhood.

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,350
Please

118
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,110
take good care

119
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,270
of him, Dr. Jun.

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,040
Besides Zhu Zan,

121
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,790
Twelfth Uncle cares about us.

122
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,230
Thank you for your trust.

123
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,350
But

124
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,950
I'm afraid that

125
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,200
I can't help you.

126
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,200
What do you mean?

127
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm going to leave the capital city.

128
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,110
Leave?

129
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,230
You've been through so much before.

130
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,000
As the saying goes,

131
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,950
after extreme bad luck comes good luck.

132
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,670
Now you're

133
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,110
known to everyone.

134
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,270
Everything

135
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,390
will go well.

136
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,440
Don't fear.

137
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,440
Let alone others,

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,040
well,

139
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,480
my whole family

140
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,070
needs your care.

141
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,390
Whoever dares to bully you,

142
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,510
I won't let him go.

143
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,920
Thank you for your comfort.

144
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,110
However,

145
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,270
I don't fear.

146
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,550
I must go.

147
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,600
I wondered why

148
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,350
you gave me so much medicine.

149
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
I get it now.

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,790
You came to say goodbye.

151
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,830
Don't worry.

152
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,350
I'll come back.

153
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,390
But I have one more favor to ask.

154
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,230
Go ahead.

155
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,390
Your Highness,

156
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
please try to save His Lordship.

157
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,600
Well,

158
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,950
it's improper for me to get involved.

159
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,230
If Lu Yunqi helps...

160
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,070
Your visit to Jiuling Drugstore

161
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
is showy enough.

162
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,390
If I turn to Lu Yunqi in this case,

163
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
His Majesty will suspect us.

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,950
So don't come forward

165
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,230
unless you have to.

166
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,600
I know why

167
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,320
you came to me.

168
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,270
Baotang, Sanbing.

169
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,600
Miss Jun.

170
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,110
Where are you going?

171
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,440
We go to save Zan.

172
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,350
Arm Moral Department is torturing him.

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,200
What?

174
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,950
Flogging.

175
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,760
The bastards are torturing him with rod.

176
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,950
I'll kill them.

177
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,000
Can you enter like this?

178
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,040
We must enter there

179
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,110
even by force.

180
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,950
At the worst, fight it out with them.

181
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,720
Wait.

182
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,110
Arm Moral Department is heavily guarded.

183
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,790
You're fighting

184
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,880
a hopeless battle.

185
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,070
He is in the prison.

186
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,440
I must ensure your safety.

187
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,160
Then what should we do?

188
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,720
Zan is being tortured in the prison.

189
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I'll turn to Lu Yunqi.

190
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,270
Are you sure?

191
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,230
Wait for my news.

192
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,270
Let's turn to those of the Sky Pavilion.

193
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,040
Here you are.

194
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,520
You know I'll come, right?

195
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,150
Now that you are here,

196
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,790
sit down and talk.

197
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,400
He is son of Lord Cheng.

198
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:09,470
You torture him without hearing.

199
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm afraid you can't explain it.

200
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,200
Do you think I care?

201
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,440
I want to see him.

202
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll treat him.

203
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,840
You care him so much that

204
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,440
I'll be angry.

205
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,350
But

206
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,200
it's great as you're here.

207
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,400
So regardless of my intention

208
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,320
and my feelings,

209
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
as long as I'm here

210
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,080
and under your control,

211
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,110
you are satisfied,

212
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,670
right?

213
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,960
Let me repeat it, Lu Yunqi.

214
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,550
I'm not Princess Jiuling.

215
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,280
You just want someone to replace her.

216
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,710
It has nothing to do with me.

217
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,910
You won't understand.

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,910
Do you think

219
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,670
His Majesty will kill His Lordship

220
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,590
due to the death of Huang Cheng's son?

221
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,880
If His Lordship dies,

222
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,710
what will

223
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,670
Lord Cheng do?

224
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,000
What will His Majesty think of you?

225
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,790
Have you thought about that?

226
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,840
So to save His Lordship

227
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,670
will meet the will of His Majesty,

228
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,520
but not His Excellency Huang's.

229
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,960
If you don't care these,

230
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,670
I'll leave the capital city.

231
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,960
It'll be easier for you to do anything to me.

232
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,400
You'll leave the capital city?

233
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,840
Yes.

234
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,440
That's what I want to talk to you about.

235
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,230
If you save His Lordship,

236
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,200
I'll leave the capital city.

237
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,710
Leave immediately.

238
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,760
Take her to the imperial prison.

239
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,400
Yes, Your Excellency.

240
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,050
Jiuling Drugstore

241
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
It's time to replenish betel nuts again.

242
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,110
It can kill worms, eliminate accumulation, promote qi and relieve diuresis.

243
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,110
It's a kind of quality medicinal material.

244
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,880
Go.

245
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,440
What are you thinking?

246
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,590
I think

247
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,110
after the trouble caused by Lu Yunqi,

248
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,320
must we close the drugstore?

249
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,470
Let alone the whole country,

250
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,640
can he stop so many people

251
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,520
in the capital city

252
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,440
from visiting Jiuling Drugstore?

253
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,590
You're right.

254
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,400
Are you back so soon?

255
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,910
Where is Jiuling?

256
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,520
She went to Arm Moral Drugstore alone.

257
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,880
Did,

258
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
did His Highness Prince Xian have her sent there?

259
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,670
She went alone after leaving the Mansion of Prince Xian.

260
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,760
She went alone?

261
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,590
Didn't she mention to Highness Prince Xian that

262
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,790
she was going to see His Lordship?

263
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,910
I don't know.

264
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,520
She let me wait at the gate of the Mansion of Prince Xian.

265
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,280
She turns to Lu Yunqi in this case.

266
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,550
Is she out of her mind?

267
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,760
By the way,

268
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,320
Her Ladyship asked me to pack.

269
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,440
It seems that she will have a long journey.

270
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,000
Zhu Zan.

271
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,590
Can anyone enter

272
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,840
the imperial prison of Arm Moral Department?

273
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,000
Take her away.

274
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,350
I won't see her.

275
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,470
Lu Yunqi let me treat you.

276
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,470
Well.

277
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,350
Do you fear that we'll escape?

278
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,110
Go.

279
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,960
Why didn't you save Wan Qing?

280
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,550
She is still alive.

281
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
She has left the city safely.

282
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,320
Hold on.

283
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,550
Your Excellency,

284
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,350
I can't understand.

285
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,520
Do you really let her go?

286
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,350
Around the country

287
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,710
are men of Arm Moral Department.

288
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
As long as she is alive,

289
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,000
she is under my control.

290
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,280
If she leaves the capital city,

291
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,590
it'll be easier for you

292
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,400
to control her.

293
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,710
I know you did that for me.

294
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,910
You feared that I would be criticized

295
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,200
for saving Huang Ziqing.

296
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,760
But you shouldn't have done that.

297
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,230
You shouldn't have been so reckless.

298
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,150
You shouldn't have taken the risk.

299
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,520
Have you thought about

300
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,150
your father and the people in the North?

301
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,110
What if they're involved?

302
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,110
What if anything goes wrong?

303
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,710
I shouted at you,

304
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,550
because I don't want you to get involved.

305
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,590
Huang Cheng will certainly take revenge on those around me.

306
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
I saw Lu Yunqi.

307
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,880
I'll leave the capital city after treating you.

308
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,400
You made a deal with him?

309
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,110
I have nothing

310
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,960
to make a deal with him.

311
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,590
If you leave the capital city, he'll save me.

312
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,000
Hold on.

313
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,230
No.

314
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,710
He has complex connections.

315
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,550
No matter where you go,

316
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,400
you can't get rid of him.

317
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
And I'm in the prison.

318
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,150
If anything goes wrong with you,

319
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,910
I can't save you.

320
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,910
Don't trust him.

321
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,350
-No. -Stop.

322
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,710
Zhu Zan,

323
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,880
listen to me.

324
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,350
You must stay alive here.

325
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,320
You must be safe.

326
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,110
As long as you're alive here,

327
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,200
we'll find a way to help you out.

328
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,400
Whether it's for me

329
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,000
or your father...

330
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,760
Dr. Jun,

331
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,960
as you have finished treating,

332
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,790
please go.

333
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,830
Brother,

334
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,070
it's a nice day.

335
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,310
You really should have a walk in the imperial garden.

336
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,710
I'm not as free as you are.

337
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,350
You're wrong.

338
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,310
I know you're

339
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,110
occupied with state affairs every day.

340
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,830
But that's why

341
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,760
you should relax yourself

342
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,190
in your spare time.

343
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,590
You can read memorials better after that.

344
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,310
What brings you here?

345
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,800
You won't come to me without a reason.

346
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,110
You're running out

347
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,190
of money, right?

348
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,070
You know me.

349
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,280
I'm always

350
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,710
running out of money.

351
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,560
But

352
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,190
this time

353
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,350
I didn't come for money alone.

354
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
What's the matter?

355
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,830
You've asked for whatever

356
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,190
you want directly.

357
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,800
What makes you so hesitant?

358
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,350
Well,

359
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,800
I feel

360
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,400
awkward to mention it.

361
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,920
Go ahead.

362
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,950
No matter what it is,

363
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,070
I won't care.

364
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,350
Then I'll say it.

365
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,920
Please

366
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,430
spare Zhu Zan's life.

367
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,920
I didn't expect that

368
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,400
you're

369
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,310
the first one to intercede for him.

370
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,560
He beat you, right?

371
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,310
But you intercede for him.

372
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,590
Isn't that returning

373
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,880
animosity with kindness?

374
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,430
No discord, no concord.

375
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,160
Brother, you know what?

376
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,110
He is

377
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,230
good at recreation.

378
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,520
I really admire him.

379
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,310
Isn't it great

380
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,760
to me to play with

381
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,400
such a person

382
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,070
every day?

383
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,000
Brother,

384
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,680
let him

385
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,110
just suffer

386
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,880
in the prison.

387
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,640
Spare his life,

388
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,710
so he can play with me every day.

389
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,230
I promise,

390
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,350
he won't

391
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,350
disturb you

392
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,230
again,

393
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,110
OK?

394
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,560
Leave it alone.

395
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,640
You don't know

396
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,830
what's at stake.

397
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,830
Brother,

398
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,560
-I... -As to money,

399
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,160
I'll ask Yuan Bao to send you some.

400
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,430
OK.

401
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm busy.

402
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,190
I'm leaving.

403
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,110
Are you trying to escape something?

404
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,160
Lady Jinxiu,

405
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,560
Miss Jun

406
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,430
isn't like that.

407
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,430
I'm sure

408
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,520
she goes back to Zezhou

409
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,590
to do things.

410
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,640
Moreover,

411
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
it has been a long time

412
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,560
since you left Zezhou.

413
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,590
It's time for you to go back.

414
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
Young Master and Senior Madame

415
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,560
will be happy.

416
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,680
Is Jiuling Drugstore still open?

417
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,310
It can't go on without you.

418
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,470
Anyway, we have no patients.

419
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,640
We're just selling medicine.

420
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,950
It can go on without her.

421
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,310
Yes.

422
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,830
Without me in Jiuling Drugstore,

423
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,230
you can still sell medicine.

424
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,470
But as you leave,

425
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,560
Lady Jinxiu has to work here alone.

426
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,430
I fear that she can't make it.

427
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,350
I can.

428
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,000
Let Chen Qi

429
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,430
return to Zezhou with you

430
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,920
to take care of you on the way.

431
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,680
Don't worry.

432
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,520
I'll go back with Her Ladyship.

433
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,950
Let me go with you.

434
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,800
It's not safe for you girls two

435
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,110
go alone.

436
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,470
When will you come back?

437
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,070
I won't come back

438
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,470
in a short period.

439
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,830
So you fear,

440
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,230
right?

441
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,470
No.

442
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,680
Well,

443
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
famous doctors are popular with the people,

444
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,040
but most of the famous doctors are killed by bigwigs.

445
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,350
Wen Zhi was killed by King Min of Qi.

446
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,520
Bian Que was framed and killed by the imperial doctor of Qin State.

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
Hua Tuo suffered a reckless disaster.

448
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,230
Now

449
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,710
Jiuling Drugstore is famous.

450
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,230
If I still stay here,

451
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,800
I fear Lu Yunqi won't let it go.

452
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,040
But fighting with a lunatic

453
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,830
will make me a lunatic sooner or later.

454
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,160
If I stay here,

455
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,640
he'll cause more troubles.

456
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,110
So we won't diagnose,

457
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,230
and sell medicine only.

458
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,230
Thus,

459
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,000
even if doctors from the capital city and others cities

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,760
come for medicine,

461
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,520
Lu Yunqi can't cause troubles

462
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,160
even if he wants to.

463
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,760
We retreat to advance.

464
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,040
In this case,

465
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,400
I'll go back

466
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,710
and prepare for the returning.

467
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,350
I'll help.

468
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,160
Thank you, Shopkeeper Liu.

469
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:04,830
Thanks.

470
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,040
I'll pack things.

471
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,560
OK.

472
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,710
You expected this situation,

473
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,230
right?

474
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,470
You asked us to work

475
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,070
as shopkeeper and accountant here.

476
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,640
Actually,

477
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,590
you want to leave Jiuling Drugstore

478
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,000
to us as you leave.

479
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,190
You always

480
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,190
think more than others.

481
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,000
Now you have time to consider

482
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,560
whether you should continue

483
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,680
to work as accountant of Jiuling Drugstore.

484
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,680
You've decided it.

485
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,640
Why should I bother?

486
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,430
Be careful

487
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,950
in the capital.

488
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:05,800
Jinxiu,

489
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,350
whatever happens to you in the future,

490
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,520
don't play tough.

491
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,920
When you meet troubles,

492
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,800
turn to Prince Xian.

493
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,230
You can trust him.

494
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,430
I asked Chengyu

495
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,950
to let Deshengchang

496
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,800
help when you need.

497
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,710
Keep it in mind.

498
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,430
Except humans,

499
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,800
we can abandon

500
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,830
everything.

501
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,760
I know.

502
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,830
I'm just an accountant.

503
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,520
I don't need to risk my life,

504
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,070
right?

505
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,520
By the way,

506
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,280
I really want to see

507
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,070
how furious

508
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,400
your future mother-in-law is

509
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,590
when she knows the engagement.

510
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,280
When will you leave?

511
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,560
We'll leave soon.

512
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,560
How about Zhu Zan?

513
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,000
He was seriously beaten,

514
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,760
but he won't die.

515
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,230
Lu Yunqi and Zhu Zan

516
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,830
have fought for times.

517
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,070
Lu Yunqi may seize the chance

518
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,310
to take private revenge.

519
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,680
Tell him not to

520
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,430
beat Zhu Zan to death.

521
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,920
Yes.

522
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,470
I wanted to see

523
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,230
who will plead for Zhu Zan

524
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,310
However...

525
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,520
So it's tricky

526
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,800
when it comes to Huang Cheng.

527
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,350
There are many discussions in the court,

528
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
but none dares to speak for him.

529
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,160
I'm afraid

530
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,560
they want to keep safe.

531
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,560
This is true for all ministers.

532
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,880
Should I be happy

533
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,000
or be worried?

534
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,040
What?

535
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,520
Do you think alike?

536
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,520
Your Majesty will judge.

537
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:09,920
I don't

538
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,190
dare to judge.

539
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,800
I saw Lu Yunqi.

540
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,430
I'll leave the capital city after treating you.

541
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,950
You made a deal with him.

542
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,950
I have nothing

543
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,880
to make a deal with him.

544
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,830
Zhu Zan,

545
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,110
listen to me.

546
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,470
You must stay alive here.

547
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,800
You must be safe.

548
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,760
As long as you're alive here,

549
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,470
we'll find a way to help you out.

550
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,560
How strange!

551
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,710
It has been a day.

552
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,190
Those of Arm Moral Department haven't appeared.

553
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,190
I think

554
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,760
someone stopped them for us.

555
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,280
Ordinary people

556
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,350
can't stop them.

557
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,040
Is it Prince Xian?

558
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,680
Will it be His Lordship?

559
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
If it is the case,

560
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,190
he told them

561
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,000
in advance to protect Her Ladyship.

562
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,430
He is

563
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,000
considerate

564
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,070
and kind to Her Ladyship.

565
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,710
I think after receiving my letter,

566
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,800
Lu Yunqi will keep his promise.

567
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
As I wrote in the letter,

568
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,800
he'll convince Huang Cheng

569
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,470
to spare Zhu Zan's life.

570
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,950
Let's finish eating

571
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,760
and keep going.

572
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,070
They are Zhu Zan's men again.

573
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,190
Yes.

574
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,110
Li Sanbing and Zhang Baotang

575
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,590
stopped us.

576
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,000
It must Zhu Zan who arranged it.

577
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,880
Your Excellency,

578
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,680
shall we send reinforcements?

579
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,040
Be patient.

580
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,800
Let her say goodbye.

581
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,310
They will

582
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,000
never meet again.

583
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,070
Yes.

584
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,560
You ask me to release Zhu Zan?

585
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,640
Your Majesty,

586
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,110
it's ascertained that

587
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,040
my son was killed

588
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,920
by the startled horse breaking into.

589
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,680
It

590
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,880
was an accident.

591
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,590
His Lordship

592
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,310
rushed there to stop

593
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,640
the startled horse.

594
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,400
No.

595
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,160
He must suffer more

596
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,560
in the imperial prison.

597
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,040
Your Majesty,

598
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,520
please don't do that.

599
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,070
The loss of my son

600
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,560
is a family matter,

601
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,830
but Lord Cheng guarding the border

602
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,880
is a state affair.

603
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,280
Do not affect him

604
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,950
with my family matter.

605
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,800
Now

606
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,640
it has been widely discussed

607
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,280
in the court and the commonalty.

608
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,520
We'd better

609
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,350
handle it properly.

610
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,680
Then

611
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
sorry to hurt you.

612
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,430
Thank you for your consideration.

613
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,640
State affairs are above everything.

614
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,880
Your Majesty,

615
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,950
please allow that.

616
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,680
Well,

617
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,920
Let him feed horses in Livestock Office

618
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,400
and ponder on his fault.

619
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,160
What do you think?

620
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,560
You are smart.

621
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,540
Fang Mansion
21
00:35:21,320 --> 00:02:09,030
Tomb of Loving Father Jun Yingwen
By Daughter Jun Zhenzhen

622
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,710
Grandma,

623
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,430
mother,

624
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,230
Chen Qi sent a man to report in advance

625
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,280
Jiuling will arrive at Zezhou

626
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,830
in a few days.

627
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,640
Good news.

628
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,110
Jiuling is coming back.

629
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,470
Let's discuss

630
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,310
how to arrange her.

631
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,710
Clean the yard

632
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,640
where she lived before.

633
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,040
How about letting her

634
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,350
live in a yard nearer to you?

635
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,230
We can see each other

636
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,680
in the Fang family at any time.

637
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,590
It's the same.

638
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,190
I wonder how long

639
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,830
she will stay here.

640
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,710
Does Jiuling know

641
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,800
what you think?

642
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,280
I'll make it clear to her.

643
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,400
Grandma,

644
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,230
mother,

645
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,160
please don't pay too much attention.

646
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,190
If she

647
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,430
doesn't have the same feeling,

648
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,590
she'll be awkward to live here.

649
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,640
Well,

650
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,160
I was about to report to grandma.

651
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,880
I've handled the account

652
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,070
of Deshengchang this month.

653
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,640
Tomorrow I will leave for the inn

654
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,190
outside the city to wait for her.

655
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,400
Is it too early?

656
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,560
Didn't you just say

657
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,680
she would arrive in a few days?

658
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,710
I guess

659
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,760
she'll arrive in a few days.

660
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,880
But things don't turn out as planned.

661
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,590
What if she travels faster

662
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,590
and arrives in advance?

663
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,430
Go.

664
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,070
Go get her back.

665
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,070
Yes, grandma.

666
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Your Lordship,

667
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,470
admit your mistake.

668
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,160
This time

669
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,430
you did

670
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,000
go too far.

671
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,280
Eunuch Yuan,

672
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,000
I was wrong.

673
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,920
Whether I'll meet startled horse

674
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,830
or startled donkey,

675
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,800
I won't meddle in.

676
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,230
That's right.

677
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,070
Remember

678
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,230
to watch your mouth.

679
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,680
They didn't let me speak.

680
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,520
They just beat me.

681
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,190
Don't worry,

682
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,830
Eunuch Yuan.

683
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,520
I'll follow His Majesty's instructions.

684
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,560
Actually,

685
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,920
His Majesty showed his mercy

686
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,400
to let you ponder upon

687
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,000
your faults in Livestock Office.

688
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,190
Really?

689
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,880
Thank His Majesty for his grace.

690
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,430
So Eunuch Yuan,

691
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,230
can I go to the Livestock Office now?

692
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,470
Yes.

693
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,000
It really hurts,

694
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,680
Lord Lu.

695
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,680
Never mind.

696
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,350
I forgive you.

697
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,350
Many are the years to come.

698
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,680
He can walk.

699
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,830
Dr. Jun's medicine

700
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,430
really works.

701
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,040
Young Master,

702
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,560
are you tired?

703
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,590
How about resting for a while?

704
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,280
Don't worry.

705
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,110
I'm fine.

706
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
There is an inn ahead.

707
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,950
Let's rest in the inn.

708
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,310
Butler Gao,

709
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,640
I lied to grandma to let her

710
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,950
rest assured by saying that

711
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,000
I'll wait for Jiuling in an inn.

712
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,160
I'll

713
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,190
go all the way

714
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,800
to pick Jiuling up.

715
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,310
Go all the way?

716
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,430
Yes.

717
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,800
Butler Gao,

718
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,710
don't worry.

719
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,560
I've recovered.

720
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,190
I can ride horse

721
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,070
and shot arrows.

722
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,560
I can go all the way

723
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,430
to let her see that.

724
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,000
Fine.

725
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,800
Since you've decided,

726
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,710
we'll go all the way.

727
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:20,880
Go.

728
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,190
Master,

729
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
I came to see you.

730
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,800
I brought you

731
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,040
your favorite pastry.

732
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,320
This year,

733
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,670
a lot has happened to me.

734
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,319
I felt the warmth I have not felt in a long time

735
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,950
and encountered a lot of difficulties.

736
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,320
But

737
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,600
I won't be baffled.

738
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,320
Don't worry.

739
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,079
I'll certainly seek justice from Chu Rang.

740
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,670
The secret of Zezhou you told me

741
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,280
has something to do with the Fang family.

742
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,320
Now

743
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
I need to collect more evidence of Chu Rang's crime.

744
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,280
I hope you'll protect me.

745
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Don't worry.

746
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,360
I'll come again

747
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,950
when I avenge.

748
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,470
Young Master.

749
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,630
Young Master.

750
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,840
Young Master.

751
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,150
Liu'er.

752
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,150
Young Master.

753
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,630
Where is Jiuling?

754
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,630
She went to worship Old Master alone.

755
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,630
I think

756
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,080
she will arrive at Zezhou soon.

757
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:58,910
That,

758
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,600
that's right.

759
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,800
Young Master,

760
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,840
why did you come all the way?

761
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,560
You may just way at the city gate.

762
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,910
I think

763
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,040
he wants to see Miss Jun earlier.

764
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,080
It has been

765
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,430
over a year since we last met.

766
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,320
What is this in your hand?

767
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,320
I picked the plums along the way.

768
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,320
It's a long journey.

769
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,630
I picked them to quench your thirst.

770
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,040
Then we'll enjoy it

771
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,630
without Her Ladyship.

772
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,390
Here you are.

773
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Where will you

774
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,390
meet with Jiuling?

775
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,560
The post

776
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,710
10 miles outside the city.

777
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,120
We planned to wait her in a post,

778
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,280
but we changed our mind

779
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,190
and came all the way.

780
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,600
Yes.

781
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,150
I had planned to meet Jiuling earlier,

782
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,560
but I didn't expect that

783
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
it would delay me.

784
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,630
Never mind.

785
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,520
It isn't late.

786
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,870
If we go fast,

787
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,600
we may get there earlier than Her Ladyship.

788
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,280
Yes.

789
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,080
Let's go now.

790
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,280
OK.

791
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,670
Go.

792
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,320
Go.

793
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,190
Mother,

794
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,560
eat something.

795
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,080
You haven't eaten for days.

796
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,840
If I eat something,

797
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,600
the thought of their words

798
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,950
flattering that woman

799
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,080
will make me vomit.

800
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,000
Mother.

801
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,630
Yunyan.

802
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,870
Brother.

803
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,280
Brother,

804
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,710
mother is so angry at your marriage with Jun Zhenzhen

805
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,280
that she falls ill.

806
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,190
Mother.

807
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
I have questions.

808
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,950
No need.

809
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,470
I asked him outside.

810
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,430
The engagement is false.

811
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,150
His uncle also agreed to that.

812
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,950
It was the most appropriate to do so

813
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,670
in the critical situation.

814
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,800
Is it really false?

815
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,840
Yes.

816
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,080
In this case,

817
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,360
when will you announce it?

818
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,360
I need to discuss

819
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,910
about that

820
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,040
with Miss Jun.

821
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
You need to discuss with her?

822
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,670
To get rid of trouble,

823
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,360
she used the engagement

824
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,150
to get our family's protection.

825
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,230
You helped her,

826
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,950
but you need to

827
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,190
discuss with her.

828
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,520
Mother,

829
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,280
she is famous

830
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,520
and I'm No.1 Scholar.

831
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,950
Even if she hadn't met trouble,

832
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,150
the engagement

833
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,520
will be discussed.

834
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,040
Anyway, I'll get involved.

835
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,910
So

836
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,320
I took the initiative

837
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,120
to stop criticism

838
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,360
to get

839
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,630
a good reputation.

840
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,320
And

841
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,600
if someone utilizes the engagement

842
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,950
on purpose,

843
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,120
I'll be said

844
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,800
to be unfaithful.

845
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,670
It'll cause troubles

846
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,870
to my career.

847
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,950
You're right.

848
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,470
No.

849
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,870
Brother,

850
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,320
do you like Jun Zhenzhen?

851
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,560
Brother,

852
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,360
you're clever

853
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,190
and resourceful,

854
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,470
you won't be afraid of others

855
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,760
making a fuss about your marriage.

856
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,000
Brother?

857
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,320
Say something,

858
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,800
brother.

859
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,670
Yes.

860
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,870
I like her.

861
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,080
Brother.

862
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,560
My precious son

863
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,710
who can bring honor to the family name

864
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,760
likes that bitch.

865
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,280
Mother,

866
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,430
you misunderstand her.

867
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,840
-In fact, she is... -Shut up.

868
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,800
Mother.

869
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,100
