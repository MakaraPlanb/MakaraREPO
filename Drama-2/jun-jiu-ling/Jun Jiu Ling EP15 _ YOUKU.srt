00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

Ning Mansion

19
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,230

Imperial Doctor of the Imperial Academy of Medicine Jiang Youshu

Mansion of Prince Huai

22
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,830
Lu Mansion

23
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,480
The Imperial Academy of Medicine

24
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,040
Jiuling Drugstore

25
00:31:30,750 --> 00:02:09,389
Jiuling Drugstore

26
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,359
I'll take this.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Which one?

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,800
This one.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,080
-I want that one. -This one?

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,550
-Okay. -I want one too.

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Okay.

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,630
It's freshly made and very sweet.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm sure you'll like it.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Here you are.

35
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,800
-Okay. -Let's go.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,110
-Here is the money. -Okay.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,080
Come on. This way.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,000
Welcome next time.

39
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,720
Let's go.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,320
Jinxiu.

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,520
Yuxiu.

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,360
Are you okay?

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,960
Long time no see.

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
I miss you so much.

45
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,960
I didn't expect the sugar figurines you made

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,600
are innovative.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,080
However innovative they are,

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
they are just sugar figurines.

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,910
You've been selling sugar figurines here.

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,670
Will you feel wronged?

51
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,440
Not at all.

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,270
Didn't you just see

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,880
they sell good?

54
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,630
Don't worry.

55
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,830
How about

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,670
I introduce another business to you?

57
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,520
Then you can put the business knowledge 

58
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,800
you learned into practice.

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,470
Really?

60
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,830
What business?

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Here is a letter from Jiuling to you.

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,360
I know

63
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,160
you didn't get well along with each other.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,550
But you know

65
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,360
her conduct and personality.

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,110
I think you can think about

67
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,880
the advice she gave you.

68
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,670
Okay.

69
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,550
I'll keep it.

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,520
Lantern.

71
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,240
Lanterns.

72
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,390
Then I'll go.

73
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,390
Go.

74
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,000
Sugar figurines.

75
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,190
Sweet sugar figurines.

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,550
Sugar figurines.

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,790
Sweet sugar figurines.

78
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,760
Do you think it's really good

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,230
to ask her to go to the capital?

80
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,600
She has gone it through

81
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,720
and let go the past.

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,790
She has the ability to do bigger things,

83
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,550
instead of being trapped in Zezhou all her life.

84
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,950
Let me have a look.

85
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,000
Jinxiu,

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,070
with your intelligence,

87
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,390
selling sugar figurines is just a temporary strategy for you,

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,950
not a long-term business.

89
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,350
You have learned many skills in the Fang family

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
for more than ten years.

91
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,600
Don't waste them.

92
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,270
The capital has bigger

93
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,880
and more opportunities.

94
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,550
If you like,

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
come to the capital

96
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
to give full play to your ability.

97
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,200
What's up?

98
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,270
You look worried.

99
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,200
Sugar figurines are not selling well?

100
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
I don't want to sell sugar figurines anymore.

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,350
Then don't sell

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,550
them today.

103
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,350
Take a day off.

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,070
Do whatever you want.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Do whatever I want?

106
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,830
This is your style.

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,600
I want to go to the capital.

108
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,270
Is it true?

109
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,390
Yes, Young Master.

110
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,230
I don't know what's going on.

111
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,830
Only half a month later,

112
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,720
those who used to

113
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,880
avoid Miss Jun as much as possible

114
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,720
all came to visit her.

115
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,510
They asked,

116
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,510
"Miss Jun.

117
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,070
Look at me.

118
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,350
Do I have a bad omen?"

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,390
If Miss Jun said no,

120
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,920
they would be happy

121
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,200
and feel healthy.

122
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,000
Now those women

123
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,790
are proud of

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,040
having no bad omen

125
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,270
as Miss Jun said.

126
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,000
Young Master.

127
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,550
You're right.

128
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Miss Jun

129
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,000
is really amazing.

130
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,070
All right.

131
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,790
I got it.

132
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,550
You can leave.

133
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,000
Imperial Doctor Jiang.

134
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,320
How is she?

135
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,920
Senior Madame.

136
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,550
She is the same.

137
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,550
Just continue

138
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,670
to take the medicine for observation.

139
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,920
But she has been taking this medicine for some time

140
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,270
and no improvement is seen.

141
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,510
Our Madame feels so painful

142
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,760
that she cries night after night.

143
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,880
How can she endure this?

144
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,440
People may get sick easily,

145
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
but won't recover that easily.

146
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,350
Madam's disease has last for a long time.

147
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
No hurry.

148
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
Thank you, Imperial Doctor Jiang.

149
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,830
Thank you so much.

150
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,720
I'm leaving.

151
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll die first

152
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,720
before those drugs work.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,510
Find some more famous doctors.

154
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,200
Who is more famous

155
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,200
than Imperial Doctor Jiang in this capital?

156
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,550
Senior Madame.

157
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,200
Speaking of this,

158
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,270
I want to 

159
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,200
recommend a great doctor.

160
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,390
Mrs. Zhou,

161
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,350
who are you talking about?

162
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
The great doctor of Jiuling Drugstore,

163
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,640
Dr. Jun Jiuling.

164
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,640
Jiuling Drugstore

165
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,270
brings a patient back to life

166
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,040
and offers efficient  medicine.

167
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,830
Miss Jun.

168
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,480
What's up?

169
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,230
I finally found you.

170
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,110
What's wrong?

171
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,350
Someone from the mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan

172
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
is looking for you for a visit.

173
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,920
Mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan?

174
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,440
Yeah.

175
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,110
Their carriage

176
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
has been at the gate of our drugstore.

177
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,670
Go.

178
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,320
People on the street now

179
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,600
dare not to laugh at her.

180
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,110
What's more interesting is

181
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,480
if there's something wrong with anyone,

182
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,110
they would like to  go see her.

183
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,510
If Miss Jun

184
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,200
didn't say they had a bad omen

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,320
or ignore them,

186
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,510
they would think there was nothing wrong with them

187
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,640
and would go to other doctors for treatment.

188
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,200
Is it that she pretends to be mystery

189
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,390
or she just treats those she likes?

190
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,440
We'll learn it after a try.

191
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,000
Sir,

192
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,150
I don't understand the meaning of this sentence.

193
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,230
Your Highness.

194
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,440
It means…

195
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,030
Jiurong.

196
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,400
Your Highness Princess.

197
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,110
Your Excellency Lu.

198
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,790
Jiurong, you grow taller?

199
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,840
You'll be a man soon.

200
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,790
It's time for you

201
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,710
to learn martial arts.

202
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you want to learn martial arts?

203
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,030
I can teach you.

204
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,150
You don't have to look at your sister.

205
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,590
If you want to learn,

206
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,590
just learn it.

207
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,790
If you don't want to,

208
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,470
just tell us frankly.

209
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,960
Your Highness,

210
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,590
stay and eat with him.

211
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,030
I have something else to do.

212
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,790
I have to go.

213
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,320
Now that you are here,

214
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,030
can I

215
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,470
rest for half a day

216
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,400
and continue reading in the afternoon?

217
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,440
Sorry for showing you this, Mr. Gu.

218
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,790
It doesn't matter.

219
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
His Highness has done well

220
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,350
in lessons recently.

221
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,840
I can give him a reward.

222
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,400
of half a day's rest.

223
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,230
Thank your teacher.

224
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,520
Thank you, sir.

225
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,910
Come here and let me have a good look.

226
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,910
During my absence,

227
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,350
did you eat well?

228
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,840
You still cough after a long time.

229
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,670
Didn't the imperial doctor come to see you?

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,030
Never mind, sister.

231
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,640
How can we ignore your illness?

232
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,840
Then later

233
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,910
I'll tell them to change another imperial doctor

234
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,080
to come and see you.

235
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Sister, it's okay.

236
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,110
My status is embarrassing.

237
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,200
You don't have to call for imperial doctors.

238
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,320
Sister,

239
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,910
why are you crying?

240
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,150
It's the tears of happiness because I meet you.

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,640
This, this, this…

242
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,030
This, this, this…

243
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,080
This.

244
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,030
This, this, this…

245
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,320
Shopkeeper Liu?

246
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,960
Your Ladyship.

247
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,080
You're back finally.

248
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,150
I just left for a patient.

249
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,030
What made you so nervous?

250
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,520
Mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan!

251
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,280
That's a real royal family.

252
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,640
Can I not worry?

253
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,790
They all eat cereals

254
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,150
and all would be sick like ordinary people.

255
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,880
This…

256
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,910
Miss Jun.

257
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,670
It's fine to

258
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,440
say this in our store.

259
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,910
Don't say it out.

260
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,230
How's it going?

261
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,440
Doctors should keep the patient's condition confidential.

262
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,910
How can I tell you that?

263
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
Of course I'm not asking

264
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,200
about Mrs. Lin's illness.

265
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,520
I mean, how was your treatment?

266
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,000
Pretty good.

267
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
I gave Mrs. Lin a dose of medicine today.

268
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
She is getting much better.

269
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,910
I think,

270
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,880
she will be all right

271
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,000
in a couple of days.

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,790
So fast?

273
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,320
Before,

274
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,030
the mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan invited

275
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,640
Jiang Youshu from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

276
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,840
Jiang Youshu

277
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,760
is the best doctor in the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

278
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,350
He had been treating Mrs. Lin for almost a month.

279
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,230
But her condition has not been improved a little.

280
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,230
If you cure her in three days…

281
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,470
You didn't tell the mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan this, did you?

282
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,030
Yes, I did.

283
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
This, this, this…

284
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,030
Shopkeeper Liu.

285
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,910
Take it easy.

286
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,280
I'll be careful.

287
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,230
All right.

288
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Look at this.

289
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,320
Just follow this prescription

290
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,350
to prepare the medicine.

291
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,590
OK.

292
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,710
Imperial Doctor Zhou.

293
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,030
What's up?

294
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,470
What's wrong with him?

295
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,710
You really don't know it?

296
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,710
Because of the disease of that madam in the Mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan.

297
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,960
That Mrs. Lin

298
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,550
was born delicate and noble.

299
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,840
Imperial Jiang

300
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,280
spent more than a month

301
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,440
mildly adjusting

302
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
and slowly treating her.

303
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,350
But when she was about to recover,

304
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,790
a female hand-bell doctor

305
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,230
came out suddenly

306
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,150
and prescribed

307
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,760
a powerful dose of medicine.

308
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,000
Three days.

309
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,150
Only three days later,

310
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,760
Mrs. Lin got

311
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,960
much better.

312
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,080
It happened only a few days ago.

313
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,030
But this matter

314
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,550
has spread all over the capital.

315
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,710
Several ministers

316
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,910
had ordered the visiting of Imperial Doctor Jiang

317
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,000
have change 

318
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,910
to call on that female doctor.

319
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,550
How can 

320
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,230
he be all right now?

321
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,710
What's the name of that female doctor?

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,110
We can keep her name in mind

323
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,110
and find a chance

324
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,840
to teach her a lesson.

325
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,790
She may be called

326
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,320
Jun Jiuling.

327
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,550
On Qianmen Street,

328
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,030
she also runs a clinic

329
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,150
called Jiuling Drugstore.

330
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,590
Then we don't need to act.

331
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,520
Someone else would teach her a lesson.

332
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,400
Imperial Doctor Zhang,

333
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,110
what do you mean?

334
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,030
Someone doesn't

335
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,880
allow others 

336
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,640
to call themselves Jiuling.

337
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,670
Lord Lu has been busy with official business recently

338
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,910
so he hasn't noticed it.

339
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,150
I think 

340
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,880
we should remind him.

341
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,790
What do you think?

342
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,640
Good idea.

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,350
Your Excellency,

344
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,590
the granddaughter of the Fang family

345
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,350
Jun Zhenzhen

346
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,470
had come to the capital one month ago

347
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,640
and opened a clinic

348
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,080
called Jiuling Drugstore.

349
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,910
She also changed

350
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,710
her name into

351
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,000
Jun Jiuling.

352
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
Jun Jiuling?

353
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,320
Jun Jiuling?

354
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,400
It happened last month.

355
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,550
Why did delay in reporting it?

356
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,400
You are preparing for your wedding.

357
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,670
I didn't dare to use trouble you

358
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,280
with such a trifle.

359
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,400
In addition,

360
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,840
this news is deliberately sent by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

361
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,350
The Imperial Academy of Medicine

362
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,150
wants to use me?

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
I know who's going to deal with her.

364
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,030
You don't have to send a message for others.

365
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,470
Your Excellency.

366
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,590
Although this matter

367
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,590
is really caused by the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

368
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,960
But she did

369
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
commit the name taboo of Princess Jiuling.

370
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,960
How about

371
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,230
we teach her a lesson?

372
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,030
No need.

373
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,910
Jiang Youshu is not a man who can swallow loss.

374
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,230
Since he's going to solve the problem for us,

375
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,230
we can just look on and do nothing.

376
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,470
Pass my orders.

377
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,150
When Dr. Jiang takes actions,

378
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,440
leave him alone.

379
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,640
Yes.

380
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,470
Jiuling Drugstore?

381
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,080
Jun Jiuling?

382
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,550
You look

383
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,470
well today.

384
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,640
If it weren't for Mrs. Zhou,

385
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,880
-I would be still lying. -Madame.

386
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,000
Miss Jun has arrived.

387
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Here is my respect, madams.

388
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,400
Miss Jun.

389
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,670
Get up please.

390
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,350
Your medicine worked.

391
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,790
My daughter-in-law

392
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
is getting much better

393
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,520
and looks much better.

394
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,000
Madam looks

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,280
really much better today.

396
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,550
Miss Jun has excellent medical skills.

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,110
I've been ill for so many days.

398
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,400
These days,

399
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,960
I really don't feel any pain

400
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,000
and can sleep tight.

401
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,230
That's good.

402
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,790
I'll give you acupuncture today

403
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,910
to consolidate it.

404
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,230
Okay.

405
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,470
Thank you, Miss Jun.

406
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,640
It's my pleasure.

407
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,080
Senior Madame,

408
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,110
Commander Lu sends someone to invite Mrs. Fang.

409
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,200
Prince?

410
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,110
He lacks nothing.

411
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,000
Why did he invite a cook from his sister's house?

412
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,710
It should be for Princess Jiuli.

413
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,280
Princess Jiuli used to like the red bean cake

414
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,080
made by our Mrs. Fang.

415
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,520
Speaking of this,

416
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,790
she used to

417
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,080
invite Mrs. Fang into the palace

418
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,030
for making red bean cake.

419
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,030
However,

420
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,030
since the death of the late emperor,

421
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,590
she moved to Prince Huai's mansion

422
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
and hasn't sent anyone to invite Mrs. Fang again.

423
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,470
Let her go.

424
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,280
Just a cook.

425
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,230
Don't mind such taboos.

426
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,200
Yes.

427
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,350
Speaking of Prince Huai's mansion,

428
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,960
have you heard it?

429
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,200
Little prince

430
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,440
has been sick for days.

431
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,710
What can he do?

432
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,030
After his sister gets married,

433
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,670
none would care about

434
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,680
him sincerely.

435
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,470
He is just a kid.

436
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,760
Even slight negligence

437
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,349
would make him sick.

438
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,470
Yeah.

439
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,830
It's hard for such a kid.

440
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,470
Madame,

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,710
let's begin the acupuncture.

442
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,470
Okay.

443
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,040
Princess.

444
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,640
This is the new red bean cake made in the kitchen.

445
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,350
Please have a try.

446
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,470
This is made by Mrs. Fang of the Mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan.

447
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,040
His Excellency heard that you like this cake,

448
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,310
so he specially invited her to make some.

449
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,430
It tastes the same as before.

450
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,000
It hasn't changed at all.

451
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
If you like it,

452
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,520
I can let her come often.

453
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Thank you.

454
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,950
Red bean cake is delicious.

455
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,590
Why not have some?

456
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,280
I don't like this.

457
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
You don't even like

458
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,800
such a delicious dessert?

459
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,070
I have something else to do.

460
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,760
I won't come back for dinner tonight.

461
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,640
Princess.

462
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,000
His Excellency,

463
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,760
His Excellency seems to

464
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,880
go over there again.

465
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,040
Princess,

466
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,590
you can't be always

467
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,070
so courtesy

468
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,640
to him.

469
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,800
In the mansion,

470
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,230
all the people

471
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,430
know that

472
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,560
on the wedding night,

473
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,110
His Excellency

474
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
didn't stay with you.

475
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,520
Princess…

476
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,950
Enough.

477
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,310
Are you OK?

478
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,520
Take your time. Thank you.

479
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,280
Candied Haws.

480
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,680
Your Ladyship, red bean cake.

481
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Candied Haws.

482
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,070
Here.

483
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,520
Does it taste good?

484
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,880
Yes.

485
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,230
Red bean cake

486
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,560
is not delicious at all.

487
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,230
But my sister likes to eat it.

488
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
She has a strange taste.

489
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,710
You advised me to try it,

490
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,040
but I always refused.

491
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,430
Now when you're not with me,

492
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,400
I buy it myself.

493
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,280
It's not delicious either.

494
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,230
I just want to meet you.

495
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,520
Do you know Prince Huai?

496
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,760
Yeah.

497
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,560
I heard that

498
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,160
he is sick.

499
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,560
What sickness?

500
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,710
I don't know.

501
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,350
Looks like he has been ill for a long time.

502
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,310
It's not that easy

503
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,830
to learn things about the mansion of Prince Huai.

504
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,110
Where did you hear that?

505
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,560
I went to the Mansion of Marquis of Dingyuan today

506
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,520
to diagnose those madams.

507
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,350
They mentioned it.

508
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,230
It's said that

509
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,160
the Imperial Academy of Medicine speculates about the emperor's intention

510
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,430
and refuses to treat him well.

511
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,400
These bastards are at the helm.

512
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,040
I mean,

513
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,830
since you know Prince Huai

514
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,760
and I was one of princess' friends,

515
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,950
I should help them.

516
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,430
But if you want to go to treat him,

517
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,800
I advise you to give up.

518
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,950
Whether His Majesty or Lu Yunqi

519
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,680
won't allow you, a hand-bell doctor

520
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
to cure Prince Huai.

521
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Then please

522
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
pay more attention to him.

523
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,640
Or,

524
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,950
is it feasible

525
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,710
to find

526
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,190
a doctor you know

527
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,430
to go to see him?

528
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,070
I will try my best.

529
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,110
But it will take some time.

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,800
After all, Prince Huai's mansion

531
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,830
is the watchful eye of Lu Yunqi.

532
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,160
You know my relationship

533
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,000
with him.

534
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,590
I will try.

535
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,430
Okay.

536
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,590
Here we are.

537
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,400
Jinxiu,

538
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,350
we have arrived in the capital.

539
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,110
Don't make a fool of yourself.

540
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,920
Looks like you haven't seen the world.

541
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,070
It looks close.

542
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,880
But I didn't expect to it takes so long.

543
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,280
It's killing me.

544
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,760
Who told you to follow me?

545
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,640
You can't ride a horse yet.

546
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,430
If I had ridden a horse by myself, I would have arrived long ago.

547
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,350
I heard that

548
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,640
selling sugar figurines

549
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,470
can make a lot of money in the capital.

550
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,680
Of course I would like

551
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,760
to make a fortune with you.

552
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,110
Who told you to follow me?

553
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,110
Don't worry.

554
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,280
Later, I, Chen Qi,

555
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,680
will never humiliate Fang Jinxiu.

556
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,470
You.

557
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
What are you shouting?

558
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,920
You have nothing

559
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,830
to do with me.

560
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,590
What a rare guest!

561
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,560
What does Your Lordship come to the Imperial Academy of Medicine for?

562
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,160
I just came back from the North.

563
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,430
I can't get used

564
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,310
to the diet

565
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,470
and have backache.

566
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Thinking that

567
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,830
you are all busy

568
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,760
and I am idle,

569
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,520
I came for some treatment.

570
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,350
We are flattered.

571
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,830
If you send a message here,

572
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,880
we will go to see you

573
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,470
however busy we are.

574
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,560
No more polite words.

575
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,350
Where's Doctor Jiang?

576
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm here for him.

577
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,760
What a coincidence.

578
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,760
He is not here.

579
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,000
How about I ask him

580
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,520
to go to your mansion when he comes back?

581
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,280
No need.

582
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,520
I'm free today.

583
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,470
I'll look around.

584
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,110
I can wait for him.

585
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,400
Fine.

586
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,800
Please help yourself.

587
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,920
I have to go.

588
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,590
Go, go ahead.

589
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,310
I wonder whether Miss Jun's clinic

590
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,000
has good business or not.

591
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
By rights,

592
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,400
it's not that easy to set a foothold 

593
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,040
in such a big place as the capital

594
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,950
by relying on medical skills

595
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,160
in less than two months.

596
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,350
I don't think people

597
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,560
know Jiuling Drugstore.

598
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,950
Not necessarily.

599
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,710
You don't know her skills?

600
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,520
Just ask someone.

601
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,760
Hello, sir.

602
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,920
Sorry to bother you.

603
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,710
Do you know

604
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,070
the newly opened clinic called Jiuling Drugstore here?

605
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,880
Jiuling Drugstore?

606
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,710
Yes, I know.

607
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,830
Everyone in the capital

608
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,000
knows Doctor Jun.

609
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,110
See?

610
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,000
Follow this road

611
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,710
and go straight.

612
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,760
Around the corner,

613
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,760
it's Jiuling Drugstore.

614
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,760
OK.

615
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,470
Thank you.

616
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,040
Never mention it.

617
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The situation in the capital is much more difficult than that in Runan.

618
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,640
I didn't expect that

619
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,000
Miss Jun really has this ability.

620
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,640
What did I say?

621
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,040
Go.

622
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:48,920
Here we are.

623
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,110
Let's get in.

624
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
How does she manage this shop?

625
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,310
The waiter is so lazy.

626
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,710
What business can there be?

627
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,640
Are you

628
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,560
Miss Fang and Childe Chen

629
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,710
from Zezhou?

630
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,710
How did you know?

631
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,110
Except you,

632
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,800
there are no more people coming to see a doctor.

633
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,470
Miss Jun has calculated the date and told us

634
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,950
you two would arrive in these two days.

635
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
She ordered us to receive you early in the morning.

636
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,680
But on her letter,

637
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
she didn't ask me to come here frankly.

638
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,880
She also predicted this?

639
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,920
Yeah.

640
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,520
Where is she?

641
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,000
Why is she here?

642
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,040
She left to be a hand-bell doctor.

643
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,110
She'll be back in a minute.

644
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Please follow me.  -Hand-bell doctor?

645
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,920
The back wing rooms have been cleaned out.

646
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,830
Your Ladyship.

647
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,710
I am tired and hungry all the way.

648
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,880
I'd like to add a dish at noon.

649
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,830
-Is that okay? -Okay.

650
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,070
I want to eat that roast chicken.

651
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,520
Glad to meet you here.

652
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,470
Miss Jun.

653
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,430
You must have a tough journey to here.

654
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,760
No.

655
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,430
Let's chat inside.

656
00:25:59,470 --> 00:25:59,760
Go.

657
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,560
Okay.

658
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,280
This is muscle strain.

659
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,310
It's not serious.

660
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,070
You'll get better after taking some medicines.

661
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,230
OK.

662
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,160
Dr. Feng,

663
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
come to treat him.

664
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
He is badly hurt,

665
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,230
but why are you so happy?

666
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,230
Miss Jun said that

667
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,350
it is

668
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,280
not serious.

669
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,430
So we

670
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,350
are happy.

671
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,040
Since that you had been to

672
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,160
the Jiuling Drugstore,

673
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,430
why do you come here now?

674
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,040
Dr. Feng,

675
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,350
you can't say so.

676
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,880
Miss Jun said that

677
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,640
it's not serious

678
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,350
and he'll

679
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,310
get better soon

680
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,310
after being boneset by you.

681
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,190
She said so?

682
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,680
She asked you

683
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,400
to come to my clinic?

684
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,280
Yes.

685
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,920
Dr. Feng,

686
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,070
Miss Jun also said that

687
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,950
you must 

688
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,430
be able to cure him.

689
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,040
What are you talking about?

690
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,070
Dr. Feng has practiced medicine

691
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,000
for several decades

692
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,070
and is famous in the capital city.

693
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,350
How could she evaluate

694
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,280
Dr. Feng casually?

695
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,830
She is unqualified

696
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,160
to be compared with Dr. Feng.

697
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,230
Qi.

698
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,830
Now that you've gone

699
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,310
to the Jiuling Drugstore,

700
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,230
he should be treated there.

701
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,040
You'd better

702
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,190
go there.

703
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:20,950
Go.

704
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,590
Miss Jun of the Jiuling Drugstore is a doctor of saving lives.

705
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,880
My disease

706
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
is not worth Miss Jun's treatment.

707
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,310
Dr. Feng,

708
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,230
please treat me.

709
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,400
Treat him right now.

710
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,590
Yeah. What?

711
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,110
Save lives but not cure diseases?

712
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,070
It's ridiculous.

713
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,640
How could a doctor

714
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,190
behave like this?

715
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,070
Go.

716
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,070
Today,

717
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,950
let me accompany you to reason with her.

718
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,950
Go.

719
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,350
Go to have a look.

720
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,070
Come on.

721
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,070
Well,

722
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,070
there will be a great show in the Jiuling Drugstore today.

723
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,430
If I'm free,

724
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,760
I'll definitely go to have a look.

725
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,470
You'd better not go.

726
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,310
Only by avoiding it

727
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,800
can the Imperial Academy of Medicine

728
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,070
be not suspected.

729
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,350
Jun Zhenzhen

730
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,190
gets herself into trouble again.

731
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,560
I've long been expecting that

732
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
you could come here.

733
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,230
From now on,

734
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,680
the Jiuling Drugstore

735
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,160
is our house.

736
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,430
We just came once we made up our mind.

737
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,190
It's a long journey from Zezhou to the capital.

738
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,190
Lady Jinxiu

739
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,160
didn't expect this.

740
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,350
Sounds like you know me well.

741
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I had enough time to know you well on the way.

742
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,830
You read the letter

743
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,110
from Miss Jun

744
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,950
again and again.

745
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,190
I just felt bored on the way,

746
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,920
so I read the letter.

747
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,160
Jinxiu,

748
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,430
you will

749
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,520
have a new life

750
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,880
after coming here.

751
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,230
I see.

752
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,520
I believe,

753
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,070
as long as you want,

754
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,000
wherever you are,

755
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,950
you can make it.

756
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,760
You believe me?

757
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,430
Of course.

758
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,110
Do, do you need me

759
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,920
to check the account books?

760
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,800
Do you have any business?

761
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,230
-Miss Jun! -Of…

762
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,230
Miss Jun!

763
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,310
Terrible!

764
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,760
There are many troublemakers outside.

765
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,950
Go to have a look.

766
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,680
You sit here.

767
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,520
I'll be back soon.

768
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,110
People often trouble the Jiuling Drugstore?

769
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,400
Occasionally.

770
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,110
Let's go together.

771
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,110
OK.

772
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,350
Let's go.

773
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,470
Come out! Come out!

774
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,760
Come out to see what you did!

775
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,950
Come out!

776
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,110
Come out! Come out!

777
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Come out! Come out!

778
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,640
Come out!

779
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,310
Look at him.

780
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,950
Are you Dr. Jun?

781
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,430
Yes.

782
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,000
What do you come to

783
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,760
the Jiuling Drugstore for?

784
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,950
You're not a doctor at all.

785
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:52,950
Dr. Feng,

786
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,350
she is just a hand-bell doctor.

787
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,400
You're Dr. Feng, whose bonesetting ranks first in the capital city?

788
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,950
Just get to the point.

789
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,400
I just come to ask you a question.

790
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,880
As a doctor,

791
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,070
you should have medical ethics.

792
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,040
How could you choose patients at will

793
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,430
and ask the patients that you didn't want to treat

794
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,710
to make trouble

795
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,880
in other clinics?

796
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,040
Dr. Feng,

797
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,070
make trouble?

798
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,590
They told me that

799
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,680
you said

800
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,110
I can cure any disease.

801
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,800
There are various diseases in the world.

802
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,430
How can I cure them all?

803
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,590
What if I can't cure them?

804
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,040
Then I'll become a sinner!

805
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,430
I didn't say so.

806
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,710
Miss Jun,

807
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
you did say so.

808
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,230
Right?

809
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:29,950
Yeah.

810
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,640
She may forget it.

811
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,350
Sir,

812
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,000
did I see you before?

813
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,710
Miss Jun,

814
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,040
it's me.

815
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,040
You may forget me.

816
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Yesterday my wife

817
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,230
asked you to treat me

818
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,640
in my house.

819
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,190
You said

820
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,350
my disease

821
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,800
is not worth your treatment at all.

822
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,310
Yeah.

823
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,070
Miss Jun,

824
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,680
you said Dr. Feng

825
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,950
can settle such a small problem.

826
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,400
How do you explain it?

827
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,310
Nonsense!

828
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,590
We didn't see you at all.

829
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,590
Did someone order you to do so?

830
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,680
What are you doing?

831
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,950
Since that you're exposed,

832
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,160
you start to slander us?

833
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,920
Yeah.

834
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,230
You don't have medical ethics at all.

835
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,190
You're unqualified for a doctor.

836
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,830
Dr. Feng.

837
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,680
Jun.

838
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,110
Your Lordship.

839
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,520
What are you doing here?

840
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,760
It seems that you can also cause a sensation

841
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,000
as a doctor.

842
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
We shouldn't be blamed for it.

843
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,950
Obviously, they come by order of someone.

844
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,710
They're making trouble deliberately here.

845
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,350
Make trouble?

846
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,520
I'm Zhu Zan, Lord Cheng's son.

847
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,560
Do you need me

848
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,520
to ask the guards of public security

849
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,640
to punish you?

850
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,040
It's a misunderstanding.

851
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,000
It's a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding.

852
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,640
Get away!

853
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,760
He runs

854
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,710
so fast.

855
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,680
Don't run.

856
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,560
Fake wound?

857
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,710
How could they do so?

858
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,350
Dr. Feng.

859
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,590
Dr. Feng,

860
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,190
you've seen the truth.

861
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Sorry to startle you.

862
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,430
What a pedantic geezer.

863
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,590
He didn't admit his mistake at all.

864
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Liu'er, don't say so.

865
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,400
Dr. Feng

866
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,920
is a doctor with medical ethics.

867
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,800
Thank you.

868
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,590
But if he's right,

869
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,070
you'll have to admit that you are wrong?

870
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,640
In this world,

871
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,640
nothing is absolutely right or wrong.

872
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,950
People in different positions

873
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,350
have different opinions.

874
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,070
In his position,

875
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,470
he is right .

876
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,310
Long time no see.

877
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,560
Why are you here?

878
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,560
I came to sell sugar figurines.

879
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,070
Now

880
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,310
the Jiuling Drugstore has a accountant

881
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,880
but lacks a shopkeeper.

882
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,310
Do you agree?

883
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,160
Yes,

884
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,070
I agree.

885
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,040
Look at your grin.

886
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,670
Lady Jinxiu,

887
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,430
wait for me!

888
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,950
Jun,

889
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,950
can I have a talk with you?

890
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,760
Lady Jinxiu, wait for me!

891
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,319
You said 

892
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,630
it has something to do with the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

893
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,120
Perhaps you cured

894
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,000
the family of Marquis of Dingyuan

895
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,360
but offended Imperial Doctor Jiang.

896
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,319
Shopkeeper Liu reminded me.

897
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,280
But the doctors' duty

898
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,870
is to treat patients.

899
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,800
I…

900
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,230
You hang the plaque of "Jiuling Drugstore."

901
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,950
Don't you worry that you will offend your peers?

902
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,800
Let's not talk about this.

903
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,870
Did you find anything

904
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,040
in the archive?

905
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,120
It's a coincidence.

906
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Jiang Youshu also went to Prince Huai's mansion,

907
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,360
and he recorded the symptoms as

908
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,470
"Qi deficiency and physical weakness."

909
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,760
He just prescribed

910
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,230
some common tonics.

911
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,710
How can he do this?

912
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,470
The condition will be delayed.

913
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,150
Medicines are always a little toxic.

914
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,520
The disease will become serious if the patient keeps taking medicines.

915
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,150
Yeah.

916
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,360
Jiang Youshu

917
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,840
is smart.

918
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,800
He had considered everything before doing it.

919
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,950
He doesn't hope for great accomplishment,

920
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,360
but hopes only to avoid mistakes.

921
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,470
And even

922
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,360
his mistakes

923
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,120
are merits

924
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,190
in the eyes of His Majesty.

925
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,190
The new emperor

926
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,670
is not broad-minded at all.

927
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,430
And 

928
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,800
Jiurong is the son of the late emperor.

929
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,150
If Jiurong

930
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,040
had reached adulthood

931
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,760
and became the Crown Prince,

932
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,670
he wouldn't

933
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,950
have been the emperor.

934
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,390
So now the top priority

935
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,390
is to replace Jiang Youshu.

936
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,840
I also think so.

937
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,950
Dr. Sun is my dad's old friend.

938
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,320
I want to replace Jiang Youshu

939
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,910
with Dr. Sun.

940
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,470
Now we can only

941
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,470
believe Imperial Doctor Sun.

942
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,950
Please help me do this.

943
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,840
Jiuling's matter…

944
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,120
I meant Jiuling.

945
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
I would certainly pay attention to her matters.

946
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,560
You thanked me so solemnly,

947
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,080
as if

948
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,950
Jiurong is your brother.

949
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,870
Her brother

950
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,120
is also mine.

951
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,950
It's my duty.

952
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,760
Does she really

953
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,040
have such excellent medical skills?

954
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,470
Yes, Third Madame.

955
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,950
Others all think so.

956
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,800
Besides,

957
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,840
she also cured

958
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,040
the wife of Marquis of Dingyuan.

959
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,600
Can she

960
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,190
also cure me soon?

961
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,840
Well,

962
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,950
you've taken the medicines for some days,

963
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,230
but you still don't get better.

964
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,430
The doctor 

965
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,950
asked you to go on taking the medicines,

966
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,120
but 

967
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,000
His Excellency hasn't come here

968
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,950
for several days.

969
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,560
You can't go on waiting.

970
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,360
Go to call her for me now.

971
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,560
Go.

972
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,360
Right now.

973
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,150
Yes.

974
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,190
Chen Qi,

975
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,040
what are you doing?

976
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,430
Jinxiu,

977
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,560
have you checked the account books?

978
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,390
Yes.

979
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,150
How is it?

980
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,840
Did she make a fortune?

981
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,710
Nope.

982
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,120
First,

983
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,080
they don't have many patients.

984
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,150
Second,

985
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,390
she still need to pay the salaries,

986
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,430
buy daily consumables

987
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,040
and pay for the diet.

988
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,230
So she suffers a great loss.

989
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,710
It doesn't matter.

990
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,840
These,

991
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,630
and these

992
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,950
will earn a lot!

993
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,190
You know what?

994
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,760
This is not a common drugstore

995
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
but a shop

996
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,120
of rare treasures.

997
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,080
Don't talk nonsense.

998
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,390
How much can these herbs cost?

999
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,120
I've seen the purchasing cost.

1000
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,040
They cost 1,000 tales of silver.

1001
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,670
It's a big deal.

1002
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,630
I hope this big deal

1003
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,910
won't cause a big trouble.

1004
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,040
Take it easy.

1005
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,670
When we are alive,

1006
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,600
we would always

1007
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,040
be in trouble.

1008
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,430
Troubles are inevitable

1009
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,430
sometimes.

1010
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,600
If we're powerful,

1011
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,390
we won't be afraid of troubles.

1012
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,520
Just take today as an example.

1013
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,600
They came to make trouble

1014
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,280
but didn't hurt Miss Jun at all.

1015
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,800
Is Dr. Jun here?

1016
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,600
Our madam asked Dr. Jun

1017
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,950
for a home visit.

1018
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,670
Your madam's illness is nothing serious.

1019
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,910
This prescription is correct.

1020
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,670
She is supposed to keep taking it for a few more days.

1021
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,000
Dr. Jun,

1022
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
you'd better go and have a look.

1023
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,520
Why don't you understand?

1024
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:49,950
According to

1025
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,230
what our lady said,

1026
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,870
your madam will be fine

1027
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,760
if she takes the medicine on time.

1028
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,870
Someone.

1029
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Invite Dr. Jun to our mansion.

1030
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,670
What are you doing?

1031
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,580
