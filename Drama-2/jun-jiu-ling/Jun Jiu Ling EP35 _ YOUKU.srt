00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 35

17
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,100
Fang Mansion

18
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,880
Fang Mansion

19
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Deshengchang

20
00:21:50,250 --> 00:02:18,520
County Government of Zezhou

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,960
We can't make full preparations for everything,

22
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,800
and the commitments won't remain unchanged forever.

23
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,470
Are you going to deceive yourself still?

24
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,910
You know

25
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,160
His Majesty dispatched him

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,670
not just to watch the Fang family

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,160
but also to uproot the Fang family.

28
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,750
Miss Jun.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,600
Lady Jinxiu.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How is grandma?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,320
From the day she got the news,

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,360
she can't eat or drink.

33
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,030
The doctor said she is too anxious.

34
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,720
Let's check her.

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,030
Senior Madame Fang,

36
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,080
take care.

37
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,440
My condolence.

38
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,600
Please take care, Senior Madame.

39
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,470
My condolence.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,360
Grandma.

41
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,360
Grandma.

42
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,390
Grandma.

43
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,360
Chengyu

44
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,880
is gone.

45
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,720
He said in the letter that

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
you're the blessing

47
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,240
of our Fang family.

48
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,200
You're the bane of our Fang family.

49
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,040
Senior Madame.

50
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,720
Senior Madame.

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,600
It's my fault.

52
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,040
I didn't protect him.

53
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,110
You knew it clearly,

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,230
but you still did things intolerable,

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,880
causing a great calamity

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,350
to our Fang family.

57
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,270
Grandma, calm down.

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,830
Madame.

59
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,040
Grandma, calm down.

60
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,920
Grandma.

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,270
Senior Madame.

62
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,160
Grandma, calm down.

63
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,000
It's you.

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,920
You harmed our Fang family.

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,350
-You harmed my son. -Stop.

66
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,830
Senior Madame, stop.

67
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,390
Stop.

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Senior Madame.

69
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,110
Your Ladyship.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,670
Butler Gao,

71
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,390
may you ask 

72
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,480
those who come to mourn to leave first?

73
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,390
Yes.

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,070
Excuse me.

75
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,230
Due to a family matter,

76
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,440
we can't receive you today.

77
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,270
Excuse me.

78
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Due to a family matter,

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,760
we can't receive you today.

80
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
-Chengyu. -Well.

81
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,880
Please leave.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Please go back.

83
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,880
Please go back.

84
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,510
Please.

85
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,790
Take care.

86
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,070
Take care.

87
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,920
Take care.

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,200
-My condolence. -Be careful.

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,720
My condolence.

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,350
-My condolence. -Take care.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,110
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,440
Due to a family matter,

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,200
we can't receive you today.

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,950
Please pardon us.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,920
Please pardon us.

96
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,320
Take care. Take care.

97
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,720
Sun,

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,350
what happened?

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,070
They fought inside.

100
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,070
-They fought? -Senior Madame

101
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,110
was so angry that

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
she beat Miss Jun.

103
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
The own mother of Young Master Fang

104
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
also beat her.

105
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,510
They were in a mess.

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,390
They're one family.

107
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,110
Why did

108
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,040
they fight?

109
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,670
I don't know.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,790
I was too far away

111
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,160
to hear clearly what they said.

112
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,350
They seemed to say

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,110
"you harmed Chengyu."

114
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,640
Wasn't Young Master Fang killed

115
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,230
in a fire at the post?

116
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,230
Why is it

117
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,070
related to Miss Jun?

118
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,200
I don't know.

119
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,440
Go. Go. Go.

120
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,760
Go. Go. Go.

121
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,790
Go.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,350
OK.

123
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,350
Grandma,

124
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,830
Chengyu is still alive.

125
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Chengyu is still alive.

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,600
Chengyu 

127
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,790
-is still alive? -He is still alive.

128
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,040
Grandma,

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
Chengyu and I made the plan in the capital city

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
to help him slip away.

131
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,790
But it happened suddenly,

132
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,390
so we had no time to discuss with you and aunt.

133
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,070
Grandma,

134
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,720
I must

135
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,550
put on the show

136
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,160
to the public.

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
Only in this way 

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,230
can we make Chu Rang believe that

139
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,270
Chengyu is dead.

140
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,000
Where is Chengyu?

141
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,390
He is safe.

142
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,110
Don't worry.

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
His Lordship has sent him

144
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,390
to the North,

145
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,880
the domain of Lord Cheng.

146
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,920
But now 

147
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,480
we can't communicate with him.

148
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,640
Grandma.

149
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,640
Grandma.

150
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,320
Senior Madame.

151
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,550
Mother.

152
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,670
I'm sorry

153
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,920
I slapped you in the face.

154
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,920
Never mind.

155
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,230
As long as it can

156
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,110
make Chu Rang believe that

157
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,000
Chengyu is dead.

158
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,720
Does it hurt?

159
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,600
No.

160
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,320
I made you angry.

161
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,920
It serves me right.

162
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,040
Silly girl.

163
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,920
Should I say you were smart

164
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,880
or cruel?

165
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,040
You even made yourself part of the plan

166
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,720
at the risk of being hurt.

167
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,200
Grandma,

168
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,510
calm down.

169
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,640
You two are so crazy

170
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,880
that you came up with the idea of playing dead.

171
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,760
Yes.

172
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,790
Your Ladyship,

173
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,200
both you and His Lordship were good at keeping secret.

174
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
I thought,

175
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,670
I thought Young Master was gone.

176
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,440
We had no choice in haste.

177
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,480
Grandma,

178
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,880
this is Zhu Zan,

179
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,480
son of Lord Cheng.

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,270
My respect, Senior Madame.

181
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,390
Don't stand on ceremony.

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,760
We couldn't inform you in time that

183
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,200
Chengyu is playing dead.

184
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,550
We really had no choice.

185
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,160
Please forgive us.

186
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,550
Senior Madame,

187
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
please take care.

188
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,200
You've overstated.

189
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,270
I should thank you.

190
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,350
Grand...

191
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,150
We haven't seen each other for over a year.

192
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,590
Don't you know how to call me?

193
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,230
Grandma.

194
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,790
Grandma.

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
Grandma.

196
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,710
It's great that you come back.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,670
Don't cry.

198
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,110
It's great that you come back.

199
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,150
Grandma.

200
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
It's great that you come back.

201
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,670
Today I found His Lordship quite liked you.

202
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,350
You said your engagement was fake.

203
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
Is it still fake?

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,880
If he can always be there with you

205
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,710
no matter what happens,

206
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,790
I'll be relieved.

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,790
Grandma,

208
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
now 

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,520
Chengyu can slip away by playing dead,

210
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
but the Fang family

211
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,880
is still in crisis.

212
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,150
Chu Rang will settle

213
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,030
the deal he made

214
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,910
with the Fang family back then.

215
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,840
So besides that seal,

216
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,910
did he leave anything else?

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,520
Grandma,

218
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,790
the emperor is unpredictable.

219
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,080
If you want to protect the Fang family completely and hinder Chu Rang,

220
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,790
the key lies in

221
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,280
that batch of silver.

222
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,280
Follow me.

223
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,840
This is the second time I've come in.

224
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,320
I was led here by your grandpa before he died 

225
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,280
for the first time.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,400
He told me all the secrets.

227
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,230
I haven't

228
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,520
dared to come in again.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,960
The third year of the Taiyan period?

230
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,880
Yeah.

231
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,470
In the third year of the Taiyan period,

232
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,710
the Fang family

233
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,790
melt the silver

234
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,200
and cast it into

235
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,440
ordinary silver ingots.

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,790
The official silver became private one

237
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,230
and was kept here.

238
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,350
I never dared to use it.

239
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,710
Chu Rang plotted for years

240
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,000
even at the cost

241
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,520
of lives of three generations of men of the Fang family.

242
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,880
Now he restrained you with the imperial decree

243
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,790
and tried to do harm to you.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,080
If grandpa didn't leave this batch of silver behind,

245
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,670
this matter

246
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,320
would never come to light.

247
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,150
We must obey

248
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,960
His Majesty,

249
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,400
but it depends on whether he is

250
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,960
qualified to be an emperor.

251
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,880
If he is unqualified to be an emperor,

252
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,960
he'll be punished.

253
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,030
Your grandfather wasn't innocent.

254
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,230
If I had known that

255
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,350
Deshengchang made a fortune

256
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,960
with this batch of silver,

257
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,960
I would have stopped him.

258
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,910
He killed the emperor's father indirectly

259
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,320
and was killed by others.

260
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,550
He got his just deserts.

261
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,200
Damn him!

262
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,550
But our Fang family doesn't have a day of peace.

263
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,840
Punishment.

264
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,150
Punishment.

265
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,550
This is a shame.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
This is also

267
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,350
the will of God.

268
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,880
Grandfather.

269
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,440
Father.

270
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,840
I promise,

271
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,150
the truth 

272
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,880
will soon come to light.

273
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,110
I'll justify for you.

274
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,960
Grandma,

275
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,280
I'm not Zhenzhen.

276
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,080
I'm Chu Jiuling.

277
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,230
You,

278
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,880
you're the princess.

279
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,000
You didn't die.

280
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,110
I didn't die.

281
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,760
We harmed you.

282
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,280
It was our fault.

283
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,470
We were greedy.

284
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,640
We're sinful.

285
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,200
It was our fault.

286
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,280
It was our fault.

287
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,110
Grandma, stand up.

288
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,030
We harmed you.

289
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,230
The Fang family

290
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,350
harmed you.

291
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,960
Grandma,

292
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,030
it wasn't your fault.

293
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,470
You don't owe me anything.

294
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,280
I was saved

295
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,520
by Zhenzhen.

296
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,280
I'm sorry, grandma.

297
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,000
I didn't tell you that before.

298
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,080
Grandma,

299
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,230
the Fang family has protected me

300
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,790
and you have treated me sincerely.

301
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,550
If you don't mind,

302
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,280
I'll always be Zhenzhen.

303
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,790
No wonder we couldn't find the clue.

304
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,110
It was hidden in the room of Senior Madame.

305
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
If Chu Rang hadn't

306
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,590
hidden the silver,

307
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,550
my grandfather and father

308
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,030
wouldn't have been involved.

309
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,639
Beiqi wouldn't have fought against us

310
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,070
for so many years.

311
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,880
Beiqi is ambitious.

312
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,560
Coveting our prosperity,

313
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,760
they fought all the way

314
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,590
to the capital city and took your grandfather away.

315
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,430
They even asked us to pay a large ransom.

316
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,109
This was

317
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,640
a shame.

318
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,160
Such a shame can only

319
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,230
be washed away by bloody wars.

320
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,190
Even if we had paid the ransom

321
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,109
and your grandfather came back,

322
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,310
Beiqi would still treat Tianyou

323
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,000
as sheep to be slaughtered

324
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,040
if Tianyou remains weak.

325
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,760
Therefore, Tianyou must be guarded

326
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,230
by those capable.

327
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
The silver

328
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,590
and the seal

329
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,430
are enough to prove

330
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,310
what Chu Rang did back then.

331
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,400
The Fang family has been having a funeral recently.

332
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
With so many people,

333
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,310
it's difficult to send the silver

334
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,640
back to the capital city without being noticed.

335
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,560
I know that.

336
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,400
So I've discussed with grandma.

337
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,310
When Deshengchang sends goods

338
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,070
to the capital city,

339
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,920
they'll send it together.

340
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,350
It's safer to do that.

341
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
Good idea.

342
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,470
It hurts. It hurts.

343
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,040
Will you stop hugging me

344
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,000
when you're tired of doing that?

345
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,830
Yes.

346
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,960
♫The wind and rain chill the night.♫

347
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,840

That's impossible.

364
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,920
You know what,

365
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
my parents 

366
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,830
often talk with each other

367
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,830
hugging like this at home.

368
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,920
They said

369
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,760
as they hug each other,

370
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,920
their hearts

371
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,110
get closer.

372
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,880
I really envy of

373
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,070
your parents.

374
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,400
They always love each other.

375
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,680
We'll always love each other, too.

376
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,760
No matter how long it is,

377
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,710
I'll

378
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,590
always

379
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,880
love

380
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,920
you.

381
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,680
As Chengyu escaped by playing dead,

382
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,470
it's time to deal with Deshengchang.

383
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,640
But with dozens of

384
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,000
Deshengchang shops in the country,

385
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,400
how can we

386
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,680
deal with them?

387
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,640
Divide

388
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,710
and reduce gradually.

389
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,680
You mean divide it up.

390
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,520
Yes.

391
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,470
Divide Deshengchang into three parts.

392
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,470
The bigger the noise, the better.

393
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,230
What people like most 

394
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,830
is the secret story of a family feud.

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,880
Storytellers love it, too.

396
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,070
Before long,

397
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,470
the separation of the Fang family

398
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,830
will cause a sensation in Zezhou.

399
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,430
The more attention the Fang family gets,

400
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the safer it will be.

401
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:53,800
OK.

402
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,710
Just do what Jiuling said.

403
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,520
But I'm afraid that

404
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,400
Jinxiu needs to act as a villain.

405
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,920
As long as I can protect the Fang family,

406
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,920
I don't mind that.

407
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,230
Butler Gao.

408
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:20,830
Butler Gao,

409
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,350
something happened.

410
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,190
Calm down. What's it?

411
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,830
Lady Yuxiu closed shops.

412
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,760
Closed shops?

413
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,880
I was just in the Fang family.

414
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Old Master didn't mention that.

415
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,590
She just 

416
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,520
closed the dozen shops

417
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
she managed before.

418
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,880
The rest Deshengchang shops

419
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
are doing business as usual.

420
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,920
Butler Gao.

421
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,760
Butler Gao,

422
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,920
go check it.

423
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,230
Lady Jinxiu went to the county government office

424
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,280
to beat the yamen drum and appeal for justice.

425
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,430
She said she will ask His Excellency County Magistrate

426
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,040
to help recover her share of property.

427
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,280
Go and check it.

428
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,310
It's a big deal!

429
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,590
She is beating the drum.

430
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,280
What's wrong?

431
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,190
What's wrong?

432
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,800
How serious the lawsuit is?

433
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,830
Who is she going to sue?

434
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,400
This is Lady Jinxiu of the Fang family, right?

435
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,920
Yes.

436
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,350
Who is she going to sue by beating the drum?

437
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,280
Didn't you notice?

438
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,160
The gate hasn't open yet.

439
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,710
She's suing the Fang family,

440
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,430
her grandma and mother.

441
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,230
How ungrateful!

442
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm ungrateful?

443
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,470
I started learning accounting at 6

444
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,800
and working in the bank at 8.

445
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,070
I was too short,

446
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,920
so I stood on chairs

447
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
to study on the account.

448
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
For more than ten years,

449
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,560
I had never dared to slack off,

450
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,520
let alone playing games

451
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,070
like other girls did,

452
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,110
because we were told to shoulder

453
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,280
the business and responsibility

454
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,950
of the Fang family in childhood.

455
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,110
You think

456
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,040
as the eldest daughter of the Fang family,

457
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,710
I can live

458
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,590
a rich life.

459
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
But who I envy most is Sanya,

460
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,560
who sells tofu jelly at the entrance of West Street.

461
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,040
As long as she sells tofu jelly for half a day,

462
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,190
she can go fishing happily

463
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,070
with a basket by the river,

464
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,430
but we can't.

465
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,950
The whole family relies on us.

466
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,800
We don't dare to relax at all.

467
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,070
It's hard for them.

468
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,880
When their peers

469
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,230
were still spoiled by their mothers,

470
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,230
they began to shoulder all this for their brother

471
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,760
and had shouldered it for over a decade.

472
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,160
It's difficult.

473
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,830
It's hard.

474
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,230
Fang Jinxiu,

475
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,000
you bastard.

476
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,000
Don't make a fool of yourself here.

477
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,190
Don't talk nonsense.

478
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,880
Go home now.

479
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,190
It isn't nonsense.

480
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,880
I'm telling the truth.

481
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,560
Chengyu was weak since childhood.

482
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,800
You asked me and Yuxiu to support the family business.

483
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,070
You asked us to refuse others' proposal

484
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,470
and recruit a husband at home.

485
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,640
You know

486
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,800
what kind of man

487
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,040
I can recruit.

488
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,710
A decent man 

489
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,430
doesn't want to be a live-in son-in-law.

490
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,920
Now we're getting old.

491
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,310
For Chengyu,

492
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,160
Yuxiu and I

493
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
accepted that.

494
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,520
But,

495
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,830
but Chengyu is dead now.

496
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,470
Shouldn't we divide

497
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,430
Deshengchang?

498
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,310
Fang Jinxiu,

499
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,310
how dare you mention that as a girl!

500
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,950
Who instigated you

501
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,160
to do such an evil thing?

502
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,640
Grandma,

503
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,830
Madame,

504
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
frankly speaking,

505
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I've worked

506
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,760
for the Fang family for 10 years.

507
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,830
During which,

508
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,040
Deshengchang has kept growing

509
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,000
and developing.

510
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,310
Is it not our credit?

511
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,070
What's wrong with us

512
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,950
getting back the property

513
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,160
we've earned?

514
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,590
Ladies and gentlemen,

515
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,520
do you think

516
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
it's unreasonable for me to ask for

517
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,160
property from my family

518
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,160
as a daughter?

519
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,640
Are we ineligible

520
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,920
to inherit the family business?

521
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,800
Yes.

522
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,880
Yes. Yes.

523
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,000
You're eligible.

524
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,560
A daughter is eligible to inherit the family business.

525
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,160
OK.

526
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,040
Now that you've made it a mess,

527
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,470
the life can't go on.

528
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,400
From now on,

529
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,760
the Fang family

530
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,760
is divided.

531
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,400
Just say what you want to say.

532
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,640
It's unhealthy

533
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,950
to bottle it up.

534
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,350
Well,

535
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,760
the Fang family got together

536
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,640
for wealth.

537
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,310
Now 

538
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,640
they're separated by wealth.

539
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,560
Do you think it's fate?

540
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,110
I tend to believe that

541
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,950
man is the master of his own fate.

542
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,560
Look.

543
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
After meeting you,

544
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,680
their fates

545
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,640
have been changed.

546
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,070
Chengyu survives.

547
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,710
The Fang family isn't harmed secretly by Chu Rang.

548
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:58,920
And

549
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,110
we decided

550
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,280
what is happening now.

551
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,470
No need to worry.

552
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,230
What matters

553
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,520
is man,

554
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,000
but not money.

555
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,000
Man is the master of his own fate.

556
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,190
It's getting late.

557
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,110
Let's go.

558
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,680
Jiuling.

559
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,710
Nothing.

560
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,230
Jiuling.

561
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,230
What's wrong?

562
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,800
Just want to call you.

563
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,430
Come on.

564
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,040
Jiuling. Jiuling. Jiuling.

565
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
What's wrong with you today?

566
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,760
I like your name,

567
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,760
so 

568
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,230
I called you for more several times.

569
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,350
And you're a doctor.

570
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,230
If anything goes wrong with me,

571
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,110
you have to save me.

572
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,830
Dr. Jun,

573
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,040
check me, OK?

574
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,310
I think you are terminally ill

575
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,160
and incurable.

576
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,400
That's great.

577
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,160
Thus, you'll always stay with me

578
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
and heal me all this life.

579
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,520
Only you can

580
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,070
heal me.

581
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,640
Really?

582
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,040
Let's go.

583
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,040
When he was buried,

584
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,230
the women of the Fang family cried sadly and loudly.

585
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,190
They said it was unfair

586
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,110
as nobody would carry on the Fang family.

587
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,160
I don't think they could

588
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,310
pretend to be so sad.

589
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,190
By the way,

590
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,070
a few days after the burial,

591
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,190
the Fang family was divided.

592
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,760
What?

593
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,800
Those women

594
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,800
in the Fang family,

595
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,560
young and old,

596
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,800
caused a big scandal.

597
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,950
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

598
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,830
Those women in the Fang family

599
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,400
can't cause great trouble.

600
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
OK.

601
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,710
Did Zhu Zan and Jun Jiuling

602
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,560
come back?

603
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,920
A few days after the burial,

604
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,230
His Lordship came back

605
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,470
with Jun Jiuling.

606
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,430
Your Majesty,

607
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,760
Commander Lu wants to see you.

608
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,040
Let him in.

609
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,560
Where are they now?

610
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,190
Your Excellency,

611
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,000
after passing Xin'an,

612
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,040
Miss Jun and His Lordship

613
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,400
separated from the convoy.

614
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,680
His Lordship shook our men off.

615
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,680
We don't know

616
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,430
where he is now.

617
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,640
But I think that servant girl Liu'er

618
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,040
can get to the capital city

619
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,880
in three days.

620
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,640
Both of them can ride,

621
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,760
so they should arrive today.

622
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,040
Commander Lu,

623
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,040
His Majesty wants to meet you.

624
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,760
Please.

625
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,760
Your Majesty,

626
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
I just intercepted a secret letter

627
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,680
sent by Lord Cheng to the North.

628
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,880
Please read it.

629
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,160
What?

630
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,640
A secret letter to the North?

631
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,280
Yes.

632
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,040
He hasn't given up yet.

633
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,160
He is still pointing fingers

634
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,560
at the affairs in the North.

635
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,950
Does he,

636
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,070
does he think

637
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,310
he is necessary

638
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,920
to the court?

639
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,880
My right eyelid

640
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,920
has been twitching recently.

641
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,830
I can't sleep well at night.

642
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,230
I don't know what's wrong.

643
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,520
Well,

644
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,190
of all the civil and military officials

645
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,680
kneeling before me every day,

646
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,880
I can't tell

647
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,230
who do that

648
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,590
with sincerity.

649
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,070
Just go.

650
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,350
I want to be alone.

651
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,520
Yes.

652
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,190
When you saw your grave just now,

653
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,880
what did you think?

654
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,230
Come have a look. Flower umbrellas.

655
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,190
Come have a look.

656
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,160
Flower umbrellas.

657
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm afraid few people in the world

658
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,040
can see

659
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,950
their own graves like me.

660
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,110
I don't know

661
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,280
when I can tear it down.

662
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,950
Soon,

663
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,000
because I'm here.

664
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,190
When I put northern manjusaka

665
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,710
in front of your tomb,

666
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,560
where did you hide?

667
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,190
I was right behind you,

668
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,590
in a corner you couldn't see.

669
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,350
When seeing me come all the way

670
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,190
to send you a bunch of flowers,

671
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,640
were you moved?

672
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,190
I wanted to 

673
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,760
rush up and beat you up.

674
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,830
It's a kind of precious medicinal material,

675
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,520
but you wasted it

676
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,760
for the blossoming moment.

677
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,560
The flower 

678
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,040
is medicinal material to you,

679
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,190
because you're a doctor.

680
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,920
But to me,

681
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,070
it was a promise.

682
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,680
Is it beautiful?

683
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,190
Yes.

684
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Really?

685
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,830
I'll take you to the North

686
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,520
to see the sea of flowers.

687
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,950
That's really beautiful.

688
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,400
We'll be busy in the North.

689
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,640
Busy?

690
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,590
Why?

691
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,470
Think about it.

692
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,040
You said you'll

693
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
enjoy sea of flowers,

694
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,920
starry sky and grassland with me.

695
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,070
You...

696
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,800
Have you forgotten it?

697
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,710
No.

698
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,520
It's here.

699
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,350
In the future,

700
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,920
wherever you want to go,

701
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,000
I'll be there

702
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,040
and go with you.

703
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,800
We'll experience suffering together

704
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,710
and see

705
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,190
great mountains and rivers together.

706
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,950
Keep your promise.

707
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,040
What's wrong?

708
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,670
What's this?

709
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,910
Come here.

710
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,599
Conduct yourself.

711
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,870
You always

712
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,190
fooled me.

713
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,230
It's my turn today.

714
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,280
Young people now are...

715
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,230
Sanbing,

716
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,760
they're at the gate,

717
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,320
but they don't go in

718
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,120
and sit here.

719
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,189
We know it.

720
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,520
We know it clearly.

721
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,120
I told you not to pick me up.

722
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,670
If we hadn't come,

723
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,150
we would have missed the wonderful scene.

724
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,840
Get down to business.

725
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,519
Is there any news?

726
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,280
There is still no news from the North.

727
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,760
Lord Cheng has made several secret reports,

728
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,470
but he hasn't got a reply.

729
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,630
Is Earl of Qinghe going to launch an attack?

730
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,360
We've sent someone to the North

731
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,150
to get information,

732
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,080
but it may not be so soon.

733
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,000
Be patient.

734
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,430
That's all we can do.

735
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,150
It's not convenient to negotiate here.

736
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,320
Let's go back to the mansion first.

737
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,150
OK.

738
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,040
Jiuling,

739
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,150
where will you go, Jiuling Drugstore

740
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,080
or my home?

741
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,230
Jiuling Drugstore.

742
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,800
Go discuss business

743
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,840
with Lord Cheng.

744
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,560
OK,

745
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,150
or I'll have no place to sleep.

746
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,600
How can you say that?

747
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,600
Come on.

748
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,870
Can such an indecent thing

749
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,320
be discussed in public now?

750
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,470
Is it indecent?

751
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,150
We're talking something serious.

752
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,560
Miss Jun just said

753
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,760
she'll sprawl all over the bed

754
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,950
when sleeping,

755
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,470
so there is no space for you.

756
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,230
He means

757
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,600
if I go home with him,

758
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,760
he needs to sleep in the guest room.

759
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,870
I see.

760
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,600
I believe that.

761
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,280
I believe that.

762
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,760
Go.

763
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,910
Go.

764
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,950
I do believe that.

765
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,120
You...

766
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,840
Miss Jun and you are great.

767
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,840
Your Excellency,

768
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,120
shall we take action?

769
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,040
Of course,

770
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,670
but not now.

771
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,360
Mother,

772
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm back.

773
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,430
You're back, Zan.

774
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,040
Where is father?

775
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,120
He was summoned to the palace by His Majesty early in the morning

776
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,040
and hasn't come back yet.

777
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
What for?

778
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,360
Nothing else

779
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,630
but retiring from office

780
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,950
to be a person not concerned.

781
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
Is it not enough to give up the military power?

782
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,600
Must he resign

783
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
from the court?

784
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,430
His Majesty, but not us

785
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,670
has the final say.

786
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,760
Lord Cheng,

787
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,560
do you admit your guilt?

788
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,670
No.

789
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,670
You secretly ordered the officers and soldiers

790
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,600
to discord with Beiqi

791
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,280
and incited them to conflict with Beiqi.

792
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,560
Don't you admit that?

793
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,670
Is that true?

794
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,430
Yes.

795
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,520
I've always

796
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,630
done this.

797
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
I don't know the secret letter Your Majesty is talking about,

798
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,000
but I always told the officers and soldiers in the North

799
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,360
to always

800
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,870
guard against Beiqi.

801
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,080
I've been dealing with Beiqi all my life.

802
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,150
I know their nature.

803
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,710
Offering kindness

804
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,760
won't make them surrender.

805
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,120
If they offer kindness,

806
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,230
it must be out of wild ambition.

807
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,870
We can't cede our territory

808
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,910
even by an inch.

809
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
If we cede the three counties,

810
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,560
we'll lose more counties.

811
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,800
It's easy to make peace now,

812
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,280
but it'll be cruel to fight in the future.

813
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,230
Your Majesty,

814
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,710
the situation today

815
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,040
is more critical than that before.

816
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,470
Your Majesty, please rectify military affairs

817
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,150
and strictly guard against Beiqi.

818
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,390
We can't be gentle

819
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,360
to them at all.

820
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,390
If they attack us,

821
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,080
we must fight back.

822
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,950
I see.

823
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,470
Lord Cheng has always disagreed with the peace talk.

824
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,320
Your Majesty,

825
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,760
in the war against us,

826
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,950
Beiqi gathered troops

827
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,950
and spent a lot.

828
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,430
Now we should go on

829
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,560
dampening their spirit.

830
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,600
Don't give them a chance to breathe.

831
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,670
Your Majesty,

832
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,230
don't always

833
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,430
give in to Beiqi.

834
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,280
Your Majesty,

835
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,910
let alone the border dispute caused by the disagreement

836
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,390
between the officers and soldiers and Beiqi,

837
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,760
the secret order means that

838
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,190
Lord Cheng

839
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,600
is still running the army privately

840
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,910
against your order.

841
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,760
Lord Cheng boasts of his prowess in battle,

842
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,040
but he ignores the policy of defending inside and making an empty show of strength outside.

843
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,630
He is greedy and warlike.

844
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,390
We've lost tens of thousands

845
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,760
of soldiers in Beiqi

846
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,840
and suffered great economic losses.

847
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,230
Luckily, with the peace talk,

848
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,520
the people can live and work in peace and contentment.

849
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,560
But he still wants to fight.

850
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,600
Is he going to send

851
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,190
Tianyou to Beiqi?

852
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,470
Your Majesty,

853
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,840
since Lord Cheng returned to the capital city,

854
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,280
I've received many memorials

855
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,760
from officials in the North.

856
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,190
They put pressure on the court

857
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,190
and ignored the government officials' orders.

858
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,470
Earl of Qinghe can do nothing in the North.

859
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,800
Officials agree outwardly but disagree inwardly.

860
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,710
Your Majesty,

861
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,520
as long as Lord Cheng is still there,

862
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,950
the border will never be peaceful.

863
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,080
Your Majesty,

864
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,430
please remove Lord Cheng

865
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,670
from the military service

866
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,760
and punish him

867
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,800
for his abuse of power

868
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
and action without authorization.
