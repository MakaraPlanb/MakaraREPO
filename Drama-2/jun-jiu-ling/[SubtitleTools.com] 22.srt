00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:15,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Episode 22

17
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,550
Since you all help Zhu Zan,

18
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,520
you'll be executed to death

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,160
due to disobedience to the imperial decree.

20
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,320
Stop.

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,550
Your Excellency Lu,

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,910
now that you come to inquire about him,

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
you must know that

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,080
he's not here.

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,390
You guard here by order of His Majesty.

26
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,030
Now he is missing,

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,520
so you should also be to blame for it.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,270
Should I praise you

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,750
for your eloquence

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
or blame you

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,440
for the neglect of work?

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,670
Dr. Jun works hard and has made a great contribution.

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,960
What crime did she commit?

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,800
Your Lordship.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,880
Yunqi,

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,030
do you know them?

37
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,550
You bring them here.

38
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,240
I took them out of the dead cell

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,190
by order

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,910
of His Majesty.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,720
Yunqi,

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,960
I have two imperial decrees now.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,520
You can do nothing to me.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,830
Come on.

45
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,600
Your Lordship,

46
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,800
they're…

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,830
They're kids who can try the smallpox viruses.

48
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,830
What?

49
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,000
They try the smallpox viruses?

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,440
They're the descendants of Grand Guardian Zhou.

51
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,800
But…

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,800
If they're sent back,

53
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,470
they can only be beheaded in autumn.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,550
I asked His Majesty,

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,470
and His Majesty promised to

56
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,080
pardon them

57
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,800
if they survive from the smallpox viruses test.

58
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,110
Come on.

59
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,550
Tell them

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,630
what your names are.

61
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm Zhou Jing,

62
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,240
from Zhending.

63
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,360
My grandfather is

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,720
Zhou Bentang.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,470
Zhou,

66
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,240
Zhou Bentang?

67
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,000
The one who collaborated

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,630
with the enemy and rebelled?

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,800
Collaboration is a great crime,

70
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,350
but kids

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,920
are innocent.

72
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,720
But my grandfather neither cooperated with the enemy

73
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,160
nor rebelled.

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,230
He didn't. He didn't.

75
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,920
He didn't.

76
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,200
He was framed.

77
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,040
But I can

78
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,320
only save them.

79
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,350
Boy,

80
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,390
it's very dangerous to try smallpox viruses.

81
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,670
You…

82
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,070
Sister,

83
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,480
just let us try.

84
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,480
Maomao,

85
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,350
say something.

86
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,760
Sister,

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,110
let me try.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,640
Dr. Jun,

89
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,200
they're so sensible.

90
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,600
Please

91
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,480
let them survive.

92
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,760
Yeah.

93
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,480
Thank you for your trust.

94
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,510
I assure you that

95
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,720
other doctors and I

96
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,000
will try our best to protect you

97
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,880
to live up to the efforts made by His Lordship

98
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
who took you out of the dead cell.

99
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,640
Doctors,

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,640
I believe in your ability.

101
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,350
Please try your best.

102
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,440
It's our duty.

103
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,320
It's our duty.

104
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,200
Your Excellency,

105
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,670
won't we really interfere in it?

106
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,510
They're the descendants of Zhou Bentang.

107
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,000
Your Excellency,

109
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
do we still need

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,440
the oil wood for ignition?

111
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,270
No.

112
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,390
Why are you here?

113
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,600
You haven't slept for some days.

114
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm afraid you'll hurt your nerves.

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
You care about me so much?

116
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,480
When I

117
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,040
suffered from unbearable pains on that night,

118
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,440
you accompanied me all night.

119
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,790
And Chen Qi said that

120
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,760
to take care of me, you had no time to sleep for some days.

121
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,270
Taste it.

122
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,950
I cooked it.

123
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,070
You risked your life trying the smallpox viruses.

124
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,720
How could I sleep?

125
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,830
This long battle finally ends.

126
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,200
We can have a good rest.

127
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,760
We're so tired.

128
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,230
Right?

129
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,200
Taste it. Taste it.

130
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,640
How does it taste?

131
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,350
This is

132
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,320
the worst ginseng soup

133
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,230
I've ever had in my life.

134
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,790
Don't drink it.

135
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,480
It doesn't matter.

136
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,480
You'll have more chances

137
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,480
to taste it in the future.

138
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,040
Zhu Zan,

139
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,320
thank you.

140
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,320
Jun,

141
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,080
don't lose your heart

142
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,200
to me.

143
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,550
Dr. Jun,

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,910
thank you for saving us.

145
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,670
You're welcome.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,590
Get up please.

147
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,840
Dr. Jun

148
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,350
and other doctors

149
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,030
are benevolent

150
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,350
and have excellent medical skills.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,880
You're really highly skilled doctors in the world.

152
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,840
Yeah.

153
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,760
You're highly skilled doctors.

154
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,790
Thank you, Miss Jun.

155
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,080
Guo'er,

156
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,960
your filial piety touched God,

157
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,910
so you and your mom

158
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,440
could get better so quickly.

159
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,030
In the future,

160
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,710
be the strongest girl,

161
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,640
OK?

162
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,000
Dr. Jun came up with the cure for smallpox.

163
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,960
His Lordship tried the smallpox viruses personally.

164
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,030
And the doctors

165
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,350
racked their brains.

166
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,350
They've made great contributions.

167
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,960
Let's kowtow to the doctors

168
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,030
to thank them.

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,400
-Thank you, Dr. Jun. -Please get up.

170
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Get up.

171
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,230
Get up, please.

172
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,640
Get up.

173
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,320
You saved my life.

174
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,280
Thank you for saving me,

175
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,350
Your Lordship.

176
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,960
What I did

177
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,440
is negligible.

178
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,350
These doctors behind me

179
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,790
are the saviors.

180
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,230
In the future,

181
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,320
you should learn from them,

182
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,150
understand?

183
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,670
Everyone,

184
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,670
your current health

185
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
is the best reward for us.

186
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,280
I once said that

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,790
I would restore you.

188
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,000
So it's the greatest consolation

189
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,320
to us that you won't be tortured

190
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,910
by smallpox anymore.

191
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,960
Dr. Jun,

192
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,110
without you,

193
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I could not meet

194
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
my families again.

195
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,590
I can't repay you

196
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,590
for your great grace.

197
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,320
Yeah.

198
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,910
You're welcome.

199
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
If you must thank someone,

200
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,400
you should thank yourselves.

201
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,790
Because your trust

202
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,670
and persistence

203
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,350
made us cure the smallpox.

204
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,110
You're

205
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,030
the real greatest meritorious men.

206
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,230
Yeah.

207
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,520
Your Lordship

208
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,710
risked your life trying the smallpox viruses,

209
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,710
and the two generations of the Lord's Mansion are loyal.

210
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,030
You

211
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,880
convince me.

212
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,880
You all have recovered,

213
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,400
and your families

214
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,280
are waiting for you.

215
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,110
Go back home.

216
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,840
Thank you, brother. Thank you, Dr. Jun.

217
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,230
Thank you, Dr. Jun.

218
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,320
Go. Go back home.

219
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,880
Go back home.

220
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,670
Go back early.

221
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,590
Go back home.

222
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,590
Go back home.

223
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,710
Thank you, doctors.

224
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,790
See you.

225
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,110
Take care, doctors.

226
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,670
Let's go.

227
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,710
Jun.

228
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,710
Thank you.

229
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,440
Thank you for your efforts.

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,910
Thank you.

231
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,080
Thank you for your efforts.

232
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,400
The majority have entered the city,

233
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,230
and Young Master Fang has made full preparations.

234
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,280
They said that they would be back today.

235
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,760
But Her Ladyship hasn't come back yet.

236
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,080
Where are they?

237
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,230
Chen Qi hasn't come back, either.

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,790
When I see him,

239
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,150
he'll suffer.

240
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,470
I kept overlooking

241
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,550
on the gate tower

242
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,150
and fixed my eyes on the distance,

243
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,910
but I didn't see Her Ladyship.

244
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,760
Other doctors were warmly welcomed by people,

245
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,790
but where is the most meritorious one?

246
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,080
Where is Her Ladyship?

247
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,910
What should I do?

248
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,030
What were you talking about?

249
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,440
You're back.

250
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
-Your Ladyship. -Jiuling.

251
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,840
Your Ladyship.

252
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
When did you come back, Your Ladyship?

253
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,760
Why didn't you come back with them?

254
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,200
Why didn't you tell us early?

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
We could go to meet you.

256
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,550
You asked me so many questions.

257
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,670
Which one should I answer?

258
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,230
I'm just worried about you

259
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,640
and miss you so much.

260
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,080
Don't worry.

261
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,760
You can be relieved.

262
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm back.

263
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,910
Shopkeeper Liu.

264
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,200
Your Ladyship.

265
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,590
Just now His Ladyship Fang said that

266
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,710
when she sees Chen Qi,

267
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,710
he will…

268
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,080
Suffer!

269
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,200
I

271
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,080
won't make you worried again.

272
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,520
Why didn't you tell us before you came back?

273
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,030
We were all worried.

274
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,400
Miss Jun knew that

275
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,910
Young Master Fang would spread her merit today

276
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,440
and many people would go to welcome us

277
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,320
when we entered the city.

278
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,910
She doesn't like fuss,

279
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,110
so we decided to

280
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,150
come back by ourselves.

281
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,590
But

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,760
I wasted Chengyu's kindness.

283
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,840
No.

284
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,550
Whatever you do is right.

285
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,840
Young Master Fang won't blame you.

286
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,520
In fact, there is no need to spread it.

287
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,710
Jiuling cured the smallpox successfully.

288
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,470
So our Jiuling Drugstore

289
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,230
will naturally be well-known.

290
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,320
Damn!

291
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,080
The Jiuling Drugstore

292
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,440
pushes itself again.

293
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,880
There was only one day left

294
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,760
before the deadline,

295
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,230
but they succeeded.

296
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,670
Now

297
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,960
even people from Runan

298
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,000
and Zezhou

299
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,320
take their children

300
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,960
to ask the Jiuling Drugstore to vaccinate them.

301
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,590
The vaccination

302
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,670
is important

303
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,790
and involves the people all over the country.

304
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,280
How can she be

305
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,790
in charge of it alone?

306
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,520
So I'll ask His Majesty

307
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,080
to allow our Imperial Academy of Medicine to take it over.

308
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,880
Yeah.

309
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,400
With time going,

310
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,710
others will think that

311
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,710
it's our Imperial Academy of Medicine that

312
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,030
takes charge of it.

313
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,110
But Jun Jiuling is hard to deal with.

314
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,280
Will she teach us

315
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,350
the cure for smallpox?

316
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,110
His majesty will summon her

317
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,350
for the vaccination in a few days.

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,400
As an ordinary woman,

319
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,200
she will definitely be scared when seeing His Majesty.

320
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,400
By then

321
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,320
I'll propose it in the court.

322
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,880
I think

323
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,280
she will have no courage

324
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,840
to refuse in front of His Majesty.

325
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,110
Yeah.

326
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,670
Your Ladyship,

327
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,910
you get thin.

328
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,080
The dessert you like.

329
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,030
Have one.

330
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,520
I'm all right.

331
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,400
But Chen Qi

332
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,400
was tired.

333
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,960
Without his help,

334
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,440
I would have been very busy.

335
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,230
I didn't help a lot.

336
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,320
Young Master Fang is so smart.

337
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,440
He spread the merit of Her Ladyship

338
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,520
in Runan and Zezhou in advance.

339
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,790
He trusts you

340
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,790
very much,

341
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,000
so he did so.

342
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,350
Since I left the Fang's mansion,

343
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,350
I indeed made many troubles

344
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,350
for grandma and aunt.

345
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,640
I can understand it.

346
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,910
So

347
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,280
do others.

348
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,640
What he did is risky.

349
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,670
If someone accuses

350
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
the Fang family of befogging the minds of the people

351
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,960
by this matter,

352
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,030
it'll be a great crime.

353
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,790
Yeah.

354
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,670
I must write to him.

355
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,470
Your Ladyship,

356
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
if you don't need my help,

357
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,030
I'm going back to make preparations

358
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,760
for entering the imperial palace tomorrow.

359
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,710
Thank you, Shopkeeper Liu.

360
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,200
Your Ladyship,

361
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
don't worry.

362
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,670
It won't cause any trouble.

363
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,880
You still need to enter the imperial palace tomorrow.

364
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,520
After entering the imperial palace,

365
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,150
I can see Chu Rang again.

366
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,150
Riding a horse under the moon is joyous.

367
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,840
Why are you worried?

368
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,590
You're still worried about entering the imperial palace?

369
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,800
Jun,

370
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:33,799
why do you

371
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,880
enter the imperial palace?

372
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,920
Sometimes I feel

373
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,040
I've known you for a long time

374
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
and I'm very familiar with you.

375
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,110
But when I almost see you through,

376
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,040
I feel you have

377
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,040
a lot of secrets

378
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,160
and become a vexatious enigma.

379
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,760
I returned to the capital city to revenge.

380
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
For Princess Jiuling

381
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,230
and my father.

382
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,110
You finally open your mind to me.

383
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,520
I know you have many secrets.

384
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,230
It doesn't matter.

385
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,950
From now on,

386
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,310
if you don't want to tell me,

387
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,160
I won't ask you.

388
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,680
But I'll definitely accompany you

389
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,230
to do what you want to do.

Wind makes

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,590

♫The wind is in hot pursuit♫

♫If memories can tell♫

421
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,470

It's indeed a good herb.

423

You're really not an ordinary woman.

425
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,950
So what is an ordinary woman like?

426
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,400
How beautiful fireflies!

427
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,880
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

428
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,590
It's disgusting.

429
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,280
I can't bear it.

430
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,350
Miss Jun,

431
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,000
nobody

432
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,230
can surpass you in vaccination in this world.

433
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,400
Why do you

434
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,110
ask me to enter the imperial palace with you?

435
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,470
Because I need your favor in something.

436
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,920
Dr. Feng,

437
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,560
take it easy.

438
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,350
Don't be nervous.

439
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,920
Dr. Jun,

440
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,760
entering the imperial palace is an event.

441
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,470
Why aren't you nervous at all?

442
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,110
You seem to come back your home.

443
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,520
Dr. Jun,

444
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,160
please.

445
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,430
Let's go.

446
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,310
OK.

447
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,760
Here is my respect,

448
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,520
Your Majesty.

449
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,800
Get up.

450
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

451
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,590
You cured the smallpox in Qingshan Court,

452
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,680
which is equivalent

453
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,310
to the great victory in a war.

454
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,350
It's the luck of our country.

455
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,880
You made a great contribution,

456
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,110
so I'll reward you.

457
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,710
I can't claim credit for myself.

458
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,280
The success of curing the smallpox

459
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,190
depended on the favorable, geographical and human conditions.

460
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,520
First,

461
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,040
Your Majesty's self-discipline and social commitment

462
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,000
touched God.

463
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,190
This is the favorable condition.

464
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,400
It was convenient to treat patients by area

465
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,590
in the spacious Qingshan Court.

466
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,880
This is the geographical condition.

467
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,710
Meanwhile,

468
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,280
many doctors and His Lordship

469
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,800
who was willing to try the smallpox viruses helped me.

470
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,430
This is the human condition.

471
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,040
You're modest.

472
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,070
You invented

473
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
the cure for smallpox,

474
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
so you rendered the greatest merit.

475
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,230
Your Majesty.

476
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,640
I want to

477
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,800
consult Dr. Jun about something.

478
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,040
These rats

479
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,000
want to profit at her expense.

480
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,880
Well,

481
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,230
just see how she will deal with it.

482
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,040
Go ahead.

483
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,160
Your Majesty,

484
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,640
the cure for smallpox

485
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,560
is the luck of our court.

486
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,350
But

487
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,430
there are few doctors who can vaccinate,

488
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
and most of them gather in the capital city.

489
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,830
So we should carefully think

490
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,190
how to popularize it in various regions.

491
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,880
Do you have any suggestions?

492
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,310
In my opinion,

493
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,590
our Imperial Academy of Medicine can be in charge of it,

494
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,950
and local clinics

495
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,800
can send doctors

496
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,590
to the capital city to learn the cure for smallpox.

497
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,920
Dr. Jun checks their learning effect,

498
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,070
and those qualified ones will go back to popularize the cure for smallpox in different areas

499
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,920
to prevent the people of our dynasty

500
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,110
from being infected with smallpox.

501
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,430
Yeah.

502
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,070
Your Majesty,

503
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,350
I agree

504
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,590
with Imperial Doctor Jiang.

505
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,830
What do you think about it, Dr. Jun?

506
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,070
Your Majesty,

507
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,160
I disagree.

508
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,710
Miss Jun must see His Majesty now.

509
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,560
She cured smallpox.

510
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,110
Doctors Imperial Academy of Medicine

511
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,070
don't dare to make difficulties for her.

512
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,190
Given her eloquence,

513
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,160
she won't be stumped.

514
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,830
She is

515
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,920
flexible.

516
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,920
In this meeting,

517
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,000
those imperial doctors

518
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,710
may rob her of her cure for smallpox.

519
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,230
If so,

520
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,830
will Miss Jun agree

521
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,110
or disagree to it?

522
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:10,950
Yes.

523
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,590
No.

524
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,190
The Jiuling Drugstore is a common drugstore,

525
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,190
but the Imperial Academy of Medicine was set up by the court,

526
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,760
so His Majesty must

527
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,110
want the cure for smallpox

528
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,710
to belong to the court.

529
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,070
Jun is weak,

530
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,400
so it'll be hard for her to refuse.

531
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,190
But

532
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,920
if she agrees,

533
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,560
that goes against her style.

534
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,640
Dr. Jun,

535
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,470
don't you want to

536
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,430
make the cure public?

537
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,430
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

538
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,640
it's doctors' pleasure to treat the patients all over the world,

539
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,040
so I certainly would like

540
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,430
to make it public

541
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,400
and want all the doctors

542
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,430
to learn it.

543
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,920
But

544
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,230
I don't want them to learn it via the Imperial Academy of Medicine

545
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,680
but doctors who worked in Qingshan Court.

546
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,110
You don't trust

547
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,470
doctors of the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

548
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,680
You misunderstand me.

549
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,280
Vaccination

550
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,710
requires practice

551
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,640
and can't be taught orally.

552
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,040
But

553
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,920
now smallpox was eradicated in the capital city.

554
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,830
Unless there's another smallpox outbreak

555
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,230
in which the doctors of the Imperial Academy of Medicine

556
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,800
popularize the cure,

557
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,830
after learning it.

558
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,310
But…

559
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,920
How can it be?

560
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,430
This…

561
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,560
How can she do so?

562
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,160
Ingrate.

563
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,470
Your Majesty,

564
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,040
that's why I

565
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,830
disagreed with Imperial Doctor Jiang.

566
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,190
She doesn't panic in the court at all.

567
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,880
She can't be underestimated.

568
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,350
What do you think we should do?

569
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,430
Your Majesty,

570
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,070
Dr. Feng is a famous doctor

571
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,710
who has run a clinic for decades in the capital city.

572
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,830
Widely praised,

573
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,110
and

574
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,430
he has made great contributions

575
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,920
to the success of curing smallpox.

576
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,310
So I recommend

577
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,800
Dr. Feng to be in charge

578
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,350
of the assessment and popularization of the cure for smallpox.

579
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,280
Local governments

580
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,880
can send their doctors to learn it,

581
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
and Dr. Feng will lead doctors

582
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,470
who know the cure

583
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,520
to teach them.

584
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,830
You invent

585
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,070
the cure for smallpox,

586
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,710
so it's better for you

587
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,350
to be in charge of it.

588
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,520
Your Majesty,

589
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,430
first, I'm too young

590
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,350
to convince the public.

591
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,190
Second,

592
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,710
Dr. Feng has more experience

593
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,590
in vaccination than I do.

594
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,590
A young woman

595
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,400
also knows how to avoid the spotlight?

596
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,070
OK.

597
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,760
But you must

598
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,560
supervise them.

599
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,800
OK.

600
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,560
Thank Your Majesty for great grace.

601
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,350
Get up.

602
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,680
This is not my reward to you.

603
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,880
You should

604
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,400
thank her.

605
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,950
Dr. Jun

606
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,000
is really amazing.

607
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,640
At such a young age,

608
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,280
you don't claim credit for yourself and become arrogant.

609
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,950
You're really awesome.

610
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,470
Chu Rang is suspicious.

611
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,470
If I don't ask for anything,

612
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,190
he must doubt my intention.

613
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,350
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

614
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,190
Actually,

615
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,350
I do have a small request.

616
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,190
Please promise me.

617
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,230
What's your request?

618
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,190
I'll promise you.

619
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,520
I don't want money,

620
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,280
but if

621
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,640
Your Majesty can confer a title on me,

622
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,070
it can be regarded as a consolation to my ancestors' perseverance

623
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,160
in practicing medicine.

624
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,040
How dare you!

625
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,160
As a doctor,

626
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,800
how can you ask for a title?

627
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,280
His Majesty is benevolent.

628
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,310
Even if you cure the smallpox,

629
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,950
how can you

630
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,520
make requests unscrupulously?

631
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,040
It's my fault.

632
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Please punish me.

633
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400
Minister Huang, don't be angry.

634
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,880
I think

635
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,190
Dr. Jun's request

636
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,040
is reasonable.

637
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,710
I

638
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,590
promote you to the County Princess,

639
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,070
with the title

640
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,560
of Shanyang.

641
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,640
I, Jun Jiuling

642
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,640
thank Your Majesty for great grace.

643
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,470
Dr. Jun,

644
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,520
you're not a common woman now.

645
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,590
I,

646
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,760
County Princess Shanyang,

647
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,520
thank Your Majesty for great grace.

648
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,920
Your Majesty,

649
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
Their Highnesses

650
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,280
are waiting for Dr. Jun to vaccinate them.

651
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,920
Go.

652
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:12,460
Danfengmen

653
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,310
Dr. Jun,

654
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,040
they're coming.

655
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,950
Jun.

656
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,640
Dr. Feng,

657
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,160
I'll go to see you

658
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,190
for the vaccination tomorrow.

659
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,800
OK.

660
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,950
Then I'm leaving.

661
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,760
Take care.

662
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,760
Sister, I miss you.

663
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,560
I also miss you.

664
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,520
Why do you

665
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,800
come to see me today?

666
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,640
Get up.

667
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,000
What's up?

668
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,830
Sister,

669
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,590
we'll leave.

670
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,040
Don't worry.

671
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,680
I've found a place for them.

672
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,640
Well,

673
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,400
Zhou Jing, Maomao,

674
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,470
remember to

675
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,560
take good care of yourselves

676
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,880
in the future

677
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,470
even if I'm not at your side.

678
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,160
Understand?

679
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,560
Yes.

680
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,560
Yes.

681
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,680
I'll always remember

682
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,560
your bravery and goodness

683
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,760
in Qingshan Court.

684
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,560
You must keep them in the future.

685
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:35,800
Miss Jun,

686
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,590
if you really like them,

687
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,310
just acknowledge them as your sons.

688
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,830
Can I call you adopted mother?

689
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,640
Then you're my adopted father.

690
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,230
You're my adopted mother.

691
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,950
-Adopted father. -Adopted mother.

692
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,880
Don't talk nonsense.

693
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,160
It's late.

694
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,110
They should leave.

695
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,400
Come on.

696
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,830
Say goodbye to your adopted parents.

697
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,350
Adopted father,

698
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,310
adopted mother,

699
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,560
take care.

700
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,110
We're leaving.

701
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,760
I wish you a safe journey.

702
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,430
Am I so old?

703
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,880
He called me adopted father.

704
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,520
What's wrong with you?

705
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm fine.

706
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,800
I just suddenly

707
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,560
want to cry.

708
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,680
What do you want to say to me?

709
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,800
No.

710
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,310
Jun Jiuling

711
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,430
is different from how others think about her.

712
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,230
Given your understanding of her,

713
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,400
is her behavior

714
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,430
in the court false

715
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,560
or true?

716
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,920
I think

717
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,190
it's false.

718
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,070
In Qingshan Court,

719
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,350
I had

720
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,760
few contacts with her,

721
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,000
but

722
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,430
I know

723
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,000
she is more impolite

724
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:37,759
at ordinary times.

725
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,280
Her behavior obviously shows that

726
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,470
she longs for power and influence.

727
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,950
What do you think about it?

728
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:50,629
In the court,

729
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,190
she still dared to make such a request,

730
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,040
so it should be  true.

731
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:03,799
Have all the princes been vaccinated?

732
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,000
Your Majesty,

733
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,710
Their Highnesses

734
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,280
all have been vaccinated

735
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,390
except for the Third Prince.

736
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,709
His Highness

737
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,229
has had a cough recently.

738
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,759
Dr. Jun said

739
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,120
only those who are in good health can be vaccinated.

740
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,230
So

741
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,600
His Highness can't be vaccinated

742
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,190
until he gets better.

743
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,120
Doctors from different prefectures

744
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,360
almost have acquired the cure,

745
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,190
except Dr. Liu's learners.

746
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,470
Two of his vaccinators

747
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,430
are not proficient,

748
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,190
but they can also go back after going on practicing

749
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,190
for 1 or 2 days.

750
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,280
It seems that everything goes well.

751
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,320
Yeah.

752
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,000
The list is posted!

753
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,560
What are they looking at?

754
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,280
It's bustling there.

755
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,710
Today is

756
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,600
March 18.

757
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,150
The Imperial Academy posted the list.

758
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,390
It's my name.

759
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,760
The exam of the Ministry of Rites is over?

760
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
-Yes. -I'm curious about Childe Ning's place

761
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,040
in the exam.

762
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,120
Your Ladyship, let's go to have a look.

763
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,840
Then,

764
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,560
I'm going to see Dr. Liu.

765
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,710
Thank you, Dr. Feng.

766
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,230
OK.

767
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,710
Let's go.

768
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,670
Look. Is this my name?

769
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,560
Excuse me.

770
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:04,950
Excuse me. Excuse me.

771
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,630
Look. Look.

772
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,600
-Excuse me. Excuse me. -My name is there.

773
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,560
My name is on the list.

774
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,150
On the list!

775
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,430
On the list!

776
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Childe Ning's name is on the list!

777
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,190
Great!

778
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:22,150
Ning Mansion
19
00:38:26,430 --> 00:02:09,190
Jiuling Drugstore

779
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,470
You're one of the top three in the exam of the Ministry of Rites,

780
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,800
but it's not the final imperial exam,

781
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,910
so your final ranking is still unknown.

782
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,760
I see.

783
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,080
I don't comment on these articles.

784
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,430
You polish them.

785
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,040
Let's talk about them in detail after I come back.

786
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,280
Yes,

787
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,000
uncle.

788
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,950
Ding,

789
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,560
how is it going in Qingshan Court?

790
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,120
Young Master,

791
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,600
you were busy with the exam,

792
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,870
so His Excellency Ning didn't allow me to tell you.

793
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,950
Her Ladyship Jun

794
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,630
cured the smallpox

795
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,910
and went downhill with others.

796
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,950
She is always able

797
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,080
to save the day.

798
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,080
Did Miss Jun return to the Jiuling Drugstore?

799
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:34,950
Yes.

800
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,360
Moreover,

801
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,560
His majesty summoned her

802
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,520
and promoted her

803
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,600
to County Princess Shanyang.

804
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,950
His Excellency Ning

805
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,710
was also on the spot.

806
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,190
Didn't he

807
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,630
tell you?

808
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,520
Uncle doesn't want me to have contact with her,

809
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,190
so he didn't tell me.

810
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,390
Well,

811
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,910
if madam knows it,

812
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,000
she won't definitely let me off.

813
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,150
Don't worry.

814
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,630
I won't tell her.

815
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,560
Thank you, Young Master.

816
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,600
Young Master,

817
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,710
here's your gift.

818
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,910
Put it down.

819
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,710
Young Master,

820
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,910
this is Miss Jun's gift for you.

821
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,710
She behaves above board

822
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,230
and sincerely.

823
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,360
She surpasses me.

824
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,000
You have studied hard

825
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,710
for a dozen years.

826
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,430
You standing here

827
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,360
are all pillars,

828
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,230
and Ning Yunzhao is the top of you

829
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,840
with extraordinary talent,

830
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,040
so he is No. 1.

831
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,120
I hope you will make persistent efforts

832
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,000
and make our country prosperous and stable.

833
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,800
Look.

834
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,910
Look there.

835
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,280
Jinxiu,

836
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
can I go out to get some air?

837
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,560
Of course.

838
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,470
Why do you ask me?

839
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,390
Now

840
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,760
Chen Qi

841
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,520
only listens to

842
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,800
Lady Jinxiu.

843
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,870
I don't mean it.

844
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,710
It's because he is unreliable.

845
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,910
But Chen Qi dealt with everything

846
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,520
very well

847
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,190
in Qingshan Court,

848
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,390
and Jinxiu seems to know it.

849
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,230
Yeah.

850
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,470
I don't know.

851
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,390
I'm unfamiliar with him.

852
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,800
I don't know it.

853
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,800
Unfamiliar?

854
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,560
Your Ladyship.

855
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,150
Your Ladyship.

856
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,520
His Excellency Lu comes!

857
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,800
Why does he come again?

858
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,470
