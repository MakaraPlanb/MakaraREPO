00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

Episode 28

17
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:26,870
Jiuling Drugstore

18
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,510
Danfengmen

19
00:30:12,250 --> 00:02:11,720
Lord Cheng's wife Yu Lan

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,190
Your Excellency,

21
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,360
I've sent them 

22
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,440
to Ghost Hand as you required.

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,030
How will we 

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,720
explain it if His Majesty or the Imperial Academy of Medicine

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,000
asks about them?

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,960
A prisoner

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,390
suffered from a serious disease,

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,320
and Imperial Doctor Jiang

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,630
was always responsible,

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,390
so 

31
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,190
he lived in the prison.

32
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,910
Do you know

33
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,080
what to say about the rest?

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,110
Imperial Doctor Jiang did his best to treat the prisoner

35
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,720
but suffered from an incurable disease in the prison

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,470
and then died.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,190
You can go.

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,440
You shouldn't try to hurt my woman.

39
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,550
Your Excellency,

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,160
Miss Jun has left Zezhou

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,880
and headed north.

42
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,160
I don't think

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
she would bring too many men on the way.

44
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,600
I will take some people

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,670
to bring Miss Jun back for you.

46
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,880
But 

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,910
you must do it

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,240
after she settles the problem.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,030
Yes.

50
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,110
Let's go.

51
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,240
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,520
please let me

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,270
return to the North.

54
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,390
How dare you talk about the war!

55
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,080
OK,

56
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,960
let me show you something.

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,910
This one

58
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,000
accuses your father

59
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,600
of delay of military plan.

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,800
Read it.

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,520
This one

62
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,880
accuses your father

63
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,240
of cheating and disloyalty.

64
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,080
This one accuses you and your father

65
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,910
of occupying and spending the military expenditure in expanding your mansion.

66
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,080
You can read them.

67
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,800
How dare you mention the war?

68
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,110
Do you want to take this opportunity

69
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,520
to go on occupying the military expenditure?

70
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,670
Read them.

71
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,320
Read!

72
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,880
Read them carefully!

73
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,470
All are to impeach you and your father.

74
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,630
I trust you,

75
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,520
so I don't believe the contents in these memorials.

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
How could you repay me in this way?

77
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,240
No wonder people in the North say that

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,670
there is an emperor in the South,

79
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,200
while there is Lord Cheng in the North.

80
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,109
Your Zhu's army

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,040
is really awesome!

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,230
Your Majesty,

83
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,160
these rumors

84
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,950
are baseless.

85
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,440
You're the guardian god and the belief

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,950
of the North.

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,670
People always say,

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,270
without you,

89
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,390
my father won't be there

90
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,830
guarding the peace and prosperity of the North.

91
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,950
Your Majesty,

92
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,950
my father Zhu Shan is dedicated.

93
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,200
He'll risk his life for the court at any time.

94
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,230
He is loyal.

95
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,390
Your Majesty,

96
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
you're wise.

97
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,830
Don't hear and believe slanders.

98
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,230
That's what you say!

99
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,040
Tell me.

100
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,720
Don't you know

101
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,950
why I kept you in the capital city?

102
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,920
Do you know?

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,110
I'm trying to shut up those

104
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,640
who have impeached you.

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
I want to make them believe that

106
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,110
as you're under my control,

107
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,600
your father will be afraid.

108
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,760
I put on a show for them.

109
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,720
Your Majesty.

110
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,920
Fine.

111
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,950
Go to feed horses

112
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
in the Pasturage Department.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,480
Your Majesty,

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,200
I want to redeem myself by good service.

115
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,550
I want to go out to battle with my father.

116
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,920
I want to go out to battle with my father.

117
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,440
I want to go out to battle with my father.

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,950
I want to go out to battle with my father.

119
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,390
Miss Jun,

120
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,880
those of Arm Moral Department are following us.

121
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,230
They've done

122
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,550
nothing to us so far.

123
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Just let them be.

124
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,600
What should we do?

125
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,000
Return to Zezhou?

126
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,480
Keep heading north.

127
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,040
We managed to come here.

128
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,550
I want to check if it's alright with the vaccine.

129
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,320
Lady Jinxiu,

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
Miss Jun sent a letter here.

131
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,040
Well,

132
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,600
let me have a look.

133
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,110
What,

134
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,480
what did she say?

135
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,350
Is it

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,920
about the vaccine?

137
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,920
Something went wrong with the vaccine,

138
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,110
but it has nothing

139
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,950
to do with ours.

140
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,000
It's false.

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,950
False?

142
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,350
What,

143
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,670
what's the matter?

144
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,110
Blinded by greed,

145
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,000
several doctors

146
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,070
who know how to vaccinate,

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,790
extracted vaccine from those 

148
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,550
who got vaccinated.

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,000
However, they did it in a wrong way.

150
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,950
With strong toxicity,

151
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,040
the vaccine went wrong.

152
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,830
I see.

153
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,040
Luckily, it's solved.

154
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,790
Yes. Yes.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,720
Luckily, it's solved.

156
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,550
Luckily, it's solved.

157
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,480
His Majesty doesn't let me go back,

158
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,830
but I must go back.

159
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,670
If you go out now,

160
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,950
more people will want to kill you.

161
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,670
Zan,

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,640
be careful.

163
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,040
By the way,

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,280
how about the vaccine in the southwestern Hebei?

165
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,199
Miss Jun has solved it,

166
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,349
but

167
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,400
she is missing.

168
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,880
I think she is

169
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,110
hiding from those of Lu Yunqi.

170
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,470
Your Lordship.

171
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,000
Your Lordship.

172
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,150
Someone is calling you.

173
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,280
I'll let you know

174
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,400
as soon as I get her news.

175
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,350
How troublesome she is!

176
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,550
Coming.

177
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,150
Your Excellency,

178
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
the princess is fine.

179
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,760
She just got a cold.

180
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,030
I'll take good care

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
of the princess.

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,030
Don't make any mistakes.

183
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,200
Don't worry.

184
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,710
I'll try my best.

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,150
I'll prescribe now.

186
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,640
Your Highness

187
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,230
needs to take good care of yourself,

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,590
even if

189
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,640
it's for His Highness Prince Huai.

190
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,000
He has lost Jiuling.

191
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,880
He can't afford to lose you.

192
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,880
I know.

193
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,280
Back then,

194
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,080
did Jiuling

195
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,110
ask you to take care of us?

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,760
No.

197
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,640
Then I have to be grateful to you.

198
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,910
Please have more rest.

199
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,840
Jiuling,

200
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,110
Princess Jiuli

201
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,280
thanked me for taking care of her and Jiurong.

202
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,960
She asked if you asked me to do that.

203
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
If you know that

204
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,080
I have done all this for you,

205
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,110
will you be moved?

206
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,320
Fine.

207
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,790
As I like you,

208
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll try my best

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,840
to catch anyone

210
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
who is a bit like you.

211
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I won't miss them.

212
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,080
Old Master,

213
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
His Excellency Yu is here.

214
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,960
Let him in.

215
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,760
Minister Huang,

216
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,670
thank you for your strategy.

217
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
It seems that

218
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,710
we'll get

219
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,520
the three counties in Zhending soon.

220
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,400
You got benefit

221
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,200
in this deal,

222
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,230
but

223
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,350
I got nothing.

224
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,960
Lord Cheng

225
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,280
wasn't killed by Beiqi.

226
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,840
He even defeated Beiqi

227
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,030
and recovered Hejian Prefecture.

228
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,280
Minister Huang,

229
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,880
we were sure that

230
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,440
we would get Hejian Prefecture.

231
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,200
However,

232
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,150
Lord Cheng

233
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,910
rushed to the rescue quickly.

234
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,350
Your handwriting

235
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,880
lives up to its reputation.

236
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,960
You can write beautiful regular scripts in Academy Style.

237
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,880
I admire you.

238
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,230
I admire you.

239
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,790
We still want to

240
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
make up with you,

241
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,520
so please

242
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,640
pass that on.

243
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,590
Zhu Zan

244
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,400
killed my son.

245
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,440
I'll make him and his father pay with their lives.

246
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,910
I wanted to kill Zhu Zan

247
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,790
through Lu Yunqi,

248
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,440
but it was in vain.

249
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,880
You want peace as you lost.

250
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,110
Who will

251
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,350
avenge my son?

252
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,520
His Excellency Junior Huang

253
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,710
was nice to me,

254
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,710
but

255
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,790
I can't go against the imperial order.

256
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,400
If you want to make peace at this time,

257
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,470
the credit will go to Lord Cheng.

258
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,710
In this case,

259
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
Lord Cheng will be known

260
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,350
not only in the North,

261
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,910
but also around the country.

262
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,440
What do you mean?

263
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,520
Whether you offer counties,

264
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,670
money or treasures,

265
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,910
they're external wealth.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,640
You're

267
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,520
in good faith,

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,110
but that's far from enough.

269
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,440
Dare you

270
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,440
fight to death?

271
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,790
Express your sincerity

272
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,150
with lives

273
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,200
of Beiqi generals and soldiers.

274
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,550
It's such a big thing

275
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,910
that I can't decide.

276
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,230
Leave it to His Majesty.

277
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,150
A long delay may cause trouble.

278
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,880
Be quick.

279
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes.

280
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,440
Minister Huang,

281
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,030
I'm

282
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,200
leaving.

283
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,440
I'll go north.

284
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,000
Your Ladyship,

285
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,880
are we going to travel again?

286
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,110
I wonder where we're going first.

287
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,200
Your Ladyship,

288
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,350
something happened.

289
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,080
Beiqi has waged

290
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,200
a war against our country.

291
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,760
Wage a war?

292
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,230
Beiqi has thrown down the gauntlet.

293
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,640
It has gathered its generals and soldiers

294
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,670
and attacked from east and west.

295
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,280
Lord Cheng has ordered

296
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,590
all prefectures to prepare for war.

297
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,110
The Yongxing Army and the Guangcheng Army

298
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,960
are currently being mobilized.

299
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,760
People's life

300
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,550
goes as usual.

301
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,550
They have reserved food

302
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,230
and reduced going out

303
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,000
as required,

304
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,030
but

305
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,400
the North 

306
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,790
is not as peaceful as before.

307
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,000
We'd better not go north

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,880
for the time being.

309
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,550
Yes.

310
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,280
It'll be dangerous once the war is started.

311
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Your Ladyship,

312
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,200
why don't we turn back?

313
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,910
Whether to Zezhou

314
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,280
or the capital city,

315
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,280
we'll follow you.

316
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:35,910
No.

317
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,760
In this case,

318
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,110
we must go to the North

319
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,710
and visit all prefectures.

320
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,520
Only when the vaccination is arranged

321
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,710
can Lord Cheng

322
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,550
fight again the enemies

323
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,320
without worrying the people.

324
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,350
But we...

325
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,230
-We… -Just do it.

326
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,670
Go pack things now.

327
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,710
We'll leave today.

328
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,910
Yes.

329
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,759
I didn't expect the war has become stalemated.

330
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,280
Get ready to move.

331
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,520
Gather those

332
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,710
of the Sky Pavilion in the southwestern Hebei.

333
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,640
We'll meet there.

334
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,470
How will you get out?

335
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,229
I have my ways.

336
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,000
Zan,

337
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,560
there is news of Miss Jun.

338
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,160
She went north from Qingyuan Prefecture.

339
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,830
Go find out about her first

340
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,000
and then meet us.

341
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,830
OK.

342
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,520
Minister Huang,

343
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,230
this is a jade seal that the emperor of Beiqi

344
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,230
asked skilled craftsmen to make.

345
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,800
You can use it after all is done.

346
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,590
Please have a look.

347
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Do you like it?

348
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,160
It's too early

349
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,280
to talk about that.

350
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
The war situation

351
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,830
is unfavorable to Beiqi.

352
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,230
Lord Cheng is so brave.

353
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,280
We suffered heavy losses

354
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,430
in the battle in Xiongzhou.

355
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,760
I know

356
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,520
you can't handle him.

357
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,950
That's why we need your strategy.

358
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,800
Raid Kaide Prefecture.

359
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,310
It's

360
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,950
the sore spot of my country.

361
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
His Majesty will

362
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,830
recall Zhu Shan for help.

363
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,880
If he doesn't come back,

364
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,280
he acts against the order.

365
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,920
If he comes back...

366
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,830
Good idea.

367
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,640
Minister Huang, it's a good idea.

368
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,230
As soon as I go back,

369
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,520
I'll start a military action.

370
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,760
Be quick.

371
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,920
Don't worry.

372
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
It'll be foolproof.

373
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,560
As

374
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
the prime minister,

375
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,830
I feel sorry

376
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,920
for my country.

377
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,920
With civil and military skills,

378
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,280
you should be

379
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,350
the emperor of the country.

380
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,430
Governor,

381
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,830
remember.

382
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,470
I must get Zhu Shan and his son killed.

383
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,190
Don't expose your wound to water these days.

384
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,800
Be sure to wrap it up.

385
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,560
Your Ladyship,

386
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,520
here is Fuxi powder.

387
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,520
Right.

388
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,520
Give him Siwu powder

389
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,710
and decoct it with 1.5g of pseudo-ginseng

390
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,110
to take the decoction.

391
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,590
OK.

392
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,110
Fuxi powder.

393
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,880
Well.

394
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,710
Be careful.

395
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
-Let me support you. -Thanks, Dr. Jun.

396
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,470
Take this.

397
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,830
Your Ladyship,

398
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,350
those seriously injured have been arranged properly.

399
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,520
The vaccination has begun

400
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,350
over there.

401
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,590
OK. Thanks.

402
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,760
Liu'er,

403
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,110
conditions are tough here.

404
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,190
-Be careful. -You've worked hard.

405
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,680
I like

406
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,560
working with you.

407
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,230
Go.

408
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,310
Let's check over there.

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,800
Dr. Jun. Dr. Jun. Dr. Jun.

410
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,830
Dr. Jun is here.

411
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,560
It's my turn.

412
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,400
Dr. Jun.

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,680
Fellow citizens,

414
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,920
Lord Cheng asked me

415
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,230
to vaccinate you.

416
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,190
He knows clearly

417
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,950
your sufferings

418
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,710
and fear

419
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,280
in the intrusion,

420
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,070
so he specially

421
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,830
asked me to cure you here.

422
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,800
This is the blessing

423
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
of the people and the North.

424
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,110
Now

425
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,000
I've taught local doctors

426
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,590
how to vaccinate.

427
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,160
Please cooperate with them on the treatment.

428
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,640
Thanks, Dr. Jun.

429
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,520
His Highness Lord Cheng is so kind.

430
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,160
He is so kind.

431
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,520
Thanks, Dr. Jun.

432
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Don't stand on ceremony.

433
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,400
Living in the North,

434
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
we're one big family.

435
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,280
Let's continue the vaccination.

436
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,230
Kids under 10 come first.

437
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,560
Well. Please.

438
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,520
Liu'er,

439
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,680
go help Mr. Lei.

440
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,680
OK.

441
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,350
Betel nut tastes bitter.

442
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,470
It's warm, astringent and non-toxic.

443
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,430
It promotes digestion and relieves diuresis.

444
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,560
It can eliminate phlegm, kill worms,

445
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,710
cure hidden diseases

446
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,110
and kill pinworm. It grows in the south coast.

447
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,680
What are you doing, Mr. Lei?

448
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,880
Miss Jun said,

449
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,040
after years of wars in the North,

450
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,680
food and drinking water here

451
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,920
have become so dirty.

452
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,470
In addition, there is miasma.

453
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,950
The people are certainly

454
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,680
breeding diseases and worms.

455
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,560
Betel nuts

456
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,920
can promote qi, kill worms,

457
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,880
eliminate accumulation and relieve diuresis.

458
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,400
It's a good medicine supplement.

459
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,470
Now that

460
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Miss Jun has left the important task

461
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,800
of sorting medicinal materials to me,

462
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,400
I must not make mistakes.

463
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,350
I need to know the efficacy

464
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,710
of these herbs.

465
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,110
You're so attentive.

466
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,590
Your Majesty,

467
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,400
we can't let Kaide Prefecture fall.

468
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,710
Back then, Beiqi

469
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,310
attacked from there

470
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
and went all the way south

471
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
to surround the capital city.

472
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,000
Nobody could rescue.

473
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
The then emperor's father was captured.

474
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,230
At last,

475
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
he died in Beiqi.

476
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,070
Are they

477
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,710
going to

478
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,070
repeat it?

479
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,040
Your Majesty,

480
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,470
please order Lord Cheng

481
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,470
to protect Kaide Prefecture.

482
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,070
The same route.

483
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,280
The same strategy.

484
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,880
What a coincidence!

485
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
Your Majesty, please don't.

486
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,560
Lord Cheng is fighting

487
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,430
against Beiqi in the North.

488
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,070
If he is recalled at this point,

489
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,760
the North 

490
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,520
will be trampled upon at will.

491
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,190
Minister Ning,

492
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,400
you mean we can ignore

493
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,590
the safety of the capital city?

494
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,070
I don't mean that.

495
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,680
Minister Huang, don't take this out of context.

496
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,430
I care about Your Majesty.

497
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,280
It's all for your safety.

498
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,800
Your Majesty, please recall

499
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,760
Lord Cheng to protect Kaide Prefecture.

500
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,430
Your Majesty,

501
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,430
even if you don't worry about your safety,

502
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,470
think about all the people in the city.

503
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,640
Your Majesty.

504
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,880
Please recall Lord Cheng to protect Kaide Prefecture.

505
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,560
Please recall Lord Cheng to protect Kaide Prefecture.

506
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,400
Yaozi Pass.

507
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,110
Qingpa River.

508
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,400
Liangcheng City.

509
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,880
The capital of my country.

510
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,400
It's risky to raid

511
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,470
Kaide Prefecture alone.

512
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,560
It doesn't seem like

513
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,830
fighting to get into the interior.

514
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,230
What a coincidence!

515
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,350
All marching routes

516
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,350
are like those

517
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,680
in the third year of the Taiyan period.

518
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,160
They want to

519
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,590
disturb the morale of our army.

520
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,710
What's wrong with the horses?

521
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,880
The horses are running away.

522
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,400
They're running away.

523
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,160
Stop them.

524
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,800
Hurry up.

525
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,950
I can't.

526
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,800
Don't let them run away.

527
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,350
Someone.

528
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,280
Stop them.

529
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,470
Someone.

530
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,680
Stop them.

531
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,880
Stop them.

532
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,710
Chase them.

533
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,400
Order

534
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,950
Lord Cheng

535
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,640
to dispatch troops immediately

536
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,470
to protect Kaide Prefecture.

537
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,070
Your Majesty,

538
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,280
I think 

539
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,800
you can issue more edicts

540
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,430
to show your reliance on Lord Cheng

541
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,880
and to let him know that

542
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,310
it's serious,

543
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,160
so he'll return immediately.

544
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,280
Then issue another

545
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,520
two,

546
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,470
three...

547
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,470
No.

548
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,800
Issue ten edicts.

549
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,000
Your Majesty is wise.

550
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,560
Zhu,

551
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,920
Zhu Zan ran away.

552
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,710
Your Majesty,

553
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,230
Zhu Zan ran away.

554
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,590
How useless!

555
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,590
How can they let him run away?

556
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,830
What happened?

557
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,640
The horses were startled,

558
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,350
so he chased them.

559
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,880
However, as he whistled all the way,

560
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,470
the horses

561
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,470
followed him.

562
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,350
The horses 

563
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,880
didn't fear swords and arrows.

564
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,190
Zhu Zan hid in them,

565
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,400
so no one could catch him.

566
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,880
Your Excellency,

567
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,590
it's my fault.

568
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,830
Though we were careful,

569
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,470
we didn't expect that

570
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,560
he ran away like this.

571
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,190
Pleas punish me.

572
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,920
Let it go

573
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,040
this time.

574
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,830
Do something for me.

575
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,230
Your Excellency,

576
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,040
what's your order?

577
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
Your Majesty has sent orders around the country.

578
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,190
Son of Lord Cheng fled to escape punishment.

579
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,160
Whoever sees him

580
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,350
can catch him.

581
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:18,560
Yes.

582
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,350
I'll notify men of all departments.

583
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,950
Your Ladyship.

584
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,800
OK.

585
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,590
Your Ladyship,

586
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,830
they've followed us all the way.

587
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,350
How persevering!

588
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,880
Let them go.

589
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,640
They've done nothing to us

590
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,430
all the way.

591
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
The North is uneasy now.

592
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,190
Take them as our body guards.

593
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,230
Go.

594
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,680
Go.

595
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,190
Go.

596
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,000
Protect madame.

597
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,560
Go.

598
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,950
Go.

599
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,950
Go.

600
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,400
There's a fight down there.

601
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,310
Your Ladyship,

602
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,710
shall we avoid it?

603
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,280
Help them.

604
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,040
Get on the horse.

605
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,710
Get on the horse.

606
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,830
Your Ladyship, be careful.

607
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,680
Your Excellency,

608
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,430
what should we do?

609
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,680
Laoba,

610
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,310
find a chance to escape,

611
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,350
or we'll be killed here.

612
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,110
Don't worry, madame.

613
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,470
I'll keep you safe.

614
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,760
Protect madame.

615
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,800
Laoba.

616
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,680
Madame Yu.

617
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,640
Leave.

618
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,160
Run.

619
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,710
I'm fine.

620
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,230
Be careful.

621
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,760
Madame.

622
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,800
Your Ladyship.

623
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,560
Your Ladyship.

624
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,830
Your Ladyship, are you alright?

625
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,950
I'm fine.

626
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,040
Are you alright?

627
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,950
What's wrong, madame?

628
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,760
Well, be careful.

629
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,710
Well.

630
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,110
Madame,

631
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,590
your feet may hurt a bit these days.

632
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:49,920
Hold on.

633
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,070
If it doesn't hurt,

634
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,920
it'll be troublesome.

635
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,040
Leave it to me.

636
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:54,880
Well.

637
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:56,950
Be careful.

638
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,560
Are you alright?

639
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,190
Yes.

640
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,640
What's your surname, young lady?

641
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,350
My surname is Jun.

642
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,350
Miss Jun.

643
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,470
Where are you going, madame?

644
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,430
Daming Prefecture.

645
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,430
He wasn't a robber.

646
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,190
He just killed and robbed us of nothing.

647
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,400
I think he was

648
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,110
from Beiqi.

649
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,230
Miss Jun.

650
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,470
Please wait, madame.

651
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,190
Mr. Lei,

652
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,430
what's going on there?

653
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,400
Your Ladyship,

654
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,520
they weren't robbers,

655
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,230
but Beiqi soldiers in disguise.

656
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,230
I see.

657
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
That makes sense.

658
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,800
Mr. Lei,

659
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,400
change our route to Daming Prefecture.

660
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,590
Daming Prefecture?

661
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,040
Yes.

662
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,680
Why?

663
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,830
I have no time to explain.

664
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,590
I'll tell you later.

665
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,350
Get ready and go.

666
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,920
OK.

667
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,590
Go

668
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,310
Everyone,

669
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,430
Clean up now

670
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,280
and get ready to go.

671
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,110
Madame,

672
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,590
I'll escort you to Daming Prefecture.

673
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,310
It seems that

674
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,950
you have no other choice now.

675
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,310
Your Excellency Jin,

676
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,350
thank you all the way.

677
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,760
What do you mean, Miss Jun?

678
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,640
I wonder when His Excellency Lu

679
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,590
will capture me to the capital city.

680
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,560
You misunderstand.

681
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,160
I don't mean to do that.

682
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,920
So you're escorting me.

683
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,910
In this case,

684
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,870
I have to trouble you in the following journey.

685
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,320
Coming.

686
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,120
Come on. Come on. Come on.

687
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,630
Hurry up.

688
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,870
Come on. Come on. Come on.

689
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,600
Is it ready?

690
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,470
A moment. A moment.

691
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,320
Well, here you are.

692
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,800
Pour.

693
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,560
Why are you crying?

694
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,390
Pour.

695
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,320
Give me one.

696
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,320
Beauty,

697
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,430
let me have a look.

698
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,360
Let me have a look.

699
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,870
Come on.

700
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,710
Come on. Come on. Come on.

701
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,600
Pour. Pour. Pour.

702
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,390
Pour.

703
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,150
Fill it. Fill it.

704
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,710
Is it ready?

705
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
A moment. A moment.

706
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,840
Be patient.

707
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,870
I haven't eaten.

708
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,430
Someone is there.

709
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,390
Run.

710
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,430
How are you?

711
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,040
I'm fine.

712
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,040
Where is Baotang?

713
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,280
He gathered brothers in northwest

714
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,120
and went to Kaide Prefecture directly.

715
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,950
No news of Miss Jun.

716
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,470
Let's go

717
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,080
to Kaide Prefecture.

718
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
He has refused

719
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,520
ten of my edicts.

720
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,190
Damn Zhu Shan!

721
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,840
Your Majesty,

722
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
please punish

723
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,120
Zhu Shan, Lord Cheng,

724
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,950
for being treacherous.

725
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,080
Your Majesty,

726
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,280
please punish

727
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,800
Zhu Shan, Lord Cheng,

728
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:14,910
for being overbearing.

729
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,470
Your Majesty,

730
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,560
please punish

731
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,320
Zhu Shan

732
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,190
for being overbearing.

733
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,320
Your Majesty,

734
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,840
as Zhu Zan escaped,

735
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,280
Lord Cheng fears nothing.

736
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,670
How dare they

737
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,040
do that!

738
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,280
Your Majesty,

739
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,950
I've sent out wanted orders around the country.

740
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,190
We'll catch Zhu Zan

741
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,080
as soon as possible.

742
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,560
Your Majesty,

743
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,560
we just see that as his son

744
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,150
escaped,

745
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,470
Lord Cheng fears nothing.

746
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,430
But think about it.

747
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,360
As son of Lord Cheng escaped to the North,

748
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,280
the wanted orders will spread all over the country.

749
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,320
It's dangerous to him.

750
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,470
As a father,

751
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,670
the easiest choice for Lord Cheng

752
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,040
is to send troops back to defend.

753
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,710
Thus, your edicts will be obeyed

754
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,390
and his son will be saved.

755
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,430
It's the best way to achieve both.

756
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,190
But Lord Cheng

757
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,150
doesn't mind that his son

758
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,080
is in danger.

759
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,230
He just sees that

760
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,390
if he leads troops back to defend,

761
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,760
the North will be in chaos,

762
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,760
the people there will suffer

763
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,430
and the country will be destroyed.

764
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,470
Your Majesty,

765
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,710
Lord Cheng

766
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,000
seems to go against you,

767
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,320
but he is actually refusing to do

768
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
what a father should do.

769
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,390
He puts the North above everything,

770
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,870
Your Majesty.

771
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,600
It's alright now.

772
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,630
You mean

773
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,390
I'm inferior

774
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,760
to Lord Cheng.

775
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,230
Your Majesty,

776
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,870
I don't mean that.

777
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,390
It's my country.

778
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,470
Don't tell me

779
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,870
what to do.

780
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,840
Your Majesty,

781
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,280
please think carefully.

782
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,910
How arrogant you are!

783
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,840
I will suspend your position

784
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,870
and punish you

785
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,470
by pondering over your mistakes in solitude

786
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,150
for three months.

787
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,400
♫Outline in my dream♫

788
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,840

805
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,200
