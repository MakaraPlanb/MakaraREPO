00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 36

17
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,850
Danfengmen

18
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:36,870
Danfengmen

19
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,310
Danfengmen

20
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:22,230
Danfengmen

21
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,070
Lord Cheng's Mansion

22
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,910
Lord Cheng's Mansion

23
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,030
Lord Cheng's Mansion

24
00:26:57,000 --> 00:02:09,190
Danfengmen

25
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,390
Is he going to send

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,000
Tianyou to Beiqi?

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,270
Your Majesty,

28
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,630
since Lord Cheng returned to the capital city,

29
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,080
I've received many memorials

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,550
from officials in the North.

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,000
They put pressure on the court

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
and ignored the government officials' orders.

33
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,270
Earl of Qinghe can do nothing in the North.

34
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,600
Officials agree outwardly but disagree inwardly.

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,520
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,320
as long as Lord Cheng is still there,

37
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,750
the border will never be peaceful.

38
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,880
Your Majesty,

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,240
please remove Lord Cheng

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,470
from the military service

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,550
and punish him

42
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,600
for his abuse of power

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,550
and action without authorization.

44
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,110
Agreed.

45
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,830
Agreed.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,550
Your Majesty,

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,630
please make a final decision.

48
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,800
We can't make presumptuous speculations.

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,720
God knows

50
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,960
my loyalty

51
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,830
to Your Majesty

52
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,440
and the court.

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,390
I don't want to explain today.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
I just

55
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,190
have a request.

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,830
I'm old

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,110
and suffer from dull pain

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,160
because of the injuries

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,390
in this battle,

60
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,270
so I hope Your Majesty

61
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,360
can agree to my resignation

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,520
from my military post.

63
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,670
Well,

64
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,270
you share

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,750
the same idea with me.

66
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,550
I know

67
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,000
you've fought outside throughout the year

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,440
and worked for the nation with great merits.

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,390
You also suffer from injuries.

70
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,880
Well,

71
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,550
recuperate

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,790
from them

73
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,950
in the capital city.

74
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

75
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,670
Take care of yourself.

76
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,790
I wish you get well soon.

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,350
Your Majesty,

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,550
if the court still needs me,

79
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,950
I'll 

80
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,480
shrink from no sacrifice.

81
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,550
Lord Cheng resigned from the post?

82
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,440
To be exact,

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,950
he was actually demobilized.

84
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,000
To save his face,

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
His Majesty didn't fire him directly.

86
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,040
Lord Cheng must

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,200
have his own consideration.

88
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,550
He gets nothing

89
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,270
but an empty title.

90
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,670
All his powers were deprived.

91
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,320
Lord Cheng is a minister of high position.

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
By rights, he should at least take a post with very little to do,

93
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,830
but His Majesty

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,720
deprived all his powers.

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,720
His Majesty wants to tell the public

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,510
Lord Cheng's resignation

97
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,720
isn't a normal resignation

98
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,230
but punishment.

99
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,110
There're many discussions on the streets.

100
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,600
People say Lord Cheng is greedy for combat achievements

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,230
and eager to provoke a battle between our state and Beiqi

102
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,160
to force His Majesty

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,270
to return his military power to him,

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,640
and His Majesty had to 

105
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,230
dismiss him in disguise.

106
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,110
I'll go and meet Lord Cheng.

107
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,350
Miss Jun.

108
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,200
Jiuling.

109
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,230
I was about to meet you.

110
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,950
How is your father?

111
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,880
After resignation, he feels carefree

112
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,880
and relaxed.

113
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,230
Will you leave?

114
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,070
They'll leave.

115
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,230
Won't you leave?

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
No, 

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,320
I'll stay to protect you.

118
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,390
Zhu Zan,

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,550
though your father handed over his military power,

120
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
His Majesty and Huang Cheng

121
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,640
won't let him go.

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920
It's vital for you

123
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,200
to escort your father and mother

124
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,510
to leave safely.

125
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,200
Easy.

126
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,200
I'm fine.

127
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,830
I don't revenge

128
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,200
rashly.

129
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,200
Jiuling.

130
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,510
Father, mother.

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,070
Your Grace.

132
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,350
Miss Jun,

133
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,270
don't worry about me.

134
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,550
I had long thought of this day.

135
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,320
You leave your credit to me,

136
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,440
which will give a handle to others.

137
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,510
You deserve it.

138
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,600
And they aim at me

139
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,320
and my credit

140
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,600
can't be erased.

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,830
But His Majesty

142
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,040
is weakening your reputation.

143
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,000
If you 

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
leave your credit to me now,

145
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,390
I'm afraid…

146
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,390
Never mind.

147
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,160
I'd rather you accept the credit.

148
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,350
I'm afraid His Majesty

149
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,350
won't let me enjoy it for long.

150
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,720
It's long enough for you 

151
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,270
to complete your matter.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,830
With some reputation,

153
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,070
you can become more popular

154
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,230
and do something greater.

155
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
You're a doctor

156
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,510
who cures the sickness and saves the patient.

157
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,230
Even if His Majesty dislikes you,

158
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,200
he can't go against

159
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,640
the will of the people in the end.

160
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,230
Miss Jun,

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,790
some people from the imperial palace went to Jiuling Drugstore,

162
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,440
saying Her Majesty Empress wants to see you.

163
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,600
Shopkeeper Chen's carriage is waiting outside.

164
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,950
Okay, I see.

165
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,350
Yes.

166
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,070
Your

167
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,110
Graces,

168
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,440
see you.

169
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,920
May you a safe journey.

170
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,230
We'll leave first.

171
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,790
Jiuling,

172
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,350
promise me something.

173
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,080
Just say.

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,230
Don't act as impulsively

175
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,710
as you did last time.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Now I know

177
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,840
it's the most important to live.

178
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,080
If I live, there'll be more chances.

179
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,910
After narrowly

180
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,440
escaping death,

181
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,470
I won't act impulsively again.

182
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,080
Slowly.

183
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,710
Miss Jun,

184
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,590
please go.

185
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,640
I'm waiting for you here.

186
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,710
OK.

187
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,840
We're urgently summoned to the imperial palace again by His Majesty

188
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,840
after the morning court session just ended.

189
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,840
Perhaps something big will happen.

190
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,230
This hypocritical emperor

191
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,960
finally shows his true face.

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,470
He stabilizes his throne

193
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,670
and eliminates dissidents,

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,960
so he don't have scruples

195
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
or need to pretend to be benevolent.

196
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,590
Childe Ning,

197
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,550
protect yourself.

198
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,590
It's good for Lord Cheng

199
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,080
to resign at the height of his prosperity.

200
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,030
I worry his concessions

201
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,910
may drive himself to desperation.

202
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,110
Jiu Ling,

203
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,400
you've closely related to Lord Cheng,

204
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,840
so you should be more careful.

205
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,520
Everyone wants to protect himself

206
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,790
in the chaotic court.

207
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,670
I admire your courage

208
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,880
to fight in the court.

209
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,550
I should lose no time

210
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,110
pacifying the popular feelings in the crisis.

211
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Loyal ministers are bitterly disappointed

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,110
and treacherous ones are in power,

213
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,030
leading to the unstable state situation

214
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,080
and disturbed life of the people.

215
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,670
I'll try my best

216
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,640
to save the people and our state

217
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,350
from falling into danger.

218
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,000
Your Majesty,

219
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,150
please

220
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,670
punish Zhu Shan

221
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,840
for his treason.

222
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,790
What?

223
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,150
Minister Huang,

224
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
don't make irresponsible remarks

225
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,350
before obtaining evidence.

226
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,200
Your Majesty,

227
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,550
I have evidence.

228
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,520
After Zhu Shan left the North,

229
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
officers and soldiers there

230
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,320
have been no longer oppressed by him,

231
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,440
so they submit their memorials

232
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,790
to report his evil deeds one after another.

233
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,440
I know it.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,670
There were

235
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,350
many memorials

236
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,960
about his impeachment.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,550
Your Majesty,

238
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,000
the past impeachments

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,110
were launched

240
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,440
by the civil officials in the North,

241
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,790
while this one

242
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,320
it's launched by officers and soldiers there.

243
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,670
I 

244
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
didn't want to report to Your Majesty

245
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,880
because I didn't believe

246
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,590
he's so bold

247
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,840
and Your Majesty

248
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,590
was rewarding him generously.

249
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,030
So I investigated him

250
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
in private,

251
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,470
only to find

252
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,000
more and more his evil deeds have emerged.

253
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,670
He is so rampant

254
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,960
that he even wants to provoke the battle between our state and Beiqi.

255
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,640
I 

256
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
don't dare to conceal it.

257
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,320
No, no, no.

258
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,470
Lord Cheng 

259
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,440
is a military officer favored by the late emperor.

260
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,790
He's of noble character and high prestige.

261
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't believe

262
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,640
he could do such a thing.

263
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,230
Your Majesty,

264
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,790
I have the evidence of his crime.

265
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,150
Please read it.

266
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,440
Your Majesty,

267
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,710
this is a letter

268
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,710
between him and the Crown Prince of Beiqi.

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,790
It can prove 

270
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,470
his crime of colluding with the enemy state

271
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,550
and rebelling against our state.

272
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,880
Jiuling is in the imperial palace.

273
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,960
As the future daughter-in-law of His Grace,

274
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,150
will she be implicated?

275
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,670
That's incredible.

276
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,000
How bold

277
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,400
Zhu Shan is.

278
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,910
I request

279
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,710
to capture Zhu Shan immediately.

280
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,550
I request

281
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,840
to capture Zhu Shan immediately.

282
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,520
There's nothing serious with Her Majesty.

283
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,840
Take good care of her.

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,230
Thank you, Dr. Jun.

285
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,960
Huixin,

286
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,550
Her Majesty wants to see you.

287
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,350
Go with me now.

288
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,440
Dr. Jun,

289
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
I'll go to report on completion.

290
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,350
Go ahead.

291
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,350
I know the way to leave the imperial palace.

292
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,110
Chu Jiuling,

293
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,670
how do you like your revisit?

294
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

295
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,790
What happened?

296
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,760
Miss Jun.

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,710
Minister Ning,

298
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,000
where will you go

299
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,400
in a hurry?

300
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,350
Minister Huang, stop kidding.

301
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,230
Surely I'll go to the Imperial Academy.

302
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,080
Your Excellency,

303
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,640
there's no one inside.

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,470
Go chase them.

305
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,280
Go chase them.

306
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,760
You finally came to yourself.

307
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,310
Where is this?

308
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,640
This is our marital room.

309
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,070
Help.

310
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,350
Help.

311
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,160
Is there anyone?

312
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,310
Help.

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,760
Help.

314
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,800
Help.

315
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,280
Don't shout in vain.

316
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,920
I locked the doors and windows.

317
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,760
Jiuling,

318
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,110
do you know

319
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,950
I feel as if I were in a dream

320
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,040
during the over one year when you left me?

321
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,640
It's 

322
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,520
our wedding day today.

323
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,710
And 

324
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,560
I've prepared a wedding dress for you.

325
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,110
It's the same

326
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,520
as that you wore when we got married that day.

327
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,470
Do you like it?

328
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,470
You're such a madman.

329
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,760
Madman?

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,160
I'm just a madman.

331
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,310
I only love you, forever and ever.

332
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,040
I am just crazy about you alone.

333
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,000
I just love you.

334
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,350
Don't come over.

335
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,560
Okay.

336
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,350
I won't come to you.

337
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,160
Jiuling,

338
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,190
why are you so indifferent to me?

339
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,920
Wearing a different face,

340
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,230
you don't know me?

341
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,280
Can you accept me

342
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,000
as long as I release you?

343
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,800
You're so cruel.

344
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,430
You stand before me

345
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,640
with a different face.

346
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,880
Lu Yunqi,

347
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,190
we're always enemies.

348
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,920
Both of us know it clearly.

349
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,350
Don't be self-sentimental.

350
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,230
Do you blame me

351
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,880
for not saving you

352
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,520
when you 

353
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,230
tried to assassinate His Majesty?

354
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,000
I did that to protect you,

355
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,920
-or… -Don't come over.

356
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,680
No.

357
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,350
No. No. No.

358
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,520
You aren't her incarnation.

359
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,190
You're just her.

360
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,760
Jiuling,

361
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,680
-you're back. -What a madman.

362
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,640
-Don't come over. -Jiuling.

363
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,190
-Don't come over. -You're back.

364
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,560
You're back.

365
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,830
-Don't come over. -You're back.

366
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,280
Don't come to me.

367
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,950
Okay.

368
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,560
I won't come to you.

369
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,760
Do you know?

370
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,230
His Majesty has suspected you.

371
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,880
You're safe with me.

372
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,280
Only I can protect you.

373
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,920
Chu Rang is

374
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,230
everything to you.

375
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,400
Just kill me now.

376
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,040
You're everything to me.

377
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,640
You are my beloved girl

378
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,110
and my dead wife.

379
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,350
I don't kill you.

380
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,920
Don't you 

381
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,000
like the atmosphere here?

382
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,560
Do you dislike here?

383
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,040
It doesn't matter.

384
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
If you dislike here,

385
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,280
we can go anywhere

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,070
you like.

387
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,070
You're crazy.

388
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,000
To please you,

389
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,190
-I can go to the ends of the earth with you. -You're crazy.

390
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,560
If you dislike here,

391
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,470
-I can take you to other places. -Don't come over.

392
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,160
Give me this.

393
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,230
Don't come over.

394
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,000
Jiuling.

395
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,070
I'm not mad.

396
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,280
I'm not mad.

397
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,400
Even if I get mad,

398
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,760
I still love you.

399
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,230
How long do you want to lock me here?

400
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,280
No,

401
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,000
I do this to protect you.

402
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,160
See what I prepared for you.

403
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,070
I tried hard to restore the scene

404
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,760
when we got married that day.

405
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,070
Do you dislike that scene?

406
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,590
Never mind.

407
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,640
I'll design it

408
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,190
according to the atmosphere in the Mansion of Prince Huai

409
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,040
as you're familiar with there.

410
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,230
I'll take you to the ends of the earth.

411
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,680
As long as I can be with you,

412
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,000
I'd like to go to the ends of the earth.

413
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,640
Jiuling.

414
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,950
Jiuling.

415
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,070
Okay.

416
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,190
Okay.

417
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,710
I don't come to you.

418
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,310
I don't come to you.

419
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,110
I just stay here.

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,760
I just stay here.

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,160
I just stay here with you.

422
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,710
Halt.

423
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,070
Halt.

424
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,640
Your Grace,

425
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
please go back to the capital city with me.

426
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,640
Whose order?

427
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,040
His Majesty's.

428
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,190
Please receive your punishment

429
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,110
in the capital city.

430
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,760
Receive my punishment?

431
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,680
What crime?

432
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,800
Treason.

433
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,590
Treason?

434
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,950
We've worked for the court for a dozen years.

435
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,800
How can you trump up

436
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,560
our treason?

437
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,190
Zan.

438
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,160
Father.

439
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,760
Will we go back?

440
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,680
I've wielded

441
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,640
this sword, red with blood,

442
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,310
for most of my life,

443
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,680
but I've always used it

444
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,880
to kill those invaders of Beiqi.

445
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,000
I've been driven into an impasse.

446
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
I just want to keep my fame.

447
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,590
If you're driven into an impasse,

448
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,190
do you want to be humiliated?

449
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,400
I only use my sword to kill the enemy

450
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,920
rather than our own men.

451
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,800
If you force me hard,

452
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,830
I'd rather die

453
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,350
than be humiliated in the capital city.

454
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,640
Your Grace,

455
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,830
do you know

456
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,950
what your leaving means?

457
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,110
It means I'll become

458
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,800
a traitor as you say.

459
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,310
Yes.

460
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,110
It means you flee to escape punishment.

461
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,710
It means

462
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,230
your treason is confirmed.

463
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,520
Your Grace,

464
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,160
you'll lose your military prestige,

465
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,350
be cast aside by the people

466
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,070
and erase

467
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,230
your military exploits of a dozen years.

468
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,310
I've protected the nation and the people most of my life.

469
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,520
I don't do that to gain high official positions and riches.

470
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,470
Your Grace,

471
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,350
since you're frank and selfless,

472
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,280
please go back to the capital city with me and make it public to the people.

473
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,160
Please don't escape.

474
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
People hate traitors to the marrow.

475
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,400
In my lifetime,

476
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,110
I hate disloyal, unfaithful

477
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,590
and disobedient people most.

478
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,880
Unexpectedly, I become

479
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,350
a traitor today.

480
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,230
But do you really believe

481
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
I am

482
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,830
a traitor?

483
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,920
I've fought for the safety of Tianyou

484
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,710
most of the life.

485
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,640
I've gone through fire and water

486
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,640
and braved untold danger numerous times,

487
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,350
hoping our people

488
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
can have a rich and healthy life.

489
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,880
I am forced to leave the capital city

490
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,800
and accept

491
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,640
the infamy of traitor.

492
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,560
God

493
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,160
and I know

494
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,560
whether I am

495
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,710
a loyal minister

496
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,310
or a traitor.

497
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,590
I have a clear conscience.

498
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,110
Your Grace,

499
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,880
if you can go back with me,

500
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
I'll try my best

501
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,950
to speak for you before His Majesty.

502
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,710
Don't choose this wrong way.

503
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,920
I've decided

504
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,040
to hold on

505
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,400
to this way.

506
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Our safety today

507
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,430
all attributes to Your Grace's credit.

508
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,470
Your Grace, may you be safe throughout the journey.

509
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,950
Make way.

510
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,190
Miss Jun.

511
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,280
Miss Jun.

512
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,280
Chen Qi.

513
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,070
Have you got

514
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,190
Miss Jun's news?

515
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,590
I asked several people in private.

516
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,760
They all said

517
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,590
Miss Jun had left 

518
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,950
from the south gate at about 4 p.m.

519
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,760
Impossible.

520
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,680
She knows I'm waiting for her here.

521
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,040
If she didn't come here,

522
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,470
she would ask someone to tell me.

523
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,190
She wouldn't ask me

524
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,110
to keep waiting for her here.

525
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,040
Is it because

526
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,160
she had something urgent to deal with

527
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,000
and didn't 

528
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,310
have time to tell us in advance?

529
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,680
We worried about her the whole night

530
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,400
as she didn't come back in time

531
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,760
and slept outside last time

532
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,590
when she went to collect herbs

533
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,800
outside the city for young master.

534
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
From that time, she has kept telling us

535
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
her whereabouts.

536
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,520
How could this be possible?

537
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,070
Well…

538
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,880
Look

539
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,560
around.

540
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,280
She may come back to meet you.

541
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,310
Go and check her information.

542
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,430
OK.

543
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,160
Shopkeeper Liu.

544
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,680
Um.

545
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,040
Shopkeeper Liu,

546
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,880
It's inconvenient for me to talk to you at the gate of the imperial palace,

547
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,110
so I call you here.

548
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,350
Your Excellency Ning, what's the matter?

549
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,350
Is Jiuling missing?

550
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,880
How do you know it?

551
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,310
When I left the imperial palace,

552
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,680
I saw Chen Qi waiting anxiously.

553
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,160
After going back, I couldn't rest assured,

554
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,760
so I asked my servant to inquire at the gate of the imperial palace.

555
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,400
Seeing you're still waiting there,

556
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,640
I know there must be something wrong.

557
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,190
Your Excellency Ning,

558
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,040
to be honest,

559
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,640
Miss Jun is indeed missing.

560
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,520
I'm put in a quandary now.

561
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,430
Can you 

562
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,070
find a chance to go to the imperial palace

563
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,640
and help us inquire about her information?

564
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,590
No need.

565
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,640
I know where she is.

566
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,110
It must be related

567
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,160
to Lu Yunqi.

568
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,280
His Excellency Lu?

569
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,710
What shall we do?

570
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,920
His Grace isn't in the capital city,

571
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,280
so no one can go to save her.

572
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,310
Well…

573
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,070
Shopkeeper Liu,

574
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,680
relax.

575
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,160
I'll ask him about her tomorrow.

576
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,280
Let's talk about it after that.

577
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,400
Thank you, Your Excellency Ning.

578
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm sorry

579
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,880
for my previous poor attitude to you.

580
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,040
Shopkeeper Liu,

581
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,800
forget it.

582
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,590
It's just a play

583
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,560
agreed by Jiuling and me.

584
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,350
Without doubt,

585
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,710
I still need to keep away from her

586
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,000
before others.

587
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,350
If there is any news about her,

588
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,710
I'll ask my servant to tell you.

589
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,040
Ok.

590
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,800
I'll go back and wait for your news.

591
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,680
Shopkeeper Liu, see you.

592
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,590
Wanton.

593
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,640
Your Majesty, please calm down.

594
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,070
I believed him firmly

595
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,070
and rewarded him generously.

596
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,760
Did I treat him badly?

597
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,000
How could he betray me?

598
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,400
Your Majesty,

599
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,230
Zhu Shan has long planned to revolt.

600
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,310
Please don't

601
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,520
show mercy to him.

602
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,920
Please order

603
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,760
to capture him at once

604
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,310
and kill him on the spot.

605
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,280
Agreed.

606
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,280
Did you take her away?

607
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,190
Minister Lu,

608
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,310
it's improper.

609
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,920
Lord Cheng disobeyed His Majesty's decree and escaped,

610
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,430
confirming his treason.

611
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,950
She disappeared

612
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,070
all of a sudden.

613
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,470
In your opinion, what does His Majesty think?

614
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,160
Is this a threat?

615
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,640
No.

616
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Listen up.

617
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,110
Don't meddle

618
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,710
in our matter.

619
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,310
Minister Lu,

620
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,950
I know you don't hurt her.

621
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,760
Now that you love her,

622
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,920
why not

623
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
let her be happy?

624
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,590
It's just

625
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,800
your idea.

626
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,110
This is a note

627
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,160
Mr. Ning asked his servant to send to us.

628
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,400
Lu Yunqi did hide Miss Jun.

629
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,800
I'll go to save her

630
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,680
in Arm Moral Department.

631
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,950
Chen Qi,

632
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,640
calm down.

633
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,520
There's no use in going now.

634
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,680
Be cool.

635
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,590
Then what shall we do?

636
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,800
We can make public Miss Jun's news

637
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,590
and pressurize him by the public opinion.

638
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,160
It was feasible before,

639
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,280
but we can't use it now.

640
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,640
Lord Cheng's treason

641
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,560
is confirmed,

642
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,560
which 

643
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,000
will be made public soon.

644
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,230
Consequently,

645
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,880
Lord Cheng will be slandered by people.

646
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,280
Miss Jun

647
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,000
is closely related to their family.

648
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,230
I'm afraid some ill-intentioned people

649
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,760
may make an issue of

650
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,070
her disappearance.

651
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,640
By then,

652
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,590
it's harder to save her.

653
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,000
All

654
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,800
can't work.

655
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,110
What shall we do now?

656
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,640
We can just wait.

657
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,920
Luckily,

658
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,760
Miss Jun is fallen into the hand of Lu Yunqi

659
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,950
rather than His Majesty.

660
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,280
Well,

661
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,400
is there any difference?

662
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,040
His Excellency Lu works for His Majesty.

663
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,760
He has a deep obsession with Jiuling,

664
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,110
so he doesn't

665
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,470
hurt her,

666
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,640
but the demon may kill her.

667
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,400
Dr. Jun.

668
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,880
Is Dr. Jun here?

669
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,590
No.

670
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,000
Didn't she just come back?

671
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,880
My master asked me to invite her,

672
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,350
but why isn't she here?

673
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,430
She has something to deal with in Zezhou,

674
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,520
so she hasn't come back.

675
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,350
When can she come back?

676
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,350
I don't know.

677
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,640
How about

678
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,110
you go to another drugstore?

679
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,040
Terribly sorry.

680
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,880
Okay.

681
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,160
I can't

682
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,680
keep lying to them.

683
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,470
How is Jinxiu in Zezhou?

684
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,680
Your Lordship.

685
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,590
Liu'er.

686
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,040
Your Lordship.

687
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,640
Don't shout.

688
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,190
Chen Qi.

689
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,350
I'm looking for Her Lordship.

690
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,110
Why are you so anxious?

691
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,470
Go to the back yard with me.

692
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,430
I'll tell you slowly.

693
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,830
Go.

694
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,680
Have a look.

695
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,520
Minister Lu.

696
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,040
Minister Lu.

697
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,070
Will you go home

698
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,160
or go to Arm Moral Department?

699
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,590
Minister Lu.

700
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,190
Guess what

701
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,830
they're thinking.

702
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,880
They're probably thinking that

703
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,400
I'm quite bold.

704
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,560
Minister Lu,

705
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,760
can I see her?

706
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,150
Jiuling,

707
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,800
sorry.

708
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,870
I come late.

709
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,430
You must be hungry.

710
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,910
I remember

711
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,800
you liked

712
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,120
the food of Cao's Restaurant.

713
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,710
You said their food is tasty last time,

714
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,190
so I specially bought you some.

715
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,280
Have a taste.

716
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,470
Let me out.

717
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,280
They open late

718
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,280
in the morning.

719
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,630
I'm afraid

720
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,910
they couldn't make tasty food

721
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,280
if I urged them,

722
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,230
so I waited

723
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,320
for a long time.

724
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,520
Are you hungry?

725
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,670
Come on.

726
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,080
Have a bite.

727
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,870
It's tasty.

728
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,230
I know 

729
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,150
you want to know the information of Lord Cheng.

730
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,470
He has been convicted of treason by His Majesty.

731
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,910
He'll be sentenced to death

732
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,520
when taken back to the capital city.

733
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,910
Treason?

734
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,800
It's impossible.

735
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,670
Nothing is impossible.

736
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,120
After he dies,

737
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,560
this won't be important.

738
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,320
Lord Cheng can no longer

739
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,280
monopolize the North.

740
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,470
It's His Majesty

741
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,080
who controls the whole state.

742
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,150
The North doesn't belong to him

743
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,150
but the people in the state.

744
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,150
That's not important.

745
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,710
Their competition

746
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,320
has nothing to do with us.

747
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,040
Have a bite,

748
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,080
or it'll get cold

749
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,910
and taste bad.

750
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,760
Let me out.

751
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,560
Have a bite.

752
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,630
Have a bite and then we can talk about it.

753
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,870
Jiuling,

754
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,150
I'm your husband.

755
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,190
Just call me Yunqi.

756
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,390
You can't win my heart.

757
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,870
You make me sick.

758
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,870
It doesn't matter.

759
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,870
Anyhow,

760
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,870
I'm your family, right?

761
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,120
I can protect you.

762
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,520
I'll secure you in the future.

763
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,600
Go out.

764
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,840
You become thin.

765
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,280
Eat some.

766
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,910
Have a shrimp,

767
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:46,760
okay?

768
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Go out, okay?

769
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,000
Calm down.

770
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,760
By the way,

771
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,560
to protect you,

772
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,150
people of Jiuling Drugstore 

773
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,040
tell others you're in Zezhou.

774
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,320
Today,

775
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,000
Ning Yunzhao

776
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,950
asked me

777
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
whether he could come to see you.

778
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,520
How funny.

779
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,630
I know

780
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,520
he likes you.

781
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,280
And he

782
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,280
likes

783
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,630
both your appearance

784
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,280
and your soul.

785
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,320
As expected,

786
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,630
he, a scholar,

787
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,630
is more insightful than me.

788
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,430
Get out.

789
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,360
You can't find his whereabouts.

790
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,840
Does he demonically vanish?

791
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,150
Your Majesty,

792
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,320
being a minister for several decades,

793
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,840
Lord Cheng has had many friends.

794
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,120
Many people

795
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,800
have covered him

796
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,670
all the way,

797
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,120
so he can escape smoothly.

798
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,320
Go check

799
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,470
who helped him in private.

800
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,630
Your Majesty, don't worry.

801
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,430
Minister Lu

802
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,470
will capture him

803
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,870
sooner or later.

804
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,360
Your Majesty,

805
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,710
our men found his whereabouts

806
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,230
nearby Malüe Pass the last time.

807
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,320
He should head for Baozhou.

808
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,520
The North?

809
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,000
How dare he go to the North?

810
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,320
Will he go to bite the hook?

811
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,080
Your Majesty,

812
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,040
I'll go and inform His Grace Earl of Qinghe.

813
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,320
Minister Huang,

814
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,320
you can leave.

815
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,950
Yes.

816
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,080
Have you

817
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,670
completed the task?

818
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,630
Because of the division of Deshengchang,

819
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,670
Jun Jiuling

820
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,120
has returned to Zezhou.

821
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,080
I 

822
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,430
have ordered Jin Shiba to go there.

823
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,000
The Fang family failed,

824
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,000
and the Zhu family lost their power.

825
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,470
This is a great chance.

826
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,190
You can't miss it.

827
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,470
I got it.

828
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,880
