00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 22

17
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:47,460
Danfengmen

18
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,150
Ning Mansion

19
00:38:26,430 --> 00:02:09,190
Jiuling Drugstore

20
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,550
Since you all help Zhu Zan,

21
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,520
you'll be executed to death

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,160
due to disobedience to the imperial decree.

23
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,320
Stop.

24
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,550
Your Excellency Lu,

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,910
now that you come to inquire about him,

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,000
you must know that

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,080
he's not here.

28
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,390
You guard here by order of His Majesty.

29
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,030
Now he is missing,

30
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,520
so you should also be to blame for it.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,270
Should I praise you

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,750
for your eloquence

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,720
or blame you

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,440
for the neglect of work?

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,670
Dr. Jun works hard and has made a great contribution.

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,960
What crime did she commit?

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,800
Your Lordship.

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,880
Yunqi,

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,030
do you know them?

40
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,550
You bring them here.

41
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,240
I took them out of the dead cell

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,190
by order 

43
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,910
of His Majesty.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,720
Yunqi,

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,960
I have two imperial decrees now.

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,520
You can do nothing to me.

47
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,830
Come on.

48
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,600
Your Lordship,

49
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,800
they're…

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,830
They're kids who can try the smallpox viruses.

51
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,830
What?

52
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,000
They try the smallpox viruses?

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,440
They're the descendants of Grand Guardian Zhou.

54
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,800
But…

55
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,800
If they're sent back,

56
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,470
they can only be beheaded in autumn.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,550
I asked His Majesty,

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,470
and His Majesty promised to

59
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,080
pardon them

60
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,800
if they survive from the smallpox viruses test.

61
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,110
Come on.

62
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,550
Tell them

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,630
what your names are.

64
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm Zhou Jing,

65
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,240
from Zhending.

66
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,360
My grandfather is

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Zhou Bentang.

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,470
Zhou,

69
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,240
Zhou Bentang?

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,000
The one who collaborated

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,630
with the enemy and rebelled?

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,800
Collaboration is a great crime,

73
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,350
but kids

74
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,920
are innocent.

75
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,720
But my grandfather neither cooperated with the enemy

76
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,160
nor rebelled.

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,230
He didn't. He didn't.

78
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,920
He didn't.

79
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,200
He was framed.

80
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,040
But I can 

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
only save them.

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,350
Boy,

83
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,390
it's very dangerous to try smallpox viruses.

84
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,670
You…

85
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,070
Sister,

86
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,480
just let us try.

87
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,480
Maomao,

88
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,350
say something.

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,760
Sister,

90
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,110
let me try.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,640
Dr. Jun,

92
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,200
they're so sensible.

93
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,600
Please

94
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,480
let them survive.

95
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,760
Yeah.

96
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,480
Thank you for your trust.

97
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,510
I assure you that

98
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,720
other doctors and I

99
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,000
will try our best to protect you

100
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,880
to live up to the efforts made by His Lordship 

101
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
who took you out of the dead cell.

102
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,640
Doctors,

103
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,640
I believe in your ability.

104
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,350
Please try your best.

105
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,440
It's our duty.

106
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,320
It's our duty.

107
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,200
Your Excellency,

108
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,670
won't we really interfere in it?

109
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,510
They're the descendants of Zhou Bentang.

110
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,000
Your Excellency,

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
do we still need

113
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,440
the oil wood for ignition?

114
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,270
No.

115
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,390
Why are you here?

116
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
You haven't slept for some days.

117
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm afraid you'll hurt your nerves.

118
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
You care about me so much?

119
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,480
When I 

120
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,040
suffered from unbearable pains on that night,

121
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,440
you accompanied me all night.

122
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,790
And Chen Qi said that

123
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,760
to take care of me, you had no time to sleep for some days.

124
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,270
Taste it.

125
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,950
I cooked it.

126
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,070
You risked your life trying the smallpox viruses.

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,720
How could I sleep?

128
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,830
This long battle finally ends.

129
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,200
We can have a good rest.

130
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,760
We're so tired.

131
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,230
Right?

132
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,200
Taste it. Taste it.

133
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,640
How does it taste?

134
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,350
This is

135
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,320
the worst ginseng soup

136
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,230
I've ever had in my life.

137
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,790
Don't drink it.

138
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,480
It doesn't matter.

139
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
You'll have more chances

140
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,480
to taste it in the future.

141
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,040
Zhu Zan,

142
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,320
thank you.

143
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,320
Jun,

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,080
don't lose your heart

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,200
to me.

146
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,550
Dr. Jun,

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,910
thank you for saving us.

148
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,670
You're welcome.

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,590
Get up please.

150
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,840
Dr. Jun

151
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,350
and other doctors

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,030
are benevolent

153
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,350
and have excellent medical skills.

154
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,880
You're really highly skilled doctors in the world.

155
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,840
Yeah.

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,760
You're highly skilled doctors.

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,790
Thank you, Miss Jun.

158
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,080
Guo'er,

159
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,960
your filial piety touched God,

160
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,910
so you and your mom

161
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,440
could get better so quickly.

162
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,030
In the future,

163
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,710
be the strongest girl,

164
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,640
OK?

165
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,000
Dr. Jun came up with the cure for smallpox.

166
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,960
His Lordship tried the smallpox viruses personally.

167
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,030
And the doctors

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,350
racked their brains.

169
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,350
They've made great contributions.

170
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,960
Let's kowtow to the doctors

171
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,030
to thank them.

172
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,400
-Thank you, Dr. Jun. -Please get up.

173
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Get up.

174
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,230
Get up, please.

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,640
Get up.

176
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,320
You saved my life.

177
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,280
Thank you for saving me,

178
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,350
Your Lordship.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,960
What I did

180
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,440
is negligible.

181
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,350
These doctors behind me

182
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,790
are the saviors.

183
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,230
In the future,

184
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,320
you should learn from them,

185
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,150
understand?

186
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,670
Everyone,

187
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,670
your current health

188
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,880
is the best reward for us.

189
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
I once said that

190
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,790
I would restore you.

191
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,000
So it's the greatest consolation 

192
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,320
to us that you won't be tortured

193
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,910
by smallpox anymore.

194
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,960
Dr. Jun,

195
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,110
without you,

196
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I could not meet

197
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
my families again.

198
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,590
I can't repay you

199
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,590
for your great grace.

200
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,320
Yeah.

201
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,910
You're welcome.

202
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
If you must thank someone,

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,400
you should thank yourselves.

204
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,790
Because your trust

205
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,670
and persistence

206
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,350
made us cure the smallpox.

207
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,110
You're

208
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,030
the real greatest meritorious men.

209
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,230
Yeah.

210
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,520
Your Lordship

211
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,710
risked your life trying the smallpox viruses,

212
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,710
and the two generations of the Lord's Mansion are loyal.

213
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,030
You 

214
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,880
convince me.

215
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,880
You all have recovered,

216
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,400
and your families

217
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,280
are waiting for you.

218
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,110
Go back home.

219
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,840
Thank you, brother. Thank you, Dr. Jun.

220
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,230
Thank you, Dr. Jun.

221
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,320
Go. Go back home.

222
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,880
Go back home.

223
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,670
Go back early.

224
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,590
Go back home.

225
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,590
Go back home.

226
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,710
Thank you, doctors.

227
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,790
See you.

228
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,110
Take care, doctors.

229
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,670
Let's go.

230
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,710
Jun.

231
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,710
Thank you.

232
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,440
Thank you for your efforts.

233
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,910
Thank you.

234
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,080
Thank you for your efforts.

235
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,400
The majority have entered the city,

236
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,230
and Young Master Fang has made full preparations.

237
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,280
They said that they would be back today.

238
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,760
But Her Ladyship hasn't come back yet.

239
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,080
Where are they?

240
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,230
Chen Qi hasn't come back, either.

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,790
When I see him,

242
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,150
he'll suffer.

243
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,470
I kept overlooking

244
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,550
on the gate tower

245
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,150
and fixed my eyes on the distance,

246
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,910
but I didn't see Her Ladyship.

247
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,760
Other doctors were warmly welcomed by people,

248
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,790
but where is the most meritorious one?

249
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,080
Where is Her Ladyship?

250
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,910
What should I do?

251
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,030
What were you talking about?

252
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,440
You're back.

253
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,280
-Your Ladyship. -Jiuling.

254
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,840
Your Ladyship.

255
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
When did you come back, Your Ladyship?

256
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,760
Why didn't you come back with them?

257
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,200
Why didn't you tell us early?

258
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,320
We could go to meet you.

259
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,550
You asked me so many questions.

260
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,670
Which one should I answer?

261
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,230
I'm just worried about you

262
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,640
and miss you so much.

263
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,080
Don't worry.

264
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,760
You can be relieved.

265
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
I'm back.

266
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,910
Shopkeeper Liu.

267
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,200
Your Ladyship.

268
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,590
Just now His Ladyship Fang said that

269
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,710
when she sees Chen Qi,

270
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,710
he will…

271
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,080
Suffer!

272
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

273
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,200
I 

274
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,080
won't make you worried again.

275
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,520
Why didn't you tell us before you came back?

276
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,030
We were all worried.

277
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,400
Miss Jun knew that

278
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,910
Young Master Fang would spread her merit today

279
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,440
and many people would go to welcome us

280
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,320
when we entered the city.

281
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,910
She doesn't like fuss,

282
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,110
so we decided to

283
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,150
come back by ourselves.

284
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,590
But 

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
I wasted Chengyu's kindness.

286
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,840
No.

287
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,550
Whatever you do is right.

288
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
Young Master Fang won't blame you.

289
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,520
In fact, there is no need to spread it.

290
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,710
Jiuling cured the smallpox successfully.

291
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,470
So our Jiuling Drugstore

292
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,230
will naturally be well-known.

293
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,320
Damn!

294
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,080
The Jiuling Drugstore

295
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,440
pushes itself again.

296
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,880
There was only one day left

297
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,760
before the deadline,

298
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,230
but they succeeded.

299
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,670
Now 

300
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,960
even people from Runan

301
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,000
and Zezhou

302
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,320
take their children

303
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,960
to ask the Jiuling Drugstore to vaccinate them.

304
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,590
The vaccination

305
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,670
is important

306
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,790
and involves the people all over the country.

307
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,280
How can she be

308
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,790
in charge of it alone?

309
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,520
So I'll ask His Majesty

310
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,080
to allow our Imperial Academy of Medicine to take it over.

311
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,880
Yeah.

312
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,400
With time going,

313
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,710
others will think that

314
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,710
it's our Imperial Academy of Medicine that

315
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,030
takes charge of it.

316
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,110
But Jun Jiuling is hard to deal with.

317
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,280
Will she teach us

318
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,350
the cure for smallpox?

319
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,110
His majesty will summon her

320
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,350
for the vaccination in a few days.

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
As an ordinary woman,

322
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,200
she will definitely be scared when seeing His Majesty.

323
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,400
By then

324
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,320
I'll propose it in the court.

325
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,880
I think

326
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,280
she will have no courage

327
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,840
to refuse in front of His Majesty.

328
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,110
Yeah.

329
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,670
Your Ladyship,

330
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,910
you get thin.

331
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,080
The dessert you like.

332
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,030
Have one.

333
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,520
I'm all right.

334
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,400
But Chen Qi

335
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,400
was tired.

336
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
Without his help,

337
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,440
I would have been very busy.

338
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,230
I didn't help a lot.

339
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,320
Young Master Fang is so smart.

340
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,440
He spread the merit of Her Ladyship

341
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,520
in Runan and Zezhou in advance.

342
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,790
He trusts you

343
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,790
very much,

344
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,000
so he did so.

345
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,350
Since I left the Fang's mansion,

346
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,350
I indeed made many troubles

347
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,350
for grandma and aunt.

348
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,640
I can understand it.

349
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,910
So 

350
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,280
do others.

351
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,640
What he did is risky.

352
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,670
If someone accuses

353
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,280
the Fang family of befogging the minds of the people

354
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,960
by this matter,

355
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,030
it'll be a great crime.

356
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,790
Yeah.

357
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,670
I must write to him.

358
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,470
Your Ladyship,

359
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,000
if you don't need my help,

360
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,030
I'm going back to make preparations

361
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,760
for entering the imperial palace tomorrow.

362
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,710
Thank you, Shopkeeper Liu.

363
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,200
Your Ladyship,

364
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,960
don't worry.

365
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,670
It won't cause any trouble.

366
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,880
You still need to enter the imperial palace tomorrow.

367
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,520
After entering the imperial palace,

368
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,150
I can see Chu Rang again.

369
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,150
Riding a horse under the moon is joyous.

370
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,840
Why are you worried?

371
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,590
You're still worried about entering the imperial palace?

372
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,800
Jun,

373
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,799
why do you

374
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,880
enter the imperial palace?

375
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,920
Sometimes I feel

376
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,040
I've known you for a long time

377
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
and I'm very familiar with you.

378
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,110
But when I almost see you through,

379
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,040
I feel you have

380
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,040
a lot of secrets

381
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,160
and become a vexatious enigma.

382
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,760
I returned to the capital city to revenge.

383
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
For Princess Jiuling

384
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,230
and my father.

385
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,110
You finally open your mind to me.

386
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,520
I know you have many secrets.

387
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,230
It doesn't matter.

388
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,950
From now on,

389
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,310
if you don't want to tell me,

390
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,160
I won't ask you.

391
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,680
But I'll definitely accompany you

392
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,230
to do what you want to do.

393
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,480
♫Outline in my dream♫

394
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,920

395
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,120

♫Let me weigh every word♫

398
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,920

♫Rare to meet you again, tears well up in my eyes♫

414
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,880
Sedum.

415
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,160
Rain can't

416
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,560
make their light go out.

417
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,310
Wind makes

418
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,590
their color brighter.

419
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,880
The fireflies

420
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,280
flying in the sky,

421
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,710
are like stars beside the moon.

422
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,830
Sedum is really a good herb.

423
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,680
On such a nice night,

424
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,350
you only see the herds?

425
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,070
Yeah.

426
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,470
Sedum can remove heat from the liver and improve vision.

427
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,110
It's indeed a good herb.

428
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,040
You're really not an ordinary woman.

429
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,950
So what is an ordinary woman like?

430
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,400
How beautiful fireflies!

431
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,880
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

432
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,590
It's disgusting.

433
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,280
I can't bear it.

434
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,350
Miss Jun,

435
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,000
nobody 

436
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,230
can surpass you in vaccination in this world.

437
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,400
Why do you

438
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,110
ask me to enter the imperial palace with you?

439
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,470
Because I need your favor in something.

440
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,920
Dr. Feng,

441
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,560
take it easy.

442
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,350
Don't be nervous.

443
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,920
Dr. Jun,

444
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,760
entering the imperial palace is an event.

445
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,470
Why aren't you nervous at all?

446
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,110
You seem to come back your home.

447
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,520
Dr. Jun,

448
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,160
please.

449
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,430
Let's go.

450
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,310
OK.

451
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,760
Here is my respect,

452
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,520
Your Majesty.

453
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,800
Get up.

454
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

455
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,590
You cured the smallpox in Qingshan Court,

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,680
which is equivalent

457
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,310
to the great victory in a war.

458
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,350
It's the luck of our country.

459
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,880
You made a great contribution,

460
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,110
so I'll reward you.

461
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,710
I can't claim credit for myself.

462
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,280
The success of curing the smallpox

463
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,190
depended on the favorable, geographical and human conditions.

464
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,520
First,

465
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,040
Your Majesty's self-discipline and social commitment

466
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,000
touched God.

467
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,190
This is the favorable condition.

468
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
It was convenient to treat patients by area

469
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,590
in the spacious Qingshan Court.

470
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,880
This is the geographical condition.

471
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,710
Meanwhile,

472
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,280
many doctors and His Lordship

473
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,800
who was willing to try the smallpox viruses helped me.

474
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,430
This is the human condition.

475
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,040
You're modest.

476
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,070
You invented

477
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,680
the cure for smallpox,

478
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
so you rendered the greatest merit.

479
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,230
Your Majesty.

480
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,640
I want to 

481
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,800
consult Dr. Jun about something.

482
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,040
These rats

483
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,000
want to profit at her expense.

484
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,880
Well,

485
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,230
just see how she will deal with it.

486
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,040
Go ahead.

487
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,160
Your Majesty,

488
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,640
the cure for smallpox

489
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,560
is the luck of our court.

490
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,350
But 

491
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,430
there are few doctors who can vaccinate,

492
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,640
and most of them gather in the capital city.

493
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,830
So we should carefully think

494
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,190
how to popularize it in various regions.

495
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,880
Do you have any suggestions?

496
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,310
In my opinion,

497
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,590
our Imperial Academy of Medicine can be in charge of it,

498
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,950
and local clinics

499
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,800
can send doctors

500
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,590
to the capital city to learn the cure for smallpox.

501
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,920
Dr. Jun checks their learning effect,

502
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,070
and those qualified ones will go back to popularize the cure for smallpox in different areas

503
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,920
to prevent the people of our dynasty

504
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,110
from being infected with smallpox.

505
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,430
Yeah.

506
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,070
Your Majesty,

507
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,350
I agree

508
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,590
with Imperial Doctor Jiang.

509
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,830
What do you think about it, Dr. Jun?

510
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,070
Your Majesty,

511
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,160
I disagree.

512
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,710
Miss Jun must see His Majesty now.

513
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,560
She cured smallpox.

514
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,110
Doctors Imperial Academy of Medicine

515
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,070
don't dare to make difficulties for her.

516
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,190
Given her eloquence,

517
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,160
she won't be stumped.

518
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,830
She is

519
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,920
flexible.

520
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
In this meeting,

521
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,000
those imperial doctors

522
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,710
may rob her of her cure for smallpox.

523
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,230
If so,

524
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,830
will Miss Jun agree

525
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,110
or disagree to it?

526
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,950
Yes.

527
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,590
No.

528
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,190
The Jiuling Drugstore is a common drugstore,

529
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,190
but the Imperial Academy of Medicine was set up by the court,

530
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,760
so His Majesty must

531
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,110
want the cure for smallpox

532
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,710
to belong to the court.

533
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,070
Jun is weak,

534
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,400
so it'll be hard for her to refuse.

535
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,190
But 

536
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
if she agrees,

537
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,560
that goes against her style.

538
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,640
Dr. Jun,

539
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,470
don't you want to

540
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,430
make the cure public?

541
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,430
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

542
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,640
it's doctors' pleasure to treat the patients all over the world,

543
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,040
so I certainly would like 

544
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,430
to make it public

545
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,400
and want all the doctors

546
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,430
to learn it.

547
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,920
But 

548
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,230
I don't want them to learn it via the Imperial Academy of Medicine

549
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,680
but doctors who worked in Qingshan Court.

550
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,110
You don't trust

551
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,470
doctors of the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

552
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,680
You misunderstand me.

553
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,280
Vaccination

554
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,710
requires practice

555
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,640
and can't be taught orally.

556
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,040
But 

557
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,920
now smallpox was eradicated in the capital city.

558
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,830
Unless there's another smallpox outbreak

559
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,230
in which the doctors of the Imperial Academy of Medicine

560
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,800
popularize the cure,

561
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,830
after learning it.

562
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,310
But…

563
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,920
How can it be?

564
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,430
This…

565
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,560
How can she do so?

566
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,160
Ingrate.

567
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,470
Your Majesty,

568
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,040
that's why I

569
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,830
disagreed with Imperial Doctor Jiang.

570
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,190
She doesn't panic in the court at all.

571
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,880
She can't be underestimated.

572
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,350
What do you think we should do?

573
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,430
Your Majesty,

574
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,070
Dr. Feng is a famous doctor

575
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,710
who has run a clinic for decades in the capital city.

576
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,830
Widely praised,

577
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,110
and 

578
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,430
he has made great contributions 

579
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,920
to the success of curing smallpox.

580
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,310
So I recommend

581
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,800
Dr. Feng to be in charge

582
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,350
of the assessment and popularization of the cure for smallpox.

583
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,280
Local governments

584
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,880
can send their doctors to learn it,

585
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
and Dr. Feng will lead doctors

586
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,470
who know the cure

587
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,520
to teach them.

588
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,830
You invent

589
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,070
the cure for smallpox,

590
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,710
so it's better for you

591
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,350
to be in charge of it.

592
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,520
Your Majesty, 

593
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,430
first, I'm too young

594
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,350
to convince the public.

595
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,190
Second,

596
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,710
Dr. Feng has more experience

597
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,590
in vaccination than I do.

598
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,590
A young woman

599
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,400
also knows how to avoid the spotlight?

600
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,070
OK.

601
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,760
But you must

602
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,560
supervise them.

603
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,800
OK.

604
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,560
Thank Your Majesty for great grace.

605
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,350
Get up.

606
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,680
This is not my reward to you.

607
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:27,880
You should

608
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,400
thank her.

609
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,950
Dr. Jun

610
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,000
is really amazing.

611
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,640
At such a young age,

612
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
you don't claim credit for yourself and become arrogant.

613
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,950
You're really awesome.

614
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,470
Chu Rang is suspicious.

615
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,470
If I don't ask for anything,

616
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,190
he must doubt my intention.

617
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,350
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

618
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,190
Actually,

619
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,350
I do have a small request.

620
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,190
Please promise me.

621
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,230
What's your request?

622
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,190
I'll promise you.

623
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,520
I don't want money,

624
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,280
but if 

625
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,640
Your Majesty can confer a title on me,

626
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,070
it can be regarded as a consolation to my ancestors' perseverance

627
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,160
in practicing medicine.

628
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,040
How dare you!

629
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,160
As a doctor,

630
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,800
how can you ask for a title?

631
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,280
His Majesty is benevolent.

632
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,310
Even if you cure the smallpox,

633
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,950
how can you

634
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,520
make requests unscrupulously?

635
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,040
It's my fault.

636
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Please punish me.

637
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,400
Minister Huang, don't be angry.

638
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,880
I think

639
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,190
Dr. Jun's request

640
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,040
is reasonable.

641
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,710
I 

642
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,590
promote you to the County Princess,

643
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,070
with the title

644
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,560
of Shanyang.

645
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,640
I, Jun Jiuling

646
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,640
thank Your Majesty for great grace.

647
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,470
Dr. Jun,

648
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,520
you're not a common woman now.

649
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,590
I,

650
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,760
County Princess Shanyang,

651
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,520
thank Your Majesty for great grace.

652
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,920
Your Majesty,

653
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,920
Their Highnesses

654
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,280
are waiting for Dr. Jun to vaccinate them.

655
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,920
Go.

656
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,310
Dr. Jun,

657
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,040
they're coming.

658
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,950
Jun.

659
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,640
Dr. Feng,

660
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,160
I'll go to see you

661
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,190
for the vaccination tomorrow.

662
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,800
OK.

663
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,950
Then I'm leaving.

664
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,760
Take care.

665
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,760
Sister, I miss you.

666
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,560
I also miss you.

667
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,520
Why do you

668
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,800
come to see me today?

669
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,640
Get up.

670
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,000
What's up?

671
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,830
Sister,

672
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,590
we'll leave.

673
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,040
Don't worry.

674
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,680
I've found a place for them.

675
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,640
Well,

676
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,400
Zhou Jing, Maomao,

677
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,470
remember to

678
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,560
take good care of yourselves

679
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,880
in the future

680
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,470
even if I'm not at your side.

681
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,160
Understand?

682
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,560
Yes.

683
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,560
Yes.

684
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,680
I'll always remember

685
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,560
your bravery and goodness

686
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,760
in Qingshan Court.

687
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,560
You must keep them in the future.

688
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,800
Miss Jun,

689
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,590
if you really like them,

690
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,310
just acknowledge them as your sons.

691
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,830
Can I call you adopted mother?

692
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,640
Then you're my adopted father.

693
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,230
You're my adopted mother.

694
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,950
-Adopted father. -Adopted mother.

695
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,880
Don't talk nonsense.

696
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,160
It's late.

697
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,110
They should leave.

698
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,400
Come on.

699
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,830
Say goodbye to your adopted parents.

700
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,350
Adopted father,

701
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,310
adopted mother,

702
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,560
take care.

703
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,110
We're leaving.

704
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,760
I wish you a safe journey.

705
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,430
Am I so old?

706
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,880
He called me adopted father.

707
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,520
What's wrong with you?

708
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,040
I'm fine.

709
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,800
I just suddenly

710
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,560
want to cry.

711
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,680
What do you want to say to me?

712
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,800
No.

713
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,310
Jun Jiuling

714
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,430
is different from how others think about her.

715
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,230
Given your understanding of her,

716
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,400
is her behavior

717
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,430
in the court false

718
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,560
or true?

719
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,920
I think

720
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,190
it's false.

721
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,070
In Qingshan Court,

722
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,350
I had

723
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,760
few contacts with her,

724
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,000
but

725
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,430
I know

726
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,000
she is more impolite

727
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,759
at ordinary times.

728
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,280
Her behavior obviously shows that

729
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,470
she longs for power and influence.

730
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,950
What do you think about it?

731
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,629
In the court,

732
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,190
she still dared to make such a request,

733
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,040
so it should be  true.

734
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,799
Have all the princes been vaccinated?

735
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,000
Your Majesty,

736
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,710
Their Highnesses

737
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,280
all have been vaccinated

738
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,390
except for the Third Prince.

739
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,709
His Highness

740
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,229
has had a cough recently.

741
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:49,759
Dr. Jun said

742
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,120
only those who are in good health can be vaccinated.

743
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,230
So 

744
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,600
His Highness can't be vaccinated

745
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,190
until he gets better.

746
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,120
Doctors from different prefectures

747
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,360
almost have acquired the cure,

748
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,190
except Dr. Liu's learners.

749
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,470
Two of his vaccinators

750
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,430
are not proficient,

751
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,190
but they can also go back after going on practicing

752
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,190
for 1 or 2 days.

753
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,280
It seems that everything goes well.

754
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,320
Yeah.

755
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,000
The list is posted!

756
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,560
What are they looking at?

757
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,280
It's bustling there.

758
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,710
Today is

759
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,600
March 18.

760
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,150
The Imperial Academy posted the list.

761
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,390
It's my name.

762
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,760
The exam of the Ministry of Rites is over?

763
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
-Yes. -I'm curious about Childe Ning's place

764
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,040
in the exam.

765
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,120
Your Ladyship, let's go to have a look.

766
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,840
Then,

767
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,560
I'm going to see Dr. Liu.

768
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,710
Thank you, Dr. Feng.

769
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,230
OK.

770
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,710
Let's go.

771
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,670
Look. Is this my name?

772
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,560
Excuse me.

773
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:39,950
Excuse me. Excuse me.

774
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,630
Look. Look.

775
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,600
-Excuse me. Excuse me. -My name is there.

776
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,560
My name is on the list.

777
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,150
On the list!

778
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,430
On the list!

779
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Childe Ning's name is on the list!

780
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,190
Great!

781
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,470
You're one of the top three in the exam of the Ministry of Rites,

782
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,800
but it's not the final imperial exam,

783
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,910
so your final ranking is still unknown.

784
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,760
I see.

785
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,080
I don't comment on these articles.

786
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,430
You polish them.

787
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,040
Let's talk about them in detail after I come back.

788
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,280
Yes,

789
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,000
uncle.

790
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,950
Ding,

791
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,560
how is it going in Qingshan Court?

792
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,120
Young Master,

793
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,600
you were busy with the exam,

794
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,870
so His Excellency Ning didn't allow me to tell you.

795
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,950
Her Ladyship Jun

796
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,630
cured the smallpox

797
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,910
and went downhill with others.

798
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,950
She is always able

799
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,080
to save the day.

800
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,080
Did Miss Jun return to the Jiuling Drugstore?

801
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,950
Yes.

802
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,360
Moreover,

803
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,560
His majesty summoned her

804
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,520
and promoted her

805
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,600
to County Princess Shanyang.

806
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:15,950
His Excellency Ning

807
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,710
was also on the spot.

808
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,190
Didn't he

809
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,630
tell you?

810
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,520
Uncle doesn't want me to have contact with her,

811
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,190
so he didn't tell me.

812
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,390
Well,

813
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,910
if madam knows it,

814
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
she won't definitely let me off.

815
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,150
Don't worry.

816
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,630
I won't tell her.

817
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,560
Thank you, Young Master.

818
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,600
Young Master,

819
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,710
here's your gift.

820
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,910
Put it down.

821
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,710
Young Master,

822
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,910
this is Miss Jun's gift for you.

823
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,710
She behaves above board

824
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,230
and sincerely.

825
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,360
She surpasses me.

826
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,000
You have studied hard

827
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,710
for a dozen years.

828
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,430
You standing here

829
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,360
are all pillars,

830
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,230
and Ning Yunzhao is the top of you

831
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,840
with extraordinary talent,

832
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,040
so he is No. 1.

833
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,120
I hope you will make persistent efforts

834
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,000
and make our country prosperous and stable.

835
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,800
Look.

836
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,910
Look there.

837
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,280
Jinxiu,

838
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
can I go out to get some air?

839
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,560
Of course.

840
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,470
Why do you ask me?

841
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,390
Now

842
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,760
Chen Qi

843
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,520
only listens to

844
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,800
Lady Jinxiu.

845
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,870
I don't mean it.

846
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,710
It's because he is unreliable.

847
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,910
But Chen Qi dealt with everything

848
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,520
very well

849
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,190
in Qingshan Court,

850
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,390
and Jinxiu seems to know it.

851
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,230
Yeah.

852
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,470
I don't know.

853
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,390
I'm unfamiliar with him.

854
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,800
I don't know it.

855
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:14,800
Unfamiliar?

856
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,560
Your Ladyship.

857
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,150
Your Ladyship.

858
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,520
His Excellency Lu comes!

859
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,800
Why does he come again?

860
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,470
