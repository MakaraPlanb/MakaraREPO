1
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 26

17
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,740
Jiuling Drugstore

18
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,660
Jiuling Drugstore

19
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,050
Jiuling Drugstore

20
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,540
Fang Mansion

21
00:35:21,320 --> 00:02:09,030
Tomb of Loving Father Jun Yingwen
By Daughter Jun Zhenzhen

22
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,800
Windmills.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Come to have a look.

24
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,470
Windmills.

25
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,110
Pendants and gadgets.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,750
Come to have a look.

27
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,240
I think His Highness Prince Xian visited

28
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,800
Jiuling Drugstore with a hidden intention.

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
You just found it?

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,320
He came in person.

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,630
On one hand,

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,240
it shows that Jiuling has such excellent medical skills that

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,830
even relatives of His Majesty value.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,750
On the other hand,

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,670
if she can make him happy,

36
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,880
perhaps

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,910
she can ask him to see His Lordship.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
It's better than asking Lu Yunqi.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
You can think of it.

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I guess Miss Jun

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,440
already thought of it.

42
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,800
She is so lucky.

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,270
Whenever she meets difficulties,

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,470
she gets help from others.

45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,750
She gets help from herself.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,270
Go.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,080
Let's work.

48
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,960
Come on.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,630
Let me kiss.

50
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Your Highness,

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,360
have a grape.

52
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,550
Yes.

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,240
Well. Come on.

54
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,190
Well. Come on.

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,000
Have another one.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,390
Tasty.

57
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,320
For Twelfth Uncle,

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,110
it's the safest to pretend to be

59
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,800
arrogant and extravagant,

60
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,550
or he will be killed

61
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,160
by Chu Rang

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,190
like my father.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Don't do that.

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,520
Twelfth Uncle

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,550
was studious and ambitious,

66
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,550
but he must pretend to be a loser.

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
Will Jiurong be like that?

68
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,160
Dr. Jun,

69
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,000
have,

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,720
have you finished?

71
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,550
Yes.

72
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,270
Thanks to Your Highness,

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,550
Her Highness is healthy.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,630
I brought some medicine for nourishing and conditioning.

75
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,390
I wrote down the usage.

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,670
You're so careful.

77
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,600
Thank you.

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,190
It's my duty.

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,600
Instead,

80
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,390
I should thank Your Highness.

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,600
Thank me?

82
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,110
Why?

83
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,960
Why?

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,440
You may go.

85
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,270
Go.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,510
Your Highness.

87
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,390
Go. Go.

88
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,040
Just go.

89
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,790
Go ahead.

90
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,550
I guess

91
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,510
son of Lord Cheng asked

92
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,070
you to visit Jiuling Drugstore, right?

93
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,550
Nonsense.

94
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,000
Can anyone

95
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,390
order me?

96
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,950
I sent you over

97
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,350
for being aware of your reputation.

98
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,480
Moreover,

99
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,110
he is in the imperial prison.

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
He couldn't talk to me.

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,920
Whether he asked you or not,

102
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,920
your visit at this point

103
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
meets the will of the public,

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
but not His Majesty.

105
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,000
So I'm grateful to you

106
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,350
for your sincerity

107
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
and help.

108
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,600
Unexpectedly,

109
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,110
honest Zhu Zan

110
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,000
has clever friends.

111
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,070
You can see my intention at once.

112
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,110
OK.

113
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,950
But

114
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,110
I should

115
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,600
help you.

116
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,440
You cured Prince Huai.

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,670
It's a great credit.

118
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,510
I feel grateful to you.

119
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,440
Prince Huai has been weak since childhood.

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,350
Please

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,110
take good care

122
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,270
of him, Dr. Jun.

123
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,040
Besides Zhu Zan,

124
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,790
Twelfth Uncle cares about us.

125
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,230
Thank you for your trust.

126
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,350
But

127
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm afraid that

128
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,200
I can't help you.

129
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
What do you mean?

130
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,640
I'm going to leave the capital city.

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,110
Leave?

132
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,230
You've been through so much before.

133
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,000
As the saying goes,

134
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,950
after extreme bad luck comes good luck.

135
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,670
Now you're

136
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,110
known to everyone.

137
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,270
Everything

138
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,390
will go well.

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,440
Don't fear.

140
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,440
Let alone others,

141
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,040
well,

142
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,480
my whole family

143
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,070
needs your care.

144
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,390
Whoever dares to bully you,

145
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,510
I won't let him go.

146
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,920
Thank you for your comfort.

147
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,110
However,

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,270
I don't fear.

149
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,550
I must go.

150
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,600
I wondered why

151
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,350
you gave me so much medicine.

152
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
I get it now.

153
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,790
You came to say goodbye.

154
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,830
Don't worry.

155
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,350
I'll come back.

156
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,390
But I have one more favor to ask.

157
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,230
Go ahead.

158
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,390
Your Highness,

159
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
please try to save His Lordship.

160
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Well,

161
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,950
it's improper for me to get involved.

162
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,230
If Lu Yunqi helps...

163
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,070
Your visit to Jiuling Drugstore

164
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,070
is showy enough.

165
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,390
If I turn to Lu Yunqi in this case,

166
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
His Majesty will suspect us.

167
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,950
So don't come forward

168
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,230
unless you have to.

169
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,600
I know why

170
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,320
you came to me.

171
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,270
Baotang, Sanbing.

172
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,600
Miss Jun.

173
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,110
Where are you going?

174
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
We go to save Zan.

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,350
Arm Moral Department is torturing him.

176
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,200
What?

177
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,950
Flogging.

178
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
The bastards are torturing him with rod.

179
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,950
I'll kill them.

180
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,000
Can you enter like this?

181
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,040
We must enter there

182
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,110
even by force.

183
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,950
At the worst, fight it out with them.

184
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,720
Wait.

185
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,110
Arm Moral Department is heavily guarded.

186
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,790
You're fighting

187
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,880
a hopeless battle.

188
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,070
He is in the prison.

189
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,440
I must ensure your safety.

190
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,160
Then what should we do?

191
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,720
Zan is being tortured in the prison.

192
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I'll turn to Lu Yunqi.

193
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,270
Are you sure?

194
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,230
Wait for my news.

195
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,270
Let's turn to those of the Sky Pavilion.

196
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,040
Here you are.

197
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,520
You know I'll come, right?

198
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,150
Now that you are here,

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,790
sit down and talk.

200
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,400
He is son of Lord Cheng.

201
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,470
You torture him without hearing.

202
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm afraid you can't explain it.

203
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,200
Do you think I care?

204
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,440
I want to see him.

205
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,200
I'll treat him.

206
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,840
You care him so much that

207
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,440
I'll be angry.

208
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,350
But

209
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,200
it's great as you're here.

210
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,400
So regardless of my intention

211
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,320
and my feelings,

212
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
as long as I'm here

213
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,080
and under your control,

214
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,110
you are satisfied,

215
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,670
right?

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,960
Let me repeat it, Lu Yunqi.

217
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,550
I'm not Princess Jiuling.

218
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,280
You just want someone to replace her.

219
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,710
It has nothing to do with me.

220
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,910
You won't understand.

221
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,910
Do you think

222
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,670
His Majesty will kill His Lordship

223
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,590
due to the death of Huang Cheng's son?

224
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,880
If His Lordship dies,

225
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,710
what will

226
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,670
Lord Cheng do?

227
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,000
What will His Majesty think of you?

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,790
Have you thought about that?

229
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,840
So to save His Lordship

230
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,670
will meet the will of His Majesty,

231
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,520
but not His Excellency Huang's.

232
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,960
If you don't care these,

233
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,670
I'll leave the capital city.

234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,960
It'll be easier for you to do anything to me.

235
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,400
You'll leave the capital city?

236
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,840
Yes.

237
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,440
That's what I want to talk to you about.

238
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,230
If you save His Lordship,

239
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,200
I'll leave the capital city.

240
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,710
Leave immediately.

241
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,760
Take her to the imperial prison.

242
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes, Your Excellency.

243
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,760
It's time to replenish betel nuts again.

244
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,110
It can kill worms, eliminate accumulation, promote qi and relieve diuresis.

245
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,110
It's a kind of quality medicinal material.

246
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,880
Go.

247
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,440
What are you thinking?

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,590
I think

249
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,110
after the trouble caused by Lu Yunqi,

250
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
must we close the drugstore?

251
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,470
Let alone the whole country,

252
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
can he stop so many people

253
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,520
in the capital city

254
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,440
from visiting Jiuling Drugstore?

255
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,590
You're right.

256
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,400
Are you back so soon?

257
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,910
Where is Jiuling?

258
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,520
She went to Arm Moral Drugstore alone.

259
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:12,880
Did,

260
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,080
did His Highness Prince Xian have her sent there?

261
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,670
She went alone after leaving the Mansion of Prince Xian.

262
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,760
She went alone?

263
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,590
Didn't she mention to Highness Prince Xian that

264
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,790
she was going to see His Lordship?

265
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,910
I don't know.

266
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,520
She let me wait at the gate of the Mansion of Prince Xian.

267
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,280
She turns to Lu Yunqi in this case.

268
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,550
Is she out of her mind?

269
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:28,760
By the way,

270
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,320
Her Ladyship asked me to pack.

271
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,440
It seems that she will have a long journey.

272
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,000
Zhu Zan.

273
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,590
Can anyone enter

274
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,840
the imperial prison of Arm Moral Department?

275
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,000
Take her away.

276
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,350
I won't see her.

277
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,470
Lu Yunqi let me treat you.

278
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,470
Well.

279
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,350
Do you fear that we'll escape?

280
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,110
Go.

281
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,960
Why didn't you save Wan Qing?

282
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,550
She is still alive.

283
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,440
She has left the city safely.

284
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,320
Hold on.

285
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,550
Your Excellency,

286
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,350
I can't understand.

287
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,520
Do you really let her go?

288
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,350
Around the country

289
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,710
are men of Arm Moral Department.

290
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,880
As long as she is alive,

291
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,000
she is under my control.

292
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,280
If she leaves the capital city,

293
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,590
it'll be easier for you

294
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,400
to control her.

295
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,710
I know you did that for me.

296
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,910
You feared that I would be criticized

297
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,200
for saving Huang Ziqing.

298
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,760
But you shouldn't have done that.

299
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,230
You shouldn't have been so reckless.

300
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,150
You shouldn't have taken the risk.

301
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,520
Have you thought about

302
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,150
your father and the people in the North?

303
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,110
What if they're involved?

304
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,110
What if anything goes wrong?

305
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,710
I shouted at you,

306
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,550
because I don't want you to get involved.

307
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,590
Huang Cheng will certainly take revenge on those around me.

308
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,000
I saw Lu Yunqi.

309
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,880
I'll leave the capital city after treating you.

310
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,400
You made a deal with him?

311
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,110
I have nothing

312
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,960
to make a deal with him.

313
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,590
If you leave the capital city, he'll save me.

314
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,000
Hold on.

315
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,230
No.

316
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,710
He has complex connections.

317
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,550
No matter where you go,

318
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,400
you can't get rid of him.

319
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,520
And I'm in the prison.

320
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,150
If anything goes wrong with you,

321
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,910
I can't save you.

322
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,910
Don't trust him.

323
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,350
-No. -Stop.

324
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,710
Zhu Zan,

325
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,880
listen to me.

326
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,350
You must stay alive here.

327
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,320
You must be safe.

328
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,110
As long as you're alive here,

329
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,200
we'll find a way to help you out.

330
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,400
Whether it's for me

331
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,000
or your father...

332
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,760
Dr. Jun,

333
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,960
as you have finished treating,

334
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,790
please go.

335
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:50,830
Brother,

336
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,070
it's a nice day.

337
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,310
You really should have a walk in the imperial garden.

338
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,710
I'm not as free as you are.

339
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,350
You're wrong.

340
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,310
I know you're

341
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,110
occupied with state affairs every day.

342
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,830
But that's why

343
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,760
you should relax yourself

344
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,190
in your spare time.

345
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,590
You can read memorials better after that.

346
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,310
What brings you here?

347
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
You won't come to me without a reason.

348
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,110
You're running out

349
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,190
of money, right?

350
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,070
You know me.

351
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm always

352
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,710
running out of money.

353
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,560
But

354
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,190
this time

355
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,350
I didn't come for money alone.

356
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
What's the matter?

357
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,830
You've asked for whatever

358
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,190
you want directly.

359
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,800
What makes you so hesitant?

360
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,350
Well,

361
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,800
I feel

362
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,400
awkward to mention it.

363
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,920
Go ahead.

364
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,950
No matter what it is,

365
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,070
I won't care.

366
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,350
Then I'll say it.

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
Please

368
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,430
spare Zhu Zan's life.

369
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
I didn't expect that

370
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,400
you're

371
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,310
the first one to intercede for him.

372
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,560
He beat you, right?

373
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,310
But you intercede for him.

374
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,590
Isn't that returning

375
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,880
animosity with kindness?

376
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,430
No discord, no concord.

377
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,160
Brother, you know what?

378
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,110
He is

379
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,230
good at recreation.

380
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,520
I really admire him.

381
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,310
Isn't it great

382
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,760
to me to play with

383
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,400
such a person

384
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,070
every day?

385
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,000
Brother,

386
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,680
let him

387
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,110
just suffer

388
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,880
in the prison.

389
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,640
Spare his life,

390
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,710
so he can play with me every day.

391
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,230
I promise,

392
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,350
he won't

393
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,350
disturb you

394
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,230
again,

395
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,110
OK?

396
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,560
Leave it alone.

397
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,640
You don't know

398
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,830
what's at stake.

399
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,830
Brother,

400
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,560
-I... -As to money,

401
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,160
I'll ask Yuan Bao to send you some.

402
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,430
OK.

403
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm busy.

404
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,190
I'm leaving.

405
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,110
Are you trying to escape something?

406
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,160
Lady Jinxiu,

407
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,560
Miss Jun

408
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,430
isn't like that.

409
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,430
I'm sure

410
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,520
she goes back to Zezhou

411
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,590
to do things.

412
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,640
Moreover,

413
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
it has been a long time

414
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,560
since you left Zezhou.

415
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,590
It's time for you to go back.

416
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,400
Young Master and Senior Madame

417
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,560
will be happy.

418
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,680
Is Jiuling Drugstore still open?

419
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,310
It can't go on without you.

420
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,470
Anyway, we have no patients.

421
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,640
We're just selling medicine.

422
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:08,950
It can go on without her.

423
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,310
Yes.

424
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,830
Without me in Jiuling Drugstore,

425
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,230
you can still sell medicine.

426
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,470
But as you leave,

427
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,560
Lady Jinxiu has to work here alone.

428
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,430
I fear that she can't make it.

429
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,350
I can.

430
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,000
Let Chen Qi

431
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,430
return to Zezhou with you

432
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,920
to take care of you on the way.

433
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,680
Don't worry.

434
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,520
I'll go back with Her Ladyship.

435
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,950
Let me go with you.

436
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,800
It's not safe for you girls two

437
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,110
go alone.

438
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,470
When will you come back?

439
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,070
I won't come back

440
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,470
in a short period.

441
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,830
So you fear,

442
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,230
right?

443
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,470
No.

444
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,680
Well,

445
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
famous doctors are popular with the people,

446
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,040
but most of the famous doctors are killed by bigwigs.

447
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,350
Wen Zhi was killed by King Min of Qi.

448
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,520
Bian Que was framed and killed by the imperial doctor of Qin State.

449
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Hua Tuo suffered a reckless disaster.

450
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,230
Now

451
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,710
Jiuling Drugstore is famous.

452
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,230
If I still stay here,

453
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,800
I fear Lu Yunqi won't let it go.

454
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,040
But fighting with a lunatic

455
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,830
will make me a lunatic sooner or later.

456
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,160
If I stay here,

457
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,640
he'll cause more troubles.

458
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,110
So we won't diagnose,

459
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,230
and sell medicine only.

460
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,230
Thus,

461
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,000
even if doctors from the capital city and others cities

462
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,760
come for medicine,

463
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,520
Lu Yunqi can't cause troubles

464
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,160
even if he wants to.

465
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,760
We retreat to advance.

466
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,040
In this case,

467
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,400
I'll go back

468
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,710
and prepare for the returning.

469
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,350
I'll help.

470
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,160
Thank you, Shopkeeper Liu.

471
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,830
Thanks.

472
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,040
I'll pack things.

473
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,560
OK.

474
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,710
You expected this situation,

475
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,230
right?

476
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,470
You asked us to work

477
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,070
as shopkeeper and accountant here.

478
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,640
Actually,

479
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,590
you want to leave Jiuling Drugstore

480
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,000
to us as you leave.

481
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,190
You always

482
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,190
think more than others.

483
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,000
Now you have time to consider

484
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,560
whether you should continue

485
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,680
to work as accountant of Jiuling Drugstore.

486
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,680
You've decided it.

487
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,640
Why should I bother?

488
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,430
Be careful

489
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,950
in the capital.

490
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,800
Jinxiu,

491
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,350
whatever happens to you in the future,

492
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,520
don't play tough.

493
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,920
When you meet troubles,

494
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,800
turn to Prince Xian.

495
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,230
You can trust him.

496
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,430
I asked Chengyu

497
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,950
to let Deshengchang

498
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,800
help when you need.

499
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,710
Keep it in mind.

500
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,430
Except humans,

501
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,800
we can abandon

502
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,830
everything.

503
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,760
I know.

504
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,830
I'm just an accountant.

505
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
I don't need to risk my life,

506
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,070
right?

507
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,520
By the way,

508
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,280
I really want to see

509
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,070
how furious

510
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,400
your future mother-in-law is

511
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,590
when she knows the engagement.

512
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,280
When will you leave?

513
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,560
We'll leave soon.

514
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,560
How about Zhu Zan?

515
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,000
He was seriously beaten,

516
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,760
but he won't die.

517
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,230
Lu Yunqi and Zhu Zan

518
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,830
have fought for times.

519
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,070
Lu Yunqi may seize the chance

520
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,310
to take private revenge.

521
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,680
Tell him not to

522
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,430
beat Zhu Zan to death.

523
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,920
Yes.

524
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,470
I wanted to see

525
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,230
who will plead for Zhu Zan

526
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,310
However...

527
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,520
So it's tricky

528
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,800
when it comes to Huang Cheng.

529
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,350
There are many discussions in the court,

530
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,640
but none dares to speak for him.

531
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm afraid

532
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,560
they want to keep safe.

533
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,560
This is true for all ministers.

534
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,880
Should I be happy

535
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,000
or be worried?

536
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,040
What?

537
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,520
Do you think alike?

538
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,520
Your Majesty will judge.

539
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,920
I don't

540
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,190
dare to judge.

541
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,800
I saw Lu Yunqi.

542
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,430
I'll leave the capital city after treating you.

543
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,950
You made a deal with him.

544
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,950
I have nothing

545
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,880
to make a deal with him.

546
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,830
Zhu Zan,

547
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,110
listen to me.

548
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,470
You must stay alive here.

549
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,800
You must be safe.

550
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,760
As long as you're alive here,

551
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,470
we'll find a way to help you out.

552
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,560
How strange!

553
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,710
It has been a day.

554
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,190
Those of Arm Moral Department haven't appeared.

555
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,190
I think

556
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,760
someone stopped them for us.

557
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,280
Ordinary people

558
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,350
can't stop them.

559
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,040
Is it Prince Xian?

560
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,680
Will it be His Lordship?

561
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,040
If it is the case,

562
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,190
he told them 

563
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,000
in advance to protect Her Ladyship.

564
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,430
He is

565
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,000
considerate

566
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,070
and kind to Her Ladyship.

567
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,710
I think after receiving my letter,

568
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,800
Lu Yunqi will keep his promise.

569
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
As I wrote in the letter,

570
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,800
he'll convince Huang Cheng

571
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,470
to spare Zhu Zan's life.

572
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,950
Let's finish eating

573
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,760
and keep going.

574
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,070
They are Zhu Zan's men again.

575
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,190
Yes.

576
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,110
Li Sanbing and Zhang Baotang

577
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,590
stopped us.

578
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,000
It must Zhu Zan who arranged it.

579
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:20,880
Your Excellency,

580
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,680
shall we send reinforcements?

581
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,040
Be patient.

582
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,800
Let her say goodbye.

583
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,310
They will

584
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000
never meet again.

585
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,070
Yes.

586
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,560
You ask me to release Zhu Zan?

587
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,640
Your Majesty,

588
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,110
it's ascertained that

589
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,040
my son was killed

590
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,920
by the startled horse breaking into.

591
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,680
It 

592
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,880
was an accident.

593
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,590
His Lordship

594
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,310
rushed there to stop

595
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,640
the startled horse.

596
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,400
No.

597
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,160
He must suffer more

598
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,560
in the imperial prison.

599
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,040
Your Majesty,

600
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,520
please don't do that.

601
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,070
The loss of my son

602
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,560
is a family matter,

603
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,830
but Lord Cheng guarding the border

604
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,880
is a state affair.

605
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,280
Do not affect him

606
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,950
with my family matter.

607
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:17,800
Now

608
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,640
it has been widely discussed

609
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,280
in the court and the commonalty.

610
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,520
We'd better

611
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,350
handle it properly.

612
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,680
Then

613
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
sorry to hurt you.

614
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,430
Thank you for your consideration.

615
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,640
State affairs are above everything.

616
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:38,880
Your Majesty,

617
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,950
please allow that.

618
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,680
Well,

619
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,920
Let him feed horses in Livestock Office

620
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,400
and ponder on his fault.

621
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,160
What do you think?

622
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,560
You are smart.

623
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,710
Grandma,

624
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,430
mother,

625
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,230
Chen Qi sent a man to report in advance

626
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,280
Jiuling will arrive at Zezhou

627
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,830
in a few days.

628
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,640
Good news.

629
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,110
Jiuling is coming back.

630
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,470
Let's discuss

631
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,310
how to arrange her.

632
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,710
Clean the yard

633
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,640
where she lived before.

634
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,040
How about letting her

635
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,350
live in a yard nearer to you?

636
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,230
We can see each other

637
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
in the Fang family at any time.

638
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,590
It's the same.

639
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,190
I wonder how long

640
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,830
she will stay here.

641
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,710
Does Jiuling know

642
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,800
what you think?

643
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,280
I'll make it clear to her.

644
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,400
Grandma,

645
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,230
mother,

646
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,160
please don't pay too much attention.

647
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,190
If she

648
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,430
doesn't have the same feeling,

649
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,590
she'll be awkward to live here.

650
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,640
Well,

651
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,160
I was about to report to grandma.

652
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,880
I've handled the account

653
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,070
of Deshengchang this month.

654
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,640
Tomorrow I will leave for the inn

655
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,190
outside the city to wait for her.

656
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,400
Is it too early?

657
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,560
Didn't you just say

658
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,680
she would arrive in a few days?

659
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,710
I guess 

660
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,760
she'll arrive in a few days.

661
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,880
But things don't turn out as planned.

662
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,590
What if she travels faster

663
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,590
and arrives in advance?

664
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,430
Go.

665
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,070
Go get her back.

666
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,070
Yes, grandma.

667
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,800
Your Lordship,

668
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,470
admit your mistake.

669
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,160
This time

670
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,430
you did

671
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,000
go too far.

672
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,280
Eunuch Yuan,

673
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,000
I was wrong.

674
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,920
Whether I'll meet startled horse

675
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,830
or startled donkey,

676
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,800
I won't meddle in.

677
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,230
That's right.

678
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,070
Remember 

679
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,230
to watch your mouth.

680
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,680
They didn't let me speak.

681
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,520
They just beat me.

682
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,190
Don't worry,

683
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,830
Eunuch Yuan.

684
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,520
I'll follow His Majesty's instructions.

685
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,560
Actually,

686
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,920
His Majesty showed his mercy

687
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,400
to let you ponder upon

688
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,000
your faults in Livestock Office.

689
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,190
Really?

690
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,880
Thank His Majesty for his grace.

691
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,430
So Eunuch Yuan,

692
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,230
can I go to the Livestock Office now?

693
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,470
Yes.

694
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,000
It really hurts,

695
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,680
Lord Lu.

696
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,680
Never mind.

697
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,350
I forgive you.

698
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,350
Many are the years to come.

699
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,680
He can walk.

700
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,830
Dr. Jun's medicine

701
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,430
really works.

702
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,040
Young Master,

703
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,560
are you tired?

704
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,590
How about resting for a while?

705
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,280
Don't worry.

706
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,110
I'm fine.

707
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
There is an inn ahead.

708
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,950
Let's rest in the inn.

709
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,310
Butler Gao,

710
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,640
I lied to grandma to let her

711
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,950
rest assured by saying that

712
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,000
I'll wait for Jiuling in an inn.

713
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,160
I'll

714
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,190
go all the way

715
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,800
to pick Jiuling up.

716
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,310
Go all the way?

717
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,430
Yes.

718
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,800
Butler Gao,

719
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,710
don't worry.

720
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,560
I've recovered.

721
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,190
I can ride horse

722
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,070
and shot arrows.

723
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,560
I can go all the way

724
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,430
to let her see that.

725
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,000
Fine.

726
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,800
Since you've decided,

727
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,710
we'll go all the way.

728
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,880
Go.

729
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,190
Master,

730
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
I came to see you.

731
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,800
I brought you

732
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,040
your favorite pastry.

733
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,320
This year,

734
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,670
a lot has happened to me.

735
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,319
I felt the warmth I have not felt in a long time

736
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,950
and encountered a lot of difficulties.

737
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,320
But

738
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,600
I won't be baffled.

739
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,320
Don't worry.

740
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,079
I'll certainly seek justice from Chu Rang.

741
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,670
The secret of Zezhou you told me

742
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,280
has something to do with the Fang family.

743
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,320
Now

744
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,320
I need to collect more evidence of Chu Rang's crime.

745
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,280
I hope you'll protect me.

746
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,600
Don't worry.

747
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,360
I'll come again

748
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,950
when I avenge.

749
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,470
Young Master.

750
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,630
Young Master.

751
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,840
Young Master.

752
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,150
Liu'er.

753
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,150
Young Master.

754
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,630
Where is Jiuling?

755
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,630
She went to worship Old Master alone.

756
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,630
I think

757
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,080
she will arrive at Zezhou soon.

758
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,910
That,

759
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,600
that's right.

760
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,800
Young Master,

761
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,840
why did you come all the way?

762
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,560
You may just way at the city gate.

763
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,910
I think

764
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,040
he wants to see Miss Jun earlier.

765
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,080
It has been

766
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,430
over a year since we last met.

767
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,320
What is this in your hand?

768
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,320
I picked the plums along the way.

769
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,320
It's a long journey.

770
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,630
I picked them to quench your thirst.

771
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,040
Then we'll enjoy it

772
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,630
without Her Ladyship.

773
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,390
Here you are.

774
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Where will you

775
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,390
meet with Jiuling?

776
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,560
The post

777
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,710
10 miles outside the city.

778
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,120
We planned to wait her in a post,

779
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,280
but we changed our mind

780
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,190
and came all the way.

781
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,600
Yes.

782
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,150
I had planned to meet Jiuling earlier,

783
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,560
but I didn't expect that

784
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
it would delay me.

785
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,630
Never mind.

786
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,520
It isn't late.

787
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,870
If we go fast,

788
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,600
we may get there earlier than Her Ladyship.

789
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,280
Yes.

790
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,080
Let's go now.

791
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,280
OK.

792
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,670
Go.

793
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,320
Go.

794
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,190
Mother,

795
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,560
eat something.

796
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,080
You haven't eaten for days.

797
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,840
If I eat something,

798
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,600
the thought of their words

799
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,950
flattering that woman

800
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,080
will make me vomit.

801
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,000
Mother.

802
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,630
Yunyan.

803
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,870
Brother.

804
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,280
Brother,

805
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,710
mother is so angry at your marriage with Jun Zhenzhen

806
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,280
that she falls ill.

807
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,190
Mother.

808
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
I have questions.

809
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,950
No need.

810
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,470
I asked him outside.

811
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,430
The engagement is false.

812
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,150
His uncle also agreed to that.

813
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,950
It was the most appropriate to do so

814
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,670
in the critical situation.

815
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,800
Is it really false?

816
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,840
Yes.

817
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,080
In this case,

818
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,360
when will you announce it?

819
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,360
I need to discuss

820
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,910
about that

821
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,040
with Miss Jun.

822
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,560
You need to discuss with her?

823
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,670
To get rid of trouble,

824
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,360
she used the engagement

825
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,150
to get our family's protection.

826
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,230
You helped her,

827
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,950
but you need to

828
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,190
discuss with her.

829
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,520
Mother,

830
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,280
she is famous

831
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,520
and I'm No.1 Scholar.

832
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,950
Even if she hadn't met trouble,

833
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,150
the engagement

834
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,520
will be discussed.

835
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,040
Anyway, I'll get involved.

836
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,910
So

837
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,320
I took the initiative

838
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,120
to stop criticism

839
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,360
to get

840
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,630
a good reputation.

841
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,320
And 

842
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,600
if someone utilizes the engagement

843
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,950
on purpose,

844
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,120
I'll be said

845
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,800
to be unfaithful.

846
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,670
It'll cause troubles

847
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,870
to my career.

848
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,950
You're right.

849
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,470
No.

850
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,870
Brother,

851
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,320
do you like Jun Zhenzhen?

852
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,560
Brother,

853
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,360
you're clever

854
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,190
and resourceful,

855
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,470
you won't be afraid of others

856
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,760
making a fuss about your marriage.

857
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,000
Brother?

858
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,320
Say something,

859
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,800
brother.

860
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,670
Yes.

861
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,870
I like her.

862
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,080
Brother.

863
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,560
My precious son

864
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,710
who can bring honor to the family name

865
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,760
likes that bitch.

866
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,280
Mother,

867
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,430
you misunderstand her.

868
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,840
-In fact, she is... -Shut up.

869
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,800
Mother.
