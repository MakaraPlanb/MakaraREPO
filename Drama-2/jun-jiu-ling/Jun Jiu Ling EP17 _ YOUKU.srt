00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 17

17
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,830
Jiuling Drugstore

18
00:29:26,720 --> 00:02:13,030
Mansion of Prince Huai

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,670
Miss Jun.

20
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,720
This…

21
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,600
Your Excellency Lu, what do you want to do?

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,160
You know it.

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
I ask you again.

24
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,240
Rename it

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,270
or not.

26
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,360
Your Excellency Lu,

27
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,110
Jiuling Drugstore is the ancestral business of our Jun family.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,240
Both of my grandpa and my father are dead,

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,320
and now only I'm alive in my family.

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,720
So I must

31
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,550
follow their wishes

32
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,830
to inherit the Jiuling Drugstore.

33
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,190
Please pardon me.

34
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,750
I can't do

35
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
as you require.

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,630
Your Excellency Lu,

37
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,470
Jiuling's families are all dead,

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,910
so she can only inherit her family business.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,750
Please pardon her.

40
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,360
Jinxiu.

41
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,600
This matter

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,160
should be ended.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,270
Smash the plaque

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,270
in front of Dr. Jun!

45
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,470
How dare you!

46
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,110
You're bold.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,960
Jiuling.

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,030
Lu Yunqi,

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,750
you're arrogant.

50
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,550
How dare you bully a girl in the street?

51
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,360
Don't interfere in the matter

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,390
of the Arm Moral Department.

53
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,800
Now that you want to smash it,

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,360
I must stop you.

55
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,470
Only the stronger

56
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,800
can do what he wants to do.

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,630
Let's see

58
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,960
whether you can stop me.

59
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,070
-Miss Jun. -Your Ladyship.

60
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,670
Jiuling.

61
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,640
Are you mad?

62
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,350
You don't want to live?

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,350
I'll protect this plaque

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,070
at all costs.

65
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,270
You can't protect

66
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
something you like sometimes.

67
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,200
Zhu Zan.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,600
Your Excellency Lu,

69
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
can I have a talk with you alone?

70
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,920
It's not necessary.

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,110
You can decide it

72
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,040
after a talk with me.

73
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,640
If you still

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,320
want to smash the plaque later…

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,830
Your Ladyship.

76
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,950
…I won't stop you.

77
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,830
Your Excellency Lu,

78
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,640
you have a bad omen.

79
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,000
You think

80
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,550
I'll believe

81
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,670
your nonsense?

82
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,880
She

83
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,670
had never appeared in your dream.

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,670
Who is she?

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,040
You know who I'm talking about.

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,670
She is your bad omen.

87
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,110
Really?

88
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,670
If so,

89
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,160
there's no need to treat me.

90
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,270
So good.

91
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,350
Much resentment

92
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,070
is not good, Your Excellency Lu.

93
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,880
Resentment?

94
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,350
You mean she resented me?

95
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,830
To be precise, she hated you…

96
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,110
-Listen up. -She hated you very much.

97
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,950
I don't know how you knew these

98
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,070
and made up this story,

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,510
but I don't believe

100
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,350
any word.

101
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,230
Don't draw a conclusion

102
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,720
before you take my medicine.

103
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,670
Please wait

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
to see

105
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,720
the prescription I make for you.

106
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,000
Your Excellency,

107
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,640
here is your prescription.

108
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,040
Jun Jiuling,

109
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,950
you are great.

110
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I've remembered you.

111
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,640
Your Excellency, take care.

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,550
Thank you today.

113
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,070
Don't think too much.

114
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,230
I just dislike Lu Yunqi.

115
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,789
If someone else was bullied,

116
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,709
I would also help him.

117
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,790
I just

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,590
thanked you

119
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,880
for helping the weak.

120
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,400
What did you say to Lu Yunqi?

121
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,640
He looked very angry when he left.

122
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,550
Yes, Your Ladyship.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,590
Even His Lordship couldn't drive him away at that time.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,110
How did you frighten him away?

125
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,320
You can ask her,

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,200
but don't mention me.

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,320
I just told him that

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,400
he has a bad omen.

129
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
So I prescribed for him.

130
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,230
Then he left.

131
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,150
He would believe it?

132
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,080
He had to

133
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,200
believe it.

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,910
Sure enough,

135
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,760
our lady

136
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,350
is awesome.

137
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,790
What a flatterer!

138
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,790
I'm convinced.

139
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,320
Anyway,

140
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
no one dares to

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,470
bully the Jiuling Drugstore from today on.

142
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,840
I'm leaving.

143
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,710
Does it still hurt?

144
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,790
Much better.

145
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,880
Cousin,

146
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,150
Prince Huai fell sick

147
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,230
with a serious disease.

148
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,710
Some imperial doctors sold all their property

149
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,790
and exchanged the silver for notes

150
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,150
in Deshengchang of the capital city.

151
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,030
After secret investigation,

152
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,840
I found they exchanged notes early to facilitate the use

153
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,470
for fear that they'll be

154
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,400
punished and driven away

155
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,590
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine by His Majesty

156
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,000
due to Prince Huai's disease.

157
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,350
I remember

158
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,030
you once asked about Prince Huai,

159
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,030
so I took it seriously

160
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,200
and wrote to tell you.

161
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,910
Grandma doesn't know it yet.

162
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,110
Remember not to mention it to her.

163
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,030
Prince Huai's disease was not serious,

164
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,670
but as it relapsed again and again,

165
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,840
it became serious.

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,470
Jiuling,

167
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,960
it's easy to cure diseases

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,110
but hard to save lives.

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,640
Be careful.

170
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,200
These imperial doctors

171
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,790
are going to run away?

172
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,840
It seems that Jiurong's condition

173
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,150
is worse than I expect.

174
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,350
Today I deliberately showed my previous handwriting

175
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,320
to Lu Yunqi.

176
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,880
He'll try to test me again.

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,550
To get close to Jiurong,

178
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,320
I can only risk it.

179
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Why is

180
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,670
her handwriting so similar

181
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,550
to that of Princess Jiuling?

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,150
She also renamed herself Jiuling.

183
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,880
What exactly does she want to do?

184
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,790
There's something wrong with the silver note?

185
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,910
It's true.

186
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,670
Of course it's true.

187
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,230
But the treatment expense

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,230
is 2,000 taels of silver.

189
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,470
No one may give you

190
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,470
so much money for no reason.

191
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,320
Why were you paid the extra 8,000 taels of silver?

192
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,840
The extra 8,000 taels of silver

193
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,110
is to rename the Jiuling Drugstore.

194
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,790
Are you worried about Prince Huai's disease?

195
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,670
These days

196
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,640
he is getting worse

197
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,080
and can't get out of bed.

198
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,520
Your Highness, please take it easy.

199
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,880
We'll find a solution.

200
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,590
So you believe

201
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,590
the soul reincarnation?

202
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,880
I don't know.

203
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,110
I didn't believe it before.

204
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,400
But now,

205
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,350
I'd love to believe it.

206
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,880
You want her to come back?

207
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,790
Yes.

208
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,470
I also want to believe it,

209
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,590
but

210
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,550
it's impossible.

211
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,440
Why?

212
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,640
The world is so big

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
that there are

214
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,760
various coincidences.

215
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,320
Others may have similar eyes,

216
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
or similar voice,

217
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,030
or

218
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
similar expression.

219
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,000
But they're

220
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,230
just similar

221
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,400
not the same.

222
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,440
It's late.

223
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Go to bed early.

224
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,640
Even if I believe it,

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,710
I don't want her

226
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,960
to come back.

227
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,590
It takes a long time to arrive here

228
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,440
from Zezhou.

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,470
Zan,

230
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,150
you meet Miss Jun

231
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,080
so often.

232
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,470
Sanbing,

233
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,790
I also want to

234
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,960
meet a girl so often.

235
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,080
You?

236
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,470
Baotang will meet a girl like this later.

237
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,520
Zan,

238
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,150
well, I indeed want it,

239
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,150
but I can't

240
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,880
get what I want.

241
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,110
While someone

242
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,030
who doesn't want it

243
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,910
just gets it.

244
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,150
Sanbing?

245
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,080
So,

246
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,710
who is she?

247
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,710
Why didn't you tell me?

248
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,590
Shut up.

249
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,110
In my life,

250
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,440
I won't absolutely get myself into such a trouble.

251
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,440
Listen to me.

252
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,230
Women are always…

253
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,550
Very troublesome.

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,910
You know me very well.

255
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,960
It turns out that he hasn't been enlightened.

256
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,520
It's you who haven't been enlightened.

257
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,840
Baotang referred to you.

258
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,350
Me?

259
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,400
Zan,

260
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,590
you

261
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,150
like her.

262
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,400
Don't talk nonsense.

263
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,280
Otherwise,

264
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,320
I'll take you to see her.

265
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,440
Look. He wants to see her.

266
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,550
Baotang,

267
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,910
listen to me.

268
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,840
If you like a girl,

269
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,840
you can't let her go.

270
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,400
I see, Sanbing.

271
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,550
Why didn't you tell me

272
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,840
such a big deal until now?

273
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,230
Your Lordship,

274
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,110
you said you would concentrate on reading

275
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,150
and asked me not to disturb you.

276
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,640
And you didn't allow me

277
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,590
to inquire about Miss Jun

278
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,150
since last time.

279
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,350
They're different.

280
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,320
I just didn't want to badger

281
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,200
and inquire about her,

282
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,080
but this is different as she is in danger.

283
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,550
Commander Lu is a dangerous man.

284
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,840
How could you conceal me from it?

285
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,030
I see,

286
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,200
Your Lordship.

287
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,790
I was wrong.

288
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,320
I heard

289
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,470
it's because Miss Jun

290
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,640
didn't treat

291
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,760
Commander Lu's mistress.

292
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,710
And some said

293
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,840
both His Excellency Lu

294
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
and the son of Lord Cheng

295
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,230
like Miss Jun,

296
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,400
so…

297
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,880
Nonsense.

298
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,710
It's ridiculous.

299
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,910
Whenever you see a woman

300
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,030
arguing with a man,

301
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,470
you always think of this.

302
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,960
I didn't see it, either.

303
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,760
I heard from others.

304
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,880
The reason is very simple.

305
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,830
Due to the name of the Jiuling Drugstore.

306
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
Why did His Lordship Zhu do so?

307
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,109
I asked Miss Jun to enjoy the lanterns with me

308
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,039
on the night of the 15th day,

309
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,830
but she refused.

310
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,190
Probably,

311
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,830
due to His Excellency Lu.

312
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,400
He always do something

313
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,880
to annoy His Excellency Lu.

314
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,640
Your Lordship,

315
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,070
let's go to

316
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,000
see Miss Jun.

317
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,950
She doesn't need it,

318
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,470
and someone else will do it.

319
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
His Excellency Lu failed to achieve his goal this time.

320
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
Maybe he'll do it again.

321
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,040
Then,

322
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,760
will Miss Jun be in danger?

323
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
His Lordship Zhu

324
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,430
can't always protect her.

325
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,520
This matter

326
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,760
depends on the attitude of the Fang family.

327
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,000
If the Fang family would like to…

328
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,470
Jiuli.

329
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,310
Jiurong.

330
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm here.

331
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,880
Sister.

332
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,920
Jiurong.

333
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,280
Your Highness.

334
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
It's time to take the medicine, Jiurong.

335
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,520
Come on, Jiurong.

336
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,880
Take the medicine.

337
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,400
Jiurong,

338
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,190
take the medicine.

339
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,230
Sister,

340
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,560
I feel bad.

341
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,830
I know.

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,920
Take the medicine.

343
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,040
Then you'll get better.

344
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,070
Come on.

345
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,040
Jiurong.

346
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,040
Come on.

347
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,160
Jiurong.

348
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,710
He could swallow yesterday,

349
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,880
but why can't he today?

350
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,190
Your Highness,

351
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,430
you can't go on feeding in this way.

352
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,710
How about using

353
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,040
a crane-mouth pot to feed His Highness?

354
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,190
Crane-mouth pot?

355
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,000
OK.

356
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,920
Jiurong.

357
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,470
Your Highness.

358
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,280
The imperial doctor said that

359
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,280
His Highness,

360
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,680
His Highness suffers from scrofula.

361
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,950
Scrofula?

362
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,230
Your Excellency,

363
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,280
Miss Jun came

364
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,190
and wanted to meet you.

365
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,640
How can you

366
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,230
recommend a female hand-bell doctor

367
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,880
to treat Prince Huai?

368
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,430
Are you mad?

369
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,950
Your Majesty, please calm down.

370
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,000
The reason why I recommend Dr. Jun is that

371
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,520
she is the daughter of Jun Yingwen,

372
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,880
a famous doctor in Runan,

373
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,950
and she has excellent medical skills.

374
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,110
Your Majesty,

375
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:44,950
I couldn't

376
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,430
cure the wife of Marquis of Dingyuan,

377
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,230
but she did it.

378
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,520
Your Majesty,

379
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,430
Command Lu asks for a meeting.

380
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,520
Let him in.

381
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,230
Yes.

382
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,230
Here are my respects,

383
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,190
Your Majesty.

384
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,950
You come at the right moment.

385
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,830
Just now

386
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,110
Imperial Doctor Jiang

387
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,830
recommended a female

388
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,880
hand-bell doctor

389
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,280
who is surnamed Jun

390
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,110
to treat Prince Huai.

391
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,040
You go to check

392
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,430
if she really has excellent medical skills.

393
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,430
Your Majesty,

394
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,760
that is

395
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,830
why I

396
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,040
came here.

397
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,880
Dr. Jun

398
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,070
volunteers to

399
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,710
treat Prince Huai.

400
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,000
Volunteer?

401
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,070
Yes.

402
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,590
Dr. Jun is

403
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,110
the granddaughter of the Fang family who runs Deshengchang.

404
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,470
The Fang family?

405
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,880
You get out first.

406
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,230
Yes.

407
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,350
The granddaughter of the Fang family

408
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,230
is Jun Zhenzhen who helped the Fang family to avoid misfortunes?

409
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,710
She is proficient in medicine?

411
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,110
Dr. Jun

412
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,070
has inherited her ancestral drugstore

413
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,830
and renamed

414
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,520
herself

415
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,230
Jun Jiuling.

416
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,560
Jun Jiuling?

417
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,350
Yes.

418
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,470
Jiuling.

419
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,310
Why did she rename herself Jiuling?

420
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,640
She also opened a clinic called Jiuling Drugstore

421
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,710
in the capital city.

422
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,560
The drugstore is called Jiuling Drugstore?

423
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,070
And she also renamed herself

424
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,520
Jiuling.

425
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,760
What is the Fang family doing now?

426
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,950
Your Majesty,

427
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,920
the Fangs

428
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,280
behave themselves recently,

429
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,680
and run Deshengchang as before.

430
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,230
Except for their identity of imperial merchant,

431
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,280
nothing else has changed.

432
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,560
What if I

433
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,110
ask Jun Jiuling,

434
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,760
the granddaughter

435
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,280
of the Fang family

436
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,110
to treat Prince Huai,

437
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,350
but she fails to

438
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,230
cure his disease?

439
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,560
Your Majesty,

440
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
there was

441
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,830
such a

442
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,230
precedent.

443
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,710
An imperial doctor misdiagnosed a concubine's disease,

444
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,230
which implicated his whole family.

445
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,350
As a result,

446
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,760
all his families were beheaded.

447
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,680
It's hard to cure scrofula.

448
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,880
If Jun Jiuling

449
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,160
fails to cure the disease of Prince Huai,

450
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,800
who is the son of the late emperor,

451
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,950
all the people

452
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,710
must burn with rage.

453
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,520
Then killing all her families

454
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,310
must be able to

455
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,310
please the people.

456
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,280
Then

457
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,230
let Jun Jiuling

458
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,280
have a try.

459
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

460
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,070
Your Ladyship,

461
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,800
don't you really need me to go with you?

462
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,190
No.

463
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,000
Scrofula is not

464
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,070
a common disease.

465
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,400
Are you sure of curing it?

466
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,800
I'll try.

467
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,920
But if you…

468
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,470
Enough.

469
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,000
Don't worry.

470
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,350
Wait for me to come back.

471
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,040
I'm leaving.

472
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,110
It's scrofula.

473
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,070
It's normal that it can't be cured.

474
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,110
It's just a bet.

475
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,950
If she wins, she'll be well-known and wealthy.

476
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,920
If she fails,

477
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,430
it'll be also normal.

478
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,110
If she wins, she'll be indeed well-known and wealthy,

479
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,590
but if she fails,

480
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,640
she will not only lose her face.

481
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
How about we spread a rumor?

482
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,520
What?

483
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,280
Let everyone know that

484
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,640
scrofula

485
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,230
is an incurable disease.

486
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,430
Zhu Zan,

487
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,110
why are you here?

488
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,590
Follow me.

489
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,590
What's the matter?

490
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,950
Let's do a deal.

491
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,760
If you cure Jiurong's disease,

492
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,640
I'll save your life.

493
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
If you fail,

494
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,710
I'll save the lives of the Fangs.

495
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,640
If you cure his disease,

496
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,190
you'll annoy His Majesty.

497
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,590
Then your life will be threatened.

498
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,430
If you fail,

499
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,470
the Fang family will be implicated.

500
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,230
Jun,

501
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,350
you have no choice.

502
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,560
It's inevitable.

503
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,160
Please do your best to save him.

504
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,310
Why do you do so?

505
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,830
He is Jiuling's brother

506
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,160
and also mine.

507
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,160
I'd like to do so.

508
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm leaving.

509
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,560
Jun!

510
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,280
Indecent.

511
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,710
Scrofula.

512
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,350
The patient's sores will crack and suppurate at later stage.

513
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,950
It the sores can't be cured in time,

514
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,040
they would affect the liver and kidney.

515
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,920
Then the patient will be deficient in vital energy.

516
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,520
Prince Huai is young,

517
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,040
so it's hard for him

518
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,070
to resist scrofula.

519
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,680
Uncle.

520
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,310
Yunzhao,

521
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,230
why are you so interested

522
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,350
in Prince Huai's disease?

523
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,350
I just sympathize with Prince Huai

524
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,470
for his adverse fortune.

525
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,070
He is predestined to suffer.

526
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,880
You shouldn't sympathize with him.

527
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,280
Illness is just illness,

528
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,160
not adverse fortune.

529
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,000
There are countless orphans in this world,

530
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,680
and many patients who suffer from

531
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,590
incurable diseases are everywhere.

532
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,230
How could you

533
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,560
sign for

534
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,350
Prince Huai's disease?

535
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,040
You can benefit the country and people

536
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,920
in many ways.

537
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,110
Don't behave like a woman.

538
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,880
Yes.

539
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,640
Uncle,

540
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,590
I heard that His Majesty

541
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,920
has allowed Dr. Jun of the Jiuling Drugstore

542
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,070
to treat His Highness Prince Huai.

543
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,280
Don't worry.

544
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,880
Go back to the Imperial Academy for review.

545
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,190
Yes,

546
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,070
uncle.

547
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,230
Dr. Jun is a well-known great doctor.

548
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,310
Maybe she can cure

549
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,830
Prince Huai's disease.

550
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,190
But others all think that

551
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,760
scrofula is incurable.

552
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,070
Yunzhao,

553
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,470
you're sympathizing with Prince Huai

554
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,760
or worried about Dr. Jun?

555
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,760
Uncle,

556
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm going back to the Imperial Academy.

557
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,710
OK.

558
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,070
If something happens in Prince Huai's mansion,

559
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,430
I'll tell you.

560
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,710
Thank you, uncle.

561
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,760
You really come.

562
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm a doctor.

563
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,830
It's my duty.

564
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,680
Jiuli.

565
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,230
Jiurong.

566
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,160
I'm coming.

567
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm back.

568
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,760
Your Highness,

569
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,590
Dr. Jun comes.

570
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,710
Here is my respect, Your Highness.

571
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,950
Get up please.

572
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,520
Sister.

573
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,830
Jiurong.

574
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,980
I feel bad.

575
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,680
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

576
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,800
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

577
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,840
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

578
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,800
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

579
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,080
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

580
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,520
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

581
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,360
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

582
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,880
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

583
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,760
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

584
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,320
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

585
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:38,360
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

586
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,200
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

587
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,960
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

588
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:56,760
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

589
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,600
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

590
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,320
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

591
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:16,280
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

592
00:32:17,200 --> 00:30:43,000
♫Early morning♫

593
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm here.

594
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,880
The doctor comes.

595
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,520
Let the doctor treat you later.

596
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,400
Sister.

597
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm here.

598
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,950
Sister.

599
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,760
Second sister.

600
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,520
Sister.

601
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,000
Come to see him.

602
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,400
Yes.

603
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,760
Jiurong's neck is clean and smooth

604
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,710
and has no lumps.

605
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,430
He doesn't suffer from scrofula.

606
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,920
It's lucky.

607
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,430
It seems that

608
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,230
scrofula is just

609
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,470
an excuse of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

610
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,350
Second sister.

611
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,230
Your Highness.

612
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,190
You're here.

613
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,190
Dr. Jun,

614
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,470
what do you think about His Highness Prince Huai's disease?

615
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,520
It's indeed

616
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,070
hard to cure it.

617
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,680
Does he suffer from scrofula?

618
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,160
Yes.

619
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,070
Your Highness,

620
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,400
I have some experience in curing it,

621
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,710
so I can cure

622
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,070
His Highness' disease.

623
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,160
I heard that folk doctors have excellent prescriptions.

624
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,520
Now that you came confidently,

625
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,110
you must be able to cure it.

626
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,310
Tell me

627
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,230
whatever you need.

628
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,160
Yes.

629
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,640
Then I'm going to decoct the herbs.

630
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,830
Thank you, Dr. Jun.

631
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,560
Dr. Jun, this way, please.

632
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,400
Now

633
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,560
people say

634
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,230
how serious the scrofula is

635
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,880
and how hard it is to cure everywhere.

636
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,950
The Jiuling Drugstore

637
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,880
must be blamed for it.

638
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,760
Yeah.

639
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,680
They just want everyone to know

640
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,400
how serious the scrofula is

641
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,840
and then they can pass the buck

642
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,360
if the scrofula can't be cured.

643
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,360
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

644
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,469
what do you think about it?

645
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,470
Ignore it.

646
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,320
Suit themselves.

647
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,470
As long as His Majesty wants to blame her,

648
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,000
it doesn't matter

649
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,709
whether it's scrofula

650
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
and it can be cured or not.

651
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,520
Dr. Jun,

652
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:54,949
let me help you.

653
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,599
No need.

654
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,600
You go to guard at the door for me.

655
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,390
Yes.

656
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,630
Dr. Jun washed, cut

657
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,520
and decocted the herbs personally

658
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,630
and always kept an eye on the medicine.

659
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,230
She also didn't allow anyone to enter the eastern kitchen.

660
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,080
Your Highness,

661
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,040
the medicine is ready.

662
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,910
Go to fetch the crane-mouth pot.

663
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,560
He can't swallow now.

664
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,280
Wait a moment.

665
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,910
The use of crane-mouth pot

666
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,800
will make him feel bad.

667
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,800
Let me try.

668
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,870
OK.

669
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,390
Your Highness,

670
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,390
help him up for me.

671
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,630
OK.

672
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,800
Come on, Jiurong.

673
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,710
Jiurong,

674
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,870
take the medicine.

675
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,000
Come on.

676
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,230
Your Highness.

677
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,000
Your Highness,

678
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
make him breathe smoothly.

679
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,870
OK.

680
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,360
He should be able to swallow now.

681
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,520
Let's try again.

682
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,230
OK.

683
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,080
Jiurong,

684
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
listen to me.

685
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,630
Take the medicine,

686
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,390
OK?

687
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,390
Jiurong, be good.

688
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,600
He has swallowed it.

689
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,230
He has swallowed it.

690
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,000
Whether His Highness

691
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,950
can get better

692
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,430
depends on whether his fever can be reduced tonight.

693
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,670
Can I

694
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,870
put him down?

695
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,470
Yes.

696
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,040
Keep him flat.

697
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,800
If you're tired,

698
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,840
you can go to bed,

699
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,600
and I'll look after His Highness Prince Huai here.

700
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,670
Jiurong.

701
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,670
Jiuling,

702
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,470
bless her cure Jiurong's disease

703
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,430
in the paradise.

704
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,040
Grandma, look.

705
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,870
Grandma,

706
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,840
do you like them?

707
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,870
Yes. Yes. Yes.

708
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,040
How did you buy

709
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,710
so many flowers and plants?

710
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,080
Beautiful.

711
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,670
Thank you.

712
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,360
I feel happy that you like them.

713
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,630
Today is neither a festival

714
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,120
nor birthday,

715
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,840
you

716
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,630
must buy so many flowers

717
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,190
for something.

718
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,840
Grandma,

719
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,840
please send the imperial decree

720
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,190
to the Jiuling Drugstore in the capital city.

721
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,120
Chengyu.

722
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,280
Chengyu, do you know

723
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,190
what you're saying?

724
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,040
Get up first.

725
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,630
Get up and talk.

726
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,390
Please promise me.

727
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,190
Don't kneel.

728
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,080
Get up.

729
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,280
Chengyu,

730
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,630
get up.

731
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,080
What happened to her

732
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,190
in the capital city?

733
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,080
You're so anxious

734
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,910
to ask me for the imperial decree here.

735
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,360
Command Lu

736
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,950
wanted to smash Jiuling's plaque.

737
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,120
Command Lu is narrow-minded,

738
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:44,840
so I think

739
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,840
we can only send the decree

740
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,320
to the Jiuling Drugstore

741
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,470
to stop him.

742
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,430
Why did she offend

743
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,150
the Arm Moral Department as a doctor?

744
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,390
Because of

745
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,000
the name.

746
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,430
Name?

747
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,080
The fever of His Highness Prince Huai has been reduced.

748
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,870
He is much better.

749
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
So he won't be dead, right?

750
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,280
Your Highness,

751
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,390
please look after His Highness first,

752
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,390
I'm going to decoct the herbs.

753
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,320
Where are you going?

754
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,080
I'm going to decoct herbs for His Highness Prince Huai.

755
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,600
Why don't you let someone else do this?

756
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,230
Isn't that faster?

757
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,600
I don't trust others.

758
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,080
Your Excellency knows

759
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,670
I came uninvited.

760
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,560
A lot of people are waiting to laugh at my failure.

761
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,230
If I lose,

762
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,950
it will be a shame for me.

763
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,840
By the way,

764
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,670
no one is allowed to touch

765
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,800
what I use to decoct the herbs.

766

Otherwise,

767
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,670
if His Highness Prince Huai can't be cured,

768
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,800
it won't be my responsibility.

769
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,190
Including Your Excellency.
