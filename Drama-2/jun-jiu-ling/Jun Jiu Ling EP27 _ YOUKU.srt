00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 27

17
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,930
Deshengchang

18
00:15:50,510 --> 00:02:23,240
Ning Mansion

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,830
Jiuling.

20
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,320
Chengyu?

21
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,030
You're finally back.

22
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,830
Yes, I'm back.

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,600
Long time no see.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,520
You get thin.

25
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,800
Long time no see.

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
You are

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
more and more handsome.

28
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,110
It's far from home.

29
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,520
Aren't others worried about you?

30
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,440
No, they're not worried.

31
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,800
No matter how far you are,

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,830
I'll come to meet you.

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,800
You had

34
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,750
a long journey,

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,520
so you must be tired.

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,440
-Your Ladyship. -Your Ladyship.

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,240
Young Master.

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
Why do you come together?

39
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,550
Your Ladyship,

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,190
Young Master Fang went to meet you,

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,320
but he didn't expect that

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,600
you would go alone.

43
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,440
Yeah.

44
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,550
Young Master Fang even brought you

45
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,720
sweet plums,

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,030
but I ate them up.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,470
Young Master Fang

48
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,670
looked very happy

49
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,390
when he met us,

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,000
but after he only saw Chen Qi and me,

51
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,880
his expression

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,800
changed in an instant,

53
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,960
and he became

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,720
cool and poker-faced.

55
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,910
Liu'er,

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
why not go out first?

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,550
I want to have a long chat with Jiuling.

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,000
OK. OK. OK.

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,630
Your Ladyship,

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,550
we're going to put the stuff away.

61
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,550
OK.

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,670
-Let's go. -Let's go.

63
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,750
Why are you looking at me?

64
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,190
I have a lot of questions for you.

65
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,190
Go ahead.

66
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,670
When staying in the capital city,

67
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,830
you did so many good deeds.

68
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,000
Did you have a hard time?

69
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,390
Nothing is easy to do.

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,880
Moreover,

71
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,270
we shouldn't be afraid of hardships outside.

72
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,000
You're right.

73
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
But you did them very well.

74
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,190
You're awesome.

75
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,080
By the way,

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,270
I did something

77
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,390
without your consent.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,670
Please don't blame me.

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,960
What did you do?

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,000
Well,

81
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,470
in my opinion,

82
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,440
our families

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,320
and I were happy

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,440
about your return.

85
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,790
So do

86
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,760
the people of Zezhou.

87
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,040
So 

88
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,199
I dispatched someone

89
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,720
to tell them that

90
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,550
you're back.

91
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,110
You're

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,880
naughty.

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,160
Grandma.

94
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,270
Aunt.

95
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,270
Yuxiu.

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,070
You're finally back.

97
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,440
Long time no see.

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,600
You look

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,480
more and more beautiful.

100
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,950
As a natural beauty,

101
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,830
you look more and more impressive.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,640
Yuxiu,

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,920
don't make fun of me.

104
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,160
Grandma is healthier and healthier.

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,200
As an old woman,

106
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,790
I can't be compared with you.

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,070
Only a year has passed,

108
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
but I change a lot.

109
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,350
I'm older.

110
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,480
Grandma,

111
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,070
aunt,

112
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,000
I bring you

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,510
some good medicinal materials to nourish your bodies

114
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,830
from the capital city.

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,230
Liu'er.

116
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,550
Jinxiu

117
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,670
also prepared you

118
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,880
some good things in the capital city.

119
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,350
How is Jinxiu

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,480
in the capital city?

121
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,920
Senior Madame,

122
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,950
Lady Jinxiu lives

123
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,070
at ease and happily

124
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,920
in the capital city.

125
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,390
And she manages

126
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
the Jiuling Drugstore well

127
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,510
by virtue of her ability.

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
Really?

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,070
She is still 

130
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,350
as confident as a lady.

131
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,270
I invited her to come back with me before leaving,

132
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,670
but she refused.

133
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,040
Why does she suddenly come back?

134
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,790
Yunzhao.

135
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,160
Father.

136
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,510
You're wronged.

137
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,440
Have a seat.

138
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,790
Your mother is

139
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,760
always good-tempered,

140
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,760
but this time

141
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,510
she was strange.

142
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,350
It's my fault.

143
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,440
I shouldn't have acted rashly.

144
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,510
Her irritation is understandable.

145
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,000
However,

146
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,200
I think it's a good thing that

147
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
you like her.

148
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,950
Do you also think that she's a good girl?

149
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,160
Such a magic skill as vaccination

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
will go down in history.

151
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,670
Have a think.

152
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,350
If you marry her,

153
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,270
how great glory it'll be!

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,110
It turns out that you mean this.

155
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,600
But 

156
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,640
it's the Jiuling Drugstore 

157
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,000
that should go down in history.

158
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,160
Even so,

159
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,950
the Jiuling Drugstore also belongs to Ningjun Jiuling.

160
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,350
Father,

161
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,070
our engagement was canceled.

162
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,440
Our marriage

163
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,720
was still false.

164
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,830
Your marriage was false,

165
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,070
but your love

166
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,390
is true.

167
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,480
I told her

168
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
my love once,

169
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,390
but she

170
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,950
refused me.

171
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,950
You've given up?

172
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,880
Zan,

173
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,830
the Pasturage Department

174
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,110
is managed by the follower of Huang Cheng.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
You must suffer a lot here.

176
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,830
Here is much better than the North.

177
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,070
Did anything happen in the bookstore?

178
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,110
Did Huang Cheng meet the mysterious man again?

179
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,000
Huang Cheng didn't go to the bookstore again.

180
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,320
But 

181
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,640
we found out the bookstore's owner.

182
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,790
Its owner is a scholar named Zhang Siming.

183
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,830
We suspect,

184
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,830
we suspect that

185
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,320
he is likely

186
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,280
to be the spy dispatched by Beiqi in the capital city.

187
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,230
We went there twice in two days,

188
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,110
but we just saw

189
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,670
the workers of the bookstore,

190
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,110
and the owner

191
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,230
never showed up.

192
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,590
It's abominable to open the door

193
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,440
to a dangerous enemy.

194
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,470
You write to my father

195
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,640
to let him beware of it.

196
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,200
Sanbing,

197
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,640
keep an eye on the bookstore.

198
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,550
In case of any abnormity,

199
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,230
come to tell me immediately.

200
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,840
OK.

201
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:55,960
Zan,

202
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,150
Miss Jun reached Zezhou safely.

203
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,910
You can be relieved.

204
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,200
You can't let her

205
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
be controlled by Lu Yunqi.

206
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,110
There are many people here.

207
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,000
You go first.

208
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,440
Be careful.

209
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,470
Young Master.

210
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,440
Butler Gao,

211
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,150
I finished checking today's accounts.

212
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,030
Do you have any other account books?

213
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,520
They haven't been sent here yet.

214
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,150
Young Master,

215
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,350
you've been checking all morning.

216
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:50,960
How about

217
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,030
going back to have a rest?

218
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,280
After the noon,

219
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,840
I can send the account books to the mansion.

220
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,520
OK.

221
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,030
I'll go back

222
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,960
after Santao comes back.

223
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,150
Santao usually

224
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,880
follows you.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
Where did he go?

226
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,110
I asked him to buy something for me.

227
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,000
Young Master!

228
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:06,960
Young Master,

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,710
I bought them back.

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,590
-They're freshly steamed. -Give me.

231
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,080
Be careful not to be scalded.

232
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,350
They won't be delicious when getting cold.

233
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,760
You said you didn't plan to leave the capital city.

234
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,840
Why did you come back so suddenly?

235
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,030
Because of Lu Yunqi?

236
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,710
Yes.

237
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,230
But not for him only.

238
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,110
If you don't want to tell me,

239
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,550
you can keep silent.

240
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,030
-Jiuling. -I…

241
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,030
Jiuling,

242
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,670
I'm back.

243
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,960
I brought you something.

244
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,840
Young Master.

245
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
You're entertaining the guest?

246
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,150
Do I bother you?

247
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,110
Young Master Fang,

248
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,350
I'm Ning Yunzhao.

249
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,000
You're Childe Ning.

250
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,960
I've long heard of

251
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,350
but never seen you.

252
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,880
Thank you for helping Jiuling

253
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,520
in the capital city.

254
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,520
You're welcome.

255
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,440
Miss Jun

256
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,230
thanked me.

257
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,550
Even if Jiuling

258
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,790
thanked you,

259
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,110
I also need to thank you.

260
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,150
Well,

261
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,640
I told you that

262
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
the steamed buns of a newly-opened shop

263
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,440
are very delicious.

264
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,000
Come on.

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,590
Have a taste when they're hot.

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,350
Otherwise they'll be cold.

267
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,790
Childe Ning, would you like to try one?

268
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,030
Come on.

269
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,640
You eat one,

270
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,550
and I can share one with Jiuling.

271
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,080
Here you are,

272
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,550
Jiuling.

273
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,440
OK.

274
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,760
Childe Ning, how about going back after having lunch?

275
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,080
Will your matter be delayed?

276
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,590
No need.

277
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,550
I specially came to ask about something,

278
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,590
and then I'll go back.

279
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,910
Ask about something?

280
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,280
What's it?

281
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,400
He wondered

282
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,150
why I suddenly came back.

283
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,880
Yes.

284
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,150
Childe Ning, don't worry.

285
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,640
Even if our engagement can't stop Lu Yunqi,

286
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,280
we aren't afraid of him.

287
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,760
Yes,

288
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,030
we aren't afraid of him.

289
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,880
And 

290
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,000
we still need to go back to the capital city.

291
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,790
Shall we go back to

292
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,230
the capital city together some days later?

293
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,230
You want to do me justice?

294
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
Now that he doesn't give up,

295
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,030
we don't need to wrong ourselves.

296
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,080
Childe Ning,

297
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,640
can you return to the capital city some days later?

298
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,880
Your mother is still ill.

299
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,710
If you leave in a hurry,

300
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,960
will you 

301
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,670
be accused of impiety

302
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
by the censor?

303
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,880
I don't know it.

304
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,110
I'm just talking nonsense.

305
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,790
Chengyu's words make sense.

306
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,840
After all,

307
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,550
your time for coming to see parents is still long.

308
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,320
If you return to the capital city,

309
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,590
I'm afraid others will take it as a handle against you.

310
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,760
And now

311
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,000
we're on a boat.

312
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,910
We've become the enemies of many people.

313
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm sorry to implicate you.

314
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:10,960
Miss Jun…

315
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,790
If you want to return to the capital city early,

316
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,230
you should

317
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,670
relieve your mother's worries first.

318
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,550
I think,

319
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,030
I think we should cancel our engagement

320
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,710
as soon as possible,

321
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,880
which will be good for you.

322
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,150
It will

323
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,320
be worse.

324
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,670
My mother is ill.

325
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,520
If we cancel our engagement now,

326
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm afraid others will think that I'm unfilial,

327
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,470
and,

328
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,110
and our family

329
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
is perfidious.

330
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,670
After all,

331
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,520
our family still

332
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,590
gets your favor.

333
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm sorry to keep troubling you.

334
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
You helped me first,

335
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,710
so I should thank you.

336
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,670
Then I'm leaving.

337
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,710
Jiuling.

338
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,790
Chengyu.

339
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,790
I saw through you

340
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,110
just now.

341
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,840
I just dislike him

342
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,960
for your previous suffering in the Ning's mansion.

343
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,030
Forget it.

344
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,350
Moreover,

345
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,230
in terms of the engagement,

346
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,320
Childe Ning helped me.

347
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,790
You shouldn't have done it.

348
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,000
I see.

349
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,400
I won't do so again.

350
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,230
Go on enjoying it.

351
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,670
OK.

352
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,350
Come on.

353
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,440
Here you are.

354
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,470
Eat more.

355
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,000
Your Lordship,

356
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,880
you mean

357
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,350
Young Master Fang dislikes you?

358
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,550
It's

359
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,550
obvious.

360
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,760
He has no reason to like me.

361
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,710
Because of the canceled engagement?

362
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,840
It happened a long time ago.

363
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,230
He still bears a grudge for it?

364
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,760
No.

365
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,080
So why?

366
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,080
Because

367
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,790
Young Master Fang also likes her.

368
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,280
It's not as simple as you think.

369
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,960
Miss Jun

370
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,840
and the Fang family don't agree,

371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,760
and 

372
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,550
my mom once 

373
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,030
annoyed Senior Madame Fang.

374
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,200
You're right.

375
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,200
How about this?

376
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,230
You invite Miss Jun and her families

377
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,470
to have a talk.

378
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,110
I'll go with you by then.

379
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,470
Father,

380
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,710
we can't do so.

381
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Why not?

382
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,790
You're engaged to Miss Jun,

383
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,030
so it's reasonable for us to get together for a meal and talk.

384
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll write to inform them.

385
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,710
It's scheduled for

386
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,110
tomorrow noon and Shunde Teahouse.

387
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,200
Father.

388
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I've decided it.

389
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,590
Jiuling.

390
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,840
Jiuling,

391
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,520
here is a letter to you.

392
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,470
A letter to me?

393
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,000
It's a letter from Jinxiu.

394
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Zhu Zan went out of the imperial prison

395
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
and is pondering upon his fault in the Pasturage Department.

396
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,110
Lu Yunqi didn't break his promise.

397
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,000
What's up?

398
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
Did anything happen in the capital city?

399
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,110
Not the capital city.

400
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,470
In the southwestern Hebei,

401
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,280
a dozen kids died from vaccination.

402
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,350
And 

403
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,280
Beiqi has sent additional troops to the border.

404
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,520
How many invaders are there?

405
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,430
Tens of thousands of soldiers and horses.

406
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,310
They're Beiqi's cavalries.

407
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,710
Then it's not an intrusion from skirmishers

408
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,229
but troops' expedition instead.

409
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
The North

410
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,400
remains stable for less than 10 years.

411
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,040
I hope Lord Cheng can overcome it.

412
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,760
Chengyu,

413
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm going to the southwestern Hebei.

414
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,640
Go to the…

415
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
Are you mad?

416
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,310
Jiuling,

417
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,110
Beiqi is not far from there.

418
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,070
It's very dangerous.

419
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,760
Now Lord Cheng leads the troops to resist the foreigners' invasion.

420
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,680
His attention can't be diverted

421
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,110
by the vaccination now.

422
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,560
Was there anything wrong

423
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,430
with the vaccinators?

424
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,070
I don't know.

425
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,640
So I must go to find it out.

426
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,640
OK.

427
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,560
I'll make preparations for you.

428
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,400
The North is not safe now.

429
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,880
I'll arrange more manpower for you.

430
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,710
OK.

431
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,800
Your Ladyship.

432
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,310
Young Master.

433
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,350
Senior Madame asked you to see her.

434
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,710
The letter from the Ning's mansion says that

435
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,400
they want to discuss the marriage in Shunde Teahouse tomorrow.

436
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,560
Discuss the marriage?

437
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,640
Yuxiu.

438
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,070
Are you tired?

439
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,590
I've brought you

440
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,040
your favorite pastries.

441
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,470
I'm not tired.

442
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,560
Don't worry.

443
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,400
How do you still stay here?

444
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,880
Do you know where she is?

445
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,040
I know it.

446
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,160
Shunde Teahouse.

447
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,640
Every day,

448
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,190
you always follow her.

449
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,760
Today,

450
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,110
grandma and mother both went there,

451
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,760
but you didn't.

452
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,350
They just wrote to

453
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,070
invite grandma,

454
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,190
mother and Jiuling.

455
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,590
I don't

456
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,430
have the cheek to go there.

457
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,920
Would you like to go?

458
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,880
Yes.

459
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,230
Of course I'd like to go.

460
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,160
Actually,

461
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,680
I really want to go.

462
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,560
In fact, as long as you said you wanted to go,

463
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,470
Jiuling would agree.

464
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,350
However,

465
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,950
if you go on pretending to be a good cousin,

466
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,040
you'll be always just a cousin.

467
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,950
But if not,

468
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,640
I'm afraid

469
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,470
I can't even get close to her.

470
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,280
The guests are coming.

471
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,110
Senior Madame,

472
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,560
it's really my honor that

473
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,190
you can come as agreed.

474
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,350
It's a surprise

475
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,000
to receive your invitation.

476
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,280
It's really hard

477
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,400
to see you.

478
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,590
It's pity that

479
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,710
I didn't see you last year.

480
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,160
I'm sorry

481
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,950
for my wife's impoliteness

482
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,800
and inhospitality.

483
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,880
Today she has a typhoid fever,

484
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,280
so she can't come out.

485
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,110
Please forgive her

486
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,070
for her inhospitality.

487
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,560
Childe Ning is the favorite son of your wife.

488
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,640
So I can understand her.

489
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,710
Isn't Childe Ning here?

490
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,800
As his father,

491
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,950
I should ask

492
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,190
about something clearly

493
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,880
for him

494
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,710
before he comes.

495
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,070
Do you agree with me?

496
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,590
I also think so.

497
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,350
Then,

498
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,110
don't stand on ceremony.

499
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,310
Let's go in

500
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,560
to have a seat and talk.

501
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,350
Please.

502
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,920
Today your father sees my grandma

503
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,280
for our engagement?

504
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,920
Yes.

505
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,560
It's good.

506
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,800
They have their own ideas.

507
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,230
If they can take this opportunity to clear up the misunderstanding,

508
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,680
it'll be good.

509
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,430
It is

510
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,920
our engagement.

511
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
We should

512
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
deal with it personally.

513
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,520
In fact, today I ask you out

514
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,520
for something else.

515
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,040
What is it?

516
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,710
Say goodbye to you.

517
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,590
Say goodbye?

518
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,800
Senior Madame, please.

519
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,830
Madame, please.

520
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,230
Then,

521
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,710
I'll

522
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
come to the point.

523
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,430
Before Yunzhao returns to the capital city,

524
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,350
let's confirm

525
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,800
their marriage as soon as possible.

526
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,230
What do you think about it?

527
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,470
The time is not yet ripe.

528
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,920
What if others think

529
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,400
it's true?

530
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,680
Whether it's true

531
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,430
depends on us.

532
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,800
You're here to say goodbye to me,

533
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,640
so you must not

534
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,110
go to the capital city.

535
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,070
I'm going to the North.

536
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,280
Do you know Beiqi has sent additional troops?

537
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:02,920
I don't know.

538
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,110
Why have they suddenly sent troops?

539
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,920
A battle is inevitable.

540
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,830
And 

541
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,680
there is something wrong with the vaccines of the southwestern Hebei.

542
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,110
It seems that this world

543
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,830
will be chaotic again.

544
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,280
So tomorrow I'll go north

545
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,520
to find out the matter about vaccines.

546
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,830
I must prevent

547
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,000
the smallpox outbreak in the rear.

548
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,160
Only when the people are not attacked by the smallpox

549
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,190
can the morale of the troops be stable

550
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,110
and the country be in peace.

551
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,190
Your journey will be full of setbacks,

552
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,000
but you still dare to move forward.

553
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Let me toast your concern for the country

554
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,640
and the people and wish you a good journey

555
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,310
with this cup of tea.

556
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,760
Jiuling now is promoted to County Princess Shanyang

557
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,110
by His Majesty.

558
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,280
I'm her grandma,

559
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,920
but it's still inappropriate for me

560
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,160
to make a decision.

561
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,430
Our family is a scholarly family,

562
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,400
and Yunzhao

563
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,040
becomes the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam.

564
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,430
They're really

565
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,640
perfectly matched.

566
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,640
Yunzhao stands out as the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam,

567
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,160
but mutual love

568
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,880
is also required in a marriage.

569
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,470
Miss Jun and Yunzhao

570
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,040
had many contacts in the capital city.

571
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,040
So 

572
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,590
they must like each other.

573
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,560
As far as I am concerned,

574
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,040
Childe Ning indeed

575
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,230
likes Jiuling,

576
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,830
but Jiuling

577
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,800
doesn't like him.

578
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,950
She said

579
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,830
their engagement had been canceled,

580
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,070
so she has put it down completely.

581
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,190
Well,

582
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,800
Yunzhao didn't know that their engagement

583
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,310
had been canceled,

584
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
but today 

585
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,110
Yunzhao 

586
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,310
has told me his thought.

587
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,560
Senior Madame, I'm telling the truth.

588
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,470
To be honest,

589
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,470
the engagement…

590
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,590
Let's not

591
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,190
talk about the engagement today.

592
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,680
Master,

593
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,190
today is an important day.

594
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,920
How can I be absent?

595
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,190
Senior Madame,

596
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,000
long time no see.

597
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,430
You look much better than

598
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,430
you were in our mansion.

599
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,160
But you look

600
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,760
much paler

601
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,070
than you were last time.

602
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Does anything bother you?

603
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,560
Many matters bother me.

604
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,800
I heard that someone renamed herself to seduce Yunzhao

605
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,590
after he became the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam.

606
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,640
I'm afraid Mrs. Ning is not only bothered

607
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,040
by this.

608
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,880
Your family spends a lot of money

609
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,230
in booking Shunde Teahouse.

610
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,710
Do you know it?

611
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,190
Honey.

612
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
Of course.

613
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,110
So 

614
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,560
I come to speak for Yunzhao.

615
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,830
Senior Madame,

616
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,040
won't you drive me away?

617
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,470
Of course I welcome you.

618
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,430
You come to speak for Childe Ning

619
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,800
or laugh at us?

620
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,640
As a saying goes,

621
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,710
every dog has his day.

622
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,470
I'm afraid

623
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,950
you'll ask for an insult today.

624
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,470
You're straightforward.

625
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,800
But don't draw

626
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,680
a conclusion early.

627
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,950
I didn't want to

628
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,190
say something,

629
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,310
but today

630
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,920
I must tell you.

631
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,310
When Jiuling was a nobody,

632
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,920
your family kept away from her.

633
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,280
Now Jiuling is famous all over the world,

634
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,680
but Childe Ning always

635
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
comes to see her.

636
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,160
Only saints can stick to

637
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,400
their conscience.

638
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,430
What are you

639
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,880
going to do in the future?

640
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,310
When my mother recovers,

641
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
I'll return to the capital city.

642
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,800
Now you're the No. 1 Scholar in the imperial exam,

643
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,560
and your uncle is the Ceremonial Master,

644
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,070
so you must be very promising after returning to the capital city.

645
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,880
I'm afraid it's not so simple.

646
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,350
I thought

647
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,760
it's joyful

648
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,070
to be an official,

649
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,520
but now it seems 

650
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,560
very hard to protect myself

651
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,070
in the court.

652
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,470
You haven't become an official,

653
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,310
but why do you sigh for it?

654
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,190
After studying hard for a decade,

655
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,280
I will have to concentrate on making profits.

656
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,280
It's really disappointing.

657
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,710
In my opinion,

658
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,560
officials should serve the people

659
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,280
from the heart.

660
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,350
Only after keeping a foothold

661
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,760
can you make contributions,

662
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,470
and there is no need to care too much about the process.

663
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,680
Sometimes the indirect approach

664
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,710
is the best policy.

665
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,640
Jiuling,

666
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,000
if you were a man,

667
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,280
you would be a trustworthy minister

668
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,800
whose name will go down in history.

669
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,350
But 

670
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,230
you have become famous,

671
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,230
and you'll be praised by later generations

672
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,760
by virtue of the vaccination.

673
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm flattered.

674
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,830
Miss Jun is otherworldly.

675
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,710
So 

676
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,430
Commander Lu came into conflict with His Lordship Zhu

677
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,560
for her in the street.

678
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,680
Men usually don't come into conflict

679
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,950
for a common woman in the street.

680
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,920
So shameless.

681
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,640
Shut up!

682
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,430
-Master Ning, don't be angry. -Senior Madame.

683
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,070
Your wife is energetic,

684
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,000
so she must recover.

685
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,760
You should be happy.

686
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,710
Thank you for your invitation,

687
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,590
but our two families won't be united by marriage.

688
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,760
Jiuling is my granddaughter,

689
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,470
and I love her very much.

690
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I can't tolerate that she will be wronged.

691
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,560
If she marries a good husband

692
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,160
but has

693
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,350
a domineering mother-in-law,

694
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,280
how can I explain

695
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,710
to her dead parents?

696
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,800
No need to explain it.

697
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,040
Even if Miss Jun

698
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,800
personally comes to ask for the marriage,

699
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,560
I won't agree to it.

700
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,590
Yunzhao is not sophisticated,

701
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,710
so he can't see through many matters.

702
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,110
As her mother,

703
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,950
I should see through them for him.

704
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,400
Has Mrs. Ning done it?

705
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,680
Back then,

706
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,160
Jiuling asked for 5,000 taels of silver to cancel the engagement.

707
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,430
It shows that

708
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,040
we abandoned your family,

709
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,400
but I couldn't refuse Master Ning's kindness,

710
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,110
so I'm here.

711
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,640
Now that Mrs. Ning has such an attitude,

712
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,560
we don't acknowledge the engagement,

713
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,640
and Jiuling won't absolutely marry beneath her.

714
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,760
Marry beneath her?

715
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,190
Our family has produced officials for several generations.

716
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,160
If Yunzhao is really engaged to a woman from the merchant family,

717
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,950
it'll be a big joke.

718
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,230
For several generations?

719
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,350
Mrs. Ning knows it

720
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,680
better than I do.

721
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,680
You…

722
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,230
It seems that Mrs. Ning doesn't have a typhoid fever

723
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,520
but is hot-tempered instead.

724
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,560
This is excellent green tea,

725
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,560
and your husband has paid for it.

726
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,070
Mrs. Ning, don't waste it.

727
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,040
See you.

728
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,830
Senior Madame.

729
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,350
Senior Madame.

730
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,920
Childe Ning,

731
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,590
what do you want to say?

732
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,280
I want to ask you

733
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,430
a same question.

734
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,160
We always meet some people

735
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,230
and then part from them

736
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,040
when we move forward

737
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,800
in life.

738
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
I'm always alone

739
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,350
in my life.

740
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,710
I thought

741
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,830
I would

742
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,680
die alone.

743
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,110
But, unexpectedly,

744
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,760
I met you

745
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,950
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

746
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,040
Unconsciously,

747
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,400
I found that I really like you

748
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,350
and it's harder for me to control myself.

749
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,000
Jiuling.

750
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,710
Childe Ning,

751
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,040
please don't say so.

752
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,310
In the world,

753
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
I have few confidants

754
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,470
but you're one.

755
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,760
I know

756
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,190
you've helped me a lot,

757
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,190
and I also know your love.

758
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:50,950
But 

759
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,430
I can only

760
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,430
refuse you.

761
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,190
I'm sorry.

762
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,710
Should I say some harsher words?

763
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,710
I should

764
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,950
refuse you cruelly

765
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,350
to make you give up,

766
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,920
which is really good for you.

767
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,920
No need.

768
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,430
I'm not

769
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,920
a stubborn man

770
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,800
and won't give myself up as hopeless.

771
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,110
Moreover,

772
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,520
the love for someone

773
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,070
is a gift from God

774
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,520
but not pain.

775
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,160
Miss Jun, you can be relieved.

776
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,950
Childe Ning,

777
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,230
I'm sorry.

778
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,590
Love

779
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,880
is unexplainable.

780
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,590
But I'm

781
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,160
much luckier.

782
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,560
Jiuling,

783
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,310
I wish I can have a chance

784
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,920
to do some things with you.

785
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,760
It's better than let you move forward alone.

786
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,430
It's enough

787
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,350
to have such a confidant as you

788
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,950
in my life.

789
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,710
Remember to take good care of yourself.

790
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,800
Take care.

791
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,710
We will

792
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,040
meet again,

793
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,680
but you can't forget me.

794
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,760
Send additional troops here?

795
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,640
It means that Beiqi is preparing for a battle.

796
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,110
Come on.

797
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,280
Lord Cheng

798
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,920
will defeat them.

799
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,520
If the late emperor were still alive,

800
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,430
he would absolutely resist and never yield an inch of territory.

801
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,760
But His Majesty is different.

802
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,310
He is mortally afraid of death

803
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,160
and cherishes his life very much.

804
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,400
If Huang Cheng advises him,

805
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,950
I'm afraid they will make peace.

806
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,350
I'm going to see His Majesty.

807
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,830
If I can't persuade him,

808
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,350
I'll go back to the North.

809
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,280
Your marriage

810
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,000
is also related to our family's future.

811
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,000
But now

812
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,520
a good marriage has been

813
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,760
completely destroyed by your mother.

814
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,110
We two families are in an embarrassing situation.

815
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,520
So it's impossible for you

816
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,950
to marry Miss Jun.

817
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,560
It's not only my mother's fault.

818
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,310
If Miss Jun doesn't like me,

819
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,230
I won't be able

820
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,470
to marry her, either.

821
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,950
Even if you can't marry her,

822
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,160
you can also become old friends

823
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,520
and help each other

824
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,560
in the capital city in the future.

825
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,470
Father, forget it.

826
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,230
I've felt relieved.

827
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,110
Even if you've

828
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,640
studied hard for a dozen years,

829
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,560
you're not a pedantic scholar.

830
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,350
Then I can be relieved when seeing you 

831
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,350
take your ups and downs

832
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,430
in the future officialdom lightly.

833
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,760
Here you are, Jiuling.

834
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,230
Take my tent with you.

835
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,710
You can use it outdoors.

836
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:52,880
OK.

837
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,760
Why not go with a chef?

838
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,710
After all, enjoying yourself

839
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,110
won't delay your journey.

840
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,920
I go to solve the problem

841
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,230
but not to have a trip.

842
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,800
How about going with me?

843
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,310
Then I can

844
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,640
talk with you all the way.

845
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,590
I can also talk with Her Ladyship.

846
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,070
I'm better at pleasing Jiuling than you are.

847
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,430
Moreover,

848
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,350
you're not as good-looking as me.

849
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,310
When it comes to the appearance,

850
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,520
Childe Ning and His Lordship Zhu

851
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,350
are both good-looking,

852
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
and even His Excellency Lu

853
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,590
who always found fault with our lady

854
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,830
is also good-looking.

855
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,470
Stop.

856
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,520
Don't talk nonsense.

857
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Clean up the desk for me.

858
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,070
Jiuling,

859
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,760
what did you say to Childe Ning?

860
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,190
Little cousin, you don't need to ask about it.

861
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,190
Why do you still treat me as a child?

862
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,560
In my eyes,

863
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,920
you're always a child.

864
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,070
Why do your words sound strange today?

865
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,040
After you leave,

866
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,669
I don't know when I'll see you again.

867
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,280
Jiuling,

868
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:15,709
after reaching the North,

869
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:16,949
if you have any difficulties,

870
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,869
just go to the local Deshengchang.

871
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,149
If you need anything,

872
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,229
you can write to me,

873
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,670
and I'll arrange everything

874
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,470
for you.

875
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,710
OK.

876
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,040
Vegetables.

877
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,760
Fresh vegetables.

878
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,840
Mr. Lei.

879
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,910
Miss Jun,

880
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,710
you lied to me.

881
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
But I'm

882
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,040
grateful to you.

883
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,950
Forget it.

884
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,390
That's what we should do.

885
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,710
Chengyu said that

886
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,080
he had dispatched a reliable man.

887
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,520
It's actually you.

888
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,040
Thank Mr. Fang for thinking highly of me.

889
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,840
We won't make trouble for you.

890
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,360
Time flew in the past year.

891
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,760
How is your escort agency now?

892
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,360
Not bad.

893
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,470
Do you find that

894
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,430
our current escort formation

895
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,000
is the one

896
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,910
taught by Mr. Ling back then?

897
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,600
He didn't stay with us for long,

898
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,390
but he taught us a useful way.

899
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,150
This year

900
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,520
we even survived from a great crisis

901
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,390
in this way.

902
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,670
That's good.

903
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,840
His way 

904
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,080
was learnt from the dangerous battlefield.

905
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,080
Of course it's useful.

906
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,470
He should know that

907
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,760
the North is not stable.

908
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,630
He must be anxious to return.

909
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,910
She has left.

910
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,320
Let's go back.

911
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,760
I really envy Liu'er.

912
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,320
Everyone envies her.

913
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,600
She enjoys herself

914
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,230
and can laugh or scold at will.

915
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,120
She can bully others,

916
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,670
but nobody can bully her.

917
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,430
Even if she does something wrong,

918
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,520
Jiuling will also make it up for her.

919
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,950
Did you tell her that

920
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,630
you like her last night?

921
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,320
No.

922
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,630
I guess it.

923
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,120
You're afraid of knowing the answer?

924
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,320
I'm contented enough that

925
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,710
I can write to

926
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,230
and talk to her

927
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,840
and act as her cousin all my life.

928
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,670
However,

929
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,150
if I ask her,

930
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
maybe I won't

931
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,230
be so lucky anymore.

932
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,600
Master!

933
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,430
Master!

934
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,080
It's true.

935
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,040
There is really something wrong with the vaccines?

936
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,080
The news is concealed,

937
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,360
but I heard that

938
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,320
a dozen kids are dead,

939
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,560
and the families of those kids

940
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,280
are going to the capital city to accuse Miss Jun of it.

941
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,080
How can such an event

942
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,190
be concealed

943
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,670
and not reported to the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

944
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,390
Yeah.

945
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,230
Dr. Feng

946
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,280
needs to draw a conclusion

947
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,080
after investigations.

948
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,520
Of course he conceals it.

949
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,470
He has benefited

950
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,190
from the vaccination.

951
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,280
But the families of the dead kids

952
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,800
are really poor.

953
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,840
As doctors who cure diseases and save patients,

954
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,760
we should speak for these poor people.

955
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,320
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

956
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,760
what are you going to?

957
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,320
It's our duty 

958
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
to share the cares and burdens of His Majesty

959
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,000
and benefit the people.

960
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,520
Even if she is popular,

961
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,710
we can't let

962
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,950
such killings occur.

963
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,910
I see.

964
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,520
Your Excellency,

965
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
please speak for us in the court tomorrow.

966
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,230
See you.

967
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,910
Imperial Doctor Jiang.

968
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,670
I want you to do me a favor.

969
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,230
Confess or not?

970
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,150
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

971
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,190
thank you.

972
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,430
Please.

973
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,950
His Excellency ordered you

974
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
to teach him a good lesson.

975
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,840
-OK. -Why do you lock the door? Open the door!

976
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,150
Master!

977
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,840
Lu Yunqi!

978
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,470
What do you want to do?

979
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,600
How dare you put me into the prison

980
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,630
without permission!

981
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,190
Aren't you afraid of being punished by His Majesty?

982
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,670
Imperial Doctor Jiang,

983
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,760
don't waste your energy.
