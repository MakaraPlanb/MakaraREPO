1
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,540
Episode 4

17
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,700
Deshengchang

18
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,580
Manager of Deshengchang Song Yunping

19
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,150
Capital of Tianyou

20
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:43,390
Mansion of Prince Huai

21
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,670
Son of Zhizong Chu Jiurong

22
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,670
Eldest Daughter of Zhizong Chu Jiuli

23
00:24:04,750 --> 00:02:10,600
Book for Supervisor of Rites  Sealed

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,230
Mother,

25
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,990
Chengyu has a better appetite

26
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,320
than usual today.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,110
He had more a half bowl of congee for breakfast.

28
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,520
The medicinal herbs

29
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,750
work?

30
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,480
A dose of medicinal herbs is decocted

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,000
by the prescription from Zhenzhen every day.

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Yesterday, she also gave an acupuncture treatment.

33
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,480
Zhenzhen is really serious

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,510
about Chengyu's disease.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,400
Yes.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,510
I went to see it yesterday.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
She decocted the medicinal herbs

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,160
in the eastern kitchen.

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,030
She washed and decocted the herbs

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,270
in person.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
She is

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,110
an earnest girl.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
Yes, exactly.

44
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,590
Chengyu had more half a bowl of congee.

45
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,000
He hadn't had

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,160
such a good appetite for days.

47
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,480
That's a great merit

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
in our Fang family.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,750
I thought

50
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,590
Zhenzhen exaggerated

51
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,110
her medical skills.

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,880
Now it seems

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,680
she's really capable.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520
Chengyu

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,720
is lucky and will get much better.

56
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,880
Zhenzhen.

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,790
Grandma.

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,270
Aunt.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,790
Zhenzhen,

60
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,760
we were talking about you.

61
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,760
Sit.

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,270
Zhenzhen,

63
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,590
your grandma and I know

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
what you did for Chengyu behind us.

65
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,830
I'm really grateful to you.

66
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,270
We're family.

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,510
That's what I should do.

68
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,400
What do you come here for?

69
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,680
Well.

70
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,680
Chengyu has got better,

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,470
but we should not be overhasty,

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,150
or his body could not bear it.

73
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,950
You don't need to

74
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,360
report such things to me in the future.

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,720
Just do as you think.

76
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,720
Thank you, grandma.

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,470
This line is about

78
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,440
expenses

79
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,120
or classification of goods purchased.

80
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,870
Below it is the price breakdown.

81
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,830
The daily turnover

82
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,190
and monthly earnings

83
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,950
are here.

84
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,080
So it is

85
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,550
this one?

86
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,550
Zhenzhen,

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,870
you know account books.

88
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,080
I learned from my father before,

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,800
so I know a little.

90
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,040
And,

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,510
you taught me carefully,

92
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,910
so I can learn faster.

93
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,590
It owes to your smartness.

94
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,720
I did not help much actually.

95
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,240
You may do your own things.

96
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,030
I'll go on reading it.

97
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,030
If I have any doubts,

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,030
I will turn to you.

99
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

100
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,000
Zhenzhen,

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,360
do you have any doubts?

102
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm slow-witted.

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,310
I have a question.

104
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,310
What is your puzzle?

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,550
Let me see.

106
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,520
Look here.

107
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,310
This column is just about

108
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,670
the expenses arising from horse purchase.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,550
It's so easy.

110
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,240
Why don't you understand?

111
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,360
It's not the total amount.

112
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,270
Here.

113
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,720
I guess you only

114
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,910
checked the total amount

115
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,160
but did not verify

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,640
the details under each income and expense.

117
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,110
Right?

118
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,440
Yes.

119
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,750
Zhenzhen,

120
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,520
is there anything abnormal?

121
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,240
These petty receipts

122
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,880
are usually calculated by

123
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,310
veterans of Deshengchang.

124
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,470
You can't make groundless guesses.

125
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,470
It seems

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,600
Yuxiu has found something is wrong.

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,160
Let me check.

128
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,520
As far as I know,

129
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,670
the average price in the horse market

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,960
is about 70 to 80 taels.

131
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,110
It's 150 taels at most.

132
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
The prices I said do not cover

133
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,270
royal bred ferghana horses.

134
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,310
But, I don't know who purchased horses

135
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,160
and where he purchased them

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,150
for Deshengchang.

137
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
Each horse was purchased

138
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,590
at a high price of 200 taels.

139
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,080
That's terrible!

140
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,990
They have worked for Deshengchang for decades,

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,310
but they are ungrateful and

142
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,640
did such dirty things under the table.

143
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,080
I will report to grandma and ask her

144
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,280
to drive them away.

145
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,870
Jinxiu, wait.

146
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,870
Take it easy.

147
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,990
You take it easy

148
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,990
as it's not money of the Jun family.

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
Only the difference in expense for horse purchase

150
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,470
amounts to nearly 1,000 taels.

151
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,190
There must be other abnormal amount.

152
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,080
We must tell grandma as early as possible

153
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,400
and punish them!

154
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,430
Jinxiu,

155
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,640
calm down.

156
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,280
Let's hear Zhenzhen out.

157
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,750
Zhenzhen,

158
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,990
go ahead.

159
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,030
Does the person in the dark in the Fang family

160
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,800
stretch his hand to Deshengchang?

161
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Now we have found the problem

162
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,680
in only one Deshengchang branch.

163
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,840
What if other branches

164
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,960
have the same problem?

165
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,680
We should investigate them together.

166
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,190
If so, the snake will be alerted.

167
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,990
In my opinion,

168
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,190
we may collect the account books

169
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,910
of all Deshengchang branches

170
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,030
by the chance of this audit.

171
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,150
In this case, the message will not be leaked out in advance,

172
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,470
so that they won't have the chance to

173
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,680
change the account books.

174
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,150
And,

175
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,750
there might be problems in the account books

176
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,080
and shipping records in previous years.

177
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,280
It's best to collect all account books and records

178
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,430
since Deshengchang's establishment

179
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,310
for thorough checks.

180
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,870
The account books more than 10 or even 20 years ago

181
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,080
are too old.

182
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,240
Is that necessary?

183
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,960
Yes.

184
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,400
Honesty

185
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,030
is the foundation for a long-lasting business.

186
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,030
In this way,

187
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,960
we can find out the moth

188
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,870
in Deshengchang these years

189
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
and promote

190
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,030
those of hard work and good faith.

191
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,120
That's a great idea.

192
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
It'll kill two birds with one stone

193
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,400
and mete out the proper awards and punishments.

194
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,430
Remind Madame Su

195
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,190
to guard against Jun Zhenzhen.

196
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,080
She may have designs on the wealth of the Fang family.

197
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:25,990
Got it.

198
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,869
I'm leaving.

199
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,030
It's for you.

200
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,680
Only kids play such things.

201
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,560
I don't want it.

202
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,430
I brought it back for you specially.

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,150
And I played it in my childhood.

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,910
My sisters

205
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,360
often bought me such things before.

206
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,800
They don't have time

207
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,470
for me now.

208
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,240
Even they don't have time for me anymore,

209
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,470
let alone others.

210
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,190
Jiurong.

211
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,190
Sister,

212
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,710
I miss you so much.

213
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,680
I miss you too.

214
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,470
Several days ago, I dreamt that

215
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,310
you bought me delicious foods

216
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,150
and told me many stories.

217
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,280
Really?

218
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,960
Yes.

219
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,840
I really have bought you

220
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,750
something delicious.

221
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,280
I'll show you.

222
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,310
Really?

223
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,430
You're so good to me.

224
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,430
Enjoy it.

225
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,520
Thank you, sister.

226
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,030
You enjoy it first.

227
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,080
I bought it for you.

228
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,590
I also brought you

229
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,710
many interesting stories.

230
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,240
You've grown taller.

231
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,470
Maybe they think

232
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,430
you are an adult

233
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,710
and you don't need it.

234
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,640
They don't bring it back so you would not get angry.

235
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,910
Only you are not afraid of making me angry.

236
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,990
I often

237
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,960
make you angry.

238
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,080
What are you doing?

239
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,750
Do you feel anything here?

240
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:30,800
Stop!

241
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,240
Do you feel anything here?

242
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,870
No.

243
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,350
I'm a doctor,

244
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,310
and your cousin.

245
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,870
You are my cousin,

246
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,280
but you still need to keep a distance from me.

247
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,480
What are you looking at?

248
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,040
It seems it's the first time

249
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,230
you said I'm your cousin.

250
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,870
Have a rest.

251
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,600
I will come to decoct medicinal herbs for you later.

252
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,310
Acupuncture and tonic food

253
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,920
are basic therapy.

254
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,430
To completely cure Chengyu's disease,

255
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,670
I must prepare a medicine bath for him as early as possible.

256
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,190
Now

257
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,110
there is a person in the dark in the Fang family.

258
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,920
The treatment for Chengyu

259
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,160
must avoid the notice of others

260
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,920
so as not to alert the snake.

261
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,430
My greetings to Madame Su.

262
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,790
Zhenzhen,

263
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,080
you just went to

264
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,400
see Chengyu?

265
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,280
Yes.

266
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,720
Due to the change of seasons,

267
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,160
he is weak.

268
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,520
So I prepared

269
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,600
some medicated food for him

270
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,550
to avoid catching cold.

271
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,110
Good girl.

272
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,960
You're really caring.

273
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,520
What are you going to do?

274
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,430
We think alike.

275
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,190
Chengyu is weak since childhood.

276
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,400
He can't sleep well

277
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,310
or eat much.

278
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,110
I prepared some tonic soup for him

279
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,990
to build up health.

280
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,790
I see.

281
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,080
You care about him too.

282
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,840
Yes.

283
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,790
It can't be delayed.

284
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,790
I came across

285
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,750
Madame Su just now.

286
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Did she go to send tonic soup to Chengyu?

287
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,920
Does she always do that?

288
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
Not every day.

289
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,190
Every several days.

290
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
You think it's her?

291
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,870
I saw the tonic soup she sent to Chengyu

292
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,110
and did not find any problem,

293
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,550
but

294
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,430
I just feel

295
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,640
something is wrong.

296
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,310
Zhenzhen,

297
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,400
you are wrong this time.

298
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,230
Madame Su has a soft temper

299
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,080
and she will not be the one in the dark.

300
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,110
Besides, I checked her tonic soup,

301
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,080
and did not find anything wrong.

302
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,790
What if she goes to check Chengyu's disease

303
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,600
by the excuse of sending soup?

304
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,310
I will send someone to keep an eye on her.

305
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,960
If it is really her,

306
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,990
I will not show mercy.

307
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,520
Grandma,

308
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,600
we'd better not

309
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,870
alert the snake.

310
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,600
I plan to give the fake message that

311
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
Chengyu cannot get better

312
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,310
by the marriage.

313
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,480
In this case,

314
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,350
they will think the marriage

315
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,640
is for helping Chengyu recover

316
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,840
so that the person in the dark will loose guard.

317
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,670
And

318
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,600
it will help me cure Chengyu's disease.

319
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,670
Chengyu is getting better now.

320
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,550
The next step is

321
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,640
to expel toxin via bath.

322
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,960
But,

323
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,720
Chengyu is particularly serious about

324
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,960
the boundary between men and women.

325
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm afraid

326
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
he would not cooperate

327
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,960
if we were not a married couple.

328
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,480
Between the sexes there should be a prudent reserve.

329
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,280
Zhenzhen's worries are reasonable.

330
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,430
Even if it's a fake marriage,

331
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,790
after truth is exposed in the future,

332
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,960
your reputation

333
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,190
will be affected.

334
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,080
Grandma,

335
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,400
Chengyu's life

336
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,480
is more important than anything else.

337
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,160
I need to cure his disease as early as possible.

338
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,480
As for the rest,

339
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,160
I don't care.

340
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,870
Zhenzhen,

341
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,600
have you really made up your mind?

342
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm sorry to make you go through all this.

343
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,720
Zhenzhen,

344
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,280
if you can save Chengyu's life

345
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,280
to protect the descendant of the Fang family,

346
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,720
you can use the property

347
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,040
of the Fang family as you like.

348
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,840
Grandma,

349
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,720
it is improper.

350
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,870
It is proper.

351
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,350
You treat the Fang family sincerely,

352
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,480
and the Fang family

353
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,960
will do the same to you.

354
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,990
That's completely fair.

355
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,840
I am also a granddaughter

356
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,750
of the Fang family now.

357
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,670
I have to protect the Fang family

358
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,080
with all my strength.

359
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,960
Sister,

360
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,520
Jiurong,

361
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,550
you must be safe

362
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,080
and wait for me to come back.

363
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,840
Sister.

364
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,750
The paper boat you fold

365
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,430
is really vivid.

366
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,790
Sister,

367
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,670
can she see it?

368
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,720
Yes.

369
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,350
Of course she can.

370
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,790
When she taught me

371
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,310
to fold paper boat,

372
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,400
she said if I kept thinking someone's name

373
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,080
while folding a paper boat,

374
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,600
the person would know it.

375
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,160
It's a pity that

376
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,400
she couldn't teach me other things,

377
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,750
nor could she tell me stories anymore.

378
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,190
Jiurong,

379
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,599
let's fold more paper boats

380
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,790
and put them on the water.

381
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,640
She would see it.

382
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,480
Okay.

383
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,430
You're coughing.

384
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,840
You've been getting cold again these days?

385
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,550
My greetings to

386
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,040
Your Highness Princess

387
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,110
and Your Highness Prince Huai.

388
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,280
Sister,

389
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,870
I'm leaving.

390
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,190
Okay.

391
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,720
I will go later.

392
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,990
Lord Lu,

393
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,430
what do you come for today?

394
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,600
I have

395
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,640
requested His Majesty's order

396
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,990
to marry you.

397
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,280
His Majesty has agreed.

398
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,550
Okay.

399
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,160
I've had someone picked a lucky day.

400
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,400
It is June 18.

401
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,840
What do you

402
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,520
think?

403
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,550
June 18.

404
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,280
Jiuling's birthday.

405
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,550
It's absolutely a good day.

406
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,720
I will prepare

407
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,230
the wedding well.

408
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,310
I'm leaving.

409
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,040
It seems everything

410
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,160
is Chu Rang's arrangement.

411
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,790
Fine.

412
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,840
This is the only way

413
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,480
for me to protect Jiurong.

414
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,280
Zan.

415
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,400
Zan,

416
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,950
I've got a message from the Sky Pavilion.

417
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
They found the late emperor's personal maid Bing'er.

418
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,640
Arm Moral Department has been hunting her.

419
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,950
Luckily, we found her ahead of them and saved her.

420
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,870
She said

421
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,470
the late emperor's death

422
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,830
is not caused by an attack of old disease,

423
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,230
but related to Chu Rang and Lu Yunqi.

424
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,350
Bing'er said

425
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,830
at the night when the late emperor passed away,

426
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,350
she saw that Chu Rang

427
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,680
went into the Imperial Study secretly,

428
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,400
and that he seemed to have a fight with the late emperor.

429
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,040
That night,

430
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,710
Lu Yunqi was on guard,

431
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,350
but he did not mention it to anyone after that.

432
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,200
Soon after that,

433
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,640
the Imperial Academy of Medicine claimed that

434
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,640
the late emperor passed away for an attack of old disease.

435
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,830
But after the late emperor passed away,

436
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,830
Bing'er checked secretly

437
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,040
and saw strangling mark on his neck.

438
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,280
He killed his brother for the throne.

439
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,640
And…

440
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,750
And Bing'er said

441
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,160
she had told it to

442
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,400
Princess Jiuling.

443
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,280
By the way,

444
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,950
Zan,

445
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,040
Bing'er drew this pattern

446
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,590
based on memory.

447
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,990
She said

448
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,710
on the day when the late emperor passed away,

449
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,750
she saw he was frowning at this pattern.

450
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,680
Did Chu Rang kill the late emperor

451
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,830
for this pattern?

452
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,560
Mother,

453
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,070
will we really announce

454
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,950
the marriage between Chengyu and Zhenzhen tomorrow?

455
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,350
Shall we wait until Chengyu gets better?

456
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,950
Tomorrow is the day for discussion among

457
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,440
stewards and managers of all Deshengchang branches.

458
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,320
They will all gather.

459
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,710
So it's the best time.

460
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,590
The whole family, including the servants, has known it.

461
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,440
It will be spread.

462
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,710
Why?

463
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,470
Why?

464
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,520
Grandma,

465
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,160
mother,

466
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,750
why?

467
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,680
Jinxiu,

468
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,070
watch your mouth.

469
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,280
Yes.

470
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,440
I know

471
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,110
I shouldn't

472
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,280
shout at grandma,

473
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,680
but I just wonder

474
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,590
why.

475
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,160
Chengyu is 15 years old.

476
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,440
The doctor said he won't live to be 16,

477
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,640
so we arrange a wedding to help him recover.

478
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,990
Grandma,

479
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,230
you're smart.

480
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,830
You never believe that blindly.

481
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,040
Now, why...

482
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,350
Things have

483
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,200
changed.

484
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,990
As long as it can save Chengyu,

485
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,640
I'll do it

486
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,870
at any cost.

487
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,830
OK.

488
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,710
To say the least,

489
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
you try to help him recover by the wedding,

490
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,560
why don't you choose another girl

491
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,230
but Jun Zhenzhen?

492
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,470
She agrees,

493
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,710
so do I.

494
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,440
Grandma,

495
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,750
she agrees

496
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,920
because she wants to dominate the Fang family.

497
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,870
When she becomes Chengyu's wife,

498
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,520
she will be domineering.

499
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,920
I see why

500
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,920
she has been so interested in Deshengchang recently.

501
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,320
She didn't want to go there before,

502
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,640
but she often goes there now.

503
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,920
She even tried ways

504
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,520
to check the  account books and shipping records

505
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,350
of Deshengchang over the years.

506
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,160
I think

507
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,560
she made a plan to prepare

508
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,870
for taking over Deshengchang.

509
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,830
Jinxiu,

510
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,350
you think too much.

511
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,470
We just want to help Chengyu recover.

512
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,590
She just wants to occupy Deshengchang

513
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,560
and the Fang family.

514
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,800
She could never make it!

515
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,870
Their marriage

516
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,110
can get the two families closer

517
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,590
and help Chengyu recover.

518
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,750
No one is allowed to interfere.

519
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,320
Jinxiu,

520
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,830
apologize to grandma.

521
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,750
I'm not wrong.

522
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,830
Why should I apologize?

523
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,230
Mother, please don't be angry.

524
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,920
It's all my fault.

525
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,680
That's what others

526
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,830
think about the marriage.

527
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,470
In the end,

528
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,320
Zhenzhen make the greatest sacrifice.

529
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,320
We'll keep her help in mind

530
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,830
and make it up to her.

531
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
If this curse is an act of providence,

532
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,160
I'll try my best to break it

533
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,160
to protect the Fang family.

534
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,800
If it is man-made,

535
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,950
no matter how powerful he is,

536
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,990
I'll fight to the end

537
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,470
though I'm weak.

538
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,590
Who made you angry again?

539
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,400
Sit down.

540
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,920
Mom,

541
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,350
I told mother and grandma

542
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,950
your guess,

543
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,280
but they don't believe it.

544
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,110
Forget it.

545
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,200
We have reminded them.

546
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,040
Don't ever mention

547
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,440
this matter again,

548
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,280
or your grandma will be angry.

549
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,230
I see.

550
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
Then I'll go to bed.

551
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,830
Go.

552
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,680
No need.

553
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,680
Go to bed.

554
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,640
Tell Mr. Song as soon as possible that

555
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,520
I can't stop the marriage.

556
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,440
Yes.

557
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,320
Jiuli,

558
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:46,990
Jiurong,

559
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,950
how are you?

560
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,110
It's ridiculous.

561
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,160
I'm going to marry again,

562
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,830
but it's different this time.

563
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,350
I'll marry

564
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,680
to repay the favor for Zhenzhen

565
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,110
and to get to the bottom of father's death.

566
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,160
You haven't slept yet.

567
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,750
I'm not the only one

568
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,520
who stays up.

569
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,640
I'm thinking, so I can't fall asleep.

570
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,440
Are you thinking, too?

571
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,110
I'm thinking

572
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,070
if I can go out of

573
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,870
Fang's gate once before death.

574
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,040
You have never gone out before?

575
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,830
I did go out

576
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,750
before I was 5.

577
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,710
I remember

578
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,230
it was the Lantern Festival.

579
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,950
There was a big lantern

580
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,320
in the open space in the middle of the city.

581
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,280
When it was lighted up,

582
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,560
almost all people could see it in the city.

583
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,440
If you want to,

584
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,070
you may go to the Lantern Festival this year.

585
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,750
Do you know why

586
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,350
I've never asked to go out

587
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,520
since I was 5?

588
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,320
Don't laugh at me after I tell you.

589
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,560
When I was ill at 5,

590
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,950
I was not allowed

591
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,920
to eat many things.

592
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,110
However, at that age,

593
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
I was curious about all kinds of food.

594
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,680
I couldn't stand

595
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,400
the temptation of food.

596
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,200
One day,

597
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,950
the cake a servant ate outside

598
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,160
fell to the ground.

599
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,870
Seeing that, I got out of my bed,

600
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,230
climbed over step by step,

601
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,320
picked up the cake and ate it.

602
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,230
My Mother

603
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,520
happened to see that,

604
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,800
and she cried and fainted.

605
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,950
She rested

606
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,950
on bed for three days and nights.

607
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,830
Since then,

608
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,110
I've asked for nothing.

609
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,990
I eat whatever

610
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,800
grandma gives me.

611
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,200
They don't want to me to go out,

612
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,160
so I stay at home.

613
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,160
It has been hard for you these years, right?

614
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,680
Anyway,

615
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,640
it'll come to an end soon.

616
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,520
But in recent days,

617
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,040
I'm getting increasingly

618
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,950
eager to go out.

619
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,830
Perhaps,

620
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,640
I want to go out without restraint

621
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,440
at the end of my life.

622
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,110
Let's go to

623
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,920
the Lantern Festival this year.

624
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,230
Grandma won't allow that.

625
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,520
I'm here with you.

626
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,200
With me,

627
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,070
you can

628
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,350
go out to the Lantern Festival this year.

629
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,230
Trust me.

630
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,040
I'm worried that

631
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,200
Chengyu can't stand it.

632
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,350
Grandma,

633
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,400
since he is feeling

634
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,200
better now,

635
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,560
he should go out

636
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,440
to have a look.

637
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,350
And

638
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,830
with a good mood,

639
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,560
he can recover faster.

640
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,990
He can make it.

641
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,070
Trust me.

642
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,830
It has been

643
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,320
hard for him this years.

644
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,520
If you think it's good for him to go out,

645
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
then let him go out.

646
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,470
Grandma,

647
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,200
Chengyu is weak.

648
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,350
With so many people

649
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,320
in the festival,

650
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,400
what if he is hurt

651
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,110
by accident?

652
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,280
What… Listen to Zhenzhen.

653
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,710
Jun Zhenzhen,

654
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,870
how did you fool

655
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,040
grandma and mother?

656
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,470
They even allow Chengyu to go out

657
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,350
at the Lantern Festival.

658
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,230
Now that Zhenzhen said that,

659
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,320
it'll be fine.

660
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,560
Sit down.

661
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,830
All of you are fooled by her.

662
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,590
Grandma,

663
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,110
I heard that

664
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,200
there is also a prize in the Lantern Festival in Zezhou.

665
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,990
The prize of the Lantern Festival

666
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,280
is just for fun.

667
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,950
It's a small prize.

668
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,830
Jinyun Restaurant prepares a grand prize on Lunar March 3.

669
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,800
Jinyun Restaurant on Lunar March 3?

670
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,830
What is that?

671
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,200
We don't know.

672
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,070
None of the Fang family members has been there.

673
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,640
What?

674
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,230
Do you want to win the prize?

675
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I want to make a lantern.

676
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,040
The Fang family

677
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,350
makes lanterns for a whole street.

678
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,990
If you want to,

679
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,070
we'll add one.

680
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,520
After the meal,

681
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,920
I'll ask Butler Gao

682
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,110
to take you to the craftsman.

683
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,070
OK.

684
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,110
Thank you, grandma.

685
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,750
Enjoy the dishes.

686
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,520
Eat.

687
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,320
What's wrong?

688
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,440
Do you think

689
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,320
this pattern

690
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,350
is related to the escort seal

691
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,590
or shipping seal?

692
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,160
Well,

693
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,920
it's possible.

694
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:31,950
Zan,

695
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,520
isn't that...

696
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,110
Royal shipment.

697
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,350
Do you think

698
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,950
he has anything known to the public?

699
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,990
In the third year of the Taiyan reign,

700
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,230
the silver for atonement was traded in Zezhou,

701
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,830
the manor of Chu Rang.

702
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,350
Back then, Beiqi betrayed

703
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,710
and killed all princes and the emperor's father.

704
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,680
If the pattern Bing'er painted

705
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,870
is the illustrated handbook,

706
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,230
there must be

707
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,400
a secret.

708
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,350
If so,

709
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,950
there will be a disaster

710
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,520
when the matter is mentioned.

711
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,110
Go investigate

712
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,560
to see which merchants in Zezhou

713
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,110
were able to do that.

714
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,229
The death of the emperor's father

715
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,710
must be related to the secret in Zezhou.

716
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,709
OK.

717
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,869
I'll go now.

718
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,400
Thank you.

719
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,280
Boss,

720
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,070
two bowls of spicy soup.

721
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,680
OK.

722
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,200
Have you heard it?

723
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,110
The disabled young master of the Fang family

724
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,750
is going to marry

725
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,560
his cousin who turned to his grandma some days ago.

726
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
The two families will become closer.

727
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,590
That's what you say!

728
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,830
Closer?

729
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,069
To put it plainly,

730
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,870
they bully lonely and helpless Miss Jun.

731
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,830
Otherwise,

732
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,070
why does decent Miss Jun

733
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
marry a disabled man?

734
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,829
Come on.

735
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,439
She cheated the Ning family

736
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
out of 5,000 taels of silver.

737
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,349
She even said Mr. Ning Shi is

738
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,710
at the same price of a courtesan.

739
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:58,110
A decent lady will never say that.

740
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,520
Waiter.

741
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,750
Sir.

742
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,470
I think

743
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,070
she marries into the Fang family

744
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,640
for their wealth.

745
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,520
Boss,

746
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,680
I want another two steamed buns.

747
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,750
OK.

748
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,160
Sir,

749
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,200
is it difficult to make it according to my design?

750
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,350
Your Ladyship,

751
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,320
it isn't difficult,

752
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,680
but the finished product

753
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,590
may be ugly.

754
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,320
Never mind.

755
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,830
Its appearance does not matter.

756
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,800
Just do as Miss Jun told you.

757
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,750
OK.

758
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:38,920
Thank you.

759
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,800
Your Ladyship,

760
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,950
you asked me last time

761
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,680
if there is anything interesting in the capital city.

762
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,520
Actually,

763
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,110
I don't know anything

764
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,870
interesting in the capital city.

765
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,830
But there is an interesting thing now.

766
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,560
Many people who have been there

767
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,440
go back with this.

768
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,800
Map of Capital City.

769
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,710
Yes.

770
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,990
I saw someone

771
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,750
selling it in the post,

772
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,680
so I bought one.

773
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,200
It's not expensive

774
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
or eye-catching,

775
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,680
but it is detailed.

776
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,760
It's really drawn in detail.

777
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,830
Your Ladyship,

778
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,590
excuse me.

779
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,920
I'll go back to Deshengchang.

780
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,790
OK.

781
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,310
Just go.

782
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,640
I'll make a lamp here.

783
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,640
OK.

784
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,350
I'm leaving.

785
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,640
Let's go

786
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,550
buy materials.

787
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,070
Liu'er.

788
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,640
OK.

789
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,790
Help pick out some bamboo strips

790
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,440
from these

791
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,110
to make the lantern.

792
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,310
If you're sleepy,

793
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,160
go sleep in the cart.

794
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,110
It'll take me

795
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,160
a while to make the lantern.

796
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,000
Your Ladyship,

797
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,270
I'll wait for you in the cart.

798
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,870
Call me when you leave.

799
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,790
OK.

800
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,440
Go.

801
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:06,960
Miss Jun,

802
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,720
excuse me.

803
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,510
Why do you come here again?

804
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:12,790
First,

805
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,270
I'm not here for the princess' matter.

806
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,200
Second,

807
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,030
I didn't follow you.

808
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,550
The cart of the Fang family is at the gate.

809
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,510
Third,

810
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
now that we're princess' old friends,

811
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,240
I'd like to ask you something.

812
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,270
I don't think we're familiar to each other.

813
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,830
Map of Capital City

814
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,310
is available in the post only.

815
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,400
Where did you get it?

816
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,680
From the family butler.

817
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,400
Do you also know it?

818
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,480
Because

819
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,870
I made it.

820
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,160
A friend told me about it.

821
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,960
I made it and sold it

822
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,680
so that Chu Rang would summon me to the capital city.

823
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,590
So I can see Jiuling.

824
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,440
What a pity!

825
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,620
♫As the echo sounds♫

826
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,140
♫The candle's tears drop♫

827
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,980
♫Eager to know when you'll return♫

828
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,180
♫I set out to look for you at any cost♫

829
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,260
♫My mind is flurried♫

830
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,780
♫and I can't solve the deep mysteries♫

831
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,220
♫But the details wet the memory♫

832
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,660
♫and I wish to take you as the answer♫

833
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,460
♫I can tell that you pretend to be calm♫

834
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,980
♫and know your uncompensated pain♫

835
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,220
♫Reunion after a long separation is a great pleasure♫

836
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,700
♫The world is bustling♫

837
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,540
♫But the light in your eyes is still there♫

838
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,620
♫Though in hardships♫

839
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,220
♫I still want to be with you next life♫

840
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,580
♫When the state is in peace with intact territory♫

841
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,380
♫when the state is in peace with intact territory♫

842
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,740
♫We will be together♫

843
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,580
♫and cherish the happiness♫

844
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,980
♫I don't need to bury the past♫

845
00:39:21,100 --> 00:38:45,240
♫and remember your look♫

846
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,310
Anything else?

847
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,720
I often made lanterns

848
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,590
with Princess Jiuling in my childhood.

849
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,440
She always wore bright red clothes,

850
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,160
looking bright and beautiful.

851
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,640
You remember clearly

852
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,350
what happened in your childhood.

853
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,480
Yeah.

854
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,240
I like her,

855
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
so I remember everything clearly.

856
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
You like her?

857
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,240
Yeah,

858
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,720
so I

859
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,440
ask you

860
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,920
about her repeatedly.

861
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
Pitifully,

862
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,510
I missed her.

863
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,640
Why didn't

864
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,070
you tell her

865
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,240
before?

866
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,920
I plan to tell her when she is 15.

867
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,960
However,

868
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,960
it's harder for us to see each other.

869
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,110
I always take this with me.

870
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,110
Apply it.

871
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,550
Thank you.

872
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,590
Miss Jun,

873
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,550
Deshengchang has operated for years.

874
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,830
Do you know Zezhou...

875
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,440
Childe,

876
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,550
I know nothing about Deshengchang.

877
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,350
Miss Jun,

878
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,400
please tell me

879
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,240
anything you know.

880
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,790
Childe,

881
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,110
I have nothing to say

882
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,440
about Deshengchang.

883
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,920
I'm making a lantern.

884
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,830
If you have nothing else,

885
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,640
please go back.

886
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,830
Thank you.

887
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,160
I stay in Yunmengze Inn.

888
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,590
If you think of something,

889
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,870
please

890
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,760
tell me.

891
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,440
See you.

892
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,310
Why are you curious about Deshengchang?

893
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,440
Are you also

894
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,480
investigating the secret in Zezhou?

895
