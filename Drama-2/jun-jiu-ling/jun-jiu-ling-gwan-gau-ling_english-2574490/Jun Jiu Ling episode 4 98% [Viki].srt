00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,360
Mother, Chengyu's appetite today is better than before.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,580
For breakfast, he had half a bowl of porridge more than usual.

21
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,000
The medicine is working then?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,630
Following the prescription from Zhenzhen,

23
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,930
one decoction every day. She even added in acupuncture yesterday.

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,770
Zhenzhen is really doing her best to treat Chengyu.

25
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,780
Yes. I went to take a look yesterday.

26
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,530
She personally made the medicine in the East kitchen.

27
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,510
From washing to decocting, she's doing it all personally.

28
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,450
This child is reliable.

29
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,860
Not only that, Mother.

30
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,820
Chengyu had half a bowl more of porridge.

31
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,500
It been so long since he's had an appetite.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,650
In our Fang Family, this is an outstanding merit.

33
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,500
I originally thought Zhenzhen was exaggerating her medical skill.

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,150
But now I see

35
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,660
she really is skilled.

36
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,980
Our Chengyu is going to be cured now.

37
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,330
Shenzhen,

38
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,330
Grandmother, Aunt.

39
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,930
Zhenzhen, we were just talking about you. Come sit.

40
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,750
Zhenzhen, Mother and I are aware of everything

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,480
you are silently doing for Chengyu.

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,590
I truly thank you.

43

We're family, no need to be polite.

44
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,820
Why did you come here?

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,030
Chengyu's illness is getting better,

46
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,510
but we shouldn't rush it. Otherwise his body won't be able to keep up.

47
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,400
Going forward, you don't need to be so polite.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,930
Just go ahead and proceed.

49
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,700

Zhenzhen, you know how to read ledgers?

56
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,220
I only learned a little from my father, so I know the basics.

57
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,800
But Older Sister is very detailed in what you teach,

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,610
so I can learn quickly.

61
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,350

it's this.

74
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,190
You both look at the records everyday, so you probably only look at totals.

75
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,700
You usually don't look at the details, right?

76
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,520
That's right.

Looks like Sister Yuxiu has already found a clue.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,210
Let me see.

83
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,420
According to my knowledge, the average cost of a horse is 70-80 taels.

84
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,850
At most it will be 150 taels,

85
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,920
excluding the imperial Han horses.

86
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,270
But for De Shenchang's horses, I don't know from whom or from where he purchased them,

87
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,750
that each horse costs 200 taels.

88
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,010
Great.

89
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,280
Each of them has been raised by De Shengchang for decades.

90
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,940
Their hearts are untamed.

91
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,830
How dare they do such tricks in secret.

92
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,840
I'll go report it to grandmother now and kick them out.

93
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,060
Sister Jinxiu, please wait. There's no rush.

94
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,460
It's not your Jun Family's money,  of course you're not worried.

95
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,710
Just this difference from these horses costs thousands of taels.

96
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,630
Moreover, there are other purchases.

97
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,210
I need to tell Grandmother immediately

98
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,780
and punish them.

99
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,150
Older sister, don't worry yet. First listen to what else Zhenzhen has to say.

100
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,100
Zhenzhen, go ahead.

101
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,430
<i>Could it be that the person giving out orders behind the scenes in the Fang family</i>

102
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,750
<i>is also controlling in Deshengchang?</i>

103
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,400
What we've found so far

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,780
is the status of one of the Deshengchang branches.

105
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,450
But what if other families also have this issues.

106
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,900
We'll of course investigate them all.

107
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,310
This will alert the enemy.

108
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,810
I thought that we could use the audit accounts as an excuse

109
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,430
to collect all the account books of all the branches of Deshengchang.

110
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,450
This way the new won't get out

111
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,790
and prevent them to making changes in their ledgers.

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,480
Also, we can't exclude the possibility that the account books and freight records of previous years also have issues.

113
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,550
So it's best if we can collect all the account books and records

114
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,670
since Deshengchang has been established

115
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,280
to have them examined thoroughly one by one.

116
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,290
Ledgers from a decade or two ago are too old.

117
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,390
We won't need them, right?

118
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,290
We do.

119
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,250
This way, we can find the moth that has been stationed in Deshengchang all these years,

120
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,390
and promote those who are conscientious and trustworthy.

121
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,170
Brilliant.

122
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,490
Kill two birds with one stone. Reward and punishment are clear.

123
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,620
Warn Madam Su of Jun Zhenzhen.

124
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,410
She might be scheming about the Fang Family's assets.

125
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,970
Yes.

126
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,040
Then I will leave first.

143
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,080
<i> - Have some. 
 - Thanks, Second Sister. </i>

144
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,510
<i> You have some first. </i>

145
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,390
<i> I bought it specifically for you. </i>

146
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,900
<i> I also have a lot of stories to tell you. </i>

147

<i> You've grown taller. </i>

148

149

don't need these things. Saves them from bringing it and making you angry.

150
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,170
Only you aren't afraid of making me angry.

151

No.

I'm a doctor and also your cousin.

157
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,220
So what if you're my cousin? You still need to avoid suspicion.

158
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,380

Zhenzhen, did you just visit Chengyu?

170
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,550
Yes. It's a change of the season, and his body is a bit weak.

171
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,260
So these past few days I prepared some medicated meals for him these to avoid the cold.

172
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,650
What a nice child. You're very thoughtful.

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,120
You're...?

174
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
We had the same idea.

175
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,610
Chengyu's had a weak body since he was young.

176
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,740
He can't sleep nor eat well.

177
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,080
I prepared some medicated meals for him to have some more nutrients.

178
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,980
You're very thoughtful as well.

179
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,040
Yes. We can't drag this out any longer.

180
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,910
I just bumped into Madam Su.

181
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,930
Was she bringing tonic soup to Chengyu?

182
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,930
Has she always done this?

183
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,450
Not every day, but every now and then.

184
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,010
You're suspicious of her?

185
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,770
I saw the medicated meals she was bringing to Chengyu. There was no problem.

186
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,530
It's just that... I can't explain why but I find that something's fishy.

187
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,850
Zhenzhen, you're wrong this time.

188
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,340
Madam Su has a soft temper. She's definitely not someone undercover.

189
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,290
I've also examined her tonic soup. Nothing is wrong with it.

190
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,540
What if she's using the soup as an excuse to check on his condition?

191
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,960
I'll have someone keep an eye on her.

192
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,910
- If it's her, I will show no mercy. 
 - Grandmother,

193
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,370
let's not act rashly and alarm the enemy just yet.

194
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,760
I want to use the marriage as an excuse to spread the false news that cousin's condition can not be improved.

195
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,130
In this way, everyone will think that the wedding is for cousin to ward off his illness, and it will paralyze the undercover person.

196
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,070
In addition, it'll be beneficial to my treatment of cousin's illness.

197
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,840
Currently, cousin's illness is improving.

198
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,220
The next step is to have a bath detoxification.

199
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,250
It's just that cousin treats the boundaries between a man and woman very seriously.

200
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm afraid that he won't cooperate if we're not husband and wife.

201
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,130
Between the sexes there should be a prudent reserve.

202
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,580
Zhenzhen's worries are reasonable.

203
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,640
Even if it's a fake marriage,

204
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,310
when everyone knows of the truth in the future,

205
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,590
your reputation will be ruined.

206
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,600
Grandmother, right now, there's nothing more important than Chengyu's life.

207
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,530
I need to cure Chengyu's illness as soon as possible.

208
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,040
As for the rest, it's not a worry of mine.

209
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,890
Zhenzhen, have you really thought about this clearly?

210
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,080
I'm sorry you have to suffer through this, Zhenzhen.

211
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,770
Zhenzhen, if you are able to save Chengyu's life,

212
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,710
and save the bloodline of the Fang family,

213
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,170
you can use the Fang family's properties as you like.

214
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,870
Grandmother, I can't do that.

215
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,440
You can.

216
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,680
You treat the Fang family wholeheartedly,

217
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,300
so the Fang family will treat you wholeheartedly as well.

218
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,950
Sincerity in return for sincerity.

219
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,280
<i>I am also a granddaughter of the Fang family now.</i>

220
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,000
<i>I must do my best to keep the Fang family safe.</i>

221
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,890
<i>Sister,</i>

222
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,990
<i>Rong'er,</i>

223
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,970
<i>you must also be safe, and wait for my return.</i>

224
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,460
<i>[Prince Huai's Residence]</i>

225
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,300
Sister.

226
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,340
The paper boat Rong'er folded looks really good.

227
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,060
It looks like a real one.

228
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,540
Sister, will she be able to see it?

229
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,230
She will.

230
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,340
Of course she will.

231
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,250
When she taught me how to fold the paper boat, she told me

232
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,030
that if you kept thinking about the person's name when you were folding it,

233
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,610
they'll definitely know.

234
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,410
Unfortunately, she can't teach me other things,

235
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,020
and can't tell stories to me anymore.

236
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,850
Then Rong'er, we can make more paper boats

237
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,800
and put them in the water. She'll definitely see them.

238
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,380
Okay.

239
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,520
Why are you coughing?

240
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,750
Did you catch a cold again recently?

241
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,280
Greetings to the Your Highness Princess

242
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,070
and Your Highness Prince Huai.

243
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,710
Sister, I'll be going now.

244
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,810
Okay. Then I'll come visit you later.

245
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,820
What brings Lord Lu here today?

246
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,720
I have asked His Majesty to marry you.

247
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,390
His Majesty has already agreed.

248
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,660
Fine.

249
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,020
I've already had someone pick an auspicious day for us. June 18th.

250
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,580
What do you think?

251
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,570
June 18th.

252
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,180
Jiuling's birthday.

253
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,650
Of course it's an auspicious day.

254
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,460
I'll make good preparations for the wedding.

255
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,360
I'll be leaving now.

256
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,610
<i>It seems that</i>

257
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,000
<i>Chu Rang has arranged all of this.</i>

258
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,840
<i>Alright. This is the only way</i>

259
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,550
<i>I can protect Rong'er.</i>

260
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,490
<i>[Blue Cloud Rundown Inn]</i>

261
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,880
Second Brother.

262
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,310
Second Brother, there's news from the Sky Pavillion.

263
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,990
They found the late emperor's personal maid, Bing'er.

264
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,970
The Arm Moral Department has been chasing her down. Fortunately, we beat them to it and saved her first.

265
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,360
According to Bing'er,

266
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,710
the late emperor's death was not caused by the relapse of an old illness,

267
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,410
but is related to Chu Rang and Lu Yunqi.

268
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,130
Bing'er said that the night the emperor died,

269
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,710
she personally saw Chu Rang secretly enter the imperial study,

270
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,270
and that he seemed to have had a dispute with the late emperor. That night,

271
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,330
it was Lu Yunqi who was on guard, but he never mentioned it to anyone after that.

272
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,690
Not long after that, the imperial hospital announced to the public

273
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,730
that the late emperor died of a relapse of an old disease.

274
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,970
But after the death of the late emperor, Bing'er checked on him secretly.

275
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,230
There were strangulation marks on his neck.

276
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,230
He killed his brother to take over the throne.

277
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,980
Also... Bing'er also said

278
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,140
that she told this information

279
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,670
to Princess Jiuling.

280
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,910
By the way, Second Brother,

281
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,520
Bing'er drew this pattern by memory.

282
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,480
According to Bing'er,

283
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,020
the day the late emperor died, she saw that he looked terribly distressed looking at this pattern.

284
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,750
Could it be that Chu Ran's killing of the late emperor is related to this pattern?

285
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,230
Mother, are we really announcing the news of Chengyu and Zhenzhen's engagement tomorrow?

286
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,650
Should we wait until Chengyu is better?

287
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,430
Tomorrow is the day of the discussion between the stewards and administers for all the branches of Deshengchang.

288
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,900
Everyone will be together, so it's the best timing.

289
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,840
Everyone in our home already knows about it.

290
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,980
It will inevitably spread.

291
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,780
Why?

292
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,510
Why?

293
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,790
Grandmother, Mother.

294
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,070
Why?

295
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,650
Jinxiu, is this how you speak to your grandmother?

296
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,090
Yes. I know.

297
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,410
It's disrespectful to question grandmother like this.

298
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,540
But I just want to know why.

299
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,750
Chengyu is already 15.

300
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,340
The doctor said that Chengyu won't live past 16.

301
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,300
So we're warding off his illness with a marriage.

302
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,010
Grandmother?

303
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,470
You have always been wise.

304
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,440
You never believe in this stuff.

305
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,920
- Why now— 
 - The past is the past.

306
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Now is now.

307
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,410
As long as Chengyu can stay alive,

308
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,290
no matter what methods there are, I'm willing to try it.

309
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,820
Fine.

310
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,260
Even so,

311
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,780
since you want to ward off the illness with a marriage, why can't you find another girl?

312
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,550
Why does it have to be Jun Zhenzhen?

313
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,610
She and I are both willing.

314
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,310
Grandmother, she's willing

315
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,340
because she wants to dominate our family.

316
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,230
In the future, she can abuse her power and domineer in the name of the young mistress of the house.

317
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,120
No wonder she's been so interested in Deshengchang recently.

318
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,090
She refused to go before, but now she goes more frequently than anyone else.

319
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,580
She also tried different ways to check Deshengchang's account books and freight records over the years.

320
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,920
I think she calculated this plan long ago

321
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,100
in order to take over Deshengchang in the future!

322
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Jinxiu, you're thinking too much of it.

323
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,850
It's really just to ward off the illness.

324
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,800
She wants to forcibly occupy Deshengchang and the Fang family!

325
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,700
She can keep dreaming!

326
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,000
Their marriage will both bring the families closer together

327
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,800
and ward off the illness with a change of luck. No one is allowed to intervene.

328
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Jinxiu, hurry and apologize to Grandmother.

329
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,590
I'm not wrong.

330
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,080
Why should I apologize?

331
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,300
Mother, please calm down. It's all my lack of disciplining.

332
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,800
This is what onlookers

333
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,400
think of this marriage.

334
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,400
In the end, Zhenzhen must feel the most wronged.

335
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,800
We'll keep these emotions in our hearts.

336
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
In the future, we'll repay her manyfold.

337
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400
<i>If this curse is a natural disaster </i>

338
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
<i>I will do everything to turn it around</i>

339
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
<i> to protect my Fang family's bloodline.</i>

340
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
<i>If it's done by a person, </i>

341
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
<i>no matter how high ranking or powerful, </i>

342
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,300
<i>even if I'm an ant shaking a tree</i>

343
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,600
<i>I will fight it to the end.</i>

344
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Who made my Jinxiu mad again?

345
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
Hurry and sit.

346
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Mother.

347
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,300
I told mother and grandmother all of your suspicions.

348
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,900
But none of them believed me.

349
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,000
Forget it.

350
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,800
We've already done our part of telling them.

351
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,700
In the future, don't mention this again.

352
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,300
Don't make Grandmother angry.

353
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,100
I got it. Then, I'm going to bed.

354
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,900
Ok, hurry on.

355
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,790
No need. Hurry and go sleep.

356
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,300
Hurry and tell Second Master Song that the marriage cannot be retracted.

357
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,490
Yes.

358
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
<i> Older Sister, Rong'er. </i>

359
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,980
<i> Are you doing well. </i>

360
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,900
<i>It's funny to say that I'm getting married again. </i>

361
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,490
<i> But this time is different. </i>

362
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,700
<i> This time I'm repaying kindness. </i>

363
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,200
<i> It's also to investigate the truth behind father's death. </i>

364
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,180
You're still up?

365
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,200
I'm not the only one

366
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
still up.

367
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,500
I was thinking abou things and couldn't fall asleep.

368
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Are you thinking too?

369
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm thinking,

370
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,800
Can I go out of this house once before I die?

371
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,700
You've never left the house?

372
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,800
I did.

373
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,600
I even remember the Latern Festival back then.

374
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,100
There is a very big lantern in the open space in the middle of the city.

375
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,400
When the light was lit, the whole city could see it.

376
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,100
If you want, you can still see the Lantern Festival this year.

377
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,000
Do you know why

378
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,600
I've never mentioned going out again?

379
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,260
Don't laugh when I say it.

380
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,760
When I got sick at 5 years old,

381
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,660
I have to avoid many foods.

382
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,830
I couldn't eat a lot of things.

383
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,400
But I was only 5 years old,

384
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,600
when I was curious about everything.

385
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,440
How could I withstand all the tempting foods.

386
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:00,020
One day, I saw a little boy outside

387
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,180
drop his pastry on the floor.

388
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
I got up from bed and

389
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,000
crawled over and ate it.

390
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Coincidentally, I was seen by mother.

391
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,100
She immediately passed out from crying.

392
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,800
She laid in bed for a full 3 days and 3 nights.

393
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,800
From then on, I've never had any requests.

394
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,000
I eat whatever Grandmother tells me.

395
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,300
If they don't let me leave, then I don't leave.

396
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,200
It's been hard all these years, right?

397
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,670
Yes and no.

398
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,570
Anyway, it's all about to end.

399
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,800
It's just that recently my desire to go outside

400
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,000
has gotten stonger.

401
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,630
Perhaps because I'm nearing the end.

402
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,610
I want to go out and live recklessly once.

403
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,190
Let's go to the Lantern Festival together this year.

404
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,150
Grandmother will never agree.

405
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,450
There's me.

406
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm here. This year, we'll definitely be able to go together.

407
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,240
Trust me.

408
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,600
I'm worried that Chengyu's body won't be able to handle it.

409
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Grandmother, his condition has gotten much better.

410
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,600
It's time for him to get out and move around.

411
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,200
Plus, if he feels good, he'll get better sooner.

412
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,700
He can do it. Trust me.

413
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,000
He's had a difficult time these past few years.

414
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,400
If you think it's good for him to get out,

415
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,600
then go ahead.

416
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Grandmother, Chengyu's body is weak.

417
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
There are a lot of people at the festival.

418
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,200
- What is someone steps on him or squishes him? 
 - Let's listen to Zhenzhen.

419
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,900
Jun Zhenzhen, what did you give Grandmother and Mother?

420
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,000
They actually agreed to let you go. Even during the festival.

421
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,600
If Zhenzhen says it's ok, then it's ok.

422
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,500
Hurry and sit.

423
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,820
She's got the whole family under her spell.

424
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,500
Grandmother, I heard there's a lottery at Zezhou's Lantern Festival.

425
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,400
The Lantern Festival Lottery is just for the liveliness.

426
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,000
It's not anything grand. The prize that Jinyun Restaurant has for the Double Third Festival is grand.

427
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,400
What's the prize of the Jinyun Restaurant for the Double Third Festival?

428
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,000
We don't know. No one in the Fang family has been.

429
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,400
What, you want to win the lottery?

430
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,670
I want to make a lantern.

431
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,000
Every year, our family rents out a street to make lanterns.

432
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,600
If you want to make one, then just add one.

433
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,400
After we eat, I'll have Steward Gao bring you to find the artisan.

434
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,000
Ok, thank you Grandmother.

435
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,700
Everyone, eat. Eat.

436
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
What's wrong?

437
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Do you think this pattern is related to seal transport goods

438
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
of the transport goods or the freight transport?

439
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,400
That's possible.

440
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Second Brother, then isn't that...

441
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Royal cargo.

442
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,960
Do you think he has anything to be known to the public?

443
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,330
The redemption silver during the third year of Taiyan was traded in Zezhou, the manor of Chu Rang.

444
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,530
That year, Beiqi was treacherous

445
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,310
and killed all the princes and the emperor's father.

446
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,260
If the pattern sketched by Bing'er is the illustrated handbook,

447
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,310
then there must be some hidden secrets.

448
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,260
If that really is the case, there would be a terrible disaster

449
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,400
- if this was mentioned again. 
 - Go investigate.

450
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,200
See which merchants in Zezhou have these capabilities.

451
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,240
The death of the emperor's father must have to do with Zezhou's secret.

452
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,830
Okay, I'll go now.

453
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,390
- Boss, two bowls of hot pepper soup. 
 - Okay.

454
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,780
Did you hear?

455
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,350
The paralyzed young master of the Fang Family

456
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,640
is marrying his cousin who turned to his grandmother a few days ago.

457
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,770
- The marriage will bring them closer together. 
 - It sounds nicer than it is.

458
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,920
What do you mean closer together? To put it plainly,

459
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,070
they're taking advantage of Ms. Jun because she's alone and helpless. Otherwise,

460
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,340
why would a girl in perfect condition like Ms. Jun

461
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,070
marry a paralyzed man?

462
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,420
Come on! Ms. Jun

463
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,900
cheated the Ning family out of 5,000 taels of silver.

464
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,900
She even said that the young master Ning Shi was paying the same price as a courtesan.

465
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,430
- What decent lady would say such words? 
 - Waiter.

466
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,830
- Sir. 
 - What I think

467
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,000
is that she married into the Fang family

468
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
for their wealth.

469
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,690
- Boss, I want two more steamed buns. 
 - Okay.

470
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,680
Sir, are my blueprints difficult to create?

471
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,710
Miss, it's not that it's difficult.

472
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,590
It's just that it won't look good after it's made.

473
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,120
That's no harm. It's appearance doesn't matter.

474
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,180
Just do as Miss is telling you.

475
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,340
Okay.

476
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,540
Thank you for the trouble.

477
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,240
Miss, last time you asked me

478
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,810
if there was anything interesting about the capital city. To be honest,

479
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,280
I don't know anything of the interesting things in the capital city.

480
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,240
Here's something interesting now.

481
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,410
Many people who have been to the capital city bring this back.

482
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,030
A roadmap of the capital city?

483
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,190
I saw someone selling it when I was at the post, so I bought one.

484
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,830
It wasn't expensive, and it doesn't look that impressive, but its victory lies in their quantity.

485
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,200
It is indeed drawn in great detail.

486
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Miss, I'll get out of your way then. I'm head back to Deshengchang first.

487
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,150
Okay, go ahead. I still have to make a lantern here.

488
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,430
Alright, goodbye.

489
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,540
Let's go, come buy materials with me.

490
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,070
- Liu'er, 
 - Okay.

491
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,460
help me choose some bamboo strips.

492
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,030
Choose some that can be used to make a lantern.

493
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,040
If you're tired,

494
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,260
you can take a nap in the vehicle.

495
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,150
I'm going to be a while.

496
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,710
I'll wait for you in the vehicle then, Miss.

497
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,380
Tell me when we're leaving.

498
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,300
Okay, go ahead.

499
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,610
Miss Jun, excuse me.

500
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,260
Why are you here again?

501
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,680
First, I'm not here because of the princess.

502
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,360
Secondly, I'm not following you.

503
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,730
The Fang family's carriage is right at the door. Third,

504
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,190
you and I are both old friends of the princess, I have some questions to ask you.

505
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,420
I don't think I'm that familiar with you.

506
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,490
You can only get this roadmap of the capital city at the post. Where did you get this from?

507
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,940
The family steward gave it to me. Are you also familiar with it?

508
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,030
<i>It's because I made it.</i>

509
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,230
A friend told me about it.

510
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,440
<i>I deliberately made this to sell </i>

511
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,330
<i>to lure Chu Rang into summoning me into the capital city</i>

512
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,510
<i>so that I can see Jiuling.</i>

513
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,340
<i>It's too bad.</i>

514
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:21,490
♫ <i>The echo sounds again provoking the candle's tears</i> ♫

515
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:28,810
♫ <i>I desperately search, wanting to know of your return</i> ♫

♫ <i>My thoughts are flustered again and I can't solve your deep mysteries</i> ♫

517

♫ <i>I see through your calm pretense</i> ♫

519
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,270
Is there anything else?

520
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,940
I often made lanterns with Princess Jiuling when we were younger.

521
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,580
She always wore crimson clothing,

522
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,250
looking bright and beautiful.

523
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,820
You still remember your childhood that clearly?

524
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,260
Yes. You remember everything about the person you like.

525
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,050
You like her?

526
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,980
Yes.

527
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,020
That's why I'm constantly asking you about her.

528
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,840
Unfortunately,

529
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,700
I still missed her.

530
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:51,100
Then why didn't you tell her before?

531
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,960
I wanted to wait to tell her when she reached the age of 15.

532
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,090
Who knew

533
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,990
it would be harder for us to see each other.

534
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,200
I bring this around with me. Apply it.

535
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,540
Thank you.

536
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,930
Miss Jun, Deshengchang has been in operation for many years.

537
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,840
- You should know whether or not Zezhou— 
 - Childe,

538
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,720
I don't know anything about Deshengchang.

539
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,800
- Miss Jun, please tell me anything you know. 
 - Childe,

540
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,180
I can't tell you anything

541
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,850
about Deshengchang.

542
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,770
I still need to make this lantern. If there's nothing else,

543
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,660
please leave.

544
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,920
Thank you for the trouble.

545
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,050
I'm staying at the Yunmengze Inn.

546
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:06,750
If you think of anything, please help me answer my questions.

547
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,390
Goodbye.

548
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,290
<i>Why are you asking about Deshengchang?</i>

549
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,570
<i>Could it be that you're also investigating the hidden secrets of Zezhou?</i>
