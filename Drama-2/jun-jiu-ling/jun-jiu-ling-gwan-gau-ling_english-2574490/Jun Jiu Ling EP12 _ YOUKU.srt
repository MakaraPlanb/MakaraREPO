00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

Episode 12

17
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,150
Capital city

18

Guanghuamen

19
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,270
Guanghuamen

20
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,470
Guanghuamen

21
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,490

23
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,330

Tomb of Beloved Wife Princess Jiuling
By Husband Lu Yunqi

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
Be patient

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,910
and listen to me.

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,880
All this begins with the origin of Miss Jun.

31
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,830
You only know that Miss Jun

32
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,550
is the granddaughter of the Fang family.

33
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,910
But do you know

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,000
her family

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,390
has practiced medicine for generations and inherited medical skills

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,030
for several hundred years?

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,470
Her father,

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,270
Jun Yingwen

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,960
was a famous doctor in Runan.

40
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,030
She is Jun Jiuling,

41
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,110
the highly skilled doctor

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,630
who learnt the medical skills at home

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,240
and took over her family business!

44
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,960
Miss Jun is a highly skilled doctor.

45
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
How can a girl

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,030
become a highly skilled doctor?

47
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,520
Yes.

48
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,800
Yes.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,190
Your story

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,440
is far off the mark.

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,080
Miss Jun wanted to 

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,240
take over her family business

53
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,600
and reopen Jiuling Drugstore in Runan.

54
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,750
After hearing the misfortunes of the Fang family,

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,110
killings of her grandpa and uncle

56
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,110
and her dying cousin,

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,720
she was determined

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
to help the Fang family through the crisis

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,830
and think out a wonderful plan.

60
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,880
Miss Jun

61
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,910
detoxified and cured

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,440
Young Master Fang

63
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,830
under the guise

64
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,440
of marriage.

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,910
To find out the plotter behind

66
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,160
Li Changhong,

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,360
Miss Jun even

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,630
risked her life.

69
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,110
With the sick and weak

70
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,520
and the old and disabled,

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,670
she returned to Runan

72
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,910
after a long and arduous journey.

73
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,670
She met ambushes,

74
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,360
broke through traps

75
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,800
and stumbled through

76
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,960
various dangers.

77
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,600
She revealed 

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,520
the big case that Li Changhong and officers and soldiers

79
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,520
had been in collusion for over 10 years.

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,600
She broke off 

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,390
an engagement and thought out a wonderful plan

82
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,000
under the guise of marriage.

83
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,160
The highly skilled

84
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,750
doctor Miss Jun didn't return overnight to help her grandma, 

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,240
a royal businesswoman, turn the table by a written instruction.

86
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm not good at storytelling.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is a story fabricated by storytellers.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,720
Good.

89
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,760
It must 

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,440
have been fabricated by the Fangs.

91
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,230
You don't know.

92
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,880
The storytellers in the whole city

93
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,880
like to tell the story that

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
the highly skilled doctor Miss Jun

95
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,510
saved the Fang family from danger, fought with bad guys

96
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,200
and treated the sick people most,

97
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,000
followed by the story that Great-grandpa Fang

98
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,230
obtained the imperial decree

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,950
of establishing Deshengchang.

100
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm not good at storytelling.

101
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,270
I'll take you to a teahouse tomorrow

102
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,110
and you can listen there.

103
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,830
Zan,

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,510
we've almost finished

105
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,720
our investigation in Zezhou.

106
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,550
Where will we go?

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,510
Go back to the capital city.

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't forget 

109
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,510
how we escaped from the capture of the men of Arm Moral Department.

110
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,270
If we go back to the capital city now, we'll be caught.

111
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,920
If we don't go and ask for punishment,

112
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,760
how can I dispel Chu Rang's suspicion of me?

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,600
And 

114
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,070
I have something more important to do.

115
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,640
I know what you want to do.

116
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,720
Go on.

117
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,390
Uphold justice for the late emperor and princess,

118
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,550
right?

119
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,070
Have your meal.

120
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,230
After that, go to bed early.

121
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,350
We'll go back to the capital city tomorrow.

122
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,270
Your Excellency,

123
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,880
our men chased her the whole night,

124
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
but she still escaped.

125
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,350
She went to the capital city.

126
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,760
The capital city?

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,790
Yes.

128
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,790
If she knows who we are,

129
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,640
she won't escape

130
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,040
to the capital city

131
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,160
and fall into our snare.

132
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,270
Your Excellency,

133
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,040
our men have entered the city.

134
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,110
Do we

135
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,320
strike the Fangs now?

136
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,270
Their daughter-in-law

137
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,880
didn't go home the whole night.

138
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,160
A girl 

139
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
served water and food in the inn.

140
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,160
She's

141
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,550
kicking up a cloud of dust.

142
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,040
Leave it alone.

143
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,510
Let's first go back to the capital city

144
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,480
and report to His Majesty.

145
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,950
Yes.

146
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,270
Jun.

147
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,040
Chengyu,

148
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,510
where is Jun?

149
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,830
She left a letter to you.

150
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,950
Ling Jiu,

151
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,440
thank you for helping me

152
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,200
find out the plotter behind who framed up the Fang family.

153
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,110
To keep my word,

154
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,350
I'll figure out the secret of Zezhou

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,600
and tell you all about it.

156
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
I learnt from my grandma

157
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,550
the official funds in the third year of the Taiyan period

158
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,070
had really been

159
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,790
secretly handed over

160
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,720
by Chu Rang to the Fang family

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,200
as their start-up funds

162
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,830
to support Chu Rang.

163
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,670
Now 

164
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,390
only my grandma knows this past event in the whole family.

165
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,670
The Fang family has been taught a lesson

166
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,920
because of their mistakes.

167
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,480
The rest are innocent.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,670
You promised me to let the Fang family go.

169
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,480
Please keep your promise.

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
Don't baffle them

171
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,480
at any time.

172
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,040
See you,

173
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,600
Ling Jiu.

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,670
I don't know when we'll meet next time.

175
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,270
Take care.

176
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,230
Dispel the grief of losing the dead

177
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,760
as soon as possible

178
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
and look forward to your future life.

179
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,830
Jun Jiuling.

180
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,960
You don't need me,

181
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,030
so you abandon me,

182
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
with only a letter left.

183
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,470
Where did she go?

184
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,880
She left.

185
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,840
She only said that

186
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,790
she had some private things to deal with.

187
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,880
I also don't know

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,840
where she went.

189
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,790
Do you

190
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,110
like her?

191
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,440
Do you actually like her?

192
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,960
Jun,

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,080
you haven't answered my question.

194
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Why did you leave?

195
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,840
Leave it alone.

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,150
I'll go back to the capital city first.

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,520
It turns out that

198
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
I have so many memories in Zezhou.

199
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,000
I have a new family.

200
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,790
I found out the secret of Zezhou

201
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,080
and met Zhu Zan,

202
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,520
but 

203
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,200
I still had to say goodbye to him.

204
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,320
I go back to the capital city

205
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,440
to find the way in my heart this time.

206
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,080
Even if it is extremely dangerous,

207
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,550
as long as I survive,

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
I will firmly go on.

209
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,200
Jiuli,

210
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,550
Jiurong,

211
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,590
I'll go back to the capital city to protect you.

212
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,910
Chen's sugar figurines.

213
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,960
Sir.

214
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,760
Would you like a sugar figurine?

215
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,150
OK.

216
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,840
Five coins per one.

217
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,350
Here you are.

218
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,550
Chen's sugar figurines.

219
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,200
The specialty of Zezhou,

220
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,150
Chen's sugar figurines.

221
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,790
Yes, yes, yes.

222
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
Chen's sugar figurines.

223
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,320
Unexpectedly,

224
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,790
Madame Su of the Fang family

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,880
is so cruel.

226
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,030
Yes.

227
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,790
She has a daughter.

228
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Does she?

229
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
How can Miss Fang 

230
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
-continue her life? -The specialty of Zezhou.

231
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,000
How, indeed?

232
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,320
She must feel terribly ashamed.

233
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,230
Is the woman 

234
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,670
surnamed Su in collusion 

235
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,320
with Shopkeeper Song…

236
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,790
Yes.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,550
She is just my mom.

238
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,320
What a nuisance.

239
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,880
Miss Fang,

240
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,030
have a sugar figurine.

241
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,320
You'll feel better

242
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,200
after having it.

243
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,080
No need.

244
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,840
Try it.

245
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,440
No need.

246
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,550
Try it, please.

247
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,230
No need.

248
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,550
My sugar figurine…

249
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,110
Only several coins.

250
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,080
I pay you.

251
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,440
Sorry.

252
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,670
I don't have any money with me.

253
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,840
But I'll keep it in my mind

254
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,840
and pay you next time.

255
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,880
It doesn't matter.

256
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,350
I can make them.

257
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,470
Never mind.

258
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,910
Were you driven out by the Fangs?

259
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,320
Good.

260
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,400
You're free.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,230
I wasn't driven out.

262
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,760
I just want to leave there.

263
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,550
Where will you go?

264
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
It's none of your business.

265
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,960
Not exactly.

266
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,910
Fate makes us

267
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,000
meet here.

268
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,320
I think 

269
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,550
you were like my long-lost friend at our first meeting.

270
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,320
I'll treat you

271
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,960
to a meal today,

272
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,150
OK?

273
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,030
The fried boiled pork ahead

274
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,150
is very delicious.

275
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,080
Would you like to taste it?

276
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,400
Let's go,

277
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,030
Miss Fang.

278
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,640
Go.

279
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:22,790
Come on.

280
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,320
Miss Fang,

281
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:23,960
quickly.

282
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,520
Your Ladyship, look.

283
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,440
Here we are.

284
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,880
Let me support you.

285
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,960
Was my father killed by you?

286
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,520
Yes.

287
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,440
What do you want to do?

288
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,550
Chu Rang,

289
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,760
I'll regain everything you seized from my father

290
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,790
and put the matter in the right light.

291
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,110
The capital city,

292
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm back.

293
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Your Ladyship,

294
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,640
where will we first go after entering the city?

295
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,880
The Map of Capital City is very detailed.

296
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,760
Where do you want to go?

297
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,230
Can we first

298
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,280
find something to eat?

299
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,880
We ate solid food all the way,

300
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,400
and my teeth can't bear.

301
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,440
OK.

302
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,910
Well then, let's go here.

303
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,910
OK.

304
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,710
Let's go.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,670
Here we are, Miss Fang.

306
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,550
This restaurant.

307
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,320
Please.

308
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,280
Let me tell you.

309
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,470
Like my sugar figurines,

310
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,470
the fried boiled pork of this restaurant

311
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,440
is also a specialty

312
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,320
of Zezhou.

313
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,640
You'll know after having it.

314
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,910
Boss,

315
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
I want

316
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,670
a bowl of fried boiled pork.

317
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,350
OK.

318
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,590
I just began my business

319
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,150
and sold several sugar figurines today.

320
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
Let's just order one bowl of pork.

321
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,110
Don't refuse.

322
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,080
We 

323
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,760
both know 

324
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,790
each other well.

325
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,760
As friends,

326
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
it's common for us

327
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,030
to sit and have a meal.

328
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,350
Don't shed tears

329
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,400
over the changes of seasons.

330
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,590
And don't mention my kindness,

331
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,550
repayment to me or the like.

332
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,350
Without doubt,

333
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,710
I'm not sympathizing with you.

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,030
Don't sympathize with me.

335
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,520
I just think

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
you, alone,

337
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,590
have a hard time.

338
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,400
Fortunately, you meet me today.

339
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I have nothing to say

340
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,790
and I don't think as much as you said.

341
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,840
Just shut up, will you?

342
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,350
Here comes your dish.

343
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,440
It's hot.

344
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,760
OK.

345
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,280
Thank you, boss.

346
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:53,910
Be free.

347
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,400
Have a taste.

348
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,150
Don't bother.

349
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,710
I ate.

350
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,110
You said you're hungry.

351
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,400
Then I'll eat.

352
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,880
Where do you

353
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,200
stay now?

354
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,910
I stay in an inn.

355
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,150
It's good

356
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,080
to stay there,

357
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,440
but it costs a lot.

358
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,960
I don't think

359
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,440
it's a good place to stay in the long run.

360
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,230
To survive here,

361
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,400
you still need to make a living by some craft.

362
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,350
I have a good idea.

363
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,880
Why not learn to make sugar figurines from me?

364
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,400
Let's go over there.

365
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Yunzhao,

366
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,710
we've devoted ourselves to preparing for the exam

367
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,160
in the capital city for a long time.

368
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,760
We rarely have time to go out and have tea.

369
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,430
Stop reading, OK?

370
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,070
Taste it.

371
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,950
It's good tea.

372
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,760
Young Master.

373
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,640
Young Master,

374
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,350
your letter.

375
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
From whom?

376
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,430
Sorry,

377
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,880
Wenming.

378
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,040
Forgive me for leaving for a while.

379
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,880
Go ahead.

380
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,430
Miss,

381
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,470
buy one.

382
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:45,950
Your Ladyship,

383
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,350
look.

384
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,230
It's so nice.

385
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:58,830
Your Ladyship,

386
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,640
look at this.

387
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,230
Do you think I don't even know the time of day?

388
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,760
No.

389
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,520
Do anything you like

390
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,950
and buy anything you want.

391
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,160
You have our money bag.

392
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,590
Well,

393
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,070
I'm a bit hungry.

394
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,920
What good food can we eat here?

395
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,640
Dong's dried meat.

396
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,830
Miss,

397
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,430
it's very fresh.

398
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Dong's dried meat.

399
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,430
I remember it's recorded in the map

400
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,760
their dried meat is very tasty.

401
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
Why not have a try?

402
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,160
OK. OK.

403
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:32,920
Let's go.

404
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,950
Dong's dried meat. Boss,

405
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,640
I want a portion.

406
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,400
OK.

407
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,950
Liu'er,

408
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,070
I'll go out

409
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,280
to handle something later.

410
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
Wait for me in the inn.

411
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,230
OK.

412
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,110
Please hurry right back.

413
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,160
How much?

414
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,230
Three coins per portion.

415
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,560
OK. Thank you.

416
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,830
See you.

417
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,800
The marriage of Miss Jun and Young Master Fang

418
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,680
is just a strategy.

419
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,160
Where is

420
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,230
she now?

421
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,830
Can we meet again?

422
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,110
Your Majesty, calm down please.

423
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,950
Due to your incompetence,

424
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,950
the Fang family gets rid of their unpresentable identity 

425
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,470
and becomes imperial businessmen in just ways.

426
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,190
It's hard for us to deal with them later.

427
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,070
How can I calm down?

428
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,830
Though they showed their identity,

429
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,000
they didn't mention anything about the official funds,

430
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,000
nor do they 

431
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,040
suspect it was done by Your Majesty.

432
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,230
They firmly believe

433
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,000
Li Changhong and the evil Madame Su were in collusion.

434
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,560
This plan must have been designed

435
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,680
by someone clever.

436
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,430
The reason why they didn't mention the past

437
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,760
is to protect themselves.

438
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,760
Having always been

439
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,760
in the palace,

440
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,350
I'm known by no one outside,

441
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,070
so 

442
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,470
no one suspects 

443
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,800
Your Majesty is involved in it.

444
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,830
Now the Fang family only knows

445
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,070
there must be someone 

446
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,560
behind this matter,

447
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,470
but they don't care

448
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,640
who he is.

449
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,000
If 

450
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,760
we do anything to them rashly,

451
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,110
it'll cause

452
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,920
all the people's speculations

453
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,110
of us.

454
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,680
If they know how to behave in this delicate situation

455
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,590
and don't cause any trouble,

456
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,310
I'll spare their lives

457
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,800
for some days

458
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,590
and decide whether to keep them or not

459
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,470
after it blows over.

460
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,710
Your Majesty, you're wise.

461
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,110
Jiuli,

462
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,880
Jiurong,

463
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm back.

464
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,110
Are you sure he is His Lordship?

465
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,830
Yes.

466
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,640
As soon as he entered the capital city,

467
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,710
our men have targeted him.

468
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,680
His Lordship?

469
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,350
Boss,

470
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,760
another plateful of meat

471
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,000
and another beaker of wine.

472
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,590
OK.

473
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,000
Zhu Zan.

474
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,760
Enjoy yourselves.

475
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,470
OK.

476
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,950
Although you've been here for a long time,

477
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,040
I'm sure you don't know

478
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,760
the marinated meat in this restaurant tastes best.

479
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,880
Why do you still have the mood to eat?

480
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,190
Don't

481
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,590
you know 

482
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,470
who the most wanted person

483
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,950
of Arm Moral Department is?

484
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:26,830
Yes, I know.

485
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,710
So eat

486
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,430
before they come.

487
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,110
If they come,

488
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,000
they'll spoil our mood.

489
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,350
I have no mood.

490
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,070
Eat quickly.

491
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,830
Enjoy your food.

492
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,280
If you eat worriedly,

493
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,280
you don't think anything tasty.

494
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:43,950
Have this.

495
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
You still have the mood to joke with other

496
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,230
at this critical moment.

497
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,520
Go back.

498
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,710
Don't you go with me?

499
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,280
I have something important to do.

500
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,560
After that, I'll go to the palace.

501
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,280
Go to the palace?

502
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,160
Why does he go to the palace?

503
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,230
Does 

504
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,680
he want to confront Chu Rang

505
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,350
about the secret in Zezhou?

506
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,470
What's the last thing

507
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,520
he wants to do?

508
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,400
Let me go with you, OK?

509
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,470
Go back.

510
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,160
I know when to stop.

511
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,280
Don't flaunt your superiority.

512
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,830
OK.

513
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,070
Then I'll go back.

514
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,190
Don't you need my help?

515
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,190
Wait.

516
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,920
Pay.

517
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,070
Boss,

518
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,520
here you are.

519
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,000
OK.

520
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,830
See you.

521
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,710
Take care.

522
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,800
It's

523
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,680
my tomb.

524
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,040
It turns out I was buried 

525
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,350
in the ancestral cemetery of the Lu family after death.

526
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,950
I was bound by this marriage

527
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,400
when I was alive and after I died.

528
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,590
I'm coming.

529
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,070
I'm back.

530
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,830
I bring the flower,

531
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,830
northern manjusaka,

532
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,470
you want.

533
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:57,950
What is

534
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,680
he doing?

535
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,830
Outline in my dream

536
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,110
can be carved on your face

537
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:14,630
Time interlaces in the eye waves

538
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,550
For unspeakable cause and effect

539
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,270
Let me weigh every word

540
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,750
Life is full of twists and turns

541
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,230
So hard to be free and easy

542
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,430
Tomorrow always comes

543
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,870
I'd like to entrust myself to you

544
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,030
to enjoy stars and the land together

545
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,310
In long silence

546
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,830
We are far separated by a sea of faces

547
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,430
What else can I do except for a sigh?

548
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,910
The rest of my life is bumpy

549
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,350
You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind

550
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,830
I'm be eventually be passed by

551
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,310
The wind is in hot pursuit

552
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,350
to stay with nature

553
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,670
If memories can tell

554
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,670
It will make me shed tears

555
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:09,150
Rare to meet you again, tears well up in my eyes

556
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,870
Tomorrow always comes

557
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,070
I'd like to entrust myself to you

558
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:39,470
to enjoy stars and the land together

559
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,630
In long silence

560
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,270
We are far separated by a sea of faces

561
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,830
What else can I do except for a sigh?

562
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,590
The rest of my life is bumpy

563
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,590
You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind

564
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,150
I'm be eventually be passed by

565
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,630
The wind is in hot pursuit

566
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,030
to stay with nature

567
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,990
If memories can tell

568
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,030
Every of its words will make me shed tears

569
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,190
Rare to meet you again, tears well up in my eyes

570
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,190
You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind

571
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,950
You shuttle through the bottom of my heart

572
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:23,110
Has nature ever asked for any clues about the wind?

573
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,790
If my longing for you can be written down

574
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,670
Every word would be as strong as pouring rain falling down

575
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,270
You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again

576
00:30:30,270 --> 00:28:06,430
Tears well up in my eyes

577
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,470
Let me perform magic for you.

578
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,400
Wait a moment.

579
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,350
I have a wish.

580
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,520
Can you help me realize it?

581
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,190
What wish?

582
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,680
Go ahead.

583
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,950
I can help you realize it.

584
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,430
It's heard there's a kind of flower called manjusaka in the north.

585
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,230
It looks very pretty in its flowering.

586
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,470
Bring one flower back with me

587
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,800
when you come back.

588
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,230
OK.

589
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,040
I promise you.

590
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,950
Is it pretty?

591
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,310
I think you look good with it.

592
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,040
Jiuling,

593
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,310
let me tell you a secret

594
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,880
which has been hidden in my heart.

595
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,590
I thought to tell you about it

596
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,110
when you called me Ling Jiu again.

597
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,710
But I had no chance anymore.

598
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,760
I like you.

599
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,070
I came immediately

600
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,560
when I got the news of your marriage.

601
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,710
But it was late.

602
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,590
Late.

603
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,590
Chu Jiuling already died,

604
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,350
but now Jun Jiuling knows

605
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,000
you covered 1,000 li

606
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,920
to pick this flower from the north,

607
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,230
during which you escaped from escort,

608
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
changed your name,

609
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,280
risked your life entering the capital city

610
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,880
and acted in black at night.

611
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,880
You just want to put this flower

612
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,230
before my tomb.

613
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,000
You cheat me.

614
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,110
You aren't buried inside.

615
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:37,950
Do you know?

616
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,160
I met a girl

617
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,350
who is exactly like you.

618
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,070
But I know she isn't you.

619
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,640
What should I do?

620
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,950
Lu Yunqi.

621
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,760
Your Lordship,

622
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,520
this is the ancestral cemetery of my family.

623
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,560
It's improper for you

624
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,920
to come here.

625
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,710
Because Jiuling's tomb is here.

626
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,950
She's my dead wife.

627
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,280
Lu Xiaozao,

628
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,070
listen.

629
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,710
How did Jiuling die?

630
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,110
She died of an acute illness.

631
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,560
The imperial doctor felt her pulse

632
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,950
before marriage.

633
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,640
Why did a healthy girl

634
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,710
die suddenly

635
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,000
at her wedding ceremony?

636
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,350
Human affairs are hard to predict.

637
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,040
But 

638
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,430
it has nothing to do with you.

639
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,230
Your harassment is useless.

640
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,350
Stop cheating me.

641
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,920
Since it's useless to say more,

642
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,230
let's do something useful.

643
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,800
I'll teach you

644
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,520
a lesson

645
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,350
with my sword

646
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,920
for Jiuling.

647
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,640
Save it.

648
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,640
You dirty brat,

649
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,880
I'm afraid you've forgotten

650
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,350
why you're called Lu Xiaozao.

651
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,040
Let me remind you.

652
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,680
You were

653
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,040
black, small

654
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,920
and as thin as a rake.

655
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,350
If my dad hadn't taken you in,

656
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,110
you would have starved to death at the roadside.

657
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,920
Now 

658
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
you begin to steal.

659
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Dare you steal again?

660
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,760
Tell me.

661
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,840
Dare you steal?

662
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Dare you?

663
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,710
Dare you?

664
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,760
I dare you.

665
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,520
You…

666
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:54,949
Zhu Zan.

667
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,040
Catch him.

668
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,670
Make way. Make way.

669
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,360
Get out of the way.

670
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,670
Eunuch Yuan.

671
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,150
I'm going to present myself to His Majesty.

672
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,520
Why do you stop me?

673
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,840
Eunuch Yuan,

674
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,910
he wanted to kill me here.

675
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,430
Your Lordship,

676
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,760
you're an adult.

677
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,430
Don't run wild again.

678
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,390
OK.

679
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,670
Look.

680
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,280
Your Excellency Lu,

681
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,950
His Majesty asked me

682
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,760
to take His Lordship to the palace.

683
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,800
Why do they take him to the palace?

684
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,800
Your Lordship,

685
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,910
please.

686
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,910
Please.

687
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,150
Your Excellency,

688
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,150
will we just let him go?

689
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,910
Go back to Arm Moral Department.

690
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,040
Let's go.

691
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,800
Zhu Zan,

692
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,360
you're so clever

693
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,390
that you can expect that your public appearance in the capital city

694
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,670
will cause an uproar.

695
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,670
So

696
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,760
entering the palace

697
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
is also your plan to get out,

698
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,470
isn't it?

699
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,150
I hope everything goes as you expected

700
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,430
and you can return safely.

701
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,120
Miss Jun.

702
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,320
Mr. Ning.

703
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,470
Miss Jun,

704
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,670
long time no see.

705
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,840
Long time no see.

706
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,560
You helped the Fang family

707
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,520
get rid of danger,

708
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,360
which is admirable.

709
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,320
You know all?

710
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,800
Yes, my family mentioned it in a letter.

711
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,040
Why do you come here?

712
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:12,910
I'm,

713
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,230
I'm here for something.

714
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,190
But no one knows I'm here

715
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,630
except my family.

716
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,520
So…

717
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,320
OK.

718
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,230
I'll keep it a secret for you.

719
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,670
If you need any help here,

720
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,320
please find me

721
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,600
in my uncle's mansion.

722
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,040
OK.

723
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,760
Do you have anything on your mind?

724
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,800
The metropolitan exam is drawing near.

725
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,190
You'll have good grades for sure.

726
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,230
Let it be.

727
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,040
You're determined to be an official.

728
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,320
It's my inescapable duty

729
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,520
to continue and develop my family.

730
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,760
You're good at reading,

731
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,150
but the official circles are full of danger.

732
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,910
I know

733
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,670
you're honest.

734
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,710
My uncle also reminded me of that.

735
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,150
Do you also know the law of the official circles?

736
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,040
Anyhow,

737
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,230
I hope you can pass the exam

738
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,080
and get what you want.

739
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,280
See you.

740
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,360
Miss Jun, let me

741
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,320
send you home.

742
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,080
No, thanks.

743
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,230
It's just ahead.

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,880
♫Rare to meet you again, tears well up in my eyes♫

765
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,400
♫Tomorrow always comes♫

766
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,960
♫I'd like to entrust myself to you♫

767
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,080
♫to enjoy stars and the land together♫

768
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,320
♫In long silence♫

769
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,360
♫We are far separated by a sea of faces♫

770
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
♫What else can I do except for a sigh?♫

771
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,800
♫The rest of my life is bumpy♫

772
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,120
♫You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind♫

773
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,880
♫I'm be eventually be passed by♫

774
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,600
♫The wind is in hot pursuit♫

775
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,720
♫to stay with nature♫

776
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,760
♫If memories can tell♫

777
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,800
♫Every of its words will make me shed tears♫

778
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,360
♫Rare to meet you again, tears well up in my eyes♫

779
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,440
♫You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind♫

780
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,080
♫It's me♫

781
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,600
♫You shuttle through the bottom of my heart♫

782
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,760
♫Has nature ever asked for any clues about the wind?♫

783
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,320
♫Any clues?♫

784
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,400
♫If my longing for you can be written down♫

785
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,440
♫Every word would be as strong as pouring rain falling down♫

786
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,160
♫You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again♫

787
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,440
♫Tears well up in my eyes♫
