00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

Episode 7

17
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,020
Dawn Moon and Good Wind

18
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,030
Assistant of Arm Moral Department  Jiang Baihu

19
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:19,890
Fang Mansion

20
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,650
Fang Mansion

21
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:09,490
Fang Mansion

22
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,750
Fang Mansion

23
00:31:35,540 --> 00:03:54,800
Ning Mansion

24
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,150
The Heavenly Maids Scattering Blossoms.

25
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,640
All arrows in the pots.

26
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,470
Miss Jun,

27
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,230
how wonderful!

28
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,800
Amazing.

29
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,150
Zan, she got all the arrows in the pots.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,080
5,000 taels, Zan.

31
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,440
Look, we didn't come in vain.

32
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,160
All arrows in the pots.

33
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,390
Ladies

34
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,910
and gentlemen,

35
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,830
the winner

36
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,000
is obviously

37
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,750
Miss Jun.

38
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,160
In just a few days,

39
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,080
I lost to you again.

40
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,830
Thank you for giving the chance.

41
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm not as calm as you.

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,110
Zan,

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
you haven't taken the money yet.

44
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,520
I didn't expect you

45
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,390
to be good at the pitch-pot game.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
After you showed your skills today,

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,030
you beat the crowd.

48
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,750
You made a huge amount of money

49
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,470
from your previous bet.

50
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,550
Please wait here.

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,240
They'll send someone

52
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
to deliver the money later.

53
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,640
Your Ladyship,

54
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,240
there's so much money.

55
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,830
I'll keep an eye on them.

56
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,270
Liu'er.

57
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,600
After the pitch-pot game,

58
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,160
you must be thirsty.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,520
Miss Jun,

60
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,750
here you are.

61
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,600
Jun Zhenzhen,

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
are you…

63
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,600
Wait a minute.

64
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,310
Yunyan,

65
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,310
it seems that Jun Zhenzhen

66
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,440
has been on guard.

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,470
But

68
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,960
I've already made all the preparations.

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,310
I arranged for a man

70
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,800
dressed in the clothes of Jinyun Restaurant

71
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,190
and gave him some money

72
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
to help me cheat Jun Zhenzhen first.

73
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
The tea I sent this time has been filled with

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,030
another overpowering drug.

75
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,720
And I tampered with

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,800
both two cups of tea.

77
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,310
That man

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,880
has taken the antidote.

79
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,720
So,

80
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,000
so once he is in the room, the plan is perfectly safe,

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,520
right?

82
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,110
Yes.

83
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,110
Let's wait and see.

84
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,880
I looked at that girl.

85
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,640
She's the girl who gave you the lantern the other day.

86
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,880
Honestly… She's that girl.

87
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,160
…did you just throw the game on purpose?

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,560
Miss Jun is so good at the pitch-pot game.

89
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,520
I candidly admit defeat.

90
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
You spent so much time up there talking to her.

91
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,800
What did you talk about?

92
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,800
I wonder too.

93
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,990
What did you talk about?

94
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,640
Tell us about it.

95
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
Don't let it go wrong this time.

96
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,030
Lord, you can rest assured.

97
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,910
This time we have made all the preparations.

98
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,470
There can be no mistakes.

99
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:39,960
Yes.

100
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
Why hasn't there been any movement

101
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
for so long?

102
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,190
I wonder too.

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,280
Shall I go and have a look?

104
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,800
That's OK.

105
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,800
Go and have a look.

106
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,030
What's the matter?

107
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
Jun Zhenzhen,

108
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
what are you shouting for?

109
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,990
I think Miss Ning is mistaken for someone else.

110
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,990
I'm here.

111
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,520
Let me go.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,190
Come over.

113
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Let me go.

114
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,470
Let me go.

115
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,990
Jin'er.

116
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,120
Isn't that Miss Lin?

117
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,990
Let me go.

118
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,560
Who sent you here?

119
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,430
Jun Zhenzhen.

120
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,120
Let's talk about it later.

121
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,990
Miss Ning,

122
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,190
I don't know this lady surnamed Jun.

123
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,680
It's none of my business.

124
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,520
Don't talk nonsense here.

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,990
I don't even know you.

126
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,800
How could you do that?

127
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,310
I…

128
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,030
Miss Ning,

129
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,280
are you trying to hurt my lady

130
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,710
or destroy her?

131
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,750
Don't talk nonsense.

132
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,710
This is clearly the trap you set.

133
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,870
Ning Yunyan,

134
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,840
how am I supposed to live?

135
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,680
You want to plot against my lady,

136
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,310
but you hurt her by mistake

137
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,990
and still bite back here.

138
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,710
It seems that

139
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,520
she hurt

140
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,590
herself

141
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,710
by her own doing.

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,190
Don't talk nonsense.

143
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,470
It has nothing to do with me.

144
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,910
You all wronged me.

145
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,990
Indeed.

146
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,800
So wicked.

147
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,990
She's gone too far.

148
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,310
Why is she like this?

149
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,910
Why is she like this?

150
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,310
How could she do that?

151
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,080
Go.

152
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,400
Miss Jun.

153
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,910
Yunzhao. Young master.

154
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,430
Yunzhao.

155
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,360
Watch out.

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:48,920
Go.

157
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,480
Don't run.

158
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,720
Don't run.

159
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,520
I hope it didn't scare you.

160
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,960
No.

161
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,600
Ning Yunyan,

162
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,550
did you do it?

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
You're talking nonsense.

164
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,750
You obviously designed all this.

165
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,480
You just want to take this opportunity

166
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,080
to make a big fuss,

167
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,480
so that you can cast the load on the Ning family.

168
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,990
Yunyan,

169
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,520
stop it.

170
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,550
Miss Jun,

171
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,280
sorry.

172
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,430
I'll solve it.

173
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,280
Everybody. Everybody.

174
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,870
Sorry, guys.

175
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,720
Sorry.

176
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,720
Come out.

177
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,480
It's all right now.

178
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,870
Today is the big day of Jinyun Restaurant.

179
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,080
I didn't expect

180
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,600
this to happen.

181
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,480
It scared

182
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,280
all of you here.

183
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,600
Jinyun Restaurant

184
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,870
apologizes to you all.

185
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Today's expenses

186
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,040
are halved.

187
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,190
But

188
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,550
the immediate priority

189
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,310
is to ensure your safety.

190
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,040
So

191
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,080
our Jinyun Restaurant

192
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,400
will be temporarily blocked.

193
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,430
I hope

194
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,520
you will bear it.

195
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,990
Please bear it.

196
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,960
Yunzhao.

197
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,790
Yunzhao.

198
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,160
It's all Jun Zhenzhen's fault.

199
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,040
Otherwise Jin'er

200
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,640
wouldn't be like this.

201
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,400
Our Ning family wouldn't

202
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,430
spend so much silver.

203
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,190
Yunyan,

204
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
why don't you think about

205
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,990
why she lied to you

206
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,040
and why you were deceived?

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,670
You framed her

208
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,920
in such a mean means first.

209
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,670
It's all your choice,

210
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,480
your decision.

211
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,190
What reason do you have to resent her now?

212
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,430
Yunzhao,

213
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,990
I'm your sister.

214
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,080
Why don't you speak for me

215
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,280
but for her?

216
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,960
Yunyan,

217
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
don't you think you were wrong?

218
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,600
I wasn't wrong.

219
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,310
It's all her fault.

220
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,750
To blame her is to shirk your own fault.

221
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,550
You will continue to make mistakes in the future.

222
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,350
What's wrong with me?

223
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,190
I just want to retaliate against her for the Ning family.

224
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,920
It's all her fault.

225
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,040
She just wanted to frame me.

226
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,960
Ning Yunyan,

227
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,430
you won't

228
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,430
be lucky

229
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,550
every time.

230
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,870
And in this case,

231
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,280
your stubbornness

232
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,400
has ruined Miss Lin's life.

233
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,640
Don't you feel sorry now?

234
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,080
What's wrong with me?

235
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,430
I wasn't wrong.

236
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,350
Yunzhao, I wasn't wrong.

237
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,550
Come on. Come on. Come here.

238
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,520
All right. All right.

239
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,430
Mr. Ling,

240
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,960
are you

241
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,310
all right?

242
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,520
Thank you for saving me today.

243
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,990
I don't know

244
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,160
when you came.

245
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,960
I happened to see

246
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,350
your skill in the pitch-pot game.

247
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,790
Well,

248
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,750
you were the one

249
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,960
who just betted on me, huh?

250
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,160
I have a question.

251
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,080
The Heavenly…

252
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,640
Zan.

253
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,190
Zan.

254
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,550
The men of Arm Moral Department are coming.

255
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,040
Let's go.

256
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,520
Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Right now.

257
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,840
Make way.

258
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,160
Make way.

259
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,350
Who's in charge here?

260
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,400
Come here to talk to me.

261
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:11,960
Your Excellency,

262
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,550
the person in charge is usually here.

263
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,920
He is absent only on March 3

264
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,990
in accordance with the usual practice.

265
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,190
What do you want me to do,

266
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,310
Your Excellency?

267
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,960
Let everyone

268
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,080
gather downstairs

269
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,670
and leave the front door

270
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,110
in turn.

271
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,280
Your Excellency,

272
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,350
our Jinyun Restaurant

273
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,790
is open to all the people today.

274
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
There are many people coming and going.

275
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,110
It's really difficult for me

276
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,840
to meet your request.

277
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,600
I'll arrange it right away.

278
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,870
I'll arrange it right away.

279
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,080
Sorry,

280
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,160
guys.

281
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,160
I'm really sorry.

282
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,790
According to his request,

283
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,640
line up

284
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
to get out of Jinyun Restaurant in turn.

285
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,790
Sorry, guys.

286
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,520
Please.

287
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,160
Go.

288
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,640
Let's go.

289
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,310
It's full of twists and turns.

290
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,310
Zan,

291
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,160
we are so unlucky.

292
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,480
We can meet

293
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,600
our enemies accidentally every time.

294
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,600
Now Jinyun Restaurant

295
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,720
is surrounded everywhere.

296
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,230
It's hard for us to go out.

297
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,480
Come here. Wait.

298
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,870
Stop.

299
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,040
OK. No. No.

300
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,480
No. Go.

301
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,280
Go. Be quick. Be quick.

302
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,230
Wait.

303
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,430
Stop.

304
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,400
No. No.

305
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,160
OK. Go.

306
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,670
Stop.

307
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,720
No. Go.

308
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,350
No. No. No.

309
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,080
Go.

310
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,080
Leave. Leave.

311
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,870
Stop.

312
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,670
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

313
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,110
You guys

314
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,280
search upstairs one room by one room.

315
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,350
Yes.

316
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,310
Go.

317
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,920
Go.

318
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:21,990
Make way.

319
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,110
My money.

320
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,350
Stop it.

321
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,190
She's covering us.

322
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,600
Zan,

323
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,040
why don't we run in chaos?

324
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,520
I'm afraid Arm Moral Department is going to pick on her.

325
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,430
Mine.

326
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,550
Stop it.

327
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,840
Stop it.

328
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,160
If you go on,

329
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,160
I will kill you all.

330
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Stop it.

331
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,190
What are you doing?

332
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,840
Who are you?

333
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,400
Arm Moral Department is handling a case.

334
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,790
Get the hell out of here.

335
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm Ning Yunzhao from Zezhou.

336
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,840
You're from the mansion of Lord Ning Yan.

337
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,430
Yes.

338
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,750
Childe Ning,

339
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,310
Arm Moral Department's action

340
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,040
was secretly ordered by His Majesty.

341
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,230
I'm afraid

342
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
you'll lose your head after listening to it.

343
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,720
Your Excellency,

344
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
all the people who came to Jinyun Restaurant today

345
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,840
are civilians.

346
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,480
There must be no key criminal you want to catch.

347
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,520
Why should you bother them?

348
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,840
Childe Ning,

349
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
this is not the time for you to be a hero.

350
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,840
Hurry back to home.

351
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,190
Send my regards

352
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,840
to your dad.

353
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,640
Did you

354
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,870
drop

355
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,960
the silver?

356
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,600
Answer me.

357
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,750
Your Excellency,

358
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,720
please forgive

359
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,430
my maid's timidity.

360
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,480
Zan,

361
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,600
what should we do?

362
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,430
Keep calm.

363
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,400
You look very composed.

364
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
I think

365
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,520
the maid

366
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,400
dropped the silver deliberately.

367
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,550
All of you,

368
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,080
search carefully upstairs and downstairs

369
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,840
and don't miss any corner.

370
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,430
Yes.

371
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,400
Let's go.

372
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:12,960
Make way.

373
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,039
Make way. Make way.

374
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,920
Zan, terrible.

375
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,309
It seems we can't avoid fighting with them.

376
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,870
Don't expose our identity.

377
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,640
We still have more important things to do.

378
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,870
Let's go.

379
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,960
Drink.

380
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,400
Stand aside. Stand aside.

381
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,920
Sorry.

382
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Sorry, everyone.

383
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:42,870
OK.

384
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,310
Go.

385
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,640
OK.

386
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,230
Stop.

387
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,110
Let me check. Wait.

388
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,790
It isn't me.

389
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,920
Go.

390
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,400
Miss Jun,

391
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
let's go now. Miss Jun.

392
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,230
She's safe.

393
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,600
Prepare to act.

394
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,670
Is there anyone?

395
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,670
No.

396
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,160
Zan,

397
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,040
will we act?

398
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,720
Follow me.

399
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,280
Search carefully.

400
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,990
Yes.

401
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,110
No one.

402
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,600
Withdraw.

403
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,480
They left.

404
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Thank you so much today.

405
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,920
Thanks. Thanks.

406
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,550
How do you know there's a secret door here?

407
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,190
I'm very familiar

408
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
with the structure of Jinyun Restaurant.

409
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,080
Each separate room here has a secret door

410
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,190
and all these secret doors are connected.

411
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,230
Chen Qi.

412
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,790
You're surnamed Chen.

413
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,640
Are you the descendant of the Chen family

414
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,200
who sold Jinyun Restaurant?

415
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
Don't slander me.

416
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,230
It's my dad, a compulsive gambler, who sold it,

417
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,590
not me.

418
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,830
Well,

419
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,280
how do you know

420
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
they want to catch us?

421
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,830
As soon as the men of Arm Moral Department came,

422
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,920
I saw you slip away.

423
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,990
If they didn't come to catch you,

424
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,830
you weren't afraid of being found out.

425
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,230
Thanks. Thanks.

426
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,920
Your Excellency,

427
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,470
we searched upstairs and downstairs

428
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,320
and didn't find anyone suspicious.

429
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,350
A bunch of bums.

430
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,320
See you, Your Excellency.

431
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,560
They already left.

432
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,200
Who are you?

433
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,280
Why are you standing at the gate of my mansion?

434
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,920
It turns out to be Miss Fang.

435
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,750
I'm Ning Yunzhao.

436
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,950
Miss Fang,

437
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
I want to see Miss Jun.

438
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,800
Please tell her.

439
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,160
Childe Ning,

440
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,200
do you think

441
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,830
it's proper

442
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,230
for you to see her

443
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,440
at this time?

444
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,110
Please tell her

445
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,110
about it.

446
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,230
Whether she wants

447
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,560
to see me or not

448
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,590
depends on her.

449
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,200
OK.

450
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,470
Just wait.

451
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,680
I'll go and ask her.

452
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,110
The assassin today

453
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,320
is likely to be the one

454
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,040
who framed up the Fang family.

455
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,070
As the assassin escaped,

456
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,230
I have no clue again.

457
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,040
After I cure Chengyu,

458
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,400
I should figure out the guy behind quickly.

459
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,160
Jinxiu.

460
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Ning Yunzhao wants to see you.

461
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,950
Ning Yunzhao?

462
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,440
Decide whether

463
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,440
you see him or not.

464
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,710
If others see

465
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,750
him waiting at our gate,

466
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,280
it'll damage my brother's reputation.

467
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:35,920
OK.

468
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,230
Miss Jun,

469
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,830
were you frightened

470
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,640
by what happened at Jinyun Restaurant today?

471
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,110
No.

472
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,560
Thank you for your care.

473
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,750
It's good.

474
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,830
It turns out you played a go game with me

475
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,440
on the night of the lantern show.

476
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,990
The one who could make such an exquisite composition

477
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
must be an openhearted person.

478
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,280
You're

479
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,110
the same as I thought.

480
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,990
I'm flattered.

481
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,710
Why do you want to see me tonight?

482
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I apologize to you

483
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,040
for Yunyan's cheating you into going to Jinyun Restaurant.

484
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,680
Childe Ning,

485
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,950
you shouldn't be to blame.

486
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,350
It wasn't caused by you, either,

487
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,470
so you don't need to apologize to me.

488
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,040
No.

489
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,470
I asked Yunyan and learnt

490
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,350
she hated you for quitting the marriage.

491
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,350
So I should

492
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,440
be to blame.

493
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,350
Since Miss Ning

494
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,440
told you the real reason,

495
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,750
please tell her

496
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,400
I don't want more people to be involved in it.

497
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,640
So I hope

498
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,520
she can conduct herself well

499
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,680
after this matter.

500
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,830
Miss Jun, don't worry.

501
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,590
They'll be given a lesson.

502
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,470
Miss Jun,

503
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,070
I also want to ask you something

504
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,320
today.

505
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,400
Please go ahead.

506
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,750
How do you know

507
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
it was my birthday date

508
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,560
on the day of the lantern show?

509
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,990
I learnt it

510
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,750
from the marriage contract.

511
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,280
Miss Jun,

512
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,560
is it really

513
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,640
a coincidence?

514
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,230
Childe Ning,

515
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,520
you think too much.

516
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,200
I didn't plan to meet

517
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,110
and play the go game with you

518
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,520
intentionally.

519
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,110
Do I

520
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,990
think so much?

521
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,320
Yes.

522
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,040
Then why did you

523
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,070
give me a lantern?

524
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,110
You knew who I was back then.

525
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,800
Didn't you think

526
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,710
it's improper?

527
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,590
Childe Ning,

528
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,680
I was indeed thoughtless.

529
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
If what I did

530
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,350
perplexes you

531
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,350
and makes you misunderstand me,

532
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,950
I'll apologize to you.

533
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,640
Miss Jun,

534
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,400
no need.

535
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,830
It seems I really think so much.

536
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,280
See you.

537
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,710
Childe Ning,

538
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,680
I know

539
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,230
our engagement

540
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,470
displeases many people.

541
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,350
But

542
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
I have put it down.

543
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,520
Let's put an end to all this.

544
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,830
I had no idea you would come today,

545
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,110
so I didn't prepare tea for you.

546
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,110
Take this pear

547
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,230
as tea.

548
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,400
It turns out

549
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,640
she doesn't adore me.

550
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,990
Our engagement was annulled.

551
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,710
We won't

552
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,950
have any relationship later.

553
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,350
Ning Yunzhao,

554
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,870
she has expressed her meaning

555
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,990
by giving you this pear.

556
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,830
It means

557
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,350
separation.

558
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,440
Don't think that much.

559
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,160
She can do it,

560
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,400
and so do you.

561
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,560
Good pear.

562
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,560
It's sweet.

563
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,350
It's a good gift for other.

564
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,680
But it means

565
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,590
separation.

566
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,070
Did you hear our talk?

567
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,950
I heard it accidentally.

568
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,870
I happened to pass by.

569
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,990
Really?

570
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,590
Yes.

571
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,320
Thank you for saving me today.

572
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,800
I promised you

573
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,040
I would protect you

574
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,640
and ensure you're not hurt.

575
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,870
I asked Zhang Baotang

576
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,520
to investigate the assassin's movements.

577
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,470
It should be the one who framed the Fang family.

578
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,440
I also think so.

579
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,680
Now they're determined

580
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,440
to perish the Fang family.

581
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,680
How are you?

582
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm fine.

583
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,830
It was dangerous

584
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,440
at Jinyun Restaurant today.

585
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,950
Did those men of Arm Moral Department come to catch you?

586
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,950
For the sake of

587
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,990
your safety,

588
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,040
please leave here as soon as possible.

589
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,640
Our deal ends.

590
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,920
Stop investigating this matter again.

591
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,920
Why do you care about me so much?

592
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,160
Do I?

593
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,470
Don't worry about me.

594
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,160
I have a sense of propriety.

595
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,590
Can I ask you a question?

596
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,110
Do you want to ask about the movement of Heavenly Maids Scattering Blossoms?

597
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,280
How do you it's called

598
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,320
Heavenly Maids Scattering Blossoms?

599
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,040
Princess Jiuling once taught me it.

600
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,070
When did you learn

601
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,400
to play the pitch-pot game with her?

602
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,800
In the winter of that year when she was 15.

603
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,560
What about the way of drinking tea?

604
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,830
Why are you

605
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,110
exactly alike?

606
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,350
Princess Jiuling and I were together morning and night,

607
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,830
so she taught me much.

608
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,440
What else did she teach you?

609
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,280
♫Outline in my dream♫

610
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,720
♫can be carved on your face♫

611
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,960
♫Time interlaces in the eye waves♫

612
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,920
♫For unspeakable cause and effect♫

613
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,600
♫Let me weigh every word♫

614
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,200
♫Life is full of twists and turns♫

♫So hard to be free and easy♫

616

♫Tomorrow always comes♫

617
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,000
♫I'd like to entrust myself to you♫

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,760
♫In long silence♫

620
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,320
♫We are far separated by a sea of faces♫

621
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,880
♫What else can I do except for a sigh?♫

622
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,200
♫The rest of my life is bumpy♫

623
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,560

632

♫Tears well up in my eyes♫

637
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,350
Who are you?

638
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,950
Who are you actually?

639
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
I'm Jun Zhenzhen.

640
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,830
Go to the accountant's office with me

641
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,160
tomorrow afternoon.

642
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,440
Mother,

643
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,280
I have something to talk with you.

644
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
I know

645
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,920
you'll leave for the capital city.

646
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,990
I've prepared luggage

647
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,710
and carriage for you.

648
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,280
Thank you, mother.

649
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,160
You're welcome.

650
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,950
Mother,

651
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,200
fix Yunyan's marriage

652
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,160
before I leave.

653
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,200
But you'll leave in three days.

654
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,110
Do you mean

655
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,470
we fix her marriage

656
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,440
in three days?

657
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:14,990
Yes.

658
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,590
She did make a mistake,

659
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,640
but Jun Zhenzhen

660
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,800
should also be to blame.

661
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,040
She's the initiator of evil.

662
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,750
If she hadn't come to break off the engagement…

663
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,320
Mother,

664
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,560
she isn't the initiator of evil.

665
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,990
I vaguely heard something about it.

666
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,520
You know the rights and wrongs

667
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,520
better than I do.

668
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,160
But

669
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,640
it's unnecessary

670
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,280
to fix Yunyan's marriage

671
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,230
so soon.

672
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,640
Mother,

673
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,750
I don't want to let my marriage

674
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,920
be others' bargaining chip anymore.

675
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,990
Yunyan should also

676
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,830
learn to be mature

677
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,110
and know what to do

678
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,070
and what not to do.

679
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,590
We shouldn't allow her

680
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,280
to wantonly enjoy youth

681
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,990
and delay her life.

682
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,800
OK.

683
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,070
I've planned

684
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,070
her marriage

685
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,680
and thought to fix it

686
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
in lunar December this year

687
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,400
and let her marry next year.

688
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,320
Since you can't come back during the Spring Festival this year,

689
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,110
I'll fix her marriage,

690
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,070
so you won't miss it.

691
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,920
Thank you, mother.

692
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,870
Ning Yunyan

693
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
will get married soon.

694
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,680
Really?

695
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,590
I heard that

696
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,870
it's Childe Ning's proposal.

697
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,710
They've seen the matchmaker,

698
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,350
and she will be engaged later.

699
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,200
Don't you know it?

700
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,710
Miss Jun, don't worry.

701
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,440
They'll be given a lesson.

702
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,040
So this is the lesson that

703
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,280
he gave Ning Yunyan.

704
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,590
Your expression tells me that

705
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,920
you've long known it.

706
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,199
Zhenzhen,

707
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
the wedding day of you and Chengyu is near at hand.

708
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,230
Have you tried

709
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,110
all the wedding clothes sent to you?

710
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,400
Are they the right size?

711
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,199
Thank you, aunt.

712
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,869
They fit well.

713
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,400
Do you believe that

714
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,680
she didn't try them at all?

715
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,829
She talked nonsense

716
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,160
and didn't take the marriage seriously at all.

717
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,710
Jinxiu,

718
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,160
stop talking.

719
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,159
Go on eating.

720
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,750
A doctor will come

721
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,710
at 13:00

722
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,440
to check Chengyu's condition again

723
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,870
before the wedding day.

724
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,520
After lunch,

725
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,560
let's go together.

726
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,710
Grandma,

727
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,560
I have something to deal with at 13:00.

728
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,400
So I'm afraid

729
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
I can't go with you.

730
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:45,919
What are you going to do?

731
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,560
Is it more important than Chengyu's condition?

732
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,400
Why must you go

733
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,710
when the doctor comes?

734
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,320
Before the wedding day,

735
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,400
I want to get everything ready.

736
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,519
OK.

737
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,230
Do I need to ask the doctor

738
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,750
about anything?

739
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,680
Can you ask the doctor

740
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,920
to prescribe something more

741
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
to supplement Chengyu's physical strength?

742
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,870
In this way,

743
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,990
he can successfully complete our marriage.

744
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,070
Jun Zhenzhen,

745
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,230
you're shameless.

746
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,800
Chengyu is in poor health,

747
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,350
but you still,

748
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,710
you still want him to take tonics

749
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,680
for your wedding night.

750
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,200
You

751
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,800
are shameless.

752
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:33,950
Jinxiu,

753
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,590
you misunderstand me.

754
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,990
I do so

755
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,440
to hope

756
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,710
Chengyu can

757
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,830
complete our wedding ceremony,

758
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,560
which is also a major event of his life.

759
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,590
You misunderstand me.

760
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,350
You were talkative.

761
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,350
Grandma, I'm full.

762
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,680
Then,

763
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,400
I'm leaving first.

764
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,470
OK.

765
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,750
Mind your own business.

766
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,560
Then come back early.

767
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,560
Jinxiu,

768
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,030
as an

769
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,070
unmarried girl,

770
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,030
be reserved

771
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,870
and don't talk

772
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,830
thoughtlessly.

773
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,070
Mother,

774
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,720
I didn't educate her well.

775
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,240
Grandma,

776
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,640
I see.

777
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,000
Go on with your lunch.

778
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,240
Deshengchang rose in the third year of the Taiyan period.

779
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,550
There're records of accounts in the previous years

780
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,350
when they earned less money,

781
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,000
but why aren't there any records

782
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,510
in the third year of the Taiyan period,

783
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,310
when they earned

784
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,440
more money?

785
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,400
Are there any other account books?

786
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,160
The freight records over the years

787
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,350
and the account books

788
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,160
of Deshengchang branches are all here.

789
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,030
Maybe they were lost

790
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,480
or destroyed.

791
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,200
Destroyed?

792
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,550
If they're really destroyed,

793
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,550
it'll be troublesome.

794
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,240
As many years have passed,

795
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,960
there must be no witnesses and material evidence.

796
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,590
Deshengchang's history of that year

797
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,510
seems to be erased.

798
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,310
Miss Jun,

799
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,510
you've been in Fang's mansion for so long.

800
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,000
Have you seen this pattern?

801
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,480
How did he know this seal pattern?

802
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,240
I've never seen it.

803
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,960
What is it?

804
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,480
Previous shops,

805
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,440
pawnshops and banks

806
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,760
all had their own symbols

807
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,590
to differentiate each other.

808
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,830
I don't know

809
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,550
what this pattern represents, either,

810
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,030
but I feel

811
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,760
it has something to do with what I'm investigating.

812
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,110
But this is not the seal of Deshengchang.

813
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,110
I know it.

814
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,920
The less related the Fang family

815
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,510
and the third year

816
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,550
of the Taiyan period

817
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,440
is to

818
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,480
this pattern,

819
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,350
the safer they will be.

820
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,480
If you see this pattern

821
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,400
in Fang's mansion,

822
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,760
please tell me at once.

823
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,550
OK.

824
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,000
This matter is serious.

825
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,640
Thank you for your help.

826
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,510
Last night,

827
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,200
I'm sorry.

828
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,590
Forget it.

829
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,790
OK.

830
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,000
See you.

831
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,160
What's wrong?

832
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,870
I just can't understand

833
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,350
why you gave up

834
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,440
the engagement with Childe Ning

835
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
but marries Fang Chengyu instead.

836
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,960
What did others say?

837
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,030
Someone said outside that

838
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,070
the Fangs hold

839
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,440
such a grand wedding

840
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,720
to spend some money

841
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,070
for Young Master Fang for the last time.

842
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,720
They said it isn't a wedding at all

843
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,240
but a funeral instead.

844
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,440
Bah, bah, bah.

845
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,640
It's too harsh.

846
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,350
Let them jeer.

847
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,200
After Chengyu gets better,

848
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,830
they will also come

849
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,510
for congratulation.

850
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,110
Wash hands!

851
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,030
In 10-odd years,

852
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,030
I've been engaged three times,

853
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,720
with Lu Yunqi who seemed to be from a dream,

854
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,830
with Childe Ning who's destined to miss me,

855
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,310
and with my cousin in depression and despair.

856
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,270
However, all these three engagements

857
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,590
do not truly belong to me.

858
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,790
Can I have an engagement

859
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,830
that truly belongs to me

860
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,720
in the rest of my life?
