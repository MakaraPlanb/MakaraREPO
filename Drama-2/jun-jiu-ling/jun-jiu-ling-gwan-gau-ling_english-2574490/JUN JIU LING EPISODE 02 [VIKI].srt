00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,590
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,620
♫ Journeying alone and cold, the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

♫ Meeting an old friend, we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,970
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,960
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement with you to surge ♫

19
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,800
Go, bring 2,000 taels.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Wait

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,820
2,000 taels was the price before.

22
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,140
It's changed now. 5,000 taels.

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,310
You!

24
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,800
You raised the price on the spot.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,700
When we saved Lord Ning

26
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,600
since we saved Lord Ning.

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,220
Now, with interest, it's at least 3,000 taels.

28
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,290
The other 2,000 taels is for angering my Grandmother. I'm not happy about it.

29
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,660
What? Lady Ning feels wronged?

30
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,010
Or...do you not think Young Lord Ning isn't worth 5,000 taels?

31
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,360
You!

32
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,260
Mother, you can't!

33
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,770
Enough. Stop with the attitude.

34
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,250
Mother! Why should you give it to her?

35
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,430
Tell her you're not giving her anything and to get out!

36
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,840
If we drag this out it'll hurt your brother's prestige.

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,160
He's about to take his government tests.

38
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,800
Spend a little money for peace.

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,460
Madam

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,780
Mother, I'll give this to her!

41
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,010
Here's the 5,000 taels you wanted.

42
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,170
Here!

43
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,790
If you dare throw it, I'll add another 5,000.

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,920
Here.

45
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,390
Miss, I never thought you'd actually get anything

46
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,240
but you really did it!

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,380
5,000 taels!

48
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,140
I just wanted to get justice. I don't have to have this money

49
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,260
but I don't want Grandmother to suffer over this.

50
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,310
You're returning favors and giving justice to injustice.

51
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,590
Miss,

52
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,180
what are you going to do with all this money?

53
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,060
Go to the Capital.

54
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,910
Zhen Zhen, you really cancelled the engagement?

55
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,140
Yes, cancelled.

56
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,580
It was the fault of the Ning family for insulting me first.

57
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,860
We're in the right.

58
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,590
But since you did this,

59
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,010
this engagement is really cancelled.

60
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,440
Grandmother, it's not sad and I don't regret it.

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,290
This type of family, even if I marry into it, it may not be a good thing.

62
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,750
You cancelled this engagement for a moment of anger.

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,750
Before doing this, you should have discussed it with us.

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,360
They slandered Uncle and angered Grandmother.

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,010
I must get justice.

66
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,540
Zhen Zhen...there are other ways to cancel the engagement.

67
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,360
Exchanging it for money is really...

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,490
This money is to teach them a lesson.

69
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,110
Grandmother, I won't lower my head to make peace with the Ning family.

70
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,750
This engagement...let's just end it here.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,410
This bracelet is for you.

72
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,090
I can't, Grandmother. This is precious to you.

73
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,760
Take it as...wearing it for your mother.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,200
The bracelet went with her

75
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,990
so she owes you one. I'll give it to you.

76
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,150
It looks pretty on you.

77
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,610
Take it as a token from me.

78
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,320
In the future, Fang Mansion will be your home.

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,920
You can live her peacefully.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,740

Father, mother, you came.

85
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,390
This time going to the capital to meet the Emperor...

86
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,240
have you thought how you're going to handle it?

87
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,120
You know why I'm doing this.

88
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,950
His majesty suspects me of selling the roadmap of capital city and leaking our military plan.

89
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,570
This is not trivial.

90
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,010
You can't let your guard down.

91
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,590
Zan'er.

92
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,450
How can we let you go to the Capital like this?

93
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,940
Mother, I'm already grown.

94
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,120
And plus I've been fighting battles with Father over all.

95
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,090
What problems have I not encountered?

96
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,370
What should I be afraid of?

97
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,160
Of course it's other people's intentions.

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,660
You and your father know how to fight and kill on the battlefield.

99
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,020
But the people in the Capital are conniving.

100
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,630
Rest assure

101
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,220
Father has so many people in the Palace.

102
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,380
They'll be sure to protect me.

103
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,110
What I worry about

104
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,280
is Father managing the military by himself.

105
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,300
He'll be too busy.

106
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,080
Don't worry about the issues here.

107
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,440
As long as you come back safe and sound, everything will be fine.

108
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,840
Zan'er, you're fate after returning to the capital is unpredictable.

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,770
You must be cautious.

110
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,090
Have Baotang return with you.

111
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,050
You can take care of each other on the road.

112

117
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,660
His Majesty has already bestowed marriage to Jiuling.

118
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,820
Why go through all the trouble as his official?

119
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,470
Mother, this is...

<i> You are the one and only Princess Jiuling of this world. </i>

180
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,760
<i> Jiuling, once I go, </i>

181
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,550
<i> I don't know when I can come back. </i>

182
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,780
<i> Perhaps one year or perhaps two years. </i>

183
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,140
<i> Perhaps three or four years. Or even longer. </i>

184
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,060
<i> No matter when you come back, I will wait for you here at the capital. </i>

185
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,390
Second brother, don't worry.

186
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,140
The news is not verified yet.

187
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,380
Besides, it is doubtful that it is true.

188
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,960
Although the letter said that Princess Jiuling died,

189
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,150
it also said that she was burned beyond recognition.

190
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,740
Is it possible that it might not be her.

191
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,220
Baotang, what you say could be right.

192
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,210
Continue.

193
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,270
Right, the letter also said,

194
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,240
The old friend of the late emperor, Jun Yingwen, appears 
when Princess Jiuling was imprisoned.

195
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,460
Is there any connection between these two events?
There is something else there.

196
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,710
Where is Jun Yingwen?

197
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,670
His whereabouts is unknown but his daughter, Jun Zhenzhen,

198
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,650
went to her maternal grandmother at Zezhou.

199
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,720
Jun Zhenzhen?

200
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,950
Zezhou?

201
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,720
Let's go to Zezhou.

202
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,980
Second Brother!

203
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,860
Eunuch Wei, I gave you more than 10 people to watch Zhu Zan.

204
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,500
You let him escape.

205
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,990
It is all my fault. Please spare me, Your Majesty.

206
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,460
- Drag him out. 
 - Yes.

207
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,360
Please spare me Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

208
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,240
Your Majesty! Please spare me, Your Majesty!

209
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,810
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

210
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,580
Say, why did this Zhu Zan run away?

211
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,960
Maybe it's because he was worried that he would be punished

212
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,900
for the roadmap of the capital city, so he fled the capital.

213
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,700
If you were Zhu Zan

214
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,580
and you wanted to run away,

215
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,040
would you choose to run away when outside of the capital

216
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,500
or escape to the northern lands?

217
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,650
Look.

218
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,820
Go look for him. No.

219
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,750
Capture him back.

220
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,350
Yes.

221
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,950
What do you

222
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,740
think about Princess Jiuli?

223
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,180
Princess Jiuli has a pure heart and is gentle and respectful.

224
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,030
She is the example of the imperial court.

225
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,910
Will she become a second Jiuling?

226
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,800
On the wedding day, the two princesses did not meet. Jiuling...

227
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,380
After Jiuling passed away,  Princess Jiuli was grieving over her loss.

228
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,510
So I think that she does not know about the late emperor.

229
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,580
That is what you think.

230
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,280
People are unpredictable.

231
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,260
I petition to marry Princess Jiuli.

232
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:17,270
Take your time. Wait after the 100th day of Jiuling's funeral.

233
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,580
Yes.

234
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,180
<i>[Wu De Si]</i>

235
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,400
<i>Family Lu's Ancestor Temple</i>

236
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,590
<i>A girl named Jiu Ling is being blessed by heaven.</i>

237
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,090
<i>Jiuling, did you just leave us like this?</i>

238
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,580
<i>Jiuling, I stopped you at the temple,</i>

239
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,490
<i>to save your life.</i>

240
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,630
<i>I brought people to the celestial prison</i>

241
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,550
<i>to also protect you.</i>

242
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,060
I'm sorry, Jiuling.

243
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,200
I came late.

244
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,080
<i>I calculated the right moment to save you.</i>

245
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,730
Yet I didn't expect

246
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,490
you to die in a fire.

247
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,110
<i>Now,</i>

248
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,630
<i>Chu Rang fears Princess Jiuli and Jiurong.</i>

249
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,100
<i>I can only marry Princess Jiuli</i>

250
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,880
<i>to protect you better.</i>

251
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,790
Now that you are no longer here,

252
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,580
you will protect everything you care about on your behalf.

253
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,390
<i>The third year of Taiyan</i>

254
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,110
The third year of Taiyan.

255
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,210
That year, your grandfather was captured by the people of the Northern region.

256
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,790
This silver was created to pay for his ransom.

257
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,230
We sent this government silver to Zezhou to hand over to the people of the Northern region.

258
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,640
However, they became hostile, broke the agreement and said that we were not trustworthy.

259
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,080
They refused to release your grandfather.

260
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,560
In the end, your grandfather and several uncles

261
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,560
died in the hands of the people from the Northern region.

262
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,790
This was a humiliation.

263
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,750
Government silver? Seal?

264
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,750
<i>Is this the seal to instruct the delivery of the government silver during the third year of Tai Yan?</i>

265
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,650
<i>If I join Fang family to gain experience, perhaps, this is a good opportunity for me to investigate.</i>

266
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,790
<i>[Fang Mansion]</i>

267
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,920
- You both are...
- I'm looking for Miss Jun. Please report to her.

268
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,740
What's your family name?

269
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,360
It's Ling. Please report immediately.

270
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,830
Miss, someone out there is looking for you.

271
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,000
- Looking for me? 
- Yes.

272
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,100
He mentioned that his family name is Ling and he's looking for Miss Jun.

273
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,140
Ling?

274
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,430
Will you meet him?

275
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,040
No. How can she casually meet a man?

276
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,480
Alright. I'm going to reply him.

277
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
Hold on.

278
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,310
Perhaps, I remembered wrongly. I will meet him.

279
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,770
Alright.

280
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,810
Second Brother.

281
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,070
Where is the Mister Ling?

282
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,220
Ba Cheng, you lied. Check first next time before you call our Young Mistress.

283
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,980
Liu'er, he must have made a mistake.

284
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,680
It's fine. Let's go back.

285
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,310
Take a look at the colorful umbrellas.

286
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,560
Buns, just out from the pot.

287
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,250
Let's go.

288
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,680
Second Brother, why isn't she out yet?

289
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,410
- I have already...
- Is Fang Mansion a place for you to mess around? Leave now!

290
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,950
He...

291
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,480
One shouldn't visit with an anonymous name.

292
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,400
I was too abrupt.

293
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,660
We can only wait till Miss Jun goes out.

294
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,800
Second Brother, what about...

295
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,710
that trick?

296
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,960
That trick was used against the soldiers from Northern region. Using this trick on a young lady?

297
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,280
Alright, I'm wrong.

298
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,230
Fine. If we don't use that trick, do you have any good tricks?

299
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,500
Alright. Be there soon.

300
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,240
I heard a female cousin went to De Shengchang shop a few days ago.

301
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,840
<i>I wonder if this is true.</i>

302
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,860
<i>You checked in such details. Are you trying to join the Fang family?</i>

303
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,060
<i>Don't, don't.</i>

304
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,300
<i>Fang family is a dead man's curse. I dare not offend it.</i>

305
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,700
<i>Come, let's drink our tea.</i>

306
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,360
<i>[De Shengchang]</i>

307
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,550
These are the accounts for that year. It's useless to read them.

308
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,090
Miss, take a look.

309
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,110
If there anything you need me to explain?

310
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,300
It's not necessary.

311
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,070
I'm leaving.

312
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,480
Zhenzhen,

313
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,530
familiarize yourself today with these. If you are tired, go back and rest.

314
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,520
Thank you, Older Sister. I'm leaving.

315
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,190
Grandmother was kind to let her learn the accounts. In the end,

316
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,250
she's not interested in De Shengchang at all. She's merely dealing with Grandmother.

317
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,040
Older Sister.

318
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,920
<i>Third year of Taiyan was a long time ago. We must plan to obtain the accounts of that year.</i>

319
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,200
Miss, I think you are not interested in De Shengchang at all.

320
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,800
It's fine.

321
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,950
You are obviously reluctant.

322
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,270
Why don't you go back to the old  lady and do stuff that you like?

323
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,620
Grandmother is doing this for my sake too.

324
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,200
What's going on?

325
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,430
How did you drive the carriage?

326
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,420
Miss, a hand cart was damaged

327
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,990
and blocked the road.

328
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,980
Come.

329
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,330
What's going on?

330
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,470
The wheel of this hand cart is damaged. Take a detour.

331
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,840
Miss, this is bad.

332
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,010
Let's walk. We can take a stroll.

333
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,340
Miss, this is not appropriate. If any mishaps happen along the way,

334
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,850
I can't undertake this responsibility. It's better that I escort you...

335
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,160
It's fine. Don't worry.

336
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,610
Our young mistress came from the capital and didn't get lost. How could she get lost in a small place like Zezhou?

337
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,360
Let's go, Miss.

338
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,410
Liu'er,

339
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,530
it's the job of the carriage driver to escort his passengers safely.

340
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,780
Talk to him nicely in the future. Don't use such attitude with him again.

341
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,480
Miss, you will be bullied by others with your good temper.

342
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,360
No. You are definitely that kind

343
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,450
who treat others politely when they do the same to you.

344
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,400
When others treat you in an arrogant manner, you will retaliate, right?

345
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,170
Why do you say that?

346
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,820
Because you treated Mrs Ning in this way.

347
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,900
Miss, I just passed by a pastry shop.

348
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,620
They looked delicious. Do you want to have some? Want to take a look?

349
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,100
Go and buy them. I will wait here for you.

350
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,010
Miss, are you alone?

351
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,320
Remove your dirty hand from me.

352
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,440
How could such a beautiful lady with a good temper be so irritable?

353
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,040
Don't blame me for being impolite.

354
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,370
Impolite? I'm so scared.

355
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,030
She's being impolite to me. Everyone, take a look.

356
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,910
<i>How could she do this? This is too much. In broad daylight too.</i>

357
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,190
<i>What is she doing?</i>

358
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,560
- Release me.
- Fine.

359
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,670
<i>How insulting.</i>

360
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,720
<i>Stop!</i>

361
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,710
<i>Look.</i>

362
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,160
Let go.

363
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,400
Brat, mind your own business.

364
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,080
Are you alright?

365
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,560
Apologize to her.

366
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,850
Impossible.

367
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,140
I was wrong.

368
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,800
I was wrong.

369
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,320
Firstly, your apology was too soft.

370
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,590
Once more time.

371
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,390
Your so-called apology was because

372
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm highly skilled in martial arts and you were helpless in this situation.

373
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,180
What do you want then?

374
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,740
Miss, what is your wish?

375
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,640
I want to report him to the official.

376
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,550
Miss, I think today was a misunderstanding.

377
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,600
Why not reduce this major problem into a trivial matter? Miss, you are magnanimous.

378
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,920
<i>He escaped.</i>

379
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,340
This little thief was rather formidable.

380
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,730
Don't bother about me. It's fine.

381
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,590
Miss.

382
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,730
I helped you.

383
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,990
Shouldn't you help me too?

384
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,140
Miss.

385
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,380
I forget to bring my wallet. The account is not settled yet.

386
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,000
Can I please know your name?

387
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,300
I will pay my debt tomorrow.

388
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
No need.

389
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,400
Take it as a repayment of your assistance today.

390
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,300
It's right and proper to repay debts.

391
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,000
I must pay my debt.

392
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Mister, do you know that person?

393
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,700
You must be joking.

394
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,800
The hand cart which was damaged and blocked the road was arranged by you too, right?

395
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,210
I think you have misunderstood me.

396
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,200
I have seen this type of trick before.

397
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,700
Miss, since you know,

398
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,300
why would you pay for me? Why not just leave?

399
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,800
I just want to come see what other tricks you have.

400
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,820
I indeed have another thing.

401
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,070
Is your father Jun Yiwen?

402
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,000
Do you know my father?

403
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,800
I heard of him.

404
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,100
You are...?

405
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm Ling Jiu. "Ling" as in "rule" the kingdom. "Jiu" as in "when all's said and done".

406
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,600
Ling Jiu.

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,200
<i>Don't be deceived.</i>

417
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,200
<i> I got it. I'll gift you a name so you will be the one and only. </i>

418
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,600
<i> I'm called Jiuling so you'll be called Lingjiu. What do you think? </i>

419
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
<i> Jiuling and Lingjiu? </i>

420
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,800
<i> - Do you like it? 
 - Yes. </i>

421
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,900
<i> I like it very much! </i>

422
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,660
Lingjiu?

423
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,800
- Miss Jun/ 
 <i> - It's you, Zhu Zan. </i>

424
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
<i> So it's you. </i>

425
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Miss Jun, are you all right?

426
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,500
Miss Jun, I was abrupt today because of someone.

427
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,390
Princess Jiuling.

428
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,800
I know your father and you just left the capital.

429
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,500
Have you seen Princess Jiuling?

430
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,500
I will never harm your father and Princess Jiuling.

431
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,400
Please believe me.

432
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,800
I do not know where they are.

433
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,000
The princess and I have known each other since we were young.

434
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,900
The princess's whereabouts are very important to me.

435
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,200
Where is the princess?

436
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,600
I really do not know.

437
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,800
If you do not believe me, you may ask others.

438
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,500
I shall leave now.

439
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,590
You're back?

440
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Second Brother, how was it?

441
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,400
Your acting is too awful that people see through you.

442
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
Can people see through my acting?

443
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,200
This Miss Jun is very discerning.

444
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,000
What happened afterwards?

445
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Have you found out anything related to Princess Jiuling?

446
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Nothing?

447
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,900
What a waste.

448
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,000

00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,400
♫ <i>It would drift like the rain </i> ♫

523
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,100
♫ <i>Seeing you again as if we’re strangers, I’m wailing in deep sorrow</i> ♫
