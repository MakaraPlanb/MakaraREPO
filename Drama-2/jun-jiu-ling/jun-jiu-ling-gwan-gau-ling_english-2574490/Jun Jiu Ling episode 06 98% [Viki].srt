♫ Sighing at how fleeting life is, the swords tell of the scars ♫

4
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,530
♫ After our meeting, I'm unwilling to separate ♫

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,590
♫ Journeying alone and cold, the past is a secret guarded closely ♫

6
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,810
♫ Hide the love and hate of tonight, stow away the naivety ♫

7
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,820
♫ Meeting an old friend, we look at each other as the memories emerge ♫

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ Only daring to show a bit of gentleness in dreams ♫

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,020
♫ This kiss caused the emotional entanglement with you to surge ♫

10
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:11,370
♫ The warmth in the rough birch disturbs the stars ♫

11
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,320
♫ The art of healing become edges used to guard the mountains and rivers ♫

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,650
♫ Hurt and hatred have not taken over ♫

13
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:31,010
♫ Unwilling to let so much hatred be in this chaotic world, a heart of sincerity in exchange for eternity ♫

14
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,810
♫ Journeying together, waiting for some prosperity ♫

15
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,170
♫ Rewrite this life because looking back, the heart aches ♫

16
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:50,950
♫ For the rest of this life, running in the field with you without any regards, waiting for dawn ♫

17
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:57,370
♫ Dawn... ♫

<i>[Episode 6]</i>

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,650
Why didn't you let Mujin pass me the message,

21
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,320
but instead asked me to meet you here?

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,600
There are so many set of eyes watching in the home.

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,060
This is too risky.

24
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,900
This is a serious matter. It's better for us to discuss a lot of it in person.

25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,070
Mujin can afford the risk of anything going wrong, but can you?

26
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,250
Then please speak quickly.

27
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,920
I'm really worried that Mujin won't be able to handle it if this takes too long.

28
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,770
I checked carefully at the Lantern Festival yesterday night.

29
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,330
I realized that Chengyu's condition is not improving.

30
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,400
He still looks half-dead.

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,780
It seems that the marriage did not help. It won't save his life.

32
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,750
But now, the only problem is if Jun Zhenzhen is using the marriage

33
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,380
to get pregnant with a male offspring of the Fang family.

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,640
What do you mean by that?

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,210
If Jun Zhenzhen dies,

36
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,110
where is the Fang family going to find

37
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,310
another girl who would willingly marry to ward off his illness?

38
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,380
You want to kill Jun Zhenzhen?

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,100
No one is going to kill her.

40
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,900
It's just that she got unlucky and got into an accident.

41
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,620
I'm afraid that this isn't proper.

42
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,600
The Fang family has taken such a fall already.

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,550
A young girl like Jun Zhenzhen isn't able to stir up any trouble.

44
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,560
Don't you think we should give this matter some more thought?

45
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,590
You're afraid?

46
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,320
We can't turn back now.

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,920
Even if you're not looking out for yourself, shouldn't you at least be looking out for Jinxiu?

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,300
Moreover, the success or failure of this plan we've had for over ten years depends on this one action.

49
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,850
I know you're sensible.

50
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,120
As long as you do what I say, Jinxiu will be safe and sound.

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,940
Madame Su just went out to see someone.

52
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,190
That person was very cautious. He covered his face with his cloak and rode away on his carriage.

53
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,330
He made many twists and turns and got rid of the people we sent after him.

54
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,470
I originally thought she had a gentle nature.

55
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,490
Who would've thought that she was a poisonous snake right beside the master's pillow.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,280
Because of the status of the Fang family, you must be very particular in the taking of concubines.

57
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,420
How did Madame Su marry into the family?

58
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,330
It's because of Shopkeeper Song.

59
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,720
Madame Su is Shopkeeper Song's distant cousin.

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,350
She came to Zezhou for help from her cousin when her family was in trouble at the time.

61
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,380
At that time, the master encountered bandits during his escorting of goods,

62
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,020
and Shopkeeper Song risked his life to save him. He took Madame Su as a concubine

63
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,810
- to thank him for his kindness. 
 - Shopkeeper Song.

64
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,290
Shopkeeper Song did the Fang family a favor.

65
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,410
Even if Madame Su did do anything dumb, it should have nothing to do with him.

66
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,760
Are you thinking that Madame Su met with Shopkeeper Song tonight?

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,830
I can't be sure.

68
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,840
It's just that the only person you wouldn't suspect

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,330
is someone like Shopkeeper Song,

70
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,120
who has been with the Fang family for over ten years.

71
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,240
These days, Madame Su repeated uses the sending of soup as an excuse

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,960
to check on Cheng Yu's condition.

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,350
They must be impatient.

74
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,390
But the more impatient they are, the more they give themselves away.

75
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,230
Miss Jun actually agreed to give you the Fang family's freight guest list?

76
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,440
That's weird. Miss Jun has always been cold.

77
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,480
Why would she do such a huge favor for you?

78
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,840
Second Brother, how did you do it?

79
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,410
Could it be that you...

80
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,980
No, no. I'm just kidding.

81
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,240
5,000 taels?

82
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,800
You made a trade with her with the 5,000 taels you earned from her?

83
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,780
Impressive. Very impressive.

84
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,880
- Awesome. 
 - I'm flattered.

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,820
Impressive.

86
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,240
How's it going at the Sky Pavillion? Is there any news from the capital city?

87
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,220
Tell me.

88
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,450
Lu Yunqi is getting married again.

89
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,720
And this time with another princess.

90
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,680
Which princess?

91
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,240
- Second Brother, please don't get mad when I tell you. 
 - Tell me first.

92
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,130
Princess Jiuli.

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,980
And their marriage date is set for Princess Jiuling's birthday.

94
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,900
Second Brother, we talked about not getting angry.

95
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,370
Send more people to surround Prince Huai's residence. Be sure to ensure the safety of Prince Huai and his sister.

96
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,290
No need to ask me for instruction not care about the means.

97
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,340
- Okay, I'll go arrange it now. 
 - Hurry!

98
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay.

99
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm here to visit you again.

100
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,940
This time, I brought your favorite eight-treasure jelly cakes.

101
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,250
I just learned how to make these.

102
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,520
It might not taste that good.

103
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,350
But it's fine.

104
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,760
I'll do better next time.

105
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,880
The first time I saw you...

106
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,250
Actually, I bet you didn't know

107
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,480
that that person was me.

108
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,720
You'll never know.

110
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,320
<i>It's not!</i>

111
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,420
<i>Hit him!</i>

<i>Stop!</i>

114
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,680
<i>Come.</i>

115
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,280
<i>Are you okay?</i>

116
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,000
<i>I'm fine.</i>

117
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,350
Did you know?

118
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,420
From that day on,

119
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,550
I thought about you every day.

120
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
Our big wedding was here at last. 
 <i>[Beloved Wife Princess Jiuling from Husband Lu Yunqi]</i>

121
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,120
But I didn't expect to not get a chance 
 <i>[Beloved Wife Princess Jiuling from Husband Lu Yunqi]</i>

122
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,400
to thank you for saving me.

123
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,530
Jiuling.

124
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't hate me.

125
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,840
I'm getting married again soon.

126
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,660
The bride is Jiuli.

127
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,560
The thing I regret the most

129
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
is not being able to save you.

130
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,880
<i>[Beloved Wife Princess Jiuling from Husband Lu Yunqi]</i>

131
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,530
So the only thing I can do now,

132
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,280
is to take care of your siblings.

133
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,930
His Majesty is already suspecting them.

134
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,820
I can only marry Princess Jiuli

135
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,370
to dispel His Majesty's concerns, and to protect them.

136
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,900
If you knew of this,

137
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,080
you'd forgive me,

138
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,000
right?

<i>Have a look. We have beautiful flowers.</i>

Your wedding dress will be delivered  later today.

144
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,300
I don't understand what you are thinking.

145
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,990
Why do you want to marry Young Master Fang?

146
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,870

We have checked all the security agencies and merchants.

We didn't find anything suspicious.

158
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600

Young Lady! 
 ♫ <i>I’ll eventually be passed by</i> ♫

174
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,300
♫ <i>The wind is in hot pursuit and locked in deadlock with the sky</i> ♫

175
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,880
♫ <i>If memories could speak</i> ♫

176
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,770
♫ <i>I wouldn’t stop shedding tears like the rain</i> ♫

177
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:08,280
♫ <i>It’s hard to see you again. I’m wailing in deep sorrow</i> ♫

178
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
That was close!

179
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,620
Thankfully, the young master stepped out and saved us.

180
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,980
Young Lady, you clearly know the man.

181
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,990
Why did you pretend not to know each other?

182
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,570
There are things that we don't want to make public.

183
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,350
Is it because you are worried that someone might notice?

184
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,510
You are engaged.

185
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,070
And you don't want people to think you are involved with another man?

186
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,680
He's not a bad person. Don't overthink this.

187
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,360
Young Lady,

188
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,430
Do you like him?

189
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,390
Why?

190
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,190
Then I don't understand.

191
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,520
If you don't like him,

192
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,990
It's hard to figure out his whereabouts. He's not very likable.

193
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,590
Yet you tried protecting him, saying that he is not a bad person.

194
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,920
Why would you protect him if you don't like him?

195
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,500
Protecting him doesn't mean that I like him.

196
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,110
It could be out of respect.

197
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,020
What's the difference?

198
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,550
For example, I developed a bad opinion for the Nings because they withdrew from the marriage contract.

199
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,290
Including Young Master Ning.

200
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,460
However, by accident,

201
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,440
We played chess together without knowing each other's identity.

202
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,250
I changed my opinion about him and his way of chess.

203
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,650
This is respect, but not admiration.

204
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,120
So... you respect Young Master Ning,

205
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,410
- But you don't like him. 
 - That's right.

206
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,570
So for that guy, you respect him, but doesn't like him.

207
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,720
You can say that.

208
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,280
Let's go.

209
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,110
Is this a good time?

210
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,920
Why not?

211
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,420
Please come in.

212
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,010
Thank you for what you did earlier.

213
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,350
Not a big deal. Did you offend someone?

214
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,390
There is a needle on the back of the horse.

215
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,350
Just as I have guessed.

216
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,220
It seems that someone wanted to see Young Master Fang getting a boost in health.

217
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,510
It's the same people who poisoned Young Master Fang?

218
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,070
I believe so.

219
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,100
By the way,

220
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,640
I brought this for you.

221
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,690
You are offering a gift from someone else.

222
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,700
If you say so.

223
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,860
How is your wound? Does it still hurt?

224
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,920
I'm fine.

225
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,720
Let me take a look.

226
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,190
- What's wrong? 
 - I can do it myself.

227
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,850
I am a doctor. What were you thinking about?

228
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,030
I can do it myself after you leave.

229
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,350
Sure. I'll leave now.

230
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,900
Wait.

231
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,760
Young Lady Jun, about De Sheng Chang,

232
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,650
Thank you advance for your efforts.

233
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,040
I don't have much time left in Zezhou.

234
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,630
is there something important that you needed to do?

235
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,800
Lu Yunqi is marrying Princess Jiu Li.

236
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,930
His Majesty has agreed.

237
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,950
When?

238
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,170
On Jiuling's birthday. That's why I must

239
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,930
Go to the capital before that.

240
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,180
<i>Lu Yunqi, you are crazy.</i>

241
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,250
Sure, I understand?

242
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,150
I'll leave now.

243
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,650
Grandmother, Aunt,

244
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,850
I wanted to discuss something with you.

245
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,160
Tell us.

246
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,000
Can we have the wedding for Chengyu and I,

247
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,390
Right after the third day of the third month.

248
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,750
Isn't this too soon? I'm worried that we don't have enough time to prepare.

249
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,800
Once we are married, I can start treating Chengyu with the medical bath.

250
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,790
then I can repair his meridians with acupuncture.

251
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,760
Chengyu would soon be able to stand up.

252
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,280
Welcome.

253
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,330
Wow, this is the Jinyun Tower.

254
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,040
I heard they have a lot of rules.

255
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,890
Only on the third day of the third month, anyone can go inside.

256
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,600
I heard that was the condition for the Cheng descendants to move out.

257
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,220
Those people are so curious.

258
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,600
Let's take a look inside.

259
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:22,110
<i>[Jinyun Tower]</i>

260
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,150
- Please come inside. 
 - Young Lady,

261
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,370
There are so much going on here.

262
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,040
Young Lady Jun,  Young Master Ning has reserved Number 3 of the First Class Rooms.

263
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Please follow me.

264
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,090
<i>Please come inside.</i>

265
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,690
<i>Please come inside.</i>

266
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,130
I knew she would be here.

267
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,970
Look at her.

268
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,920
She must be here to seduce the Tenth Young Master.

269
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,480
Don't worry about it. So long as we succeed today,

270
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,800
After my brother finishes the spring exams, he'll be looking for a bride.

271
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,340
I will put in some words for you.

272
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,950
I will feel more at ease if I have a good friend becoming my in-law.

273
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,350
I'm only doing this to help you.

274
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,710
That's not what I am doing this for.

275
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,230
I have given instructions to my servants.

276
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,700
Look.

277
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,470
Young Lady Jun, please have a seat.

278
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,000
This is freshly made tea. Please enjoy.

279
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,340
Is Young Master Ning here?

280
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,850
Young Master Ning will be here shortly. Thank you for your patience.

281
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,840
Sure.

282
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm all set here. You can leave us now.

283
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,380
Yes Ma'am. I'll leave now.

284
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,020
Ning Yunyan?

285
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,720
The tea is drugged.

286
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,990
Liu Er,

287
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,760
Go now.

288
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,250
Sure.

289
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,090
Is everything clear?

290
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,590
Don't worry about it. Leave it to me.

291
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,250
Young Lady Lin and Young Lady Ning will be happy with the results.

292
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,220
Just wait and see. Her reputation will be ruined.

293
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,560
Good. Just be steady.

294
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,500
There will be a handsome reward if you can get it done.

295
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,560
This is what I'm good at.

296
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,010
Good. Follow me.

297
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,920
Coming.

298
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,260
Do I really have to dress like this?

299
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,850
Second Brother, it's the third day of the third month!

300
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,810
We are just looking for a good omen.

301
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,520
Jingyun Tower is the most auspicious place today.

302
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,020
Let's go. Just one peek.

303
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,340
- That's boring. I don't want to go. 
 - Second Brother, please.

304
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,910
Just one peak.

305
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,190
We are almost there. It's right over there.

306
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,040
Give me back my fan.

307
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,850
Just one peak.

308
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,980
I can't believe it really was her.

309
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,300
Young Lady, let's get out of here now.

310
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,500
What happens if the scoundrel comes in?

311
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,000
Even if we run away this time, they will try again.

312
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,400
This is a good opportunity to confront her.

313
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,430
What should we do?

314
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,500
<i>Long time no see.</i>

315
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,000
<i>Come here. Have a seat. Bring some tea please.</i>

316
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,680
Look how lively this place is.

317
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,610
Let's go.

318
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,120
Look. Isn't this nice?

319
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,790
Have you never seen pitch-pot before?

320
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,330
You've been working so hard lately.

321
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,890
Do you not understand we have important business to take care of?

322
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,170
Let's relax a little then attend to the business. You can't be working all the time.

323
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,170
This way.

324
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,110
This is the last time I'll entertain you.

325
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,380
Sure, sure. This is the last time.

326
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,450
Young Master Ning,

327
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,030
This way please.

328
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,720
Why is Young Master Ning here?

329
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,660
There is no need to get nervous.

330
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,890
It's good that my brother is here. He can see with his own eyes how shameless Jun Zhenzhen is.

331
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,960
It's crowded here.

332
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,070
Yunzhao!

333
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,030
What are you thinking about?

334
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,980
Nothing.

335
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,020
You must be looking for the girl who gave you the lantern.

336
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,930
That's right.

337
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,380
I knew it! From how much you treasured the lantern,

338
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,050
I knew immediately.

339
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,900
Brother Wenbin, don't make fun of me.

340
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,880
I just thought the girl was very intelligence, and wanted to make her acquaintance.

341
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,380
I understand.

342
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,540
Yunzhao, you can't be impatient with things like this.

343
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,270
Fate is hard to predict.

344
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,890
When the time is right,

345
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,930
She will naturally appear in front of you.

346
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,720
- Am I right?  
 - I agree.

347
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,590
Ladies and gentlemen

348
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,500
Everyone, can I have your attention please?

349
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,690

378
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,280
Based on what I know about her,

379
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,920
She definitely will.

Five Thousand?

386
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,590
Young Lady, do you know how to pitch-pot?

387
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,410
I didn't expect a pass-time from my childhood,

388
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,020
Would become useful today.

389
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,860
Any challengers?

390
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,280

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,620
And Jun Zhenzhen from First Class Room 3.

393
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,100
Let's welcome,

394
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,040
Our first challenger,

395
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,190
First Class Room

396
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,650
Number 6,

397
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,280
Young Lady Ning Yunyan.

398
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,990
Yanyan?

399
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,510
And First Class Room 3,

400
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,880
- Young Lady Jun Zhenzhen. 
 - Second Brother, look.

401
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,320
<i>Great!</i>

402
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,660
<i>Great!</i>

403
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,760
<i>Great!</i>

404
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,860
Jun Zhenzhen?

405
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,290
Didn't Yunzhao break the marriage contract with her?

406
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,370
That's her?

407
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,700
Did you sign me up?

408
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,400
No.

409
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,880
Who signed me up? And to compete with her?

410
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,080
She doesn't even qualify.

411
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,460
Whose prank is this?

412
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,180
Let's not go.

413
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,570
No way.

414
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,530
They have announced my name.

415
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,860
If I don't show up, that'd be disgrace to the Nings.

416
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,290
I am good at pitch-pot anyways.

417
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,360
I am not afraid of her.

418
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,800
Let's go.

419
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,420
It's her?

420
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,510
<i>- Great, great! 
 - Yes, yes.</i>

421
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,370
Yanyan.

422
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,630
Brother.

423
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,750
Brother!

424
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,830
Childe Ning.

425
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,320
Brother, why didn't you tell me you wanted to come today?

426
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,230
I came on a whim.

427
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,950
I heard your name just now.

428
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,560
Who could the shameless person who signed up for me be?

429
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,080
Brother, since you're here,

430
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,560
why don't you play for me?

431
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,850
Let those who overestimate themselves see your great pitch-pot skills.

432
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,670
Forget it, Yanyan.

433
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,730
- Quit it, Yanyan. 
 - Brother. Brother.

434
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,230
- Go ahead, Childe Ning. 
 - Come on, Yunzhao, Yanyan is begging you.

435
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,760
- You should quit it as well. 
 - Come on! Come on!

436
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,210
Go! Don't keep them waiting, Brother.

437
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,390
No, Yanyan.

438
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,330
Everyone! Next up, let's welcome Childe Ning

439
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,580
in taking Miss Ning Yunyan's place in the pitch-pot game!

440
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,180
Go ahead!

441
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,830
Come on, Brother!

442
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,360
Great!

443
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,010
Great!

444
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,250
Childe Ning.

445
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,360
I'm looking forward to seeing how this ends up.

446
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,370
You don't think Jun Zhenzhen is good at this?

447
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,940
How could she be good at this?

448
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,880
My brother will show her how it's done.

449
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,340
- Let's go upstairs and watch. 
 - Let's go.

450
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,740
I'm sorry, Miss Jun.

451
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,010
It seems that you are in quite a good mood today.

452
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,760
So you're Miss Jun.

453
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,030
- I'm pleased to meet you. 
 - I'm pleased to meet you.

454
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,760
I originally thought that I would only have the pleasure to meet many people once in my lifetime.

455
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,690
But seeing you today, I now think

456
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,730
that it's much more exciting to encounter people for a second time.

457
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,300
Yes. What a coincidence.

458
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,980
You also know how to play the pitch-pot game.

459
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,110
I wonder if you're as good as you are in playing go.

460
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,740
You're flattering me.

461
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,890
It's actually my pleasure to have the opportunity catch a glimpse

462
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,070
of your pitch-potting skills.

463
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,470
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

464
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,690
As long as you don't mind the rumors from those around us.

465
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,450
Their gossiping has nothing to do with us.

466
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,620
The pitch-pot competitors, Miss Jun Zhenzhen and Childe Ning Yunzhao.

467
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,230
All bets go to the winner.

468
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,820
The loser return double the amount to the bettors.

469
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,690
Great!

470
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,300
Yanyan, your brother is about to play. Are we adding our bets?

471
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,950
Of course.

472
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,570
My brother will win us the money.

473
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,830
Please.

474
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,860
Miss Jun, what do you want to pitch?

475
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,150
- Let's raise the stakes first. 
 - All right.

476
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,210
The stakes will be raised!

477
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,180
For the first two rounds, each person gets six arrows.

478
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,870
There are twelve pots in total. Each person gets twelve arrows in the last round.

479
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,270
The person who gets the most arrows in wins. Best of three.

480
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,340
I bet 100 taels on my brother, Childe Ning.

481
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,090
100 taels for Childe Ning.

482
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,940
- 500 taels on Childe Ning. 
 - 100 taels on Childe Ning.

483
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,860
I bet 500 taels on Childe Ning.

484
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:11,960
Great!

485
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,660
Miss Jun, please.

486
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,090
Please.

487
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,790
I'm telling you my brother is very good.

488
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,450
It'll be great.

489
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,500
Great!

490
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,090
Yunzhao is still Yunzhao.

491
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,580
Look. Right?

492
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,950
Wait for Jun Zhenzhen to embarrass herself!

493
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,550
Miss Jun, please.

494
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,180
It was just off by a bit.

495
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,460
I knew she wasn't good.

496
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,610
Childe Ning made all six pitches.

497
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,810
Miss Jun made five out of the six.

498
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,190
Childe Ning wins the first round.

499
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:27,080
- Great! 
 - So impressive!

500
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,000
Miss Jun, your wrist was off by half an inch when you were just pitching.

501
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,660
Be more steady this time.

502
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,540
Thank you for calling my attention to that.

503
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,170
Please.

504
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,280
Miss Jun, please start.

505
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,200
Great!

506
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,230
- Great! 
 - Impressive!

507
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,240
- She's doing well. 
 - She's not bad.

508
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,740
Darn it!

509
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,790
Yunzhao is obviously giving it to her!

510
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,560
He let her win.

511
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,270
- It's fine, it's fine. My brother won't lose. 
 - Miss Jun made all six pitches.

512
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,610
Childe Ning made five out of the six pitches.

513
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,960
Miss Jun wins the second round.

514
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,290
Great!

515
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,900
Miss Jun, we're tied.

516
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,150
You purposely gave me that.

517
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,450
I admit defeat.

518
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,820
You also gave me a round.

519
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,280
Miss Jun, why don't we play a round honestly?

520
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,590
I'll do as you say. I'm willing to do it.

521
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,490
Everyone, it's the last round.

522
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,720
Is there anyone else who wants to bet?

523
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,660
300 taels on Childe Ning.

524
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,450
500 taels on Childe Ning.

525
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,470
- I bet 500 taels. 
 - We're betting

526
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,160
another 1,000 taels on Childe Ning.

527
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,630
Bet on Miss Jun!

528
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,050
Increase the bets.

529
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,580
I bet 1,000 taels on Miss Jun.

530
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,920
1,000 taels?

531
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,360
1,000 taels?

532
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,120
- Great! 
 - How interesting!

533
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,340
I bet another 2,000 taels on my brother.

534
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,410
Sky Room 6 bets another 2,000 taels

535
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,540
on Childe Ning.

536
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,280
Continue!

537
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,910
It seems that this lady is betting against me.

538
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,420
Miss Jun seems outstanding.

539
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,430
I bet another 1,000 taels.

540
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,250
- 4,000 taels. 
 -4,500 taels.

541
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,740
- 5,000 taels. 
 - 5,000 taels!

542
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,520
It's so interesting today.

543
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,290
That's right!

544
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,160
Why is it 5,000 taels again?

545
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,720
Why does the Ning family always have something to do with 5,000 taels?

546
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,900
It's the same people

547
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,120
and the same amount of money.

548
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,110
It's still not certain who the winner is going to be.

549
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,880
When I get double my amount of silver,

550
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,350
don't be jealous!

551
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,230
Please place a bet for me, sir.

552
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,570
I bet 5,000 taels on myself.

553
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,190
- 5,000 taels? 
 - Miss Jun, you...

554
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,400
5,000 taels?

555
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,210
She's willing to spend money and embarrass herself. Why are you still standing there?

556
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,430
Place the bet.

557
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,490
Miss Jun bets 5,000 taels on herself.

558
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,010
- Great! 
 - Impressive!

559
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,770
Please begin.

560
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,930
Great!

561
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,020
Yunzhao, great job!

562
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,090
This...

563
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,060
- What did I tell you? Was I right? 
 - He's so impressive.

564
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,020
He managed to pitch all the arrows into the pots on his first try.

565
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,300
Childe Ning makes all twelve pitches.

566
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,410
Next up, Miss Jun.

567
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,230
You're skills are indeed impressive.

568
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,260
Miss Jun, please.

569
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,710
Jun Zhenzhen, you cheated my family of 5,000 taels with a fake marriage contract in the past.

570
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,780
Let me see how you're going to cheat our money in the eyes of the public!

571
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,300
Yanyan.
