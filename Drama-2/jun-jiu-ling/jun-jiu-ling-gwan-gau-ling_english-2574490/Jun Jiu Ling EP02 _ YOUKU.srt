00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12

♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14

♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,500
Episode 2

17
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,180
Ning Mansion

18
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,780
去
Go.

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,060
Bring 2,000 taels.

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,540
Wait a moment.

21
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,500
2,000 taels was the price just now.

22
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,660
Now it's different.

23
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,940
5,000 taels.

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,520
You?

25
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,540
How dare you raise the price?

26
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,380
My grandfather saved Master Ning

27
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,980
many years ago,

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,020
which deserves

29
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,340
3,000 taels, doesn't it?

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,660
As for the other 2,000 taels,

31
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,100
it's for you irritating my grandmother,

32
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,140
and I'm not okay with it.

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,180
So what?

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,860
Mrs. Ning, you don't want to buy it?

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,860
Or do you think

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,220
Tenth Childe Ning

37
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,820
isn't worth 5,000 taels?

38
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,480
You?

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,100
Mom, you can't do as she said.

40
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,260
Come on. Just stop.

41
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,620
Mom.

42
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,220
How could you promise to give her the money?

43
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,220
You should have let her go

44
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,740
without giving her a dime.

45
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,020
And what could she do?

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,140
Her causing a scene

47
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,580
would affect the fame of your brother.

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,620
He will take the exam next spring,

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,820
which matters more.

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,140
We just pay the money

51
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,860
for his fame.

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,380
Madam.

53
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:14,920
Mom,

54
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,100
I'll send the bank note to her.

55
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,760
Hey.

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,860
The five-thousand-tael bank note you asked.

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,980
Take it.

58
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,780
If you dare to throw it to the ground,

59
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,900
I'll ask for another 5,000 taels.

60
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,660
Your Ladyship,

61
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,820
I thought

62
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,020
you were kidding for asking them to pay a hundredfold or thousandfold price,

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,660
but I'm wrong.

64
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,300
It's five-thousand-tael bank note.

65
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,260
I was just trying for the justice we deserve.

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,020
I would rather not get the sum of money

67
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,860
than have my grandmother suffer that.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,060
You've tried your best.

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,820
And Her Ladyship will understand.

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,260
Your Ladyship,

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,060
what will you do with such a large sum of money?

72
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,180
Go to the capital city.

73
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,900
Zhenzhen,

74
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,500
do you really want to break off the engagement?

75
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,500
Yes.

76
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,340
The Ning family was wrong for humiliating me.

77
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,460
It was their fault for sure.

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,020
But what you did

79
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,659
would entirely ruin the engagement.

80
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,620
Grandma,

81
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,940
it's not a pity.

82
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,300
And I don't regret it.

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I wouldn't be happy

84
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
if I were to

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,060
marry into such a family.

86
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,500
How could you

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,380
break off such a good engagement

88
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,500
due to sentiment?

89
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,540
You should have discussed it

90
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,700
with us before you made up your mind.

91
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,940
They slandered grandfather,

92
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,060
and grandmother got sick because of them.

93
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,900
I couldn't just

94
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
let them go so easily.

95
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,540
Zhenzhen,

96
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,980
you could have figured out another way to break off the engagement

97
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,220
if you really wanted it that much.

98
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,820
It was just so unwise of you to do this

99
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,820
by asking them for money.

100
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,060
They deserved to

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,700
pay us the money.

102
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,060
Grandma,

103
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,580
I won't compromise with the Ning family.

104
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,060
Let's just forget

105
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,980
the engagement.

106
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,180
This bracelet is for you.

107
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,380
Grandma, I can't take it.

108
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,820
It's yours.

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,900
Just regard it as

110
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,780
my present for your mother.

111
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,900
She died with the bracelet

112
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,220
which is supposed to be yours,

113
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,060
so I gave you this as a compensation.

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,060
It looks so good on you.

115
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,820
Take it.

116
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,740
It's my good will.

117
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,060
Don't be that starchy here.

118
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,900
Make yourself at home.

119
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,540
Thank you, Grandma.

120
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,820
Lord Cheng's Mansion

121
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,180
Lord Cheng's son Zhu Zan

122
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,260
Zan'er still doesn't want to take off his armour.
Lord Cheng Zhu Shan  Zhu Zan's mother Ms. Yu

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,860
Zan'er.

124
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,180
Dad.

125
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,680
Mom.

126
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,380
You came.

127
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,020
Zan'er,

128
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,740
have you prepared well

129
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,860
to meet His Majesty?

130
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,620
You knew why I did that.

131
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,780
His Majesty suspected

132
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,500
me of selling the mileage chart of the capital city

133
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,380
and divulging military secrets.

134
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,340
These are huge charges.

135
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,020
You have to deal with them carefully.

136
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,460
Zan'er,

137
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
you'll go back to the capital city.

138
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,220
Your dad and I are

139
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,260
so worried about you.

140
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,100
Mom,

141
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,580
I'm an adult.

142
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,780
And

143
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,660
I've been fighting wars with dad.

144
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,620
I've experienced a lot.

145
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,780
I know how to deal with the situation.

146
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,660
Man's heart is incomprehensible.

147
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,300
Your father and you

148
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,980
are good at fighting wars,

149
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,820
while those who are in the prosperous capital city

150
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,700
are so good at plotting against each other.

151
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,660
Don't worry about me.

152
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,300
Father has so many friends in the imperial government,

153
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,460
who will protect me for sure.

154
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,620
In fact, what I worry about the most

155
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,900
is that father will be

156
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,140
so busy with military business alone.

157
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,140
Don't worry about military business.

158
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,860
All that we want is you coming back safe.

159
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,980
Zan'er,

160
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,220
we don't know

161
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,500
whether you'll be safe this time.

162
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,060
Remember not to drop your guard.

163
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,180
Let Baotang go back with you.

164
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,620
He can protect you on the way.

165
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,860
If something happens,

166
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,020
let the Sky Pavilion take care of it

167
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,580
as we used to do.

168
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,980
Sanbing will have to stay

169
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,620
in the north backland

170
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,700
to deal with military business.

171
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,420
Zan'er,

172
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,940
His Majesty has granted a marriage to Jiuling.

173
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,580
What else can you do

174
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,940
as an official of His Majesty?

175
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,780
Mom,

176
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,340
this is the present I prepared

177
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,220
for Jiuling's wedding.

178
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,740
I've grown up.

179
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,340
I won't cause a scene.

180
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,340
Okay.

181
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,660
Zan'er will set out soon.

182
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,380
Let him package his things up.

183
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,820
Let's go.

184
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,660
Dad.

185
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,460
Mom.

186
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,140
I'm leaving.

187
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,980
Please allow me to bow to you.

188
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,100
Go.

189
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,220
Go.

190
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,460
Cheers, Second Brother.

191
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,440
Cheers.

192
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,000
Drink it.

193
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,100
It tastes good.

194
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,900
Yeah.

195
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,400
Second Brother,

196
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,380
Zhu Zan's sworn brother Zhang Baotang
those flunkies of the Arm Moral Department

197
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,260
are watching us

198
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,740
so firmly.

199
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,660
Waiter.

200
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,340
Bring us dishes.

201
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,100
We're hungry.

202
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
One more shot, Second Brother.

203
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,020
Come on. Try this.

204
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,340
Cheers. Cheers.

205
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,260
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

206
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,620
Sir, here's your noodle.

207
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,980
Sir, I'm so sorry.

208
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,640
Sir.

209
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,060
Sir.

210
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,780
I'm so sorry.

211
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,060
Sir, I'm so sorry.

212
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,980
The waiter is a new comer.

213
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,620
He's a green hand.

214
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,180
Please tell me

215
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,900
what I can do for you.

216
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,180
The one from

217
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,260
the Sky Pavilion is still that mysterious.

218
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:04,960
Back off.

219
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,610
Yes. Yes. Yes.

220
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,290
Thank you, Sir.

221
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,790
Eunuch Li,

222
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,190
I'll go clean the mess.

223
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,230
Sir, are you okay?

224
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,990
The waiter was so careless.

225
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,590
Everyone, sit down.

226
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,310
Okay. Have a seat. Let's sit down.

227
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,530
What's up?

228
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,950
Nothing.

229
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,750
Let's just enjoy the meal first.

230
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,330
Give it to me.

231
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,270
It's nothing. I mean it.

232
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,550
Let's just enjoy the meal first.

233
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,390
Give it to me.

234
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,870
The information I got might not be true.

235
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,510
Let me go confirm it, will you?

236
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,190
Enjoy the meal.

237
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,710
Second Brother.

238
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,750
I mean…

239
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,670
Jiuling

240
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,910
died?

241
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,430
The letter says so.

242
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,390
But don't be that sad, Second Brother.

243
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:06,950
Maybe…

244
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,190
Sir,

245
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,890
he drank too much.

246
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,390
He drank too much.

247
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:11,830
Sir,

248
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,710
I'll go check him.

249
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,470
You're a teenage hero, aren't you?
Chu Jiuling Junior

250
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,870
Of course.

251
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,990
I'll go

252
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,350
garrison the frontier with my father.
Zhu Zan Junior

253
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,230
How come you remember to praise me

254
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,070
when I'm leaving?

255
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,550
Will you miss me?

256
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,310
Of course not.

257
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,270
I was just kidding.

258
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,670
Of course I'll miss you.

259
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,630
You're the one and only one

260
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,990
I'll miss

261
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,990
in the capital city.

262
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,350
Am I that different?

263
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,990
You're so different.

264
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,750
You're unique, the only Princess Jiuling.

265
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,350
Jiuling,

266
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,270
I don't know

267
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,350
when I can come back.

268
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,510
Maybe one year.

269
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,950
Maybe two.

270
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,990
Or maybe three or four years.

271
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,430
Or longer.

272
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,550
No matter when you come back,

273
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,950
I'll be waiting for you in the capital city.

274
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,070
Second Brother,

275
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,270
don't be that worried.

276
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
The letter hasn't been confirmed yet. Right?

277
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,080
I'm suspicious of its authenticity.

278
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
The letter says

279
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Princess Jiuling…

280
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,000
But…

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But the letter also says

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,280
her body can't be recognized.

283
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Is there a chance that

284
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,520
it's not Princess Jiuling?

285
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,040
Baotang,

286
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,960
you're right.

287
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,200
Go on.

288
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,060
Well.

289
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,720
The letter also says

290
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,880
Jun Yingwen, an old friend of the deceased emperor,

291
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
appeared on the day Princess Jiuling was locked up.

292
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,640
So is there a connection between the two things?

293
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,080
Something might be behind it.

294
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
Where is

295
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,920
Jun Yingwen?

296
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,640
He's missing.

297
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,200
But his daughter, Jun Zhenzhen,

298
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,560
went to Zezhou.

299
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,520
She went to her grandmother's place.

300
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Jun Zhenzhen?

301
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Zezhou?

302
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,760
Let's go to Zezhou.

303
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,040
Second Brother.

304
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,320
Eunuch Li,

305
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,680
I sent you a dozen people

306
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,080
to watch Zhu Zan.

307
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,480
How could you let him run away?

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,700
It's…

309
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,760
It's all my fault.

310
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,320
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

311
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,680
Drag him away.

312
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes.

313
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,239
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

314
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,080
Your Majesty.

315
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,640
Your Majesty.

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,840
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

317
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
Your Majesty.

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Your Majesty.

319
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,160
I mean, why did Zhu Zan

320
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,480
run away?

321
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Maybe he was afraid

322
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,280
that he would be

323
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,880
punished for

324
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
the mileage chart of the capital city thing,

325
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,120
so he ran away from the capital city.

326
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
If you were Zhu Zan,

327
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,080
when would you choose to run away?

328
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,920
When you've been

329
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,320
close to the capital city

330
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,400
or you're in the north backland?

331
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,000
Find him.

332
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
Go find him back.

333
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,860
No.

334
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,760
Arrest him.

335
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,280
Yes.

336
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
What do you

337
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,240
think of

338
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,600
Princess Jiuli?

339
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,760
Princess Jiuli?

340
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,200
She's pure,

341
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,440
kind, gorgeous and thrifty.

342
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,840
She's really a model

343
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
of the girls in our country.

344
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,680
Could she become

345
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,880
another Jiuling?

346
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,640
The two princesses didn't meet

347
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,000
on the wedding day.

348
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,120
Jiuling…

349
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,840
When Jiuling died,

350
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,040
Princess Jiuli was immersed

351
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,960
in the deep sorrow of losing her relative.

352
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,040
So

353
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,880
I think

354
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,080
she shouldn't know the thing of the late emperor.

355
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,440
That's your point of view.

356
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,000
It's hard to know a person's real thought.

357
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,640
Your Majesty,

358
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,880
could you please marry

359
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,160
Princess Jiuli to me?

360
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,140
Don't rush.

361
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,420
It can wait until

362
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,460
the 100th day of Jiuling's death.

363
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,660
Yes.

364
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,420
Ancestral Temple of the Lu Clan

365
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,580
My daughter, Jiuling

366
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,620
went to heaven.

367
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,740
Jiuling,

368
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,140
did you go to heaven?

369
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,420
Jiuling,

370
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,620
why I stopped you in the hall

371
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,660
was to protect you.

372
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,020
Why I led people to the imperial prison

373
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,500
was to save you.

374
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,020
I'm sorry, Jiuling.

375
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,100
I arrived there too late.

376
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,500
I had figured out the best timing of coming to your rescue.

377
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,340
But I didn't expect

378
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,380
you would die in the big fire.

379
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,140
Now

380
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,340
Chu Rang is alert to Princess Jiuli,

381
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,060
and Jiurong.

382
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,420
I'll be able to protect them well

383
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,860
if I marry Princess Jiuli.

384
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,420
You died,

385
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,980
but I'll protect the persons you care about

386
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,620
for you.

387
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,860
Fang Mansion

388
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,940
The third year of Taiyan.

389
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,620
Your grandfather

390
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,180
was caught by Beiqi people.

391
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,980
We made the taels

392
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,620
to save him from Beiqi.

393
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,260
We sent these official taels to Zezhou,

394
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,580
and gave them to Beiqi people.

395
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,060
But they broke the promise.

396
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,060
And they accused us of breaking our word.

397
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,100
They refused to release your grandfather.

398
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,180
In the end,

399
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,820
your grandfather and your uncles

400
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,460
died in Beiqi.

401
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,020
The third year of Taiyan National Treasury
It's a huge humiliation.

402
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,780
Official taels?

403
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,340
A paper strip for sealing?

404
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,340
Is this the shipment paper strip

405
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,820
which was used to seal the official taels in the third year of Taiyan?

406
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,060
Working in the commercial house of the Fang family

407
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,420
might be a good chance to figure the thing out.

408
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,340
Flower umbrellas.

409
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,900
Come and have a look.

410
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,700
This one is good.

411
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,420
Come and have a look.

412
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,420
Please take your time.

413
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,260
It's fresh. It's fresh.

414
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,820
I want this. I want it.

415
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,740
Okay. Sure.

416
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,620
Who are you?

417
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,380
I'm looking for Miss Jun.

418
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,940
Could you please

419
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
report it for me?

420
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,580
What's your surname?

421
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,060
It's Ling.

422
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,220
I'll be back soon.

423
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,820
Your Ladyship,

424
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,940
someone is looking for you.

425
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,220
Me?

426
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,900
Yes.

427
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,820
His surname is Ling.

428
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,780
He said

429
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,820
he was looking for you.

430
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,140
Ling?

431
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,900
Well,

432
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,260
will you meet him?

433
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,140
No. Of course not.

434
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,740
How could Her Ladyship meet a strange man?

435
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,620
Okay.

436
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,820
I'll ask him to leave.

437
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,180
Wait.

438
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,220
Maybe I know him.

439
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,340
I'll meet him.

440
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,020
Yes.

441
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,000
Second Brother.

442
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,980
Second Brother. Second Brother.

443
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,860
Well, where's Childe Ling?

444
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,060
He must be a liar.

445
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,140
You'll have to confirm his identity

446
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,100
when you report to Her Ladyship.

447
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,820
Liu'er.

448
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,300
You might mistake him.

449
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,420
That's fine.

450
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,540
Let's go back.

451
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,660
Have a look at the flower umbrellas.

452
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,420
Flower umbrellas.

453
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,660
Have a look at the flower umbrellas.

454
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,260
Steamed buns.

455
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,580
Fresh steamed buns.

456
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,100
Let's go.

457
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,020
Second Brother,

458
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,740
how come she hasn't appeared?

459
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,740
I've…

460
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,380
How dare you knock at the door of the Fang Mansion again?

461
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,260
Hurry and leave.

462
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,540
I wanted to meet her but refused to reveal my name.

463
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,300
It's so impolite of me.

464
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,420
We can only meet her when she goes out.

465
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,260
Second Brother,

466
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,780
shall we

467
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,500
try that?

468
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,540
That trick is for the Beiqi soldiers.

469
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,460
How could we use it on a lady?

470
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,540
Got it. Got it. Got it.

471
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,020
I'm wrong.

472
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,540
I'm so wrong.

473
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,980
Okay.

474
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,740
We won't use that.

475
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,980
Then what else can we do?

476
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,740
Okay.

477
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,660
I'm coming.

478
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,780
I heard a lady, a new comer,

479
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,060
was working in Deshengchang.

480
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,140
But I haven't confirmed the news.

481
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,020
Why do you care about it so much?

482
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,700
Do you want to be a matrilocal son-in-law of the Fang family?

483
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,580
No. No. No.

484
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,740
Men of the Fang family won't get a good ending.

485
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,660
I don't want to be one of them.

486
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,820
Come on. Have some tea.

487
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,320
Okay. Sure.

488
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,920
Have it. Have it. Have it.

489
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,420
Deshengchang
Hurry up. Hurry up.

490
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:26,980
Please take your time.

491
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,260
These are the account books of this month,

492
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,220
which are useless for me.

493
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,220
Your Ladyship.

494
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,620
Your Ladyship.

495
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,820
Do you need me

496
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,740
to explain it to you?

497
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,740
No need.

498
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,830
Well,

499
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,870
I'm leaving first.

500
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,390
Zhenzhen,

501
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,390
you just need to know something about how the commercial house works today.

502
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,590
If you get tired,

503
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,070
feel free to go back and have a rest.

504
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,830
Sister, thank you so much.

505
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,430
Then I'm leaving first.

506
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,750
Grandmother let her learn to read account books out of kindness.

507
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,310
You know what?

508
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,950
She's not interested in the business of Deshengchang at all.

509
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,950
Instead, she's giving grandmother the runaround.

510
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,910
Come on, Sister.

511
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,030
The third year of Taiyan is a long time ago.

512
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,110
I have to figure out a way to get the account book of that year.

513
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,550
Your Ladyship,

514
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,790
I mean you're not interested in

515
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,230
the business of Deshengchang at all.

516
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,030
I'm not.

517
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,190
You look reluctant.

518
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,350
Why didn't you just refuse the requirement of the dowager?

519
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,150
Then you would be able to do something you really liked.

520
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,670
Grandmother asked me to do this for my sake.

521
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,270
What's up?

522
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,870
How did you drive the coach?

523
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,070
Your Ladyship,

524
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,030
a handcart broke,

525
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,630
which blocked our way.

526
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,550
This way, please.

527
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,050
Please.

528
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,990
What happened?

529
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,430
The wheel of the handcart broke.

530
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,310
You'll have to choose another route.

531
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,070
Your Ladyship,

532
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,670
what should we do now?

533
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,870
We'll walk.

534
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,430
And we can wander around.

535
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,830
Your Ladyship,

536
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,030
it's not a good idea.

537
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,950
If you come across an accident on your way,

538
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,110
I can't take the responsibility.

539
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,030
Let me send you back.

540
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,590
That's fine.

541
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,390
Don't worry about that.

542
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,350
We came all the way to Zezhou

543
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,670
from the capital city safe.

544
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,870
We can certainly

545
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,790
take care of ourselves here.

546
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,270
Let's go. -Your Ladyship.

547
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,270
Liu'er.

548
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,030
A carter's duty is to fetch people safe.

549
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,150
Be nice

550
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,390
to him. Okay?

551
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,630
Don't talk to him that rudely.

552
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,470
Your Ladyship,

553
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,430
you might be bullied

554
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,590
if you're so nice to everyone.

555
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,070
No.

556
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,230
I think you'll be nice to

557
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,190
those who

558
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,310
are polite to you,

559
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,430
while you'll treat the impolite people

560
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,710
the same way as they do.

561
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,230
Right?

562
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,030
Why do you think so?

563
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,790
Because that was how you treated Mrs. Ning.

564
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,990
Your Ladyship,

565
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,710
I passed a cake shop just now.

566
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,230
The cakes there look pretty good.

567
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,430
Do you want to try it?

568
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,150
Come here and take a look.

569
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,790
Go buy some.

570
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,230
I'll wait for you here.

571
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,030
Miss,

572
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,990
are you alone?

573
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,070
Take your hand away from me.

574
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,110
You look so gorgeous.

575
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,310
But how come you're so rude?

576
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,990
You'll regret for what you did.

577
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,750
Will I?

578
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,070
I'm so scared.

579
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,990
Miss, I'm looking forward to what you'll do.

580
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,630
How could he do that to a lady?

581
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,990
It's too much.

582
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,670
How could he do this in broad daylight?

583
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,870
What's he doing?

584
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,870
Let go of me.

585
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,370
Okay.

586
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,590
He's so rude.

587
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,250
Stop.

588
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,510
See. See.

589
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:04,850
Brat,

590
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,930
it's none of your business.

591
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:07,930
Are you alright?

592
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,290
Apologize to this lady.

593
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,530
No way.

594
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,050
I'm sorry.

595
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,450
I'm sorry.

596
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,650
First,

597
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,850
your voice was too light.

598
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:28,970
Second,

599
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,690
you making the apology

600
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,970
was because you were overwhelmed

601
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,370
by my excellent martial arts.

602
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,530
Then what else do you want me to do?

603
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,410
Miss, what do you think?

604
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,610
I'm going to notify the local government.

605
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,050
Miss,

606
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,330
it's merely a misunderstanding.

607
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,530
We can deal with

608
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,370
it by ourselves.

609
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,610
Miss, I know you're generous.

610
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,370
He's running away. He's running away.

611
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,770
That brat

612
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,370
is kind of powerful.

613
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,050
Don't worry about me.

614
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,730
I'm fine.

615
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,610
Miss,

616
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,130
I helped you.

617
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,890
So, could I ask you for a favor?

618
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,170
I don't have my purse with me.

619
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,610
And I haven't paid the bill yet.

620
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,330
Could I know your name, Miss?

621
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,450
I'll pay you

622
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,730
a visit tomorrow.

623
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,690
And I'll send the taels back to you.

624
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,050
No need.

625
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,330
You can regard that

626
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,210
as my appreciation for your help.

627
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,210
I have to pay you back,

628
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:51,930
which is necessary.

629
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:52,930
I have to send the money

630
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,810
to you.

631
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,450
You know that man, don't you?

632
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,450
Miss, are you kidding me?

633
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,210
Of course I don't know him.

634
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,450
The goods dropping from the broken handcart

635
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,810
which blocked my way

636
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,050
were also arranged by you.

637
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:09,810
I think

638
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,290
you got me wrong.

639
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,330
I've seen so many tricks

640
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,330
like what you did before.

641
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,330
Miss,

642
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,210
you've known everything.

643
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,810
How come you still paid the bill for me

644
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,170
instead of leaving?

645
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,450
I wanted to know

646
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,970
what else you'd like to do.

647
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,570
There's really another thing that I want to do.

648
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,050
I do want to know

649
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,090
whether your father is Jun Yingwen.

650
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,730
You know my father?

651
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:42,810
Sort of.

652
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,530
Who are you?

653
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,050
I'm Ling Jiu.

654
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,210
Ling means ruling the world

655
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,450
while Jiu means the end of everything.

656
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,570
I'm Ling Jiu.

657
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,570
Whenever you come back,

658
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,050
you should write a letter to me in advance.

659
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,290
Then I'll be waiting for you at the gate of the city.

660
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,210
Are you sure?

661
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,690
No matter how long it takes?

662
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,090
I've never lied to you, have I?

663
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:08,910
But…

664
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,170
But if I would be away from you for so many years,

665
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,850
you wouldn't be able to

666
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,530
recognize me after so many years.

667
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,210
What would you do?

668
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,570
If someone would

669
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,570
pretend to be me,

670
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,210
you couldn't trust him.

671
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,450
I come up with an idea.

672
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,970
I'll give you a name.

673
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,530
Then you'll be unique to me.

674
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,210
My name is Jiuling.

675
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,090
Then yours can be Ling Jiu.

676
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,810
Okay?

677
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,450
You're Jiuling

678
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,290
while I'm Ling Jiu.

679
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,210
Do you like it?

680
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,650
Yes, I do.

681
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,810
Ling Jiu.

682
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:45,730
Miss Jun.

683
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,690
It's you.

684
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,210
Zhu Zan.

685
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,930
You're Zhu Zan.

686
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:50,690
Miss Jun,

687
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,330
are you okay?

688
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,460
Miss Jun,

689
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,420
all that I did today

690
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,540
is because of a person,

691
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
Princess Jiuling.

692
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,300
I got to know your father and you have just left the capital city.

693
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,339
Has your father met Princess Jiuling?

694
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,059
I won't do anything to hurt your father and Princess Jiuling.

695
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,420
Please trust me.

696
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,820
I really don't know where they are.

697
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,660
Princess Jiuling and I have known each other since childhood.

698
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,820
Where the princess is means so much to me.

699
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,180
Then where is your father?

700
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,540
I really don't know.

701
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,340
If you don't believe me,

702
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,820
you can ask someone else.

703
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,580
See you.

704
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,460
You came back.

705
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,080
Second Brother,

706
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,080
how is it going?

707
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,300
Your acting skill is terrible.

708
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,580
She knew everything from the very beginning.

709
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,300
How could it happen?

710
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,420
That Miss Jun is

711
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,220
far smarter than I thought.

712
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,140
Then…

713
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,940
What happened later?

714
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,740
Have you known where Jun Yingwen

715
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,980
and the princess are?

716
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,460
You haven't?

717
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,500
Then

718
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,820
we did everything in vain, didn't we?

719
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,820
I feel she hid something from me.

752
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,140
♫You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again♫

753
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,480
♫Tears well up in my eyes♫

754
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,320
Jun Zhenzhen must know where Jiuling is.

755
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,480
She doesn't dare to tell me the truth, does she?

756
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,040
Was it Jiuling who taught her

757
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,400
to splash rose petals on tea?

758
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,840
Second Brother,

759
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,000
don't think about it anymore.

760
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,080
Take a rest.

761
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,900
Enjoy the meal.

762
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,000
Try this.

763
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,840
It's so delicious.

764
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,120
It's empty.

765
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,240
Try another one.

766
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
See. When it's closed,

767
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,600
I don't know whether it's empty.

768
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,360
What's up?

769
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,760
Saving the princess

770
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,080
and keeping it a secret would be a huge crime.

771
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,560
Even if I told her who I am,

772
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,760
she wouldn't let her guard down since

773
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,800
we don't know each other well.

774
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,680
Then what should we do?

775
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,080
If Mr. Jun and Jiuling are safe,

776
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,440
and they can't show up,

777
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,960
then daily necessities will be a big problem.

778
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
If Jun Zhenzhen does know where they are,

779
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,560
she will definitely go to their place.

780
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,880
Your Ladyship,

781
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,520
that one seems to be Fang Chengyu, the legitimate son of the Fang family.

782
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,040
You're Jun Zhenzhen,

783
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,160
the so-called cousin of me. Right?

784
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,800
♫Outline in my dream♫
