00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

Episode 3

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,260
Young Master of the Fang family Fang Chengyu

18
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,380
Fang Mansion

19
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,510
Ning Mansion

20
00:29:22,990 --> 00:02:17,990
Young Master of the Ning family Ning Yunzhao

21
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,560
Your Ladyship,

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,070
that one seems to

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,080
be Fang Chengyu,

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,030
the legitimate son of the Fang family.

25
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,760
You're Jun Zhenzhen,

26
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,790
the so-called cousin of me. Right?

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,520
Well,

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,950
you're supposed to call me sister.

29
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,390
Hasn't anyone told you

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,590
that I'm the one

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,320
and only one

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,950
who can come here?

33
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,040
Yuxiu seemed to tell me so,

34
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,590
but I forgot to tell you.

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,550
The scenery here looks so good today,

36
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,520
so I came.

37
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,230
I hope you don't mind.

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,070
We shouldn't meet later.

39
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,000
You said you come from a family of academics,

40
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,360
so you should know

41
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,830
not to look at things that you're not allowed to see.

42
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,150
Santao,

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,320
let's go.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,510
This young master of the Fang family

45
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,080
is fifteen years old.

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
But he has never been out.

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,080
It's heard that

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,830
he got a strange disease

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,000
and might not be able to live long.

50
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,800
Liu'er,

51
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,440
go enquire about

52
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,360
when he got the disease

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,040
and who has been curing

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,720
and prescribing him.

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,720
Sure.

56
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,040
I'll go.

57
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,080
Your Ladyship,

58
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,640
you know what I got?

59
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,550
It's just so appalling.

60
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,910
The men of the Fang family are under a curse.

61
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Hey, girl,

62
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,799
don't spread rumor.

63
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,000
It's not.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,910
The previous master of the Fang family died violently.

65
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,880
The old master was kidnapped and killed.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
And the young master, who's the only son of the Fang family,

67
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,240
is born weak.

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
He was sick seriously

69
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,190
at the age of five.

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,190
The doctor said

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,910
he wouldn't live to sixteen years old.

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,160
Sixteen years old?

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,830
Then he has less than a year, doesn't he?

74
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,190
Yeah.

75
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,390
That's why I said they're under a curse.

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,670
Such a big and rich family is meaningless.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,830
It has only been prosperous for three generations,

78
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,190
but their heir is about to die.

79
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,360
Stop. Stop. Stop.

80
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
Just cut your nonsense.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,160
I was wondering where these books were.

82
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,160
You seem to have a bad memory.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
You're not welcome.

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,470
I don't care.

85
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll only stay here for half of a day.

86
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Do you mean

87
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,160
you can read all these books in half of a day?

88
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,440
Sort of.

89
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,800
Miss Jun is really a genius.

90
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,160
Thank you for saying that.

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,030
Which book are you looking for?

92
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm not looking for a book.

93
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm reading.

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,910
Do you want to…?

95
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,430
Shut up.

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,960
Are you sick?

97
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,240
It's you who are sick,

98
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,870
Brother.

99
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,520
You're right.

100
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,590
I'm sick.

101
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,710
And I shouldn't

102
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,800
judge you who're healthy.

103
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,360
Time is always

104
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,750
enough for a healthy person.

105
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,470
I won't waste my time,

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,310
but I mean I can try to cure you.

107
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,280
Santao,

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,870
let's go.

109
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,310
He's not sick

110
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,280
but poisoned.

111
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,800
Zan,

112
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,430
we've been waiting here for half of a day,

113
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,470
but Miss Jun hasn't showed up.

114
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,400
We'll keep waiting.

115
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,640
She will go out anyway.

116
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,560
Boss,

117
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,680
another pot of water, please.

118
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,190
Okay.

119
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,590
Childes,

120
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,080
please wait.

121
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,150
These two treatments

122
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,910
should be feasible for his symptoms.

123
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,520
Taking baths to detox.

124
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,960
Your Ladyship,

125
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,520
the dowager invited you to go to her place.

126
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,430
Okay, I'm on my way.

127
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,080
You met

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,150
Chengyu today,

129
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,840
didn't you?

130
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,590
Yes.

131
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,150
Don't do that again later.

132
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,840
Don't go to the places

133
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,800
he goes.

134
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,960
Grandma,

135
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,150
I'd like to

136
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,990
try to cure Chengyu.

137
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,080
No need.

138
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,560
You won't have a chance to make it.

139
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,750
Giving him hope but

140
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,840
depriving him of it in the end

141
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,430
would be way

142
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,430
too cruel for him.

143
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,520
Chengyu is not sick

144
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,400
but poisoned.

145
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,590
You knew it?

146
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,080
Why do you think

147
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,150
he's not sick

148
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,120
but poisoned?

149
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,310
I checked his pulses today.

150
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,870
I found he's been poisoned for many years.

151
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,990
It's you

152
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,190
who have been poisoning him?

153
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,520
I don't understand.

154
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,560
Could I ask

155
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,800
why you did this to him?

156
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,360
Chengyu was sick seriously at the age of five.

157
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,990
He has been taking the poison

158
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,990
every day since then.

159
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,640
This kind of poison is the only way to control his sickness.

160
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
If he hadn't taken it,

161
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,710
he would have died already.

162
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,910
The noble doctor who prescribed him

163
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,990
died long before.

164
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,800
No other doctor can figure out another way to cure him.

165
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,870
We had no choice but to let him take the poison

166
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,030
to keep him alive.

167
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,240
The prescription seemed

168
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,310
to be a good treatment,

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,710
but it would poison him

170
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,360
if he took it for a long time.

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,400
He wouldn't become better

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,870
if he didn't take it.

173
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,990
Even if he took it,

174
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,080
he would only be in a stable situation for the time being.

175
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,590
He would die immediately if he didn't take the poison.

176
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,400
But taking that poison could keep him alive.

177
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,360
That's our last option.

178
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,360
Nope.

179
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,670
Aunt,

180
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,870
it was not your last option.

181
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,080
Someone misled you on purpose.

182
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,870
Chengyu is seriously poisoned

183
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,920
due to the prescription,

184
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,430
which causes the situation now.

185
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,640
Chengyu didn't get

186
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,040
an untreatable disease that year.

187
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,600
That the one misled you

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,990
by letting Chengyu take the poison

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,040
for so many years was to ruin him.

190
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,550
Who is that?

191
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,430
How come the one is so vicious

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,110
that he wants to ruin our family?

193
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,110
The one behind this must hide himself so well.

194
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
If I guess right,

195
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,310
he must be someone in the Fang family.

196
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,670
What's the most urgent

197
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,870
is to cure Chengyu as soon as possible.

198
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,350
Please let me try.

199
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,670
Mother,

200
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,720
please let Zhenzhen have a try, will you?

201
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,480
Grandma,

202
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,040
could I have a look at that prescription?

203
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,750
I'll be free.

204
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,920
It's almost the end.

205
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,550
Zhenzhen.

206
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,640
Why does grandma have a seal of this pattern?

207
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,920
Zhenzhen?

208
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,400
Something is wrong.

209
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,840
Aunt,

210
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,750
Chengyu can still use this prescription

211
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,230
before I make him a new one.

212
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,750
Then the one behind won't suspect a thing.

213
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,400
Okay.

214
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Grandma,

215
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,110
I'm

216
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,870
leaving first.

217
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,400
Wait.

218
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,190
Zhenzhen,

219
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,670
remember to keep this a secret.

220
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,080
Only

221
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,790
the three of us know the truth.

222
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,400
Sure.

223
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,550
Rest assured, Grandma.

224
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,720
The Fang family,

225
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,670
the seal,

226
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,520
the paper strip for sealing.

227
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,430
What on earth are the connections among these?

228
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,640
Is the Fang family also involved in the secret event of Zezhou?

229
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,520
Where's the one

230
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,670
who intended to ruin the Fang family?

231
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,400
Your Ladyship,

232
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
what's on your mind?

233
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,080
You've been anxious

234
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,790
since you came out of the dowager's room.

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,430
I'm wondering

236
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,110
how to cure Chengyu.

237
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,160
You do mean to cure him?

238
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,190
Whatever,

239
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,190
I have to cure Chengyu first, which is my priority.

240
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,040
Then I can both pay Zhenzhen back

241
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,350
and save the Fang family.

242
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,870
Besides, I can also win Grandma's trust.

243
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,350
And it'll be easier for me to find the connections

244
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,310
between the seal and the Fang family.

245
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,920
Your Ladyship.

246
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,550
Steward Gao.

247
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,670
Steward Gao, could I have a minute?

248
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,280
Your Ladyship, what can I do for you?

249
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,550
Deshengchang has branches in both the south and north areas. Right?

250
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,080
Yes.

251
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,190
We want to do business easily.

252
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,230
So we start up banks

253
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,230
wherever we

254
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,160
do business.

255
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
So is there a branch in the capital city?

256
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,400
Of course.

257
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,520
There're several branches in the capital city.

258
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,230
That's it.

259
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,310
Is there anything fun in the capital city?

260
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,480
Nope.

261
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,840
There isn't.

262
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,750
But it'll be lively on the Lantern Festival.

263
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,790
Well,

264
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,960
an acrobatics troupe

265
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,110
is touring in the capital city these days.

266
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,920
That's fun.

267
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Anything else?

268
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,640
Anything new happened in the imperial palace?

269
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,480
There's nothing

270
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,920
new in the imperial palace.

271
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,840
Ministers come and go as usual.

272
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,990
We're businessmen.

273
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,920
We don't focus much on that.

274
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,190
And they

275
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,920
don't work with businessmen either.

276
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,720
Have you ever heard

277
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,600
anything about Prince Huai?

278
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,190
Your Ladyship.

279
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
The dowager is waiting for

280
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,430
Steward Gao to check the account books with her.

281
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:29,960
Your Ladyship,

282
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,230
please allow me to leave.

283
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Sure.

284
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,110
See you later.

285
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,790
Your Ladyship.

286
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,840
What on earth did she ask you?

287
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,160
Young people want to know something new,

288
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,870
which is usual.

289
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,280
They can inquire about things,

290
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
but not everything.

291
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,920
They might not know where is the boundary,

292
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,670
which would be something got on by their enemies.

293
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,110
And they would regret for that.

294
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,430
Steward Gao,

295
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,480
just spill it out.

296
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,920
Don't hide anything from me.

297
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,350
I think

298
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,280
Miss Jun didn't just

299
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,790
want to know anything fun in the capital city.

300
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,550
What she wanted to know more

301
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,990
was the things of the imperial family.

302
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:13,870
Madam,

303
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,720
you know it.

304
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,750
The things of the imperial family can't be inquired about.

305
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,400
His Majesty

306
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,400
doesn't allow us

307
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,790
to talk about these things.

308
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,280
Besides,

309
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
she also mentioned Prince Huai.

310
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,310
Zan. Zan.

311
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,190
Zan.

312
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,840
Shall we try another way?

313
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,080
For example,

314
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,720
we can pay a visit to the Fang family secretly at night.

315
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,550
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

316
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,160
It's not a good idea.

317
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,869
Accessories.

318
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,550
Have a look at the accessories.

319
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,429
Zan. Zan.

320
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,720
See.

321
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,599
The two ladies of the Fang family

322
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,229
came back.

323
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,400
I guess

324
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,479
Miss Jun won't go out today.

325
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,310
If she doesn't go out today,

326
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
we'll wait here tomorrow.

327
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,350
I can figure something out

328
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,480
as long as she goes out.

329
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,720
Have you got any news

330
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,400
from the Sky Pavilion?

331
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,160
Have they got any news of Jun Yingwen?

332
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,790
Not for now.

333
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,080
Have a look at the accessories.

334
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,600
Jun Zhenzhen is the only source

335
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,430
of us before we get some news

336
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,600
from the Sky Pavilion.

337
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,990
15 grams.

338
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,040
Shaoyao.

339
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,310
Your Ladyship,

340
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,870
the dowager invited you to go to her place.

341
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,670
Okay.

342
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,670
I'll be there soon.

343
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,990
Please go with me now.

344
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,350
The dowager is waiting for you.

345
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,790
Shaoyao,

346
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,230
is there anything urgent?

347
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,960
Does Her Ladyship need to go there now?

348
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,790
Could she go there

349
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,920
after dealing with these medicinal materials?

350
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,600
Liu'er,

351
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,640
arrange them for me.

352
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm going with you.

353
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,080
Do you know why I asked you here?

354
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,790
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,870
For what?

356
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,080
I shouldn't have been that interested in the customs in the capital city.

357
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,190
I shouldn't have enquired about the things of the imperial family.

358
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,840
You knew these,

359
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,350
but you did them anyway.

360
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,110
How could you do those things knowingly?

361
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,600
How dare you enquire about the things in the capital city?

362
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,400
I went to

363
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,750
the capital city

364
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,790
with my father,

365
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,310
so I'm curious about the city.

366
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,040
Then why did you inquire about the things of the imperial family?

367
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,230
Why did you mention Prince Huai?

368
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,800
To tell you the truth,

369
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,320
I'm an old friend of Princess Jiuling.

370
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,920
I missed her,

371
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,710
so I randomly asked Steward Gao about that.

372
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,640
Was it a spur of the Motherent?

373
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,350
Or…

374
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,110
Please don't get mad at me.

375
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,640
Even though you're an old friend of her,

376
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,710
don't mention her anymore.

377
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,470
Man's heart is incomprehensible.

378
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,640
From now on,

379
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,990
you're not allowed to

380
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,280
enquire about the things of the imperial family.

381
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,920
I got it.

382
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,800
I'll always remember what you said, Grandma.

383
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,920
You can go.

384
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,230
Grandma,

385
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
I want to tell you another thing.

386
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,520
We'll almost run out of medicinal materials.

387
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,800
I think

388
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,830
we need to purchase some.

389
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,710
Could I ask Yuxiu to go with me?

390
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,070
Then

391
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,870
others won't know we need medicinal materials,

392
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,280
as two girls going shopping is normal.

393
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,640
Thank you, Grandma.

394
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,800
Your Ladyship,

395
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,400
it's lively.

396
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Where are we going?

397
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,950
There's a time-honoured

398
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,440
jewelry store in the street ahead,

399
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,800
Green Jade Pavilion.

400
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,110
The jewels there are new

401
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,640
and exquisite because of the skilled craftsmen.

402
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,280
Many ladies in Zezhou

403
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,440
like to go there.

404
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,560
Let's go there.

405
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,230
Okay.

406
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,830
Purses, accessories.

407
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,680
I want this.

408
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:13,950
Let's go.

409
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,560
Miss Fang,

410
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,590
welcome.

411
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,280
These are the newly made

412
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,040
hair clasps of our store.

413
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,110
Please take a look.

414
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,640
Okay.

415
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,400
We will.

416
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,920
Zhenzhen,

417
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,590
which one do you like?

418
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,750
This one looks good.

419
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,350
This one

420
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
is ordinary,

421
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,560
and the jade used is also mediocre.

422
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,800
Why not pick another one?

423
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,990
This one is fine.

424
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,070
It's plain and decent.

425
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,040
I like it.

426
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,990
I

427
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,110
want this one.

428
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,400
You're the close relative of the Fang family, aren't you?

429
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,680
You're Jun Zhenzhen, who broke off the engagement with Childe Ning. Right?

430
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,160
Is it a rumor?

431
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,440
No one actually knows

432
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,200
who broke off the engagement.

433
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,560
Shut up.

434
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,200
Liu'er,

435
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,110
it's fine.

436
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,870
Let's go over there.

437
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
Miss, this way, please.

438
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,280
Sister,

439
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,750
this one looks pretty.

440
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,400
I want this.

441
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,320
Okay.

442
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,320
What a coincidence!

443
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,680
I also like it.

444
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,680
Miss Ning, what on earth do you want?

445
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,470
What do I want?

446
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,830
I want to buy accessories.

447
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,590
Then you can pick first.

448
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,870
No way.

449
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,640
This store doesn't belong to my family.

450
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,440
And

451
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,640
everyone here is a guest.

452
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,350
Both you and I can pick accessories.

453
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,990
Well,

454
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,110
we asked you to pick first,

455
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,830
which you refused.

456
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,110
And you picked the ones

457
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,440
we preferred.

458
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,230
I mean,

459
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,200
now that we picked the same hair clasp,

460
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,990
the one

461
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,040
who pays a higher price can have it.

462
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,230
What a good idea!

463
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,070
It's great.

464
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,800
Ladies,

465
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,350
it's a good idea.

466
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,110
The hair clasp costs 5 taels.

467
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,750
10 taels.

468
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,680
20 taels.

469
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,440
30 taels.

470
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,230
40 taels.

471
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,710
I'll…

472
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,040
Sister.

473
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,230
Who do you think will win?

474
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,440
Of course you will.

475
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,520
Yanyan.

476
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,640
I can't wait

477
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,830
to see Jun Zhenzhen crying.

478
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,200
100 taels.

479
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,870
150 taels.

480
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,950
You can have it as you want.

481
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,230
Let's go.

482
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,870
Thanks for coming.

483
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,830
How dare she?

484
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,870
But the hair clasp

485
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,560
is only worth 5 taels.

486
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,110
Sister, don't be that angry.

487
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,280
Zhenzhen, I got it.

488
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
A nice person is always bullied.

489
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,470
Don't be nice

490
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,470
to those arrogant and rude people,

491
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,710
which is the right thing to do.

492
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,710
Ning Yunyan is so stupid.

493
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,640
She shot herself in the foot.

494
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,920
She paid thirty times the price

495
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,640
for a hair clasp which even wouldn't catch my eyes.

496
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,750
Will she wear it or not?

497
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,160
Well, Sister,

498
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,680
I mean

499
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,400
Grandma still can feel the pain in her chest these days.

500
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,680
I'll buy some medicinal materials

501
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,200
when we pass the herbal medicine shop.

502
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,200
Alright.

503
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,680
Your Ladyships,

504
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,400
here we're.

505
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,710
I'll be back soon.

506
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,870
Sister, please wait here for me.

507
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,400
Sure.

508
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,950
Miss,

509
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,710
what do you want?

510
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,710
Please wait a sec.

511
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,400
Liu'er.

512
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,160
Please prepare two servings of the medicinal materials on the prescription.

513
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,110
Please wait a minute.

514
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,160
Miss.

515
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,830
I mean…

516
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,110
I know

517
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,470
you might not have all the medicinal materials

518
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,680
on this prescription.

519
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,640
Just prepare the ones

520
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,560
you have.

521
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,950
Thank you for your understanding.

522
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,830
To tell you the truth,

523
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,560
the amount of the medicinal materials I have

524
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,680
can only be enough for one serving.

525
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,590
Please wait a minute.

526
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,070
Okay.

527
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,640
Anyway,

528
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,920
we got something today.

529
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,110
What the hell is she doing?

530
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,830
What is she doing?

531
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,870
Your Ladyship,

532
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,350
it's the last we have.

533
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,070
What are they doing?

534
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,920
Ning Yunyan,

535
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,160
what on earth do you want?

536
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
What are they doing?

537
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,800
Jun Zhenzhen,

538
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,040
you deserve it.

539
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,560
It's the price you have to pay for scheming me.

540
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
It seems 150 taels aren't enough.

541
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,110
I should have let you pay more.

542
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,560
What about 5,000 taels?

543
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,520
5,000 taels?

544
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,400
That's equal to the price of Childe Ning.

545
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,350
Right?

546
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,440
Yeah.

547
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,280
I…

548
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,160
10,000 taels.

549
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,040
She's going to slap her.

550
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,710
Look at her. Look at her.

551
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,280
She's going to slap her.

552
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,830
She's going crazy.

553
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,710
15,000 taels.

554
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,830
She's a fraud.

555
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,640
Let me tell you.

556
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,990
She's a fraud.

557
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,710
She cheated our Ning family out of 5,000 taels.

558
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,470
She cheated her family.

559
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,990
Now she wants to hit me.

560
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,640
Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,520
Miss Ning, let me remind you.

562
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,470
Your Ning family was willing to pay me

563
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,350
5,000 taels to get back the marriage contract.

564
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,350
It's a deal.

565
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,470
You're talking nonsense.

566
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,830
She's talking nonsense.

567
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,160
What do you mean willing?

568
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,870
It was you who came to threaten us.

569
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,710
And you raised the price over and over.

570
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,230
The most beautiful prostitute in the capital city, Wu Xiaoxiao,

571
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,520
is worth 3,000 taels.

572
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,680
Childe Ning is talented,

573
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,160
so he is definitely worth 5,000 taels, isn't he?

574
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,800
Zhenzhen.

575
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,350
She compared a noble childe with a prostitute.

576
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
How could it happen?

577
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,590
She's going to pick up another fight.

578
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,350
Let's go.

579
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,280
Yeah. Let's go.

580
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,350
Jun Zhenzhen, I…

581
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:48,990
Yanyan, let's go first.

582
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,920
I won't let you go so easily.

583
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Let's deal with her later. Let's go.

584
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,920
Let's go.

585
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,070
Let's go.

586
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,640
Zan,

587
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,350
that girl

588
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,400
is something.

589
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,440
Did she really say that?

590
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,350
More than that.

591
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,800
Her Ladyship Ning was so anxious.

592
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,990
People around her were all laughing at her.

593
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,320
It sounded quite exciting.

594
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,560
I didn't expect

595
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,230
Jun Zhenzhen would be that interesting.

596
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,160
Then what do you think of me,

597
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,280
Young Master?

598
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,520
What are you doing here?

599
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,640
Santao,

600
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
go guard at the door.

601
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,470
Don't let anyone come in.

602
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,230
Yes.

603
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,440
Come back.

604
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,950
Santao,

605
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,440
you're my man or hers?

606
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,440
Stay here.

607
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,950
The dowager said

608
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,590
I should listen to Miss Jun

609
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,040
when she was here.

610
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,160
How dare you?

611
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,870
You're as annoying as you used to be.

612
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,800
So are you.

613
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,590
Young Master,

614
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,870
you're also annoying.

615
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,400
Then why did you come to me?

616
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,950
You curing me

617
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,040
is for carrying on the lineage of the Fang family. Am I right?

618
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,950
Why do you think so?

619
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,520
I know

620
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,680
my disease can't be cured.

621
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,440
And that's the last thing

622
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,950
I can do for the Fang family.

623
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,920
The length of a life doesn't matter.

624
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,710
Fireworks can't last long,

625
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,520
but they're splendid.

626
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,400
A dead wood can exist long,

627
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,070
but it's useless.

628
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,710
Mother.

629
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,040
I told you long before.

630
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,560
If you kept causing scenes,

631
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,750
it would affect the fame of your brother.

632
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,800
You could find someone to teach them a lesson, which was enough.

633
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,400
How could you do that in person?

634
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,350
And the word she said

635
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,710
was a huge humiliation for your brother's fame.

636
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,070
Mother, I…

637
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,750
I've spoiled you.

638
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,070
Mother.

639
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,870
Stop.

640
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,160
Mother.

641
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm back.

642
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,400
Zhao'er.

643
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,920
Brother.

644
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,640
Zhao'er.

645
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,830
Why did you suddenly come back from the capital city?

646
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,710
You should have noticed me earlier.

647
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,070
Then I could send someone to pick you up.

648
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,070
My academic schedules aren't tight recently.

649
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,590
So I came back. And I can enjoy the festival with you

650
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,350
for a few days before going back.

651
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,830
That's great. Great. Great.

652
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,440
Brother.

653
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,990
What's wrong with you, Yanyan?

654
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,280
Nothing.

655
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,710
She's just unhappy for

656
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,640
the quarrel among girls.

657
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,520
Zhao'er,

658
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,800
are you hungry?

659
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,110
Shall I

660
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,160
prepare any snacks for you?

661
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,680
Thank you, Mother.

662
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:53,990
But I'm not hungry.

663
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,920
Then I'll send you a cup of water.

664
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,320
Brother.

665
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,710
Don't be that unhappy, Yanyan.

666
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,070
Come on.

667
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,160
Talk to me.

668
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,470
Who bullied you?

669
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:01,830
Brother.

670
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,440
Yanyan.

671
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,920
I have to tell him the truth.

672
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,920
Brother.

673
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,870
A girl, Jun Zhenzhen, suddenly went to the Fang family.

674
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,280
Then she came to us with a marriage contract with you.

675
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,230
And she intended to break off the engagement with you.

676
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,560
Besides, she cheated us out of 5,000 taels.

677
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,750
She also said

678
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,710
the most beautiful prostitute in the capital city, Wu Xiaoxiao,

679
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,990
is worth 3,000 taels.

680
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,400
Childe Ning is good-looking and talented,

681
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,560
so he is definitely worth 5,000 taels.

682
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,830
Mother,

683
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,950
what does the marriage contract mean?

684
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,230
Just let it go.

685
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,920
Yunzhao,

686
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,870
we don't need to

687
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,230
talk about it anymore.

688
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,110
But I mean, Miss Jun

689
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,950
is really impolite.

690
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,560
Brother,

691
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,990
she has crossed the line.

692
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,350
I have to teach her a lesson.

693
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,200
She can say

694
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,990
whatever she wants.

695
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,990
You don't need to care about it that much.

696
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,560
If you go deep into it,

697
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,830
the whole thing will be mentioned

698
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,520
over and over by people.

699
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,320
Brother.

700
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,870
Good girl.

701
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,560
Yanyan.

702
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,440
Be a good girl.

703
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,830
I said

704
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,590
not to look at me with pity.

705
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,640
You're weak.

706
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,870
Besides the prescription,

707
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,800
I'll make some

708
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
nutritious diets for you.

709
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,350
They will work together.

710
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,710
No need.

711
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,950
If you can't stay healthy,

712
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,350
how will you carry on the lineage of the Fang family?

713
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,560
How dare you?

714
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,400
Zan.

715
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,070
What did you get?

716
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
Miss Jun didn't get all the medicinal materials on her prescription.

717
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,520
But a prescription which needs these medicinal materials

718
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,870
is rare.

719
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,710
I don't know much about the detail.

720
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,280
Send the medicinal materials to the Sky Pavilion.

721
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,230
Let them investigate it.

722
00:31:59,560 --> 00:31:59,990
Sure.

723
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,350
Her medicinal materials were ruined today,

724
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,200
so she will go to a herbal medicine shop again tomorrow.

725
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,200
I've checked almost

726
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,230
each large herbal medicine shop in Zezhou.

727
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,440
This one has the most kinds of medicinal materials.

728
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,590
You intend to do what we did last time again?

729
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,230
Take it carefully.

730
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,920
You brat,

731
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,230
how dare you disturb Miss Jun in broad daylight?

732
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,040
I…

733
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,920
Do you admit your fault?

734
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,680
Yes, I do.

735
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,870
That's fine. Kneel down.

736
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,470
Zan, I…

737
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,830
Enough.

738
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,640
Thank you.

739
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,590
Do you know what your fault is?

740
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,440
Well, it's…

741
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,950
I

742
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,400
shouldn't have disturbed her.

743
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,070
To be honest, you should thank me

744
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,110
who's handsome

745
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,350
and righteous

746
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,680
with excellent martial arts.

747
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,230
It was I who overwhelmed you.

748
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,320
You got it?

749
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,830
Yeah.

750
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,800
How many people are there in your family?

751
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,920
Nobody.

752
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,680
I mean, I'm a nobody.

753
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,870
I'm mean.

754
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,710
And I don't deserve to be a human being.

755
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,230
Great.

756
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,320
I shouldn't do what my second brother did.

757
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,750
Your second brother would feel sad

758
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,800
when he knew what you did, wouldn't he?

759
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,400
My second brother wouldn't do better than I.

760
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,750
Just kill me.

761
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,990
I don't want to be alive.

762
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
I want to die.

763
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,350
Don't be that depressed.

764
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,950
You can start over.

765
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,640
No, I can't.

766
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,560
Really?

767
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,680
Miss Jun,

768
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,950
please stop.

769
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,110
Could I have a minute?

770
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,040
You're so impolite.

771
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,680
Her Ladyship isn't familiar with you.

772
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,560
Why will she waste time in talking to you?

773
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,160
Do you want to talk to me about that again?

774
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,590
Yes.

775
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,319
If I tell you the truth,

776
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,709
could you promise not to disturb me anymore?

777
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,830
I promise.

778
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:18,870
Okay.

779
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,280
Steamed buns.

780
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,560
Celery. Fresh celery.

781
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Princess Jiuling and I are old friends.

782
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,749
I will never

783
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,680
do anything to hurt her.

784
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,069
Instead, I'll

785
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,160
guard her with my life.

786
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,640
Please tell me where she's.

787
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,750
And I'll take care of her.

788
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,989
Princess Jiuling didn't suddenly die

789
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,349
from an old sickness.

790
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,440
Do you know the big fire on that day?

791
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,200
Yeah.

792
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,800
Of course.

793
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,520
You set fire to save her.

794
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,040
Did you make it?

795
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,350
If what you said had come true,

796
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,520
the princess should have been so lucky.

797
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,950
What do you mean?

798
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,680
We did mean to save the princess.

799
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,040
But what do you know?

800
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,990
We were still a bit late.

801
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,750
I'm sorry.

802
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,400
I would be a good daughter in my next life.

803
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,230
When we arrived

804
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,350
where the princess was locked up,

805
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,710
a fire broke out for some season.

806
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,920
The princess died in the fire.

807
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,550
No way.

808
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,070
No.

809
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,830
I don't believe it.

810
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,000
Jiuling is blessed.

811
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,110
How could she die in the fire?

812
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,960
Jun Zhenzhen,

813
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,480
I don't believe anything

814
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,440
you said today.

815
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
She must be alive.

816
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,070
There's a cliff in the north west,

817
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,160
25 kilometers away from

818
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,070
the east gate of Zezhou.

819
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,960
The tomb of my father is under the cliff.

820
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,310
My father was being chased

821
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,070
after we failed to save the princess.

822
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,350
He fell off the cliff

823
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,760
You're

824
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
not Chu Jiuling

825
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,680
in the future.

826
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,720
You will

827
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,760
be Jun Zhenzhen.

828
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,110
If you don't believe me,

829
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,270
you can go there and check it in person.

830
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,000
Ling Jiu,

831
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,590
I'm sorry.

832
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,350
Jiuling,

833
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,760
I felt good,

834
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,590
no matter how you hit me, scolded me or pinched me

835
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,000
in childhood.

836
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,310
When I grow up,

837
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,160
I feel so happy

838
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,640
the Motherent I'm thinking of you.

839
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,030
Do you think

840
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,350
it's love?

841
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,920
I've been in the north backland for eight years.

842
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:40,870
For eight years.

843
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,960
The latest news on you that I heard

844
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,830
was your marriage.

845
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,590
Zan.

846
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,550
Zan,

847
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,310
are you out of your mind?

848
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,550
Are you okay?

849
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,480
What's wrong with you?

850
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,440
What's wrong?

851
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,830
I mean,

852
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,830
I didn't know

853
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
how a burn would feel.

854
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,000
Now I know.

855
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,510
Jiuling's skin is so good, smooth as jade.

856
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,200
There's no scar on her.

857
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,870
Princess Jiuling died.

858
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,550
She died.

859
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,680
She died.

860
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,550
What you were doing is meaningless.

861
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,070
Torturing yourself is meaningless.

862
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,720
She didn't die.

863
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,200
She didn't.

864
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,440
Baotang,

865
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
you have to believe me.

866
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,160
She didn't die.

867
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,550
She must be

868
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,640
waiting for me

869
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,510
somewhere.

870
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,510
Jiuling,

871
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,160
no matter where you're,

872
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,510
I swear that

873
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,030
I'll find you.
