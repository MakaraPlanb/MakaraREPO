<i>[Episode 3]</i>

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,170
Miss, that seems to be

20
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,950
the eldest son of the Fang family, Fang Chengyu.

21
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,820
<i>You're the so-called cousin,</i>

22
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,810
<i>Jun Zhenzhen, right?</i>

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,320
Actually you should call me cousin.

24
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,760
Has nobody told you

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,340
that only I'm allowed in this place

26
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,970
and others aren't allowed?

27
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,700
Miss Yuxiu seems to have said that.

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,400
I forgot.

29
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,030
Today's scenery is so nice

30
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,710
that I took a longer walk than expected.

31
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,150
I hope my cousin doesn't mind it.

32
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,820
We'd better not meet again.

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,070
You said you come from a family of scholars.

34
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,170
Then you should know

35
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,830
out of sight, out of mind.

36
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,280
Santao, let's go.

37
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,290
This young master of the Fang family

38
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,120
is fifteen years old but has never gone out.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,710
<i>I heard that he's diagnosed with a strange illness.</i>

40
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,070
It looks like he won't live long.

41
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,840
Lie'er, find out

42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,110
when he started to get sick

43
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,220
and who gave him medicine and took his pulse.

44
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,290
Okay. I'll ask.

45
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,430
<i>[Fang Manor]</i>

46
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,780
Miss, I didn't know before I asked around.

47
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,020
It was shocking once I found out.

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,960
There's a curse on the Fang family's men.

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,210
You're a girl. Don't spread rumors.

50
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,650
It's real.

51
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,180
The old master of the Fang family died a sudden death.

52
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,550
The master of the Fang family got robbed and killed.

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,870
The young master of the Fang family, who's the only son in their third generation,

54
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,750
is even frail.

55
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,100
When he was five years old, he got very sick.

56
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,330
The doctor said he wouldn't live past the age of sixteen.

57
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,700
Sixteen?

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,170
Doesn't it mean there's only less than one year left?

59
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,880
Exactly.

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,370
That's why I said it's a curse.

61
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,990
What's the point of having a big family?

62
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,260
It won't go past the third generation. No more descendants.

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,420
Oops.

64
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,560
You're a girl. Don't talk nonsense.

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,280
Where's my book?

66
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,950
It looks like you have a bad memory.

67
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,810
You're not welcome here.

68
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,280
That's fine. I'm staying here for a half day.

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,040
Are you saying

70
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,700
you can finish reading them in a half day?

71
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,530
That sounds about right.

72
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,390
Miss Jun is really a genius.

73
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,240
Thank you for your compliment.

74
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,360
What books are you looking for?

75
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,100
I'm not looking for books.

76
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,770
I'm reading.

77
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
- Do you want to– 
 - Be quiet.

78
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,960
Are you out of your mind?

79
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,820
You're the one out of your mind, cousin.

80
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,670
Indeed.

81
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm sick.

82
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,590
A sick person like me can't criticize a healthy person like you.

83
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,180
A healthy person doesn't worry about wasting time.

84
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,540
I'm not wasting time.

85
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,260
I can try to treat your illness.

86
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,820
Santao, let's go.

87
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,110
He isn't sick, but poisoned.

88
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,950
Second brother,

89
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,930
we've been waiting for the better part of a day.

90
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,510
We don't see Miss Jun come out at all.

91
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,570
Keep waiting. She'll come out eventually.

92
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,900
- Shopkeeper, can I have another pot of water? 
 - Sure.

93
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,080
Two masters, just a moment.

94
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,910
<i>[Dosages of herbs and formula for medicinal decoction]</i>

95
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,940
<i>[Method for treatment]</i>

96
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,870
It should be doable to treat my cousin's illness with these two treatments.

97
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,310
Detox in a bath.

98
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,280
<i>Miss, the old madam invited you to go over there.</i>

99
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,430
I'm on my way.

100
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,750
- You met Chengyu today, didn't you? 
 - Yes.

101
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,940
Don't meet him ever again.

102
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,450
Don't go wherever he goes.

103
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,470
Grandma, I'd like to try to treat Chengyu's illness.

104
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,930
No need.

105
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,960
You're not capable of treating it.

106
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,480
Giving him hopes and letting him down,

107
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,430
it'll be too cruel to the patient.

108
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,570
Chengyu isn't sick,

109
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,450
but poisoned.

110
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,800
Did you know he's poisoned?

111
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,240
Why do you think he's not sick, but poisoned?

112
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,970
Today I took his pulse and found he's had many toxins for years.

113
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Is it you who have been feeding him the poison?

114
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,970
I don't get it.

115
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,830
May I ask why you've been doing this to him?

116
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,990
<i>When Chengyu was five years old, he got really sick.</i>

117
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,570
Since then, he's been taking this poison every day.

118
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,080
This poison can keep his illness under control.

119
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,050
If he hadn't taken it,

120
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,230
he wouldn't still be alive.

121
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,750
The famous doctor who prescribed him this died of an illness a long time ago.

122
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,090
Other people couldn't do anything about it.

123
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,430
In order for Chengyu to live on,

124
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,980
we're left with no choice.

125
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,450
This prescription looks good at the first sight,

126
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,790
but it becomes a poison when combined with his illness.

127
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,320
<i>If he doesn't take it, his illness won't get better.</i>

128
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,430
But even if he does, he's only stable for now.

129
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,450
He'll die once he stops taking it.

130
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,730
He'll wait to die if he takes it.

131
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,800
<i>We're left with no choice.</i>

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,290
No.

133
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,130
Aunt,

134
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,750
it's not your fault.

135
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,450
Someone misled you on purpose.

136
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,470
Chengyu ends up like this because he's been severely poisoned by taking this medicine.

137
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,710
Back then he didn't have

138
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,850
an incurable illness.

139
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,420
Over the years, someone misled you with the poison

140
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,640
and actually destroyed my cousin's body.

141
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,140
Who

142
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,010
was this evil and wanted to harm our Fang family?

143
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,210
The culprit must be hiding.

144
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,370
If I guess it right,

145
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,600
the person should be in the Fang family.

146
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,330
<i>Most importantly,</i> we need to treat his illness now.

147
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,640
Just let me try.

148
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,710
Mother, why don't we let Zhenzhen give it a try?

149
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,180
Grandmother, can I see the prescription that was given to him?

150
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,960
I will soon be liberated.

151
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,110
It will be over soon.

152
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,090
<i>[Seal]</i>

153
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,110
<i>[Third year of Taiyan]</i>

154
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,370
- Zhenzhen. 
 - Why would grandmother has a stamp with patterns like that?

155
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,070
Zhenzhen.

156
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,350
As I expected, something is wrong. Aunt,

157
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,500
We should keep using this.

158
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,230
So that the plotters wouldn't get suspicious.

159
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,860
Grandmother, I will leave now.

160
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,510
Hold on.

161
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,460
Zhenzhen, you need to keep this a secret.

162
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,950
Only the three of us will know about it.

163
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,020
I understand. Please rest assured.

164
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,860
The Fang family, the stamp, and the seal.

165
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,060
How are these all connected? Is the Fang family also involved in the secrets with Ze Zhou?

166
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,850
Who is plotting to harm the Fangs?

167
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,470
Miss, what are you thinking about?

168
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,920
You've been lost in thoughts since we came out of Madam's room.

169
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,130
I was thinking about how to cure Chengyu.

170
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,320
Are you really going to cure him?

171
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,650
Regardless, my priority should be to cure Chengyu.

172
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,580
I will repay Zhenzhen's kindness, and save the Fang family too.

173
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,720
This is how I can earn grandmother's trust.

174
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,350
It will then be easy for me to figure out the Fangs' connection to the stamp.

175
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,790
Miss.

176
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,670
Steward Gao.

177
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,150
Please wait.

178
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,660
Miss, do you need something?

179
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,510
- De Sheng Chang are in both the south and the north, right? 
 - That's right.

180
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,820
It is to facilitate our commerce activities.

181
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,640
Wherever we do business, we will have a bank branch too.

182
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,830
Do you have branches in the capital?

183
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,360
Of course. We have a number of branches there.

184
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,640
I see. By the way, is there anything interesting happening in the capital?

185
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,040
I don't think so.

186
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,270
But it will be very lively during the lantern festival.

187
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,080
There is a touring circus visiting the capital. There's always a crowd.

188
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,770
What about the palace?

189
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,160
I don't think there's anything new in the palace. It's just the courtisans coming and going.

190
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,550
Businessmen like us don't care too much about that.

191
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,020
They don't interact with us either.

192
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,340
- Have you heard of anything in Prince Huai's Manor- 
 - Miss.

193
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,650
- Madam is waiting to go through the books with the Steward. 
 - I see.

194
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,820
Miss, I'll report to my boss now.

195
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,580
Please.

196
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,830
Farewell.

197
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,520
What did she ask you?

198
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,710
It's natural that young people are curious. However, there are things that you can ask about and those you cannot.

199
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:56,370
Young people don't know the limits. If someone finds fault in this, it'd be a disaster.

200
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,670
Steward Gao, if you have something to say, say it. Don't beat around the bush.

201
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,400
Miss Jun didn't just about the happenings in the capital.

202
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,740
She was asking about...

203
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,050
The royal family.

204
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,530
Madam, as you know,

205
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,760
One cannot talk about the royal family for fun.

206
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,880
He doesn't allow us to talk about the royal family.

207
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,590
Moreover, she asked about Prince Huai.

208
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,860
Second Brother, let's change our strategy.

209
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,530
For example, sneaking into the Fang Manor at night.

210
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,260
and have a chat.

211
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,360
No no. Sneaking into other people's home is a bad idea.

212
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,480
Second Brother, look.

213
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,360
The First and Second Misstresses are both back.

214
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,660
I think Miss Jun wouldn't come out today.

215
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,500
If she doesn't come out today, we will be here waiting tomorrow.

216
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,540
If she comes out, I have my plans.

217
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,750
What's going on with Yunxiao Pavilion? Have you heard anything about Jun Yingwen?

218
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,980
I haven't heard anything.

219
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,240
Before we hear anything else, Jun Zhenzhen is our only source.

220
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,980
Right.

221
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,860
Three qian. 
<i>[T/N Qian is a unit of measurement, about 5 grams.]</i>

222
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,630
Sister Shaoyao.

223
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,070
Miss, Madam wants to see you.

224
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,590
Sure. I'll be there shortly.

225
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,390
I'd suggest you go now. Madam is waiting for you.

226
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,640
Sister Shaoyao, what's so urgent?

227
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,330
Do we have to go right now?

228
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,080
Can it wait until miss finishes with the ingredients?

229
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,700
Liu'er,

230
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,210
Tidy things up here for me.

231
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll go with you now.

232
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,950
Do you know why I called you here?

233
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,830
I know I was wrong.

234
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,920
Tell me what you did wrong.

235
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,540
I shouldn't have been curious about the happenings in the capital.

236
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,360
I shouldn't have asked about the royal family.

237
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,810
You did it knowing you  shouldn't have.

238
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,700
How did you learn to knowingly violate the rules?

239
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
How dare you ask about the capital?

240
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,770
I visited the capital before with my father. That's why I was curious.

241
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,680
Why did you ask about the royal family.

242
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,320
And about Prince Huai?

243
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,170
I'll be honest here. I am an old friend with Princess Jiuling.

244
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,870
I was thinking about her, so I asked Steward Gao about it.

245
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,630
Was that spontaneous?

246
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,420
- Or- 
 - Grandmother, I hope you won't be mad at me.

247
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,260
Even if she is an old friend of yours, you should not mention her name anymore.

248
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,090
It's hard to know what people are thinking.

249
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,420
Going forward, don't talk about the royal family.

250
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,180
I will remember that.

251
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,740
You can leave now.

252
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,280
Grandmother, I have one more request.

253
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,720
There are not much medical ingredients left at home. I want to purchase some from the pharmacy.

254
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,460
Can I ask Yuxiu to accompany me?

255
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,380
This way, we can tell people that it's just girls shopping together.

256
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,710
Thank you, grandmother.

257
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,150
Miss, it's so lively out there.

258
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,200
Where are we going?

259
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,280
There is an old jeweler, called Cuiyao Pavilion.

260
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,280
They have the latest styles, and the master is very skillful.

261
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,670
Most of the young ladies in Zezhou love visiting them.

262
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,280
- Let's go there.
 - Sounds good.

263
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,030
<i>Purses and pendants.</i>

264
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,860
Let's go.

265
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,780
Miss Fang, please come inside.

266
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,270
These are our latest hairpins.

267
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,490
- Please take a look. 
 - We will.

268
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,600
Zhenzhen,

269
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
Which one do you like?

270
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,830
This one looks good.

271
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,930
This one looks pretty mediocre.

272
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,250
Pick a different one.

273
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,400
It is good. It's simple and tasteful.

274
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,270
I'll have this.

275
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,850
I'm taking this one.

276
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,640
Isn't this the cousin of the Fangs?

277
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,000
The Jun Zhenzhen who rejected the marriage proposal of Young Master Ning.

278
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,470
That's what the rumor said. We don't know who rejected who.

279
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,200
- Shut up. 
 - Liu'er.

280
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,380
It's fine. Let's go over there.

281
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,670
Miss, please come inside.

282
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,770
Older Sister, this looks nice.

283
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,800
- I want this. 
- Alright.

284
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,810
What a coincidence. I like this too.

285
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,240
Miss Ning, what do you mean?

286
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,020
What do you mean? I'm here to buy jewelries.

287
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,900
You can choose first.

288
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,760
How can I do this? This is not my family's shop.

289
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,680
Moreover, everyone here is a customer.

290
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,100
We have the rights to choose first.

291
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,130
However, when we let you have it, you rejected it.

292
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,300
When we chose it, you chose it too.

293
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,310
Since we are interested in the same hairpin,

294
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,520
let's bid for it.

295
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,260
This is a good idea. A good idea.

296
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,080
Dear ladies,  this is a good idea. This hairpin is five taels.

297
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,060
Ten taels.

298
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,490
- Twenty taels. 
- Thirty taels.

299
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,530
Forty taels.

300
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,740
- I...
- Who do you think will win?

301
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,710
No need to ask. Of course, it's Yanyan.

302
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,520
I can't wait to see Jun Zhenzhen cry.

303
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,740
100 taels.

304
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,020
150 taels.

305
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,930
It's good that Miss Ning is happy.

306
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,880
Want to compete with me?

307
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,690
But this hairpin is worth only five taels.

308
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,620
- Older Sister, don't be angry.
- I know, Zhenzhen.

309
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,700
Kind people are bullied by others. When facing such domineering and arrogant people,

310
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,830
not being outdone by them is the way to get along with each other.

311
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,010
Thinking about Ning Yunyan, she's really stupid.

312
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,820
She shot herself in her foot.

313
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,600
She paid thirty times for the price of the hairpin. I don't even think that hairpin is that great.

314
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,810
Will she wear it or not?

315
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,580
By the way, Older Sister. For the past two days, I can see that Grandmother is still having chest discomforts.

316
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,660
We will be passing a medicine shop. I'm going to prepare some tonics for her.

317
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,250
Alright.

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,860
I will be back soon. Please wait for me here.

321
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,470
Alright.

322
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,190
Miss, buying medicines?

323
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,440
Yes. Liu'er.

324
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,840
Here.

325
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,340
Two sets for what's written here.

326
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,030

Miss, about this...

329
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,860
I know. You may not have all the herbs listed here.

330
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,730
Let me have those that are available.

331
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,230
Thank you for being considerate. I won't lie.

332
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,560
Even if I have these herbs,

333
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,520
I can barely provide a set. Please wait.

334
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,880
It can be considered fruitful today.

335
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,500
Oh no.

336
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
<i>What is she doing?</i>

337
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,680
Miss, these are our last herbs.

338
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,620
Ning Yunyan, what are you trying to do?

339
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,720
<i>What's the problem?</i>

340
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,880
Jun Zhenzhen, you deserved it. This is your consequence for tricking me of my money.

341
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,570
Seems like the 150 taels as a lesson is still not enough.

342
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,050
If I had known earlier, I would have increased the price.

343
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,800
For example, 5,000 taels.

344
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,650
5,000 taels? Wouldn't this be the same price as Young Master Ning?

345
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,370
Right?

346
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,150
- I...
10,000 taels.

00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,670
<i>She's hitting someone. Quick.</i>

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,780
<i>Look.</i>

350
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,590
15,000 taels.

351
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,030
Look at her.

352
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,120
Fraudster. Let me tell you, she's a fraudster!

353
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,640
She deceived five thousand taels from the Ning family

354
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,170
She's now being violent and hitting me.

355
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,450
That's right.

356
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,510
Miss Ning, don't forget.

357
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,580
At that time, your Ning family willingly

358
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,700
redeemed the marriage certificate for 5,000 taels. It was a transaction with me.

359
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,980
Nonsense. It's a total nonsense.

360
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,000
What do you mean by willingly? It was obvious that you came to threaten us.

361
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,090
She repeatedly raised the price.

362
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,920
The top performer in the capital, Wu Xiaoxiao is worth 3,000 taels.

363
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,120
No matter how outstanding Young Master Ning is, how could it be worth 5,000 taels?

364
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,980
- Zhen Zhen...
- A son from a rich family is on par with a woman from a brothel.

365
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,380
There's really something like this?

366
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,200
She's going to hit her again.

367
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,600
- Jun Zhen Zhen, let me tell you.
- Let's go, Yan Yan.

368
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,990
This matter is not over yet.

369
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,530
Let's talk again later. Let's go.

370
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,410
Second Brother, this young lady is rather interesting.

371
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,780
- She really said that?
- Not only that,

372
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,990
Miss Ning was exasperated and furious.

373
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,980
Everyone came to watch and laugh.

374
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,650
Everyone was really satisfied.

375
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,170
Really can't tell that she's such an interesting person.

376
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,350
Young Master, what kind of person do you think I am?

377
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,550
Why are you here?

378
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,650
San Tao, guard the door. Don't let anyone enter.

379
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,790
Yes.

380
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,290
Get back here.

381
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,960
San Tao, are you my staff or her staff?

382
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,780
Get back here.

383
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,560
Old Madam instructed me to obey her when she's here.

384
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,120
You!

385
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,750
You are still loathsome.

386
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,490
You, too.

387
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,100
Young Master, you are unpleasant too.

388
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,200
You are courting a rebuff too.

389
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,040
You are doing this to manipulate the Fang family.

390
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,940
Why do you think this way?

391
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,090
I know that I can't be cured.

392
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,750
I'm the only benefit for you to stay in Fang family.

393
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,690
This should be the reason.

394
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,900
A human's life is not long or short.

395
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,160
Although fireworks last for a short time but they are dazzling.

396
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,020
Dead woods last for a long time but they are decayed.

397
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,350
<i>- Mother.
- I already told you.</i>

398
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,990
If this trouble continues, it won't be good for your older brother.

399
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,990
Just find someone to teach her a lesson.

400
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,510
Why did you attack her on your own?

401
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,110
Letting others talk badly will tarnish your older brother's reputation.

402
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,530
- Mother, I...
- I spoiled you.

403
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,600
- Mother. 
- Enough.

404
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,350
Mother, I'm back.

405
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,190
- Older Brother? 
- Zhao'er,

406
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,420
why did you suddenly come back from the capital?

407
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,080
You didn't even tell me. I could have sent someone to receive you.

408
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,890
I'm not busy with homework recently. I'm back to celebrate the festival with you for a few days and will leave thereafter.

409
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,030
- Alright.
- Older Brother.

410
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,570
Yanyan, what's wrong?

411
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,920
It's nothing much. Just some quarrels between girls.

412
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,420
Zhao'er, are you hungry?

413
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,130
I will prepare some snacks for you in the kitchen.

414
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,890
I'm not hungry, Mother.

415
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,800
I will get you a cup of water.

416
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,890
Older Brother...

417
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,540
It's fine, Yanyan. Tell me who bullied you again.

418
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,740
- Older Brother...- Yanyan.

419
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,410
I want to tell him.

420
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:10,420
Older Brother, Jun Zhenzhen from Fang family suddenly brought a marriage letter here to cancel your marriage.

421
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,800
She even extorted 5,000 taels from us.

422
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,940
She even said that Wu Xiaoxiao, the top performer in the capital is worth 3,000 taels.

423
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,680
No matter how outstanding Young Master Ning is, how can he be worth 5,000 taels?

424
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,210
Mother. what marriage agreement?

425
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,230
It's fine not to talk about it.

426
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,740
Yunzhao, there's no need to mention this again.

427
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,990
However, that Miss Jun is really rude.

428
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,880
Older Brother, she's really too much. You need to take revenge.

429
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,660
It was a moment  of angry words from her mouth. Just ignore her.

430
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,620
If this trouble continues, this matter will go back and forth. Others will talk about it.

431
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,000
- Older Brother. 
-Be good.

432
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,350
Yanyan, be obedient.

433
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,510
I already told you not to look at me with pitiful expression.

434
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,210
Your bones are too fragile.

435
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,390
Other than prescription, I will prescribe some tonics for you too.

436
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,020
It's a two-pronged approach.

437
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,820
It's not necessary.

438
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,830
- If your body is not treated, how can the Fang family be manipulated?
- You.

439
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,490
Second Brother.

440
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,100
How is it?

441
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,790
The herbs that Miss Jun purchased is not complete but the pairing of these herbs

442
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,660
are rarely seen in prescriptions. I can't tell you the specifics.

443
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,510
Deliver the herbs to Yun Xiao Pavilion. You must investigate this.

444
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,980
Alright.

445
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,850
Her herbs were ruined today.

446
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,600
She will definitely buy again tomorrow.

447
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,430
I have already checked several small medicine shops in Zezhou,

448
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,400
This is the shop with the most complete stock of herbs.

449
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,650
Are you planning to block her again?

450
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,980
<i>[Fu Xiang Medicine Shop]</i>

451
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,520
We got them.

452
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,130
Hold it properly.

453
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,990
You are a swindler.

454
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,600
You even dared to harass Miss Jun in broad daylight.

455
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,800
- I...
- Do you know your crime?

456
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,180
- I...I do.
- If you do, kneel.

457
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,550
Second Brother, I...

458
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,520
- No need to kneel.
- Thank you.

459
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,840
Do you know your mistake?

460
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,040
My mistake was...

461
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,820
I shouldn't have molested her.

462
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,190
Let me tell you. Fortunately, you met a suave and admirable man like me

463
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,650
who's righteous and highly skilled in martial arts. I can fight and am good looking too.

464
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,690
That's how I could subdue you.

465
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,940
- Understand?
- I do.

466
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,960
How many in your family?

467
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,760
- No one else.
- What?

468
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,760
I'm a worthless person without any conscience.

469
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,740
- I'm inferior to pigs and dogs.
- That's right.

470
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,520
I shouldn't learn from my second brother.

471
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,890
Your second brother must be very sad seeing you like this.

472
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,830
My second brother is not as good as me.

473
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,650
Kill me.

474
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,640
I don't want to live anymore.

475
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,100
- I want to die.
- You don't need to be so depressed.

476
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,230
You can start a new life.

477
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,000
But I don't have a choice.

478
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,900
- Is that so?
- Yes.

479
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,130
Do it.

480
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,200
Miss Jun,

481
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,920
please stay.

482
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,770
I wonder if I could chat with you.

483
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,430
You are unreasonable.

484
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,610
Our Young Mistress is not close to you. What's there to chat?

485
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,520
Is it still regarding that matter?

486
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,420
Yes.

487
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,960
If I tell you the truth today, will you must stop pestering me in the future?

488
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,760
I definitely will stop pestering you.

489
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,780
Fine.

490
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,660
- Buns. 
- Fresh celeries.

491
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,920
The princess and I are old family friends. I will never do anything to harm her.

492
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,060
On the contrary, I will use my life to protect her.

493
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,780
Please tell me where she is. I will be responsible for the aftermath.

494
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,450
The princess definitely didn't die suddenly from an illness.

495
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,800
Do you know about the big fire that day?

496
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,270
I know, I know.

497
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,210
And I know you went to put out the fire. Did you rescue her?

498
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,360
If it's really like you said,

499
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,620
then that's her fate.

500
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,280
What do you mean?

501
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,810
We did plan to rescue her.

502
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,140
But heaven is stronger than the will of people.

503
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,090
We were still too late.

504
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,640
Zhen Zhen is unfilial, unworthy to be your daughter.

505
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,150
When we arrived,

506
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,830
I have no idea why the place where the princess was imprisoned, caught fire.

507
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,960
The Princess had died.

508
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,910
That's impossible.

509
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,880
Absolutely impossible!

510
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,800
Jiuling is blessed.

511
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,310
How could she die in a fire?

512
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,040
Jun Zhen Zhen,

513
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,730
I don't believe anything you've said today.

514
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,850
She's definitely still alive.

515
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,400
When you leave via the east gate of Zezhou, fifty miles towards northwest,

516
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,360
there is a cliff.

517
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,050
My father's grave is at the bottom of the cliff.

518
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,700
Once my father finished,

519
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,170
he was chased the entire way.

520
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,850
And accidentally fell off the cliff.

521
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,150
From now on,

522
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,700
you're not Chu Jiu Ling.

523
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,950
You will be Jun Zhen Zhen.

524
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,520
If you don't believe me, go look for yourself.

525
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,170
Ling Jiu,

526
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,610
I'm sorry...

527
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,590
Jiu Ling,

528
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,890
sometimes

529
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,090
when you hit me, curse me, pinch me, I don't feel it.

530
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,310
Once we grew older, every time I think of you

531
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,610
I was so happy.

532
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,000
Don't you think...

533
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,230
do you like it?

534
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,000
I went to the north for 8 years.

535
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,880
8 years...then I received news about you.

536
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,840
Your engagement...

537
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,200
Second Brother,

538
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,310
Second Brother, are you crazy?

539
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,700
Are you okay?

540
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,420
What's wrong with you? What's wrong?

541
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,980
Do you think...

542
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,890
being burned feels like?

543
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,670
I never knew before...

544
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,080
But now I know.

545
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,440
Jiuling is beautiful, delicate and fair.

546
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,890
I have never bumped into her.

547
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,210
Princess Jiu Ling is already dead.

548
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,850
She's already dead. Dead!

549
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,260
What's the point of doing this now?

550
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,870
Is there a reason to torture yourself like this?

551
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,540
Second Brother.

552
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,180
No

553
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,400
She's definitely not dead.

554
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,280
Bao Tang,

555
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,200
have to believe me.

556
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,200
She's definitely not dead.

557
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,000
She's definitely waiting for me somewhere.

558
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,710
Jiu Ling,

559
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,500
no matter where,

560
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,760
I swear

561
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,170
I will find you.

562
