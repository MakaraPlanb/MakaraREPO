00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14

♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

Episode 11

17
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,470
Fang Mansion

18
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,350
New County Magistrate of Zezhou Liu Qing

19
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,530
Treat this written instruction as me and do as the holder requires. Chu Huai

20
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:49,810
County Government of Zezhou

21
00:34:20,560 --> 00:02:11,630
Divorce settlement

22
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,910
I wonder who did this.

23
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,910
It was all beginning to unravel.

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,880
Li Changhong became a jinshi at the age of 20.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,670
He successively served as the Deputy Governor of Luting,

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,800
Military Staff of Taizhou,

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,320
County Magistrate of Qingyang,

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,030
County Magistrate of Anyang,

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,030
Deputy Military Governor of Weihui,

30
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,750
and County Magistrate of Zezhou.

31
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,320
Every place he served

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,520
was around Zezhou.

33
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,960
In this case,

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,470
he might have been targeting at our Fang family

35
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,550
since 20 years ago.

36
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,360
I didn't get it.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,030
Our Fang family is just a merchant.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,030
What's worth planning for so long?

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,880
It's all about money.

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,960
He coveted the property of the Fang family.

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,960
Did he work hard for 20 years

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,470
just for money?

43
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,720
What's more,

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,520
20 years ago,

45
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,830
our Fang family hadn't made a fortune yet.

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Zhenzhen,

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,960
why did you change your name to Jiuling?

48
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,880
I remember it.

49
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,110
Jiuling

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,080
is the name of the princess left by the late emperor,

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,160
and the late wife of Governor Lu of Arm Moral Department.

52
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,960
I kept wondering

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
why this name sounds so familiar.

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,830
Zhenzhen was acquainted with Her Highness Princess Jiuling.

55
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,600
I think it's to commemorate her old friend.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,030
Both Zhenzhen's and Her Highness Princess Jiuling's parents

57
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,320
passed away.

58
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,670
Her Highness Princess Jiuling married but didn't live long.

59
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,390
Zhenzhen's engagement

60
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,880
was rejected.

61
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,360
This is different, grandma.

62
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,800
Although Zhenzhen isn't granted a title of the princess,

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,880
I think

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,550
she is much better than the princess.

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,830
At least she's alive.

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,880
Grandma,

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,160
I want you to go back alone later.

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,080
I have one more thing

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,800
to go out.

70
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,830
It's almost home.

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,470
Why don't you go after the reception?

72
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,360
I'll be back

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,190
before the reception.

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,000
Yuan Bao.

75
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,640
Isn't that Miss Jun?

76
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,600
Stop talking.

77
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,670
What are we doing? You stay here.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,350
Grandma,

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,550
Chengyu has returned safely.

80
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,920
Jinxiu didn't know anything about it.

81
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,110
She had nothing to do with what Madame Su did.

82
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,720
You've been locking her up for a long time.

83
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,440
As the way she is,

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,350
she's not going to make it.

85
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,830
I beseech grandma

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,760
and mother

87
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,320
to forgive her

88
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,720
as she is a member of the Fang family.

89
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,950
Grandma,

90
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,390
I think

91
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,790
what Yuxiu said makes sense.

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,230
Let bygones

93
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,040
be bygones.

94
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,350
It's not Jinxiu's fault.

95
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,160
She shouldn't be involved in this.

96
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,270
What's more,

97
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
I'm still standing right here.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,320
Jinxiu is

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,110
violent-tempered

100
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,000
and proud.

101
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,440
I locked her up

102
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,790
for her good,

103
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,000
so that

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
she wouldn't torment herself

105
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,600
when listening to rumors and criticism every day.

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,110
Grandma,

107
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,480
I have a way

108
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,790
that might work.

109
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,270
Jinxiu.

110
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,200
Jinxiu.

111
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,790
It's me.

112
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,160
Chengyu.

113
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,270
Chengyu.

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,390
It's me.

115
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,670
You can really walk?

116
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,160
Yes.

117
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm all right.

118
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,720
Does it hurt?

119
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,830
No.

120
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,790
That's great.

121
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,670
By the way,

122
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,070
I bought you

123
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,550
a lot of little gifts on my way here.

124
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,350
Have a look.

125
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,510
This carved wooden figure.

126
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,640
Have a look.

127
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,880
Do you still remember?

128
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,160
There's something for me, too.

129
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,230
Sure.

130
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,640
What's wrong? What's wrong?

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
I don't think

132
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
I should call you brother anymore.

133
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,270
Nonsense.

134
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,350
We all believe in you.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,160
I know you're innocent.

136
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,510
That's not the case.

137
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,350
I was born guilty.

138
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,480
My birth

139
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,790
just gave her reason

140
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,230
to stay in the Fang family.

141
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,230
Beyond that,

142
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,110
I'm useless.

143
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,000
Believe me.

144
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,950
None of us blame you

145
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,000
or complain about you.

146
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,550
It just

147
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,830
happened so suddenly

148
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,070
that we haven't figured out how to face it.

149
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,670
Yes,

150
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,790
she gave birth to you.

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,510
But

152
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,510
you have nothing to do with her now.

153
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
You are you.

154
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,640
Moreover,

155
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,070
you have been an independent person

156
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,510
since you were born.

157
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,040
It's heinous for others

158
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
to kill and set fire,

159
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,790
but as long as you didn't do it,

160
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,550
it has nothing to do with you.

161
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,040
Really?

162
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,390
I have

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,230
such a good sister.

164
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,960
She can read, write,

165
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,710
examine the accounts and do calculations,

166
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,790
and dares to deal with businessmen.

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,550
You are smart

168
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,590
and skilled.

169
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
You are my good sister

170
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,030
forever.

171
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,550
You will find

172
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,710
many things very difficult in the moment,

173
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
but they will be better

174
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,350
in a long time.

175
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,880
Look at me.

176
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,520
Look.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,880
Am I not all right now?

178
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,790
Chengyu,

179
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,110
I want to leave the Fang family.

180
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,000
Leave?

181
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,880
I am no longer the young lady of the Fang family,

182
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,150
but Fang Jinxiu.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,550
I want to start

184
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,350
a new life as Fang Jinxiu.

185
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,590
All right.

186
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,320
It's all over.

187
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,590
All right.

188
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,110
Take good care of yourself while you're gone.

189
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,110
Don't worry.

190
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,790
Don't worry about me.

191
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,960
But

192
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,080
you have to take on

193
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,790
more family affairs in the future.

194
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,790
It's my duty.

195
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,590
I'm leaving.

196
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Grandma, mother,

197
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
don't worry about it.

198
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,150
Jinxiu is smart.

199
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,280
Let her be.

200
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,280
Then she can feel better.

201
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,640
She might as well go out and temper herself.

202
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,590
Let's see when she'll be willing

203
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,960
to come back.

204
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,790
Senior Madame.

205
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,080
Senior Madame.

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,230
Her Ladyship is gone.

207
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,520
I looked everywhere

208
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,440
and couldn't find her.

209
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,080
What?

210
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,880
Stop crying and tell us about it.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,790
Li Changhong is dead?

212
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,640
Smooth and clean.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,440
No one can find any doubt.

214
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,400
Do you have all the men?

215
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,790
Your Excellency,

216
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,880
they'll be here in a few days.

217
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I dispatched them from a distance

218
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,470
as ordered.

219
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,670
It was much hidden.

220
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,710
OK.

221
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,080
This time

222
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,470
we will uproot

223
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,280
the Fang family.

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,150
Where's my hot water?

225
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,200
Why is it so slow?

226
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,030
Sorry.

227
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm late.

228
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,710
What are you

229
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,110
looking at?

230
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,710
I want

231
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,670
hot water first.

232
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,670
Is there any hot water?

233
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,840
Yes, yes.

234
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,150
I'll send it to you later.

235
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Send it to my room.

236
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,150
Yes.

237
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,910
Your Excellency,

238
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,280
I think she was just passing by

239
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,150
when sending some hot water to the wing room over there.

240
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,520
Why do I always think

241
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,640
there's something wrong with

242
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,910
this damn place?

243
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,640
Go.

244
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,030
Confirm it with the people

245
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,880
at the post station below.

246
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,760
Yes.

247
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,110
Sir,

248
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,000
all the people in our kitchen

249
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,000
are here.

250
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,080
Is there

251
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,400
a young woman in your post station?

252
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,200
A maid.

253
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,550
We're all men here

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,080
except her.

255
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,640
Oh, no.

256
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,200
Your Excellency,

257
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,110
she ran.

258
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,320
Chase her.

259
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,880
Yes.

260
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,670
How did you know Yuan Bao?

261
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,440
Why did you follow him?

262
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,960
It's too late to explain to you.

263
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,640
Let's talk later.

264
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,640
If he were an ordinary man,

265
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,590
we would fool him.

266
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,520
Yuan Bao is different.

267
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,840
He practices kung fu

268
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,230
and takes the imperial decree with him.

269
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,880
There are some hidden guards and men of Arm Moral Department around him.

270
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,230
What can we do?

271
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,520
Create chaos

272
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,470
and disperse the pursuers.

273
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,520
You go back to Zezhou now.

274
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,960
What about you?

275
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,230
I have my own way.

276
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,110
Jun,

277
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,110
remember,

278
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,550
you owe me an answer.

279
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,880
Zhu Zan.

280
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,150
What should I do?

281
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,640
I didn't find Her Ladyship all night.

282
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,230
Senior Madame,

283
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,110
what should we do?

284
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,640
Any news

285
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,520
after reporting to the government?

286
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,790
They helped find Her Ladyship,

287
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,910
but His Excellency said

288
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,200
she might have lost her way

289
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,230
and it's not a big deal.

290
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,400
He even said…

291
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,350
What did he say?

292
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,110
He said

293
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,550
we dragged in too many people

294
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,910
and acted like

295
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,000
bandits who wanted to

296
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,790
turn this city over.

297
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,030
Senior Madame,

298
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,840
please find a way

299
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,590
to help me find Her Ladyship.

300
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,470
Please.

301
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,400
For the sake of Jiuling,

302
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,440
even if I turn this city over,

303
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,910
it's no big deal.

304
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,590
Bring me the walking stick.

305
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,080
Your Excellency the Prefect,

306
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,470
all the clues we know

307
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,440
have been told.

308
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,110
Please send some people to search immediately.

309
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,670
Your grace

310
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,230
must be remembered by our Fang family.

311
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,790
Well,

312
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,280
Mr. Fang,

313
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,000
don't worry too much.

314
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,590
Young Lady left home

315
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,000
not long ago.

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,590
Don't worry,

317
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,350
she will come back safely.

318
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,230
If something happens to Jiuling,

319
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,230
I, a grandma,

320
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,550
can't be forgiven.

321
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,320
I'll find her

322
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,440
even if I turn the city over.

323
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,150
Your Excellency Liu, please send some people to find her.

324
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
Senior Madame  Fang,

325
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,280
that's not a big deal!

326
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,640
She hasn't been home for one day.

327
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,910
I don't think anything will happen to her.

328
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,640
My granddaughter-in-law

329
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,470
is very important to the Fang family.

330
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,000
If she has an accident,

331
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,670
our Fang family

332
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,520
will collapse.

333
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,110
Senior Madame Fang,

334
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,110
I beg you.

335
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,790
I beg you

336
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,550
not to make trouble.

337
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,590
Treat this written instruction

338
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
as me

339
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,520
and do as the holder requires.

340
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,430
Senior Madame Fang,

341
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,830
can I

342
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,590
have a look?

343
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,400
Sorry to

344
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,520
offend you.

345
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,560
This is a written instruction that His Majesty

346
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,830
gave our Fang family when he was a prince.

347
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,520
Now he has ascended the throne.

348
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,430
Your Excellency Liu,

349
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,680
is it still useful?

350
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,710
Of course.

351
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,310
It's, it's still useful.

352
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,470
Please assist our Fang family

353
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,950
in searching the city

354
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,000
to look for Jun Jiuling,

355
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,880
the young lady of our Fang family.

356
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,190
I

357
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,470
follow the order.

358
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,640
I'm leaving.

359
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,880
Don't kneel still.

360
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,830
Go to look for her.

361
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,800
Yes.

362
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,710
Grandma,

363
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,110
the written instruction…

364
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,230
I've done

365
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
what I can do.

366
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,350
You go to

367
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,830
the west of the city.

368
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,470
You go to…

369
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,590
-Grandma. -…the east of the city.

370
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,680
Yes!

371
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,640
Set out.

372
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,800
Your Ladyship!

373
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,590
You're back.

374
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,950
Are you all right?

375
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,280
Senior Madame and we had been looking for you all night.

376
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,430
Grandma.

377
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,760
Where had you been

378
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,040
last night?

379
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,280
I went to gather herbs.

380
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,000
You,

381
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,040
you acted rashly.

382
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,560
You…

383
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,800
Grandma,

384
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,800
it's great that Jiuling is back.

385
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,070
She went to gather herbs

386
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,000
for me.

387
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,590
As an adult,

388
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,590
why are you

389
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,400
so thoughtless?

390
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,710
Now that you stayed out to gather herbs all night,

391
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,310
you should 

392
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,640
have told your families early.

393
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,640
It's my fault.

394
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,000
I shouldn't come back late.

395
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,310
Sorry to make you worry about me.

396
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,830
Miss Jun is not a doctor.

397
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,560
Why did she go up the mountains to gather herbs?

398
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,190
Yeah.

399
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,430
Jiuling is indeed a doctor.

400
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,350
She cured my legs.

401
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,310
The Jun family is a medical family,

402
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,640
and she has inherited the medical skills.

403
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,310
Well,

404
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,760
you showed the written instruction

405
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,280
of His Majesty

406
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,070
just in time.

407
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
What written instruction?

408
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,350
Grandma,

409
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,190
now that she is back,

410
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,070
let's go back home.

411
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,950
Jun Jiuling,

412
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,920
you were thoughtless this time.

413
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,000
Grandma,

414
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,680
Jiuling…

415
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,280
Chengyu,

416
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,880
don't talk back to your grandma.

417
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,680
I'm sorry my thoughtlessness

418
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,880
made you worried.

419
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,760
Grandma,

420
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
I want to…

421
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,430
You get out first.

422
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,880
Yes.

423
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,920
Jiuling stays here.

424
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,470
The written instruction…

425
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,710
You just need to know that

426
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,640
the written instruction

427
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,230
is true.

428
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160
But I had sworn that I wouldn't tell 

429
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,830
the origin of the written instruction

430
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,920
to anyone.

431
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,920
I just wonder

432
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,800
why you took it out 

433
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
just now.

434
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,430
After all, you didn't take it out

435
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,680
when father

436
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,000
and my husband

437
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,680
had an accident.

438
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,710
Back then,

439
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,190
I didn't know they were murdered.

440
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,950
Grandma worried that I would be murdered?

441
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,640
But why did you

442
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,830
take it out just now?

443
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,040
It's simple.

444
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,190
She can cure Chengyu of his disease

445
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,000
and has helped our Fang family.

446
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,800
Thank you, grandma.

447
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,710
Grandma,

448
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,640
I want to ask you

449
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,830
about something.

450
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,640
Then I'm leaving first.

451
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,470
Mother.

452
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,430
Mother.

453
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,830
How is grandma?

454
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,470
Don't worry.

455
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,760
Your grandma is not angry.

456
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,040
That's great.

457
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,920
Sure enough,

458
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,590
she can please everyone.

459
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,880
Of course.

460
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,280
Mother,

461
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,110
now that we failed to give a reception for Jiuling yesterday,

462
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,430
let's have a rich lunch

463
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,830
to welcome her today.

464
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:58,830
Shaoyao,

465
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,760
issue my order.

466
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,560
Yes.

467
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,110
Wait.

468
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,400
Heat a pot of wine

469
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,430
to celebrate Jiuling's safe return.

470
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,520
Mother,

471
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,350
I'm going to prepare for it first.

472
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,590
OK.

473
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,590
You really don't care about me after getting married.

474
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,830
I never thought I'd see this day.

475
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,680
Mother,

476
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,310
I also care about you.

477
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,190
Mother,

478
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,110
you suffered

479
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,800
for me.

480
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,590
Grandma,

481
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,350
the reason why I came back late is that

482
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,280
I came across someone

483
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,760
I shouldn't have seen

484
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,000
in the street yesterday.

485
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,760
Who?

486
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,920
A eunuch.

487
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,000
Eunuch?

488
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:57,950
Yes.

489
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,800
Eunuchs can't go out of the imperial palace at will.

490
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,280
Maybe 

491
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,520
you mistook someone for the eunuch.

492
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,310
I once saw him when I went to

493
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,470
the imperial palace with my father.

494
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,230
So I absolutely didn't mistake him.

495
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,000
Eunuchs indeed can't go out of the imperial palace without permission.

496
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,190
But what if he did so by order of His Majesty?

497
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,310
Even so,

498
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
it's not a big deal.

499
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,110
Our Fang family has His Majesty's written instruction,

500
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,520
so it's reasonable for His Majesty

501
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,760
to dispatch an attendant here.

502
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,710
Grandma,

503
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,310
even if someone doesn't intend to do harm to us,

504
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,560
we should always guard against the harm he may do to us.

505
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,430
We can't make full preparations

506
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,110
for everything,

507
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,590
and the commitments won't remain unchanged forever.

508
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,310
This is human joy,

509
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,590
fighting with the heaven

510
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,310
and earth.

511
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,110
Are you going to

512
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,520
deceive yourself still?

513
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,160
You know

514
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,430
His Majesty dispatched him

515
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,160
not just to watch the Fang family

516
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,040
but also to uproot the Fang family.

517
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,640
I heard from the eunuch that

518
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,470
His Majesty is going to uproot the Fang family.

519
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,230
To be honest,

520
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,590
I had seen the seal in your box.

521
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,040
It's related to the official silver in the third year of the Taiyan period,

522
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,430
right?

523
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,560
Why do you know it?

524
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,350
If my guess is right,

525
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,710
that batch of official silver

526
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,190
was not sent to Beiqi at all.

527
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,230
When Chu Rang was still a vassal,

528
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,430
Zezhou was his fief.

529
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,230
The official silver was sent to Beiqi

530
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,110
via here,

531
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,800
but Chu Rang

532
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,350
transferred the official silver to the Fang's mansion halfway

533
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,560
as the initial capital of the Fang family.

534
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,590
Then,

535
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,230
your Fang family

536
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,760
recruited followers

537
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,800
and earned money for Chu Rang.

538
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,000
But he 

539
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,430
didn't care about his father and brother

540
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,760
abducted by Beiqi people at all,

541
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,680
because he wanted less people

542
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,040
to hinder him.

543
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,000
No. No.

544
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,310
Back then,

545
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,230
our Fang family was confused

546
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,800
and committed a blunder,

547
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,070
but we were

548
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,920
also punished.

549
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,760
Both the father

550
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,190
and grandpa of Chengyu

551
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,230
died for it.

552
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,920
Why?

553
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,880
Why?

554
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,040
Why can't he let us off?

555
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,400
Why?

556
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,110
Grandma,

557
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,880
have you never thought that

558
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,000
he is the one who has framed the Fang family up

559
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
these years?

560
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,710
I doubt him,

561
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,760
but I have no evidence.

562
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,280
Chu Rang 

563
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,830
knows our Fang family retained the written instruction,

564
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,070
so he won't hurt us.

565
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,430
He won't hurt our Fang family.

566
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,590
He won't.

567
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,280
He won't.

568
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,310
He won't hurt our Fang family!

569
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,110
He won't.

570
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
He won't.

571
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,110
Grandma,

572
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,310
now

573
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,000
the written instruction

574
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,710
can't protect the Fang family anymore.

575
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,950
Instead, the top priority is to deal with the troubles

576
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,070
caused by it.

577
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,590
You can't conceal that

578
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,040
the Fang family is the imperial merchant anymore.

579
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,190
First,

580
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,280
everyone has known that

581
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,590
you took out the written instruction in Zezhou,

582
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,110
which will cause many doubts.

583
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,470
Second,

584
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
if Chu Rang knows it,

585
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,920
he must doubt the Fang family,

586
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,070
but we don't know what he will do.

587
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,040
Then what should we do?

588
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Conceal the matter about the official silver in the third year of the Taiyan period

589
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,560
and tell the world the Fang family is the imperial merchant.

590
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,470
Don't worry.

591
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,040
I'll ask someone

592
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,470
to spread it

593
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,110
as far as possible.

594
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,590
In this way,

595
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,070
Chu Rang doesn't dare to act rashly,

596
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,000
and the Fang family may avoid the disaster.

597
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,040
OK.

598
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,590
This is the last resort for our Fang family

599
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,400
to save ourselves

600
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,680
in the crisis,

601
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
so we'll listen to you.

602
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,680
I know this matter is important,

603
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
so no one will know it in the Fang family

604
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,800
except you and me.

605
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,520
You can be relieved.

606
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,680
Jiuling,

607
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,640
our Fang family

608
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,070
will be saved.

609
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,350
She should finish the chat with grandma.

610
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,830
I'm going to have a look.

611
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,160
She hasn't eaten for a night.

612
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,070
She must be hungry.

613
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,920
Chengyu,

614
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,920
I must tell you something.

615
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,070
What's the matter?

616
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,280
Your marriage with Jiuling

617
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,760
is not true.

618
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,190
Mother,

619
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,350
don't fool me

620
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
in this way in the future.

621
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,190
I'm telling the truth, Chengyu.

622
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,350
To treat you

623
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,230
behind others' back,

624
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,680
you got married

625
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,160
on the pretext of warding off the evil.

626
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,070
Why didn't 

627
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,000
she tell me?

628
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,110
It's unfair for her

629
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,520
to do it

630
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,950
and also tell you the truth.

631
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,920
My legs have been cured,

632
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,520
and she will leave,

633
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,160
so it's time

634
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,920
to tell me the truth,

635
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,040
right?

636
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,590
No, Chengyu.

637
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,040
You misunderstand me.

638
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,920
In my opinion,

639
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,430
as long as my legs are cured,

640
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,430
and I can stand up,

641
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
I can be with her.

642
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,920
It turns out that

643
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
everything is false.

644
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,000
Of course not.

645
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,040
Your legs have been cured,

646
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,310
and you can walk now.

647
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,830
These are true.

648
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,430
I wish I'd never got better.

649
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,000
Don't say so.

650
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,680
Chengyu,

651
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,000
Jiuling doesn't want you to behave like this, either.

652
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
You're clever.

653
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,400
You must know

654
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,280
Jiuling doesn't love you.

655
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,070
As a man,

656
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,430
you should be

657
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,680
open-minded

658
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,190
and decisive.

659
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,760
Mother,

660
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,280
we should 

661
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,280
settle this matter for Jiuling.

662
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
Now that we had held the wedding ceremony,

663
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,070
bowed to the heaven and earth,

664
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,230
gave offerings to the deities,

665
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,800
given a banquet

666
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,680
and invited all the people in the city to attend the wedding,

667
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,280
we can't only

668
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,710
tell others that

669
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,520
it's false,

670
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,400
which is unfair to Jiuling.

671
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,640
So you want to

672
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,470
give her a divorce settlement?

673
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,280
I'm not just going to give her a divorce settlement

674
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,590
but will also tell everyone in the city

675
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,920
and the deities.

676
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:10,920
Only in this way

677
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,560
can it be fair to Jiuling.

678
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,920
For me,

679
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,040
she fooled the heaven and earth,

680
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,470
deities

681
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,040
and all the people in the city,

682
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,800
so I should tell the heaven and earth,

683
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,800
deities

684
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,950
and all the people in the city

685
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,110
how kindhearted

686
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,430
she is

687
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,590
and what she has done.

688
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,800
You become mature.

689
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,880
Your Ladyship.

690
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,280
Your Ladyship.

691
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,430
Are you OK?

692
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,520
Yes.

693
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,350
You've packed everything up?

694
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,110
You can finally go to the capital city

695
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,310
to realize your wish.

696
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,110
Yeah.

697
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,920
I always want to go to the capital city.

698
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,000
Now I can finally go.

699
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,190
But I'm loath to leave.

700
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,070
You're loath

701
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,800
to part with Young Master Fang?

702
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,350
Don't talk nonsense.

703
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,950
Chengyu is always my cousin.

704
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,760
It turns out that

705
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,520
you really don't love me.

706
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,800
And

707
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,590
the whole Fang family

708
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,040
are good to us,

709
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,950
right?

710
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,880
Cousin.

711
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,760
Chengyu.

712
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,190
Young Master.

713
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Your Ladyship,

714
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,760
this is the first time I hear Young Master Fang

715
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,590
calling you cousin.

716
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,040
What's the matter?

717
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,350
I want to

718
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,920
tell you something.

719
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,230
Go ahead.

720
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,040
I think

721
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
you should need it.

722
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,389
Divorce settlement?

723
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,360
Thank you

724
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:30,999
for protecting our Fang family.

725
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
You're welcome.

726
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,149
We are

727
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,040
of the same family.

728
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,710
You will

729
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,230
set out tomorrow?

730
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,710
How about going out for a walk?

731
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,150
OK.

732
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,710
Be careful on the way

733
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,950
to the capital city.

734
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,190
Take good care of yourself.

735
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,840
I won't go alone.

736
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,230
I'll go with Liu'er.

737
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,390
So you must take good care of yourself,

738
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,000
because you still need to think of Liu'er.

739
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,390
Cousin,

740
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,390
if you need help,

741
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,670
you can go to the firm.

742
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
Deshengchang also has branches in the capital city.

743
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I'll tell them.

744
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,080
OK.

745
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,950
You came to see me

746
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,120
to prevent me from leaving

747
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,470
without telling you?

748
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,360
I planned to see you

749
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,470
after finishing packing up

750
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,520
my belongings.

751
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,760
Unexpectedly, you came first.

752
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,360
Then,

753
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
can I ask you a question?

754
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,280
Yes.

755
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,840
Will

756
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,470
you come back?

757
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,840
Of course.

758
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,120
My families are here.

759
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,760
I'll be back after I settle my matters.

760
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,670
The swordsmen always help others,

761
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,760
and Weiniang was known for her uniqueness.

762
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,150
But everyone can benefit from the good deeds

763
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,840
they did in this way,

764
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,950
so she is not extraordinary.

765
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,600
You're not strange to the woman that

766
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
I'm going to introduce today.

767
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,950
She is Miss Jun

768
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,320
who is famous in Zezhou.

769
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,390
The stories about the extraordinary woman Miss Jun

770
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,080
should be told from the past.

771
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,670
She canceled the engagement with Mr. Ning,

772
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,950
pushed herself forward in Jinyun Restaurant

773
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,520
and married Mr. Fang.

774
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,630
All these

775
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,080
are under her control.

776
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,320
Be patient

777
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,280
and listen to me.

778
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,230
All this begins with the origin of Miss Jun.

779
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,190
You only know that Miss Jun

780
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,910
is the granddaughter of the Fang family.

781
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,280
But do you know 

782
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,360
her family 

783
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,760
has practiced medicine for generations and inherited medical skills

784
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,390
for several hundred years?

785
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,430
Her father,

786
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,190
Jun Yingwen

787
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,000
was a famous doctor in Runan.

788
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,040
She is Jun Jiuling,

789
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,080
the highly skilled doctor

790
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,950
who learnt the medical skills at home

791
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,520
