19
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,560
Chengyu, look over there.

20
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,280
Chengyu, it's cold at night. Do you want a handwarmer?

21
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,350
No need.

22
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,410
Sister, Chengyu is a lot better now and not that afraid of the cold.

23
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,660
- Too much heat may cause dryness for him. 
 - Okay, we'll do as Zhenzhen says.

24
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,560
Little brother.

25
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,030
The Fire God temple is ahead.

26
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,090
- It's the most lively there every Lantern Festival. 
 - Yes.

27
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,240
Will mother worry about other seeing me sick?

28
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,390
You didn't do anything wrong. What are you scared of?

29
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Relax.

30
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,480
- There is an endless stream of people here to see the lanterns today. 
 - Many people.

31
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,260
Yunzhao, you'd be missing out if you didn't come today. You should thank me.

32
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,870
Exactly.

33
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,770
Why is it so lively ahead? Are they showing the best lanterns?

34
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,200
Right. I heard

35
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,450
that the lanterns this year are of various styles, unique, and novel.

36
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,920
Let's go check it out.

37
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,740
Let's go take a look.

38
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,210
The festive lanterns this year are really nice.

39
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,610
Does Brother Wenming like to see lanterns in the daytime?

40
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,290
Seeing lanterns in the daytime?

41
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,570
I think that seeing lanterns in the daytime is a different kind of experience.

42
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,490
I don't have such refined interests. I only like

43
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,000
the grand view

44
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,290
of the many colors and bright lights.

45
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,760
You're still the same as always.

46
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,740
Yunzhao, look at that.

47
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,310
What should we do

48
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,170
if we encounter Miss Fang here today?

49
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,770
Right. What should we do?

50
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,980
Act naturally. It'll be fine as long as we enjoy the view.

51
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,490
Even if people joke and talk about me,

52
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,360
what does that have to do with me?

53
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,310
He's indeed from the Ning family.

54
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,430
He minds his own business!

55
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,440
Grandmother, look over there.

56
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,810
Grandmother, later, I want to leave for a bit.

57
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,090
We're celebrating festivities today. Spread out, you don't have to stay by our sides.

58
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,420
Go see the lights.

59
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,500
Go see the lights.

60
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,280
Go see the lights.

61
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,630
Let me help you, Miss.

62
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,650
- Chengyu, isn't it nice to be out here? 
 - Yes.

63
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,440
Look over there.

64
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,700
Eleventh month, fifteenth day.

65
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,130
He has good skill.

66
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,790
Four seasons, fifteenth day.

67
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,800
Person, fifteenth day.

68
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,950
Miss, where is the lantern you made? Are we there yet?

69
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,420
Don't worry.

70
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,810
We're almost there.

71
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,810
I just saw someone selling nuts. Do you want some? I'll go buy it.

72
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,440
Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

73
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,040
Here you go.

74
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,440
I lost.

75
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,010
Everyone, is anyone else up for a challenge?

76
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,200
Chess master, don't challenge him just yet.

77
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,140
Wait for all of us to have had our fun.

78
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,090
Then you can take up the challenge and impress everyone.

79
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,480
I'll challenge you.

80
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,790
Do well, don't lose.

81
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,500
It'll be embarrassing.

82
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,010
Five elements, six palaces.

83
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,780
Six palaces, five elements.

84
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,960
That's a mistake.

85
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,170
Seven dippers, six palaces.

86
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,120
Seven dippers, five elements.

87
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,420
Six palaces, six palaces, long.

88
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,710

Eighteen stars, eight directions.

Eighteen pines, seven dippers, connect.

 - Five elements, nineteen guests.

93

95
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,910

<i>Thirteen intercalary days. Earth.</i>

126
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,360
Your Go skills are excellent and admirable.

127
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,650
I admit you outdid me.

128
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,040
Don't need to be modest.

129
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,270
"Don't need to be modest." I should say it to you instead.

130
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,780
Decisive and thoughtful, you thought twice before making every move.

131
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,690
Your skills are truly superior than mine. It wasn't just a fluke.

132
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,910
But why didn't you move the last piece?

133
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,590
Did you try to avoid embarrassing me?

134
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,000
Of course not.

135
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,390
It was obvious who had won. Why would I do that?

136
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,390
You can tell someone's personality by how they make moves. Your style was elegant.

137
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,850
I had a good time playing you today.

138
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm Ning Yunzhao. May I know your name?

139
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,060
So you are Young Master Ning?

140
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,050
That's me.

141
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,800
May I know who your teacher is?

142
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,060
My teacher is my deceased father.

143
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,600
Where do you live?

144
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,330
Will I have another chance to play you?

145
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,560
Your Go skills are quite good.

146
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,780
You're more impressive than I thought.

147
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,630
This is for you.

148
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,300
Are you comforting me since I lost?

149
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,190
Happy birthday.

150
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,680
<i>After all, he once had a marriage contract with Zhenzhen.</i>

151
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,540
<i>If Zhenzhen was alive, she would definitely be satisfied with the marriage.</i>

152
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,560
<i>I gave him the lantern for Zhenzhen.</i>

153
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,230
<i>Yunzhao,</i>

154
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,410
I lost.

155
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,990
When did you receive the lantern?

156
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,890
Who gave you this?

157
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,770
I just met a lady who beat me at Go.

158
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,760
- Beat you? 
 - You played Go?

159
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,040
When did you play Go?

160
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,660
That doesn't sound right. A child prodigy, you remembered all the Go moves you'd seen at the age of eight

161
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,150
and ranked level four, Understanding Changes, at the age of twenty.

162
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,520
Which woman in the world could beat you at Go?

163
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,550
Which family is she from?

164
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,560
I want to know too.

165
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,320
Miss! Wait for me, Miss.

166
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,200
I finally found you. I thought I'd lost you in the crowd.

167
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,710
Where's the lantern you made?

168
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,310
It's right there.

169
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,300
Why is it dim?

170
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,200
This lantern is a Go board, embellished with pieces all over.

171
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,090
Now Black is just one step away from winning this game.

172
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,570
If someone can make the right move, the lantern will be lit up.

173
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,080
- Give it a try. 
 - Let me try.

174
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,000
Hold on.

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,910
Not everyone can give it a try.

176
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,040
Look.

177
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,200
<i>The 5,000-tael note in this Chinese crystal cup is the prize.</i>

178
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,010
<i>- 5,000 taels–</i> 
 - Whoever lights up the lantern can win the prize.

179
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,020
- 5,000 taels? 
 - 5,000 taels?

180
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,150
<i>You can give it a try for 10 taels.</i>

181
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,290
If you have no money... get out of here!

182
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,510
<i>[Hit the Ground Running]</i>

183
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,010
Miss, do you think the 5,000 taels is...

184
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,790
Exactly.

185
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,930
The money the Ning family gave you for breaking off the engagement...

186
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,830
Did you use the money the Ning family gave you for breaking off the engagement as the prize?

187
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,960
Does it mean if we lose, we'll lose everything?

188
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,500
Don't worry. Very few people in the world can solve it.

189
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,620
Good. Good. Then I can sit back and watch.

190
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,080
What do you think, second brother?

191
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,810
Isn't it crowded with lanterns lit up at night?

192
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,480
Even though Zezhou is small,

193
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,650
the Lantern Festival here can compare with the one in the capital.

194
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,590
Second brother, you've been exhausted lately. Just relax.

195
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,560
Also, someone set up a Go game today,

196
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,950
where you can give it a try for 10 taels.

197
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,700
If you win, you can take 5,000 taels home.

198
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,320
I think I can win it for sure. I'll win it for sure.

199
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,880
- Second brother. 
 - Baotang.

200
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,690
Second brother, look.

201
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,810
I have something serious to do. Don't take me

202
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,120
to irrelevant places like this.

203
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,190
Second brother, we've arrived. It's right there, second brother.

204
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,320
Don't. Don't go. Let's give it a try.

205
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,700
The Fang family's cousin set up a Go game over there. Let's take a look.

207
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,760
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

208
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,820
Go game?

209
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,810
<i>With 10 taels,</i>

210
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,100
you can only buy high-quality rouge from a high-end cosmetics shop in Zezhou.

211
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,940
You can only buy a famille Ding ware tea set.

212
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,470
<i>You can only pay for a table of a top-notch feast at Luyang Restaurant.</i>

213
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,110
You can only buy an ink brush made with wolf fur from the north.

214
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,090
Miss, did you teach him to say that?

215
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,220
No.

216
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,760
Now we've been in Zezhou for a while, our money's tight indeed.

217
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,330
Second brother, you've changed.

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,840
Have I changed?

219
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:18,410
No, no, no. You haven't changed. You haven't changed.

220
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,420
What are you looking at?

221
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,740
With 10 taels, you have a chance of winning 5,000 taels.

222
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,450
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

223
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,450
<i>This keeper is knowledgeable.</i>

224
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,800
It looks like he's always traveling.

225
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,260
I'm a businessman. I'll give it a try.

226
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,590
Miss, we've made 10 taels.

227
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,080
<i>Look.</i>

228
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,370
<i>- Hurry. 
 - I'll try.</i>

229
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,940
<i>Yunzhao.</i>

230
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,310
<i>Yunzhao,</i> you've excelled in Go since you were little.

231
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,150
Why don't you give it a try?

232
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,050
<i>Whoever set it up is a clever person with brilliant Go skills and in an extraordinary state of mind</i>

233
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,750
But this game... I can't solve it.

234
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,920
You can't solve it?

235
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,240
Just give it a try first.

236
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,650
This is a chance of winning 5,000 taels with 10 taels.

237
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,310
If you don't go, I'll go in a bit.

238
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,960
This game can't be solved.

239
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,490
Chengyu, this year's lanterns are more beautiful than ever before.

240
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,180
How joyful it is.

241
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,610
- That's right. 
 <i>- Grandma, you see how pretty that is?</i>

242
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,400
<i>Look at that.</i>

243
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,020
Right?

244
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,310
Grandma, do you know where Zhenzhen is?

245
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,600
Why hasn't she come back?

246
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,240
It's so crowded and she's probably so happy that she's forgotten it.

247
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,310
Then do you know where her lantern is?

248
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,970
I don't.

249
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,610
I really don't.

250
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,940
Grandma, I'm a bit tired. <i>Let's go home.</i>

251
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,380
Chengyu, are you okay?

252
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,710
I'm okay.

253
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,860
You're tired indeed. We've been browsing for a while.

254
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,790
Go. Let's head home. Let's head home.

255
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,950
- Grandma, I haven't had enough fun. 
 - Let's head home, sister.

256
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,420
You see how pretty that is?

257
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,510
Hurry.

258
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,930
I'll try.

259
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,550
- Nobody wants to try now. 
 - Exactly.

260
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,110
I'll do it.

261
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,280
Only 10 taels.

262
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,840
That's fine as long as we have fun.

263
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,280
- He's not good. 
 - He dared to give it a try despite his caliber.

264
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,680
- I'll do it. 
 <i>- Nobody can solve it. You're just a sugar figure seller. What's the point of trying?</i>

265
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,240
<i>- Somebody's playing. Don't disturb them. 
 - Why give it a try?</i>

266
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,290
Exactly.

267
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,060
If I light up this lantern, you'll be impressed.

268
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,960
He seems quite confident.

269
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,320
- Make a move. 
 - Make a move.

270
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,410
<i>- Just take the money back. 
 - Can you do it?</i>

271
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,770
<i>- Exactly. Can you do it? 
 - Hurry up and make a move.</i>

272
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>Make a move now.</i>

273
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,640
<i>- Do you think it's easy to make money? 
 - Just place it somewhere.</i>

274
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,430
<i>Can you do it?</i>

275
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,400
It's lit up! It's lit up!

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,460
<i>He is so good.<i></i></i>

277
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,530
<i>Yeah, so good</i>

278
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,710
I figured out the chess gameplay.

279
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,510
I figured out the chess gameplay.

280
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,380
I did it. I did it.

281
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,600
I did it.

282
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,060
I figured out the chess game.

283
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,560
Where is the money?

284
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,370
Does he know?

285
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,010
That's right.

286
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,080
Whether I know how I play or not? I am the one who got it nevertheless.

287
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,940
What is he saying?

288
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,210
Deliver the left over small taels to my house.

289
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,510
Return our money to us.

290
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,190
Miss.

291
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,310
Our money is all gone.

292
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,320
Five thousand taels.

293
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,300
How long would it take to earn that back?

294
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,690
Miss.

295
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,160
Miss.

296
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,660
I was only joking before.

297
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,570
Its only five thousand taels. You are so brilliant.

298
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,760
Will earn that back very soon.

299
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,920
I wasn't thinking about the money.

300
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,790
Watch where you are going.

301
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,730
Miss.

302
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,490
- Manager Gao. 
 - This is the person watching the lantern, Lai Zhong Liang.

303
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,040
What are you doing?

304
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,580
It's all right, Manager Gao.

305
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,520
We met last night. You did well.

306
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,860
Miss, you were at the scene yesterday?

307
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,250
Since I made the lantern, naturally I need to take a look.

308
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,730
Then did Miss know who won at the end?

309
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,490
I heard people calling him Chen Qi.

310
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,730
Right, his name is Chen Qi.

311
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,480
- He is a candy selling peddlar. 
 - He doesn't know how to play chess.

312
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,060
He...doesn't know to play chess.

313
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,320
Then he scammed us?

314
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,570
Mister Lai, we asked you here today to check with you as well.

315
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,620
Yesterday did you see anything suspicious at the end.

316
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,030
I am only paid for watching the lanterns.

317
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,130
Liu'er.

318
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,430
Last night,

319
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,920
<i> - Can I ask you a question? 
 - What question? </i>

320
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,340
<i>This five thousand taels is enough for your entire lifetime's spending. </i>

321
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,180
<i> Why didn't you just directly take it? </i>

322
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,320
<i> This young sir, who are you looking down at? <i></i></i>

323
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,260
<i> It was agreed on who gets it. <i></i></i>

324
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,570
<i> If you didn't advised me just before, I would most likely placed wrong. <i></i></i>

325
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,770
<i> Then I wouldn't even be able to earn those couple hundred taels.<i></i></i>

326
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,440
<i> You actually keep your words. <i></i></i>

327
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,820
<i> Give me the money. <i></i></i>

328
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,720
<i> What money? <i></i></i>

329
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,380
<i> I am missing one candy there. <i></i></i>

330
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,840
<i> Look at this person. <i></i></i>

331
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,070
Two man in their twenties.

332
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,570
One call the other Second Brother, is that right?

333
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,760
Since you know already, why did. you ask me over.

334
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,880
- This... 
 - No...

335
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,430
Lai Zhong Liang, you...

336
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,520
Where did Mr. Lai used to work previously?

337
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,460
He watches the vehicles at the money exchange.

338
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,610
He's been at the Fang Family for quite a number of years.

339
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,800
Miss, you lost so much money yesterday.

340
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,170
Aren't you angry?

341
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,830
What is there to be angry over?

342
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,340
They used their true ability to win the chess game.

343
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,510
Doesn't matter who figured it out.

344
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,090
Brother.

345
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,980
It's not right.

346
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,570
Brother.

347
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,230
Yangyang, you are mischievious again.

348
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,670
Brother,

349
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,540
what is interesting about chess game? You've been pondering it since last night.

350
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,000
It's an ancient gameplay. I was trying to solve it.

351
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,070
My brother is so brilliant. You surely can solve it.

352
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,650
Brother, this lantern is pretty.

353
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,600
I will take it to make a pair with my own.

354
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,800
You can't.

355
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,370
I am not taking it.

356
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,900
I will just borrow it for a few days. I will return it.

357
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,830
If you like this, I will buy a new one.

358
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,860
Is there a matter you need me for?

359
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,640
Mother asked me to inquire when you plan to return to the capital?

360
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,360
I'll leave in a few days. I'll go tell mother personally.

361
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,890
Then I'll get going, Brother.

362
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,430
All right.

363
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,930
You come in here without prior notification.

364
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,890
What is that about?

365
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,710
Santao asked me to come.

366
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,420
I saw that you were in a good mood. So i didn't interrupt.

367
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,260
Did you have a good time last night?

368
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,840
It's not bad.

369
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,200
No wonder, you didn't return.

370
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,700
Of course you had fun without my annoying presence.

371
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,590
You are mad?

372
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,350
All right, it's my fault. I was too focus on the lantern.

373
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,470
I missed the time. Didn't come back to be with you.

374
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,380
I also know that you lost money. A large amount.

375
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,900
You know all about it?

376
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,770
I know it. Grandmother told me yesterday.

377
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,820
Told me not to mention this matter in front of you.

378
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,740
Yet you brought it up?

379
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,280
I wanted to.

380
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,210
Come.

381
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,780
You are recovering well.

382
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,040
You will soon can do a medicinal soak.

383
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,810
I don't need you for the medicinal soak. Let Santao do that.

384
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,420
Santao also has to listen to me. In addition,

385
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,060
- I will be marrying you soon. You needn't be shy anymore. 
 - You...

386
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,250
<i>[Yunmengze Inn]</i>

387
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,600
You have a guest.

388
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,110
Miss Jun, why are you here?

389
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,510
You spent all night trying to solve my game to wait for me to come over, didn't you?

390
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,350
What do you mean?

391
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,580
Do sugar figures taste good, second brother?

392
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,460
Miss Jun is very smart.

393
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,120
I came to ask you how you figured out the chess gameplay.

394
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,350
I can answer you after you answer my question.

395
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,450
OK. Ask.

396
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,900
How did Deshengchang start making a fortune?

397
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,780
Why do you ask this?

398
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,240
Deshengchang's business is booming,

399
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,210
so I want to learn how to do business and make money.

400
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,380
You came to the lantern shop for me.

401
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,670
You managed to win my 5,000 taels at the Lantern Festival and trick me into coming here. Is it worth it?

402
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,550
It's worth it.

403
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,340
I'm not done asking. When it comes to cargos,

404
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,780
there's a list of customers

405
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,770
showing their destinations and names.

406
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,120
Since Deshengchang deals with many customers,

407
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,560
there should be documents.

408
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,760
<i>He's really digging into the secret of Zezhou.</i>

409
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,280
You think too highly of me.

410
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,240
How could an outsider like me know about such confidential information?

411
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,270
So can you answer my question?

412
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,540
Because I am smart.

413
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,180
-You. -Forget it. I will stop teasing you.

414
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,460
Actually, my father told me.

415
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,150
When my father taught me this chess gameplay,

416
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,460
I listen very, very carefully to him.

417
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,700
Only becaseu I am smart. I got it right away.

418
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,020
The audience who watched us playing all praised me.

419
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,180
They said, "Wow! You're very smart!

420
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,430
You're an invincible, extremely intelligent hero."

421
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,810
I...

422
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,000
So, I am really smart.

423
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,680
Second brother, Sky Pavilion has figured out the medicinal herbs.

424
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,030
-What is it for? 
 -This prescription is for chronic disease.

425
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,240
But it was rare to put so many herbs together.

426
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,040
Never seen anything like this.

427
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,500
In Fang family, there is only one person

428
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,010
has chronic disease.

429
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,110
The dying young master Fang?

430
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,640
<i>[Fuxiang Medicine Shop]</i>

431
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,420
Put it all to the side.

432
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,040
- Place them. 
 - Got it shopkeeper.

433
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,860
-Hi Miss Jun. -Hi shopkeeper.

434
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,180
Is the prescription that I reserved ready?

435
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,780
Here it is. Wait for a moment.

436
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,360
-I will get it for you. -Thank you.

437
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,200
Miss Jun, can I ask you

438
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,510
who prescribed it for you?

439
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,520
Antying wrong?

440
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,280
Nothing wrong. It is just weird.

441
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,260
Seperately, each herb is good.

442
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,130
But I don't know why mixing more than 10 herbs together

443
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,400
They are all detox herbs.

444
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,880
One or two detox herbs should be sufficient. 
But mixing more than 10 herbs

445
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,960
is an overdose of medicine, like the saying said.

446
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,400
It can backfire.

447
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,720
Miss Jun, it not only cannot detox,

448
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,850
it may harm you.

449
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,980
Thank you for your concern. I know what it is. It should be fine.

450
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,680
Since you know,

451
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,650
please take it.

452
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,910
-Thank you. -Have a good day.

Is it difficult to bump into me?

456
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,160
You're detoxifying the young master, right?

457
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,360
Why do you always think you're so clever?

458
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,600
How do you explain the purpose of the prescription?

459
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,610
I am ignorant.

460
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,290
What disease needs more than 10 detox herbs?

461
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,350
As a doctor, I get it to research on herbs.

462
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,350
Is it not right?

463
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,800
It sounds good.

464
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,910
But see if what I'm thinking makes sense as well.

465
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,040
Family Fang has only one son for three generations.

466
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,190
They've been cursed.

467
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,300
I heard that this young master won't live past 16 years old.

468
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,210
It turns out that he's been deeply intoxicated.

469
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,840
If it occurs to one generation, it is an accident. Two generations, coincidence.

470
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,260
If it happens to three generations,

471
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,770
isn't it weired?

472
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,290
I don't know what you are talking about. 
 It could be destiny.

473
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,220
Guess what?

474
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,640
The male curse on the Fang family is actually artificially created.

475
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,070
The young master Fang was actually secretly poisoned.

476
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,860
You are smart.

477
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,430
But it is not inappropriate for me to heal Fang Chengyu.

478
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,120
It has nothing to do with you. Please give me a break.

479

Yanyan, your idea is wonderful.

492
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,560
She'll definitely show up with Childe Ning's letter.

493
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,560
At that time, she'll lose her innocent reputation.

494
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,670
Will she still dare to put her hopes on Childe Ning after that?

495
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,360
That is right.

 - So what?

She offended us first.

499
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,230
She first cheated my family of silver and then embarrassed us again and again.

500
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,120
It is tit for tit.

501
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,630

<i>To Jun Zhenzhen</i>

505
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,070
Although the letter comes from Ning Yunzhao's personal servant,

506
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,080
he might not the one who wrote it.

507
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,070
How so?

508
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,350
Ning Yunzhao was born into a gentry family. 
He would act openly and appropriately.

509
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,140
Even If there really was something that couldn't be talked about at home,

510
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,120
he still probably wouldn't have invited me to a place that would make girls uncomfortable.

511
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,040
This is just my guess.

512
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,630
Why didn't you let Mujin pass me a message as usual, but ask me to meet you here?

513
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,890
There are so many people watching in the residence.

514
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,540
This is too risky.

515
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,160
This is serious. We should talk in person.

516
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,420
If anything goes wrong, even if Mujin can afford that, can you?

517
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,590
Then please say it quickly.

518
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,240
I'm really worried that Mujin can't handle it on her own if this takes too long.

519
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,210
I checked carefully at the Lantern Festival last night.

520
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,760
I realized that Chengyu's condition was not improving.

521
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,050
He still looked half-dead.

522
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,090
It seemed that the marriage wasn't of much help. It won't save his life.

523
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,960
But the only thing that could go wrong now is if Jun Zhenzhen is using the marriage as an excuse,

524
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,880
to get pregnant with a male offspring of the Fang family...

525
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,090
What do you mean by that?

526
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,630
If Jun Zhenzhen dies,

527
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,640
in such a short period of time, where is the Fang family

528
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,760
going to find another girl who will willingly to marry for the sake of warding off his illness?

529
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,660
You're going to kill Jun Zhenzhen?

530
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,350
Nobody will kill her.

531
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,300
It's just that she got unlucky and had a little accident.
