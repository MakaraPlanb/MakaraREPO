00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12

♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,520
Chengyu.

21
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,000
It's cold at night.

22
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,190
Would you like a hand warmer?

23
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,080
No, thanks.

24
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,960
Jinxiu,

25
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,440
Chengyu has got better,

26
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,360
so he isn't afraid of cold.

27
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
Much heat may chafe him.

28
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,670
OK.

29
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,670
I'll listen to you.

30
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,600
Chengyu,

31
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,470

32
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,520

33
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,910
which is the most lively place

34
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,000
at the Lantern Festival every year.

35
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,030
Yes.

36
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,550
Does my Mother worry

37
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,830
I'm seen by others?

38
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,360
You doesn't do anything wrong.

39
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,310
Don't worry.

40
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,880
Relax.

41
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,640
There's a constant stream of visitors

42
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
tonight.

43
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,240
So many people.

44
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,800
Yunzhao.

45
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,270
Fortunately,

46
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,080
you're here today.

47
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,270
You should thank me.

48
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,600
Yes.

49
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,270
It's crowded ahead.

50
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,960
Are the best lanterns displayed?

51
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,190
Yes.

52
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,800
It's heard

53
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,960
there're unique and novel lanterns

54
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,960
in various styles

55
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,000
this year.

56
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:05,640
Let's go

57
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,550
and have a look.

58
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,240
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

59
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,720
Go and have a look.

60
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,830
This year's lanterns are really nice.

61
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,750
Do you like

62
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,240
to watch lanterns in the daytime?

63
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
Watch lanterns in the daytime?

64
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,800
I think

65
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,960
it's another kind of pleasure

66
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,360
to watch lanterns in the daytime.

67
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,870
I don't like it.

68
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,030
I just like

69
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,680
the colorful lanterns

70
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,990
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

71
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,150
You're still unchanged.

72
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,910
Yunzhao,

73
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,520
what if you meet

74
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,590
Miss Fang

75
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
at the lantern show

76
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,590
today?

77
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,280
What if,

78
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,960
indeed?

79
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,360
Let it be.

80
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,560
Let's just

81
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,870
have a good time.

82
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,870
Even if others laugh at

83
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,520
and talk about me,

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,310
I don't care.

85
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,640
You indeed have

86
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,080
a detached attitude.

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,240
Yes, yes, yes.

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
There're so many lanterns.

89
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,280
Grandma, look over there.

90
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,120
Grandma,

91
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,560
may I leave

92
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,640
for a while later?

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,560
Over there. Over there.

94
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
It's the Lantern Festival today.

95
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,520
Enjoy yourselves.

96
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,560
Don't accompany me.

97
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,870
Go and watch lanterns.

98
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,990
Go and watch lanterns.

99
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,280
Go and watch lanterns.

100
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,960
Let's go.

101
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,190
Let me push, Your Ladyship.

102
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,750
OK.

Yes.

106
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,190

where's the lantern you made?

115
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,400
Why haven't we seen it?

116
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,430
Don't be anxious.

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,960
We're almost there.

118
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,150
I just saw there're nuts for sale.

119
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,750
Would you like them?

120
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,310
I'll go and buy some.

121
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,120

Be careful.

Don't lose,

136
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,360

Childe, you're modest.

194
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,040
That's

195
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,750
what I should

196
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,960
say to you.

197
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,310
Decisive

198
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,350
and thoughtful,

199
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,750
you thought it over before every move.

200
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,600
Your skills are indeed

201
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,310
better than mine.

202
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,080
You didn't win by luck.

203
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,310
But why

204
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,520
didn't you

205
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,750
drop the last piece?

206
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,600
Did you worry about me?

207
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,110
No.

208
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,990
The victory or defeat is obvious.

209
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,310
I didn't need to make an unnecessary move.

210
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,520
I can know your character by your go moves.

211
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm impressed with your elegant go style.

212
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,790
I'm glad to play the go game with you.

213
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
I'm Ning Yunzhao.

214
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,230
May I

215
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,310
have your name?

216
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,400
Are you Childe Ning?

217
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,960
Yes.

218
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,430
Who is

219
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,400
your teacher?

220
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,750
My deceased father.

221
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Where is your home?

222
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,230
Can I

223
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,870
have another chance

224
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,230
to have a competition with you?

225
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,480
You have superior go skills.

226
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,670
You are also better than I thought.

227
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,640
Here is for you.

228
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,400
Are you comforting me for my failure?

229
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,110
Happy birthday to you.

230
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,520
He was engaged to Zhenzhen.

231
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,990
If Zhenzhen were still alive,

232
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,230
she would be satisfied with the marriage.

233
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,190
I gave the lantern

234
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,080
to him for Zhenzhen.

235
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,230
Yunzhao.

236
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,400
I lost.

237
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,400
When did you accept a lantern?

238
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,840
Who gave you it?

239
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,160
I met a girl

240
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,190
who won me in the go game.

241
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Won you?

242
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,750
You played a go game?

243
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,960
When did you play it?

244
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,960
No.

245
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,280
You're a child prodigy

246
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,600
who could remember every move at 8

247
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,990
and be well versed in go skills at 20.

248
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,960
Who could

249
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,990
win you in the world?

250
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,520
Who is she?

251
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,600
I also want to know.

252
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,160
Your Ladyship,

253
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,870
wait for me.

254
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,350
I finally saw you.

255
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,600
I thought I lost you

256
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,520
in the crowd.

257
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,550
Where's the lantern you made?

258
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,400
Over there.

259
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,670
"Show Your Skills".

260
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,160
Why is the lantern dim?

261
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,520
The lantern is the chessboard

262
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,670
and lanterns on it are pieces.

263
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,430
Now the black player

264
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,480
can win the game by one move.

265
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
Whoever makes the right move,

266
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,920
the lantern will light up.

267
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,790
Try. I'll try.

268
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,720
Wait.

269
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,600
Listen to me

270
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,670
before you try.

271
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,720
The 5,000-tael note in the glazed cup

272
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,670
is the prize.

273
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,280
5,000 taels.

274
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,670
Anyone who can let this lantern light up

275
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,960
can win the prize.

276
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,160
5,000 taels.

277
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,110
5,000 taels.

278
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,310
10 taels for each try.

279
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
If you have no money,

280
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,400
get out of here.

281
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,160
Your Ladyship,

282
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,160
Is the 5,000-tael note…

283
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,280
Yes.

284
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,230
You take the engagement annulment money of the Ning family…

285
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,430
You take the engagement annulment money of the Ning family as the prize.

286
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,350
If we lose,

287
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,350
we'll suffer.

288
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,720
Don't worry.

289
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,840
Few people can crack it

290
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,430
in this world.

291
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,110
That's good.

292
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,720
That's good.

293
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,520
Then I'll be a looker-on with ease.

294
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,430
Zan,

295
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,550
the streets are crowded with visitors

296
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,480
when lanterns are lit.

297
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
I think the Lantern Festival of Zezhou

298
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,190
is as lively

299
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,480
as that of the capital city.

300
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,080
Zan,

301
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,400
you've been tired lately.

302
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,480
Relax yourself.

303
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,520
Let me tell you.

304
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,430
There's a go game today,

305
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,960
with 10 taels of silver for a try.

306
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,400
The winner

307
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,430
can win a 5,000-tael note.

308
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,110
I'm determined to get it.

309
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,230
Determined to get it.

310
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,840
Zan.

311
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,790
Baotang.

312
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,640
Zan, look.

313
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,280
I'll get down to my work.

314
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,750
Don't lead me

315
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,080
to these irrelevant places later.

316
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,080
Zan, here we are.

317
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,230
It's just ahead.

318
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,840
Don't, don't go.

319
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,310
Don't go.

320
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,080
Accompany me to have a try.

321
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,040
Sorry.

322
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,110
Miss Jun of the Fang family sets a go game ahead.

323
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,670
Let's go and have a look.

324
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,640
Go, go, go.

325
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,670
A go game?

326
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,430
With 10 taels of silver,

327
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,990
you can just buy a bottle of top rouge

328
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,920
in a top rouge shop of Zezhou,

329
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,990
buy a set of famille rose teacups

330
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,280
of the Ding kiln,

331
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,280
a tableful of first-class feast at Luyang Restaurant

332
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
and a writing brush

333
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,230
made of north wolf's hair.

334
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,790
Your Ladyship,

335
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,040
did you teach him to say that?

336
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,160
No.

337
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,960
Having been in Zezhou for such a long time,

338
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,669
we're indeed short of money.

339
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,310
Zan,

340
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,400
you've changed.

341
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,720
Have I?

342
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,599
No, no, no.

343
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,749
You haven't changed.

344
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,310
You haven't changed.

345
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,669
You haven't changed.

346
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,480
You haven't changed.

347
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,870
Don't hesitate.

348
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,400
You can have a chance to win the 5,000-tael note

349
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
with only 10 taels of silver.

350
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,600
It's

351
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,400
a god-given chance.

352
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,750
This keeper

353
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,790
knows a lot.

354
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,990
It seems he must often travel widely.

355
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,870
I, a businessman,

356
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,190
would like to try.

357
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,520
Your Ladyship,

358
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,750
we earned 10 taels.

359
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,110
Look.

360
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,190
Quickly.

361
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,720
I'll try.

362
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
It's interesting.

363
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,840
Yunzhao.

364
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,430
It's so difficult.

365
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,520
Yunzhao,

366
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,280
you've been skilled at go games since childhood.

367
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,110
Go and try.

368
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,080
Of an extraordinary mood,

369
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,230
the setter must be clever

370
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,480
and skilled in go games.

371
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,990
But I can't

372
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,520
crack it.

373
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,750
Can't you?

374
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,990
Go and have a try.

375
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,350
It's

376
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,550
a rare chance.

377
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,310
If you don't go,

378
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,280
I'll go later.

379
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,870
It can't be cracked at all.

380
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,440
Chengyu,

381
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,280
this year's lanterns

382
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,950
are much nicer than those in previous years.

383
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,040
They look joyful.

384
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,320
Yes.

385
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,950
Grandma,

386
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
that lantern is pretty.

387
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,200
Look at that.

388
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:26,920
Is it pretty?

389
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,350
Grandma,

390
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,750
do you know

391
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,040
where Zhenzhen is?

392
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,470
Why hasn't she come?

393
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,560
The lantern show is very bustling.

394
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,470
She must enjoy herself a lot

395
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,200
and forget us.

396
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,950
Do you know

397
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,160
where her lantern is?

398
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:46,950
I don't know.

399
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
I really don't know.

400
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,830
Grandma,

401
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm sort of tired.

402
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,870
Let's go home.

403
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,560
Chengyu,

404
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,590
are you alright?

405
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,110
Yes.

406
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,560
Having been here for a long time,

407
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,830
I'm also tired.

408
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,230
Let's

409
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,200
go back.

410
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,710
Go back.

411
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,560
Grandma,

412
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,640
I haven't enjoyed myself.

413
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,440
Let's go back, Jinxiu.

414
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,470
That lantern is very pretty.

415
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,350
Quickly.

416
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,870
Let me try.

417
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,640
It's a wrong move.

418
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,470
No one wants to try.

419
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:49,870
Yes.

420
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,160
Me.

421
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,800
I've watched here for a long time.

422
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,200
It isn't

423
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,870
a big deal.

424
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,750
It's important to be happy.

425
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,560
It's wrong.

426
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,920
He lacks self-knowledge.

427
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,870
Me.

428
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,640
No one can crack it.

429
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,560
As a sugar figurine seller,

430
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,710
you're a layman in go.

431
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,440
Don't make trouble

432
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,320
here.

433
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
Leave there.

434
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,110
Yes.

435
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,590
I'll show you

436
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
my real skill.

437
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,830
He's so confident.

438
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,990
Lay your piece.

439
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,520
Can't you crack it?

440
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,070
You're baffled.

441
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,750
Lay your piece.

442
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,950
Lay your piece.

443
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,200
Take back your silver.

444
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,070
Can you make it?

445
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
Can you, indeed?

446
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,920
Can you make it?

447
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,750
Lay your piece.

448
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,040
Lay your piece quickly.

449
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,590
It's hard to make money.

450
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,750
Lay your piece.

451
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,280
Yes.

452
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,440
Can you make it?

453
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,800
It lights up.

454
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,160
It lights up.

455
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,350
It lights up.

456
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,680
5,000 taels.

457
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,950
I cracked it.

458
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,200
I cracked it.

459
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,070
Yunzhao.

460
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,710
I cracked it.

461
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,520
He really made the lantern light up.

462
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,680
I cracked it.

463
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,470
I cracked it.

464
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,520
I cracked it.

465
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,040
I cracked it.

466
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,680
Where is the note?

467
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,950
No matter whether I can play the go games or not,

468
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,640
I cracked it.

469
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,870
Send the rest small bits of silver to my house.

470
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,350
Return our silver to us.

471
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,200
Your Ladyship.

472
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,870
We lost all our silver,

473
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,640
5,000 taels.

474
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
How long will it take

475
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,230
to earn so much money?

476
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,710
Your Ladyship.

477
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,110
Your Ladyship.

478
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,110
I was kidding.

479
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,750
Just 5,000 taels.

480
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,560
You're so clever

481
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,710
that you can earn it quickly.

482
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,830
I'm not thinking about the lost silver.

483
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,640
Watch out.

484
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,560
Your Ladyship.

485
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,680
Butler Gao,

486
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,990
this is the keeper of your lantern last night,

487
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,560
Lei Zhonglian.

488
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,070
Why are you seated?

489
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,590
It doesn't matter,

490
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,200
Butler Gao.

491
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,350
I saw you last night.

492
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,520
You did a good job.

493
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,560
Did you also go to the scene last night?

494
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,750
I should see

495
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,950
who could crack my composition.

496
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,040
Do you know

497
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,200
who won the prize

498
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,710
in the end?

499
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,160
I heard others call him

500
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,280
Chen Qi.

501
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:29,990
Yes,

502
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,950
he's Chen Qi,

503
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,710
a sugar figurine seller.

504
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,520
In fact, he…

505
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,350
He can't play the go games.

506
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,800
Really?

507
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,950
Then he won so much silver

508
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,160
by luck.

509
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,470
Mr. Lei,

510
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,230
today I invited you here

511
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,440
to ask you a question.

512
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,680
Did you find something suspicious

513
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,520
after he cracked my composition?

514
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,920
Pay me for guarding your lantern.

515
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,070
Liu'er.

516
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,990
Last night…

517
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,400
Can I ask you a question?

518
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,280
What question?

519
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,830
5,000 taels is enough for you

520
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,830
to spend your life.

521
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,710
Why didn't you take it away?

522
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,870
Childe,

523
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,710
don't look down upon me.

524
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
We reached

525
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,920
an agreement.

526
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,680
If you hadn't reminded me,

527
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,040
I might have made a wrong move

528
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,560
and lost the chance to earn several thousand taels of silver.

529
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,200
You're true to your word.

530
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:31,950
Pay me.

531
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,870
Why?

532
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,200
I lost a sugar figurine.

533
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,950
Zan,

534
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,640
he is so mean.

535
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,440
Two childes of about 20

536
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,640
and one called the other brother,

537
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,830
right?

538
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,440
Since you know it,

539
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,750
why do you still ask me?

540
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,950
Um…

541
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,440
Well.

542
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,560
Lei Zhonglian.

543
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,750
Lei Zhonglian.

544
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,440
You…

545
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,070
What did he do before?

546
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,640
He took care of carriages in a bank.

547
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,280
He has been in our family

548
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
for years.

549
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,040
Your Ladyship,

550
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,200
are you angry about

551
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,590
losing so much money yesterday?

552
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,470
No.

553
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,950
They cracked my composition by their skill.

554
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,400
I don't care about who the winner is.

555
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,200
Yunzhao.

556
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,950
No.

557
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,590
Yunzhao.

558
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,200
Yunyan,

559
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,800
you're so naughty.

560
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,320
Yunzhao,

561
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,280
is it worth pondering?

562
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,200
You've watched it

563
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,160
since you came home last night.

564
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,640
I tried to crack

565
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,950
this ancient composition.

566
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,990
You're well versed in go games.

567
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,950
I'm sure you can crack it.

568
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,680
Yunzhao,

569
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,520
the lantern looks good.

570
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,470
I'll take it

571
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,560
and put it together with the one in my room.

572
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,750
No.

573
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,800
I don't have it,

574
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,920
and I'll give it back to you

575
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,870
after placing it in my room for several days.

576
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,160
If you like this kind of lantern,

577
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,350
I'll buy you a new one.

578
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,680
Why do you

579
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,800
come to me?

580
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,070
Our Mother wonders

581
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,590
whether you fix the date of going back to the capital city.

582
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,640
I'll leave in several days.

583
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,520
I'll go and tell our Mother personally.

584
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,640
Yunzhao,

585
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm leaving.

586
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,400
OK.

587
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,320
Why didn't you

588
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,920
tell you

589
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,680
before entering?

590
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,110
Santao asked me to come.

591
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,470
Seeing you're

592
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,520
in a good mood,

593
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,440
I didn't disturb you.

594
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,560
Did you have a good time

595
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,160
last night?

596
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,710
Yes.

597
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,320
No wonder

598
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,950
you didn't come to us.

599
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,440
I didn't trouble you,

600
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,870
so surely you could have a good time.

601
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,590
Are you angry with me?

602
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,230
Come on.

603
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,470
It's all my fault.

604
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,710
I watched who could crack my composition

605
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,320
most of the time

606
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,440
and failed to accompany you.

607
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,590
I know

608
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,640
you lost

609
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,440
a big sum of money.

610
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,520
Do you know all that?

611
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,400
Yes.

612
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,200
Grandma told me yesterday

613
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,400
and asked me not to mention it before you.

614
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,640
Then why do you mention it?

615
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,350
I'm glad to do it.

616
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,230
Give me your hand.

617
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,920
You've recovered quickly.

618
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,990
You can take a medicated bath soon.

619
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,200
Don't bother you with it.

620
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,590
Let Santao take care of me.

621
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,160
She also needs to listen to me.

622
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,520
And you and I

623
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,200
will get married.

624
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,590
Don't be shy.

625
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,200
You…

626
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,230
Childe,

627
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,590
you have a visitor.

628
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,560
Miss Jun,

629
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:39,990
what brings you here?

630
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,440
You managed to crack my composition last night.

631
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,680
Don't you wait for you?

632
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,320
Miss Jun,

633
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,280
what do you mean?

634
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,400
Does the sugar figurine taste good,

635
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,710
Zan?

636
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,230
Miss Jun is extremely intelligent.

637
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,590
I wonder

638
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,990
how you cracked my composition.

639
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,830
I can answer you,

640
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,200
but you should answer me a question first.

641
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,470
OK.

642
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,320
Go ahead.

643
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,590
How did Deshengchang start to go up?

644
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,040
Why do you ask this?

645
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,520
I find

646
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,990
its business is booming,

647
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,640
so I want to learn how to do business

648
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,830
and make some money.

649
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,950
So you came to me

650
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,110
in the lantern shop

651
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,400
and managed to ask me to visit you by winning my 5,000 taels by trick

652
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,470
at the Lantern Festival?

653
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,440
Yes.

654
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,520
I haven't finished.

655
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,200
The customers' information,

656
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,830
such as destinations and names, is recorded

657
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,350
as for the transport of general cargos.

658
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,920
Deshengchang has lots of customers,

659
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,400
so there must be documents.

660
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,710
He's indeed investigating the secret of Zezhou.

661
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,640
You really overestimate me.

662
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,400
I, one beyond the Fang family,

663
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,320
can't know

664
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,110
such a secret.

665
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,230
So can you

666
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,110
answer my question?

667
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,680
Because I am

668
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,710
extremely intelligent.

669
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,560
You…

670
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,590
Come on.

671
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,230
I'm not kidding you.

672
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,590
In fact,

673
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,040
my dad told me it.

674
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,640
When my dad taught me

675
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,920
how to crack this composition,

676
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,230
I listened

677
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,520
very carefully beside.

678
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,400
I'm extremely intelligent,

679
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
so I got it soon.

680
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,870
The people beside us

681
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,920
praised me loudly.

682
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,560
They said

683
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,200
I was very clever,

684
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,750
I was a matchless hero

685
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,070
and I was extremely intelligent.

686
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,990
I…

687
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,640
So I'm indeed extremely intelligent.

688
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,039
Zan,

689
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,590
the Sky Pavilion figured out the medicinal materials.

690
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,470
What disease can they treat?

691
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,440
This prescription is used

692
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,800
to treat a stubborn disease.

693
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,750
But such a prescription

694
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,990
with so many detoxification medicinal materials

695
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,830
is rare.

696
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,830
Only one

697
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,799
in the Fang family

698
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,870
suffers from a stubborn disease.

699
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,990
That dying Childe Fang.

700
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,990
Put all medicinal materials aside.

701
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,830
Handle it.

702
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,560
OK, shopkeeper.

703
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,870
Hello, Miss Jun.

704
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,870
Yes.

705
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,230
Have the medicinal materials

706
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,870
I booked last time come?

707
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,830
Yes.

708
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,680
Wait a Motherent.

709
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,750
I'll fetch them for you.

710
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,400
Thank you.

711
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,590
Miss Jun,

712
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,920
would you mind me asking you a question?

713
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:23,920
Who made the prescription

714
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,320
for you?

715
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,440
What's wrong with it?

716
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,520
No,

717
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,950
it's sort of strange.

718
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Each of these medicinal materials

719
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,040
is effective,

720
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,560
but it's strange

721
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,830
to mix them

722
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,440
in a parcel.

723
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,350
Most of them are used for detoxification.

724
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,710
One or two medicinal materials can work,

725
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,750
but why do you use dozens of them?

726
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,680
As the saying goes,

727
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,830
every medicine has its side effect.

728
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,750
Many of them may accomplish the very opposite.

729
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,040
Miss Jun,

730
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,440
they may not remove the toxins

731
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,440
and even hurt the patient.

732
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,990
Thank you for your tips.

733
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,070
I know about it.

734
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,710
Never mind.

735
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,750
OK.

736
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,520
It's good that you know it.

737
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,400
Please take them.

738
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,280
Thank you.

739
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,710
Miss Jun, see you.

740
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,830
It is a small world.

741
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,480
Is it hard

742
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,760
to meet me?

743
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,440
Do you want to

744
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,240
remove Childe Fang's toxins?

745
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,400
Don't always think yourself clever.

746
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,920
Why did you

747
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,030
buy these medicinal materials?

748
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,720
I'm ignorant.

749
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,480
I wonder what disease can be treated

750
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,270
with dozens of detoxification medicinal materials.

751
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,920
As a doctor,

752
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,830
is it improper for me

753
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,270
to do research with some medicinal materials?

754
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,870
It makes sense.

755
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,240
Miss Jun, listen to me

756
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,000
and think

757
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,110
whether my idea also makes sense.

758
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,400
The Fang family has had the only son for three generations in a row

759
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,510
and been cursed evilly.

760
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,440
It's said Childe Fang

761
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,110
can't live to 16

762
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,400
as he suffers from

763
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,240
the hurt of toxins.

764
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,790
It's an accident if such misfortune happens to one generation

765
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,070
and it's a coincidence

766
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,720
if such misfortune happens to two generations.

767
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,350
Is it strange

768
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,920
if such mischief happens to three generations?

769
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,720
I can't understand your words.

770
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,400
Maybe it's predestined.

771
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,720
Let me make a guess.

772
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,760
In fact, the curse of men of the Fang family

773
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,960
are caused by others, fabricated

774
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,640
and Young Master Fang

775
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,070
was secretly poisoned.

776
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,790
You're so smart.

777
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
But it's my duty

778
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
to treat Chengyu,

779
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,640
and it has nothing to do with you.

780
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,000
So please don't stop me.

781
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,920
Miss Jun, don't worry.

782
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,640
I won't tell others.

783
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,350
But please

784
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,000
do a favor for me.

785
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,070
Find the list of freight customers

786
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,830
of the Fang family over the years

787
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,960
by virtue of your identity for me.

788
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,480
Your Ladyship.

789
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,510
Here is a letter for you.

790
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,240
Where does it come from?

791
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,240
The Ning family.

792
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,160
Miss Jun,

793
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,510
there was a misunderstanding between the Ning family and the Fang family.

794
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,270
Please go to

795
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,760
Room 3 of the sky level in Jinyun Restaurant

796
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,920
on March 3 for a chat.

797
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,440
Ning Yunzhao.

798
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,070
Jun Zhenzhen,

799
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,480
you'll be tricked definitely.

800
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,510
Yunyan,

801
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,310
your idea is wonderful.

802
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,590
With Childe Ning's letter,

803
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,960
she'll definitely go.

804
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,240
By then

805
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,870
she will be blemished

806
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,110
and won't bother

807
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,760
Childe Ning anymore.

808
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,200
Yes.

809
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,550
But,

810
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,760
do we

811
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,870
go too far?

812
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,030
Aren't you afraid…

813
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,870
So what?

814
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,760
It's her fault.

815
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,510
She shouldn't have blackmailed our Ning family

816
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,790
and humiliated us

817
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,550
again and again.

818
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,160
What I did

819
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,480
is to get even.

820
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,400
Yes.

821
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,550
Your Lady,

822
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,510
drink tea.

823
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,510
Your Lady,

824
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,790
will you go to see Childe Ning by appointment?

825
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,680
This letter was sent by Childe Ning's manservant,

826
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,480
but it doesn't mean that it's written by Childe Ning.

827
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,720
Why?

828
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
Childe Ning was born from a scholarly family

829
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,640
and acts magnanimously.

830
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,510
If it was really inconvenient

831
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,590
for him to say something at home,

832
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,400
he probably wouldn't invite me

833
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,480
to a private room

834
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,790
which may stump girls.

835
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,760
Of course, it's just my guess.

836
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,790
Cousin, why didn't you let Mujin send a message as usual,

837
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,440
but let me meet here?

838
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,480
There are so many people in the mansion.

839
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,400
It's too risky to do so.

840
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,030
This matter is very serious.

841
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,960
So we'd better agree on many things ourselves.

842
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,200
In case of mistakes,

843
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,270
even if Mujin can afford it,

844
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,350
can you afford it?

845
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,960
Then let's get to the point.

846
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,240
If it takes a long time, I'm really worried that

847
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,680
Mujin can't cope.

848
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,640
At the  lantern show last night, I checked carefully

849
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,310
and found that Chengyu's condition had not improved.

850
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,310
He was still half dead.

851
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,480
It seems that a wedding can't help.

852
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,590
It can't save his life.

853
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,640
But now the only mistake is that

854
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,920
in case Jun Zhenzhen is pregnant with the children of the Fang family

855
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,200
after the wedding…

856
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,870
What do you mean by that?

857
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,070
If Jun Zhenzhen dies,

858
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,720
where can the Fang family find

859
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,480
a woman to marry him voluntarily

860
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,440
in such a short time?

861
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
Are you going to kill Jun Zhenzhen?

862
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,000
No one wants to kill her.

863
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,440
She is just unlucky enough

864
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,200
to have an accident.
