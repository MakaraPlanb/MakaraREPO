♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700

00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020

Tomb of Beloved Wife Princess Jiuling

Jinyun Restaurant  Drunken Steps by the River

21
00:21:15,970 --> 00:02:13,480
Jinyun Restaurant  Drunken Steps by the River

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,360
Cousin, why didn't you let Mujin

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
send a message as usual,

24
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,950
but let me meet here?

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
There are so many people in the mansion.

26
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,440
It's too risky

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,000
to do so.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,710
This matter is very serious.

29
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,760
So we'd better

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,870
agree on many things ourselves.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,950
In case of mistakes,

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,030
even if Mujin can afford it,

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
can you afford it?

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,640
Then let's get to the point.

35
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,760
If it takes a long time, I'm really worried that

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,190
Mujin can't cope.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,070
At the lantern show last night,

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
I checked carefully

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,040
and found that Chengyu's condition

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,160
had not improved.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,160
He was still half dead.

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,390
It seems that

43
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,320
a wedding can't help.

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,430
It can't save his life.

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,550
But now the only mistake is that

46
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,590
in case Jun Zhenzhen is pregnant with the children of the Fang family

47
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,070
after the wedding…

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,550
What do you mean by that?

49
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,750
If Jun Zhenzhen dies,

50
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,390
where can the Fang family find

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,160
a woman to marry him voluntarily

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,200
in such a short time?

53
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,680
Are you going to kill Jun Zhenzhen?

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,830
No one wants to kill her.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,270
She is just unlucky enough

56
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,870
to have an accident.

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,470
I'm afraid

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,320
it's inappropriate to do so.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,120
You see, the Fang family

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,360
has come to this point now.

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,870
Jun Zhenzhen is a little girl

62
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,230
and can't make waves.

63
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,590
Cousin, do you think

64
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,150
it should be discussed in the long run?

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,510
Are you afraid?

66
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,360
Now we have no way back.

67
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,640
Even if you don't think about yourself,

68
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,000
shouldn't you think about

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,680
Jinxiu?

70
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,510
Moreover, the success or failure of the plan over the past ten years

71
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,120
depends on this action.

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,360
I know you are sensible.

73
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,150
As long as you work hard,

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Jinxiu will be safe and sound.

75
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,910
Just now Madame Su went out

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,190
to see a man.

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,230
That man was very cautious.

78
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,510
His cloak covered his face.

79
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,590
He took a carriage

80
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,470
and made a long detour

81
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,150
to get rid of the people we sent.

82
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,510
I thought she was gentle.

83
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,190
Unexpectedly,

84
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,240
she was a poisonous snake beside the master.

85
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,109
The Fang family is supposed to be

86
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,830
picky about concubines.

87
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,310
How did she marry into the Fang family?

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
It's because of Shopkeeper Song.

89
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,550
She is the distant cousin of Shopkeeper Song.

90
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,080
When something happened to her family,

91
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,960
she came to Zezhou to seek relief from her cousin.

92
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,360
At that time, the master

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,390
encountered bandits

94
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,270
during the escort,

95
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,030
when Shopkeeper Song risked his life to save him.

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,880
Because the master was grateful for Shopkeeper Song's kindness,

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,360
he took her as a concubine.

98
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Shopkeeper Song.

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Our family feels indebted to Shopkeeper Song.

100
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,670
Even if Madame Su did something stupid,

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,190
it should have nothing to do with him.

102
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,470
Do you think

103
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,910
she went to see Shopkeeper Song tonight?

104
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,910
I'm not sure.

105
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,670
However,

106
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,670
only someone who has been with the Fang family for decades

107
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,360
like Shopkeeper Song

108
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,030
will not make you suspicious.

109
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,750
Now,

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,000
Madame Su has repeatedly sent soup

111
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,880
to check Chengyu's condition.

112
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,160
They must be impatient.

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,640
But the more impatient they are,

114
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,310
the more they will give themselves away.

115
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,240
Miss Jun even promised to give you

116
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,030
the guest list of the Fang family's freight.

117
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
That's not right.

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,390
Miss Jun has always been very cold.

119
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
How could she help you so much?

120
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,640
How did you do it, Zan?

121
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,310
Could it be…

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,880
No, no.

123
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,110
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

124
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,030
5,000 taels.

125
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,640
You made a deal with her with the 5,000 taels

126
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
you earned from her.

127
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,390
Great.

128
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,520
That's great.

129
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,830
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

130
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,830
I'm flattered. I'm flattered.

131
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,750
Awesome. Awesome.

132
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,030
How is everything going in the Sky Pavilion?

133
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Any news from the capital city?

134
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,000
Go ahead.

135
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,360
Lu Yunqi

136
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
is getting married again,

137
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,750
and his fiancée is still a princess.

138
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,520
Which princess?

139
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,590
Zan,

140
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,560
don't get mad when I say it.

141
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,190
Go on.

142
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,030
Princess Jiuli.

143
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,080
And their wedding day

144
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,910
is the birthday of Princess Jiuli.

145
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,400
Zan,

146
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,710
we agreed not to get mad.

147
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,430
Send more people near Prince Huai's residence.

148
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,560
Be sure to ensure

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
the safety of Prince Huai and his sister.

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,430
Don't need to ask me for instructions

151
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,120
and don't need to care about the means.

152
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,800
OK.

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,590
Then I'll arrange it now.

154
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,190
Go.

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,990
OK.

156
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,990
I came to see you again.

157
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,590
I brought you

158
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,710
your favorite

159
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,800
eight-treasure cake this time.

160
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
This is what I just learned.

161
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,990
I may not

162
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,640
have done a very good job.

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,430
But it doesn't matter.

164
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,080
I'll

165
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,710
do better next time.

166
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,520
When I first saw you,

167
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,560
in fact,

168
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
you certainly didn't know

169
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
it was me,

170
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,470
and you'll never know.

171
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,960
That's my ball.

172
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,710
It's not yours.

173
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,240
No.

174
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,470
Hit him.

175
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,710
Kick him.

176
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,800
Stop it.

177
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,640
Come on.

178
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,190
Are you OK?

179
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,030
Yes, I'm OK.

180
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,359
You know what?

181
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,080
I've been thinking about you every day

182
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,560
since that day.

183
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,870
Finally, our wedding came.

184
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,870
I didn't expect that I had time

185
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,680
to say thank you for saving me.

186
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,190
Jiuling,

187
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,120
don't hate me.

188
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,750
I'm getting married again soon.

189
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,990
The bride

190
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,430
is Jiuli.

191
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,120
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,470
The most regretful thing in my life is that

193
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,520
I didn't save you.

194
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,430
So the only thing I can do now

195
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,030
is to take care of them two.

196
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,800
His Majesty has doubts about them.

197
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,750
Only by marrying Princess Jiuli

198
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,960
can I dispel his concerns

199
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,400
and protect them.

200
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
If you knew it,

201
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,800
you would forgive me,

202
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,750
wouldn't you?

203
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,430
Come and have a look.

204
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,710
Have a look.

205
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,310
Look at the flowers.

206
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,190
Your Ladyship,

207
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,680
everything you need to get married

208
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,870
is almost ready.

209
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,400
The wedding dress will be delivered later.

210
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,430
In fact, I really can't figure out

211
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,640
what you think.

212
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,910
Why do you want to marry Young Master Fang?

213
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,800
Make way.

214
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,790
Be careful. Be careful.

215
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Make way.

216
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,600
Make way.

217
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,670
Make way.

218
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,520
Hold on to it.

219
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,720
Your Ladyship.

220
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,280
Your Ladyship.

221
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,400
Make way.

222
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,110
Make way.

223
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,280
Make way.

224
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,550
Your Ladyship.

225
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,520
Your Ladyship.

226
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,110
Don't come out.

227
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,430
Your Ladyship.

228
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,790
Your Ladyship, be careful.

229
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,640
Make way.

230
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:10,990
Make way.

231
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,920
All the escort agencies

232
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,080
and merchants in Zezhou have been verified.

233
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,230
None has suspicion.

234
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,920
Now

235
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,790
only Deshengchang of the Fang family is left.

236
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,310
The Fang family?

237
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,480
Jun Zhenzhen.

238
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,870
Liu'er, don't come out.

239
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,600
Make way.

240
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,550
Make way.

241
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,670
Excuse me.

242
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,750
Zan, hurry up.

243
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,840
Make way.

244
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,870
Make way.

245
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,520
Look out.

246
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,230
♫Outline in my dream♫

247
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,670

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,870

♫In long silence♫

250
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,160
♫We are far separated by a sea of faces♫

251
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,800
♫What else can I do except for a sigh?♫

252
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,400
♫The rest of my life is bumpy♫

253
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,120

♫Rare to meet you again, tears well up in my eyes♫

260
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,190
Your Ladyship.

261
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,040
Your Ladyship.

262
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,920
Your Ladyship.

263
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,350
That was dangerous.

264
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,430
Fortunately, that childe saved you.

265
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,640
Your Ladyship,

266
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,110
you know

267
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,310
that man.

268
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,960
Why did you two pretend

269
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,840
you didn't know each other?

270
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,040
We should hide

271
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,520
something from others.

272
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Are you worried that

273
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,870
people will notice it

274
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,310
and you will be misunderstood to be involved with other men

275
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,550
since you have been engaged?

276
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,960
All in all,

277
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
he is not a bad man.

278
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,920
Don't think too much.

279
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,280
Your Ladyship.

280
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,280
Do you like him?

281
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,190
Why do you ask so?

282
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,550
Then I don't understand.

283
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,430
You don't like him.

284
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,670
He is mystery

285
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,670
and not pleasant at all.

286
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,990
But you still protect him

287
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,230
and say he is not a bad man.

288
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,640
If you don't like him,

289
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
why are you protecting him?

290
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,870
Protecting him

291
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,040
doesn't mean I like him.

292
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,640
Maybe it's because I admire him.

293
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,990
What's the difference?

294
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,040
For instance,

295
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,079
because of the cancelling of marriage,

296
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,279
I dislike

297
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,080
all people of the Ning family,

298
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,430
including Childe Ning.

299
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,990
However,

300
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,960
occasionally,

301
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,550
we played a game of blind chess

302
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,790
without knowing each other's identity.

303
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,110
Then I change my view on

304
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,990
his character and chess character.

305
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,230
This is called admiration.

306
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,520
But I don't like him.

307
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,870
So you are

308
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,840
admiring Childe Ning,

309
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,280
but you don't like him?

310
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,280
Yeah.

311
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,640
So you admire that person

312
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,480
but you don't like that man?

313
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,550
Almost.

314
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,310
Let's go.

315
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,040
May I come in?

316
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,790
Why not?

317
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,480
Please.

318
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,600
Thank you for your help today.

319
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,040
Forget it.

320
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,040
But did you offend anyone?

321
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,790
On the hip of the horse which had been alerted,

322
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,040
there is a silver needle.

323
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,400
I guessed it.

324
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,750
Looks like someone

325
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,840
doesn't like the marriage of the youngest son of the Fang family.

326
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,230
So they also

327
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,790
poisoned the young master

328
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,600
of the Fang family?

329
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:56,990
Maybe.

330
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,040
By the way,

331
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,670
I brought you this.

332
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
You give me medicine provided by others?

333
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,440
Sort of.

334
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,640
How are you?

335
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,750
Does your wound still hurt?

336
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,200
It's all right.

337
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,520
Let me see.

338
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,350
What are you doing?

339
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,280
I can do it myself.

340
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,990
I'm a doctor.

341
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,800
What are you thinking about?

342
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,990
After you leave,

343
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,920
I can do it myself.

344
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,950
Okay.

345
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,590
Then I'm leaving.

346
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,560
Miss Jun.

347
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,440
please pay more attention to

348
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,520
Deshengchang.

349
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,950
I won't stay in Zezhou for long.

350
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,520
You have something important to do?

351
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,400
Lu Yunqi wants to

352
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,110
marry Princess Jiuli.

353
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,950
The emperor has promised him.

354
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,750
When?

355
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,280
On the birthday of Jiuling.

356
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,800
So I have to hurry

357
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,920
to the capital before his wedding.

358
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,110
Lu Yunqi, you are mad.

359
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,800
Okay.

360
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,750
I see.

361
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,040
Then I'll leave first.

362
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,280
Grandma, aunt.

363
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,350
I'd like to discuss

364
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,640
something with you two.

365
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,230
Go ahead.

366
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,710
I was thinking whether

367
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,990
my marriage with Chengyu

368
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,350
can be completed after March 3.

369
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,040
Is it in such a hurry?

370
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,350
I'm afraid it's too late to prepare.

371
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,640
After marriage,

372
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,710
I can do

373
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,590
give Chengyu medicine baths as soon as possible.

374
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,160
Then I can repair his meridians

375
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,040
with gold needles.

376
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,680
After a period of time,

377
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,750
Chengyu should be able to stand up soon.

378
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,870
Sir, please come in.

379
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,870
Welcome.

380
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,710
Welcome.

381
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,640
This is Jinyun Restaurant?

382
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,950
I've heard that they have many rules.

383
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,070
On March 3,

384
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,470
no one is allowed to go in.

385
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,640
It's said that

386
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,830
this is the condition

387
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,950
for descendants of the Chen family to give up this place.

388
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,470
The descendants of the Chen family are really interesting.

389
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,710
Go.

390
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,350
Let's go in and have a look.

391
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,200
There are fine seats.

392
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,230
Come in, please.

393
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:27,990
This way, please.

394
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,070
Upstairs, please.

395
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,870
This way, please.

396
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,560
Upstairs, please.

397
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,950
Come in, please.

398
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,110
Sir, please come in.

399
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,070
Sir.

400
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,750
Please come in, Your Ladyship.

401
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,350
It's lively here.

402
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:58,950
Come in, please.

403
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,160
Miss Jun.

404
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,870
Childe Ning has arranged it.

405
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,990
In Sky Room No. 3.

406
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,950
Please follow me.

407
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,230
Come in, please.

408
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,680
Come in, please.

409
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,470
This way.

410
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,520
I knew she would come.

411
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,400
Look at her dress.

412
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,640
She must have come to seduce Childe Ning.

413
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,920
Take it easy.

414
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,520
Don't worry.

415
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,230
As long as we succeed,

416
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,830
when my brother finishes the spring exam

417
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,440
and chooses a girl for engagement,

418
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,110
I would speak good

419
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,750
of you.

420
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,560
With you, my best friend

421
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,280
to be my sister-in-law,

422
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
I'll be much more relieved.

423
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,950
I'm just trying to help you,

424
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,640
I didn't think so much.

425
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,950
I've arranged

426
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,640
my subordinates.

427
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,800
Look.

428
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,830
Miss Jun,

429
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,440
please have a seat.

430
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,230
This is a good new tea.

431
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,590
Please have a taste.

432
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,950
Is Childe Ning here?

433
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,640
He will arrive later.

434
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,710
Please forgive him.

435
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:13,950
Okay.

436
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,710
I have nothing else.

437
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,400
You can leave now.

438
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,200
Yes.

439
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,560
See you, Your Ladyship.

440
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:25,990
Ning Yunyan?

441
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,710
There is overpowering drug in the tea.

442
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,230
Liu'er.

443
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,520
Go.

444
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,160
Yes.

445
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,560
Are you clear?

446
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,160
Don't worry.

447
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,320
It's on me.

448
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,470
I promise

449
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,320
to complete it well.

450
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,470
Just wait to see her

451
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,320
be discredited.

452
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,680
Good.

453
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,950
Do it well.

454
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,470
After you succeed,

455
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,280
I'll give you a great reward.

456
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,320
I'm good at it.

457
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:19,950
Good.

458
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,680
Come with me.

459
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,710
OK.

460
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,320
Do I have to dress like this?

461
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,110
Zan,

462
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,750
it's March 3.

463
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,350
We are trying

464
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,440
for a prize.

465
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,520
And Jinyun Restaurant has the largest prize today.

466
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,110
Let's go, let's go.

467
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,990
Just take a look.

468
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,440
It's boring. I won't go.

469
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,070
Zan, please.

470
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,870
Just take a look.

471
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,640
You're almost there.

472
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:42,950
Go.

473
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,470
We'll be right there.

474
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:43,950
That's it.

475
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,920
Fan.

476
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,800
Just take a look.

477
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,440
Just take a look.

478
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,110
It's really her.

479
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,440
Your Ladyship.

480
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,070
Why don't we just go?

481
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,040
What if that scoundrel

482
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,950
comes in?

483
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,750
Even if we avoid it this time,

484
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,230
we would meet with other tricks later.

485
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,350
Why don't we take this opportunity to deal with her?

486
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,400
What are we going to do?

487
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,830
Long time no see.

488
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah, yeah.

489
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,800
Long time no see.

490
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,160
How is it?

491
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,200
Look around.

492
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,870
How lively it is!

493
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,640
Let's go, let's go.

494
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,750
Look. How nice it is here!

495
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,470
Haven't you seen a pitch-pot game before?

496
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,320
You've been too tired lately.

497
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Don't you know we have serious business to do?

498
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,990
Let's relax

499
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,870
before we get back to business.

500
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,160
You can't do business every day.

501
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,040
Come on, let's go this way.

502
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,230
I'll be with you this time.

503
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,870
The last time.

504
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:41,830
Okay.

505
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,920
Be with me for the last time.

506
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,440
Okay?

507
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,040
Childe Ning.

508
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,110
Nice to see you.

509
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,710
This way, please.

510
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,280
Why does Childe Ning come?

511
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,320
What are you panicking about?

512
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,400
Since my brother is here,

513
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,350
we can let him see

514
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,920
how shameless Jun Zhenzhen is.

515
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,950
It's pretty lively.

516
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,680
Yunzhao.

517
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,110
Yunzhao.

518
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,920
What are you thinking about?

519
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,590
Nothing.

520
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,710
I know.

521
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,990
You are looking for

522
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,070
that girl who gave you a lantern that day.

523
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,830
Yeah.

524
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,680
I knew it.

525
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,230
I figured it out

526
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,160
because you keep an unusual attitude

527
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,680
toward that lantern.

528
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,590
Don't make fun of me.

529
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,470
I just think that girl is smart.

530
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,750
I want to know her.

531
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,800
We understand.

532
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,230
But Yunzhao,

533
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,200
be patient.

534
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,590
Fate is something

535
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,920
we can't ask for.

536
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,710
Maybe one day,

537
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,520
she will naturally appear in front of you.

538
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,320
Is that so?

539
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,070
Yes.

540
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,830
I think so.

541
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,920
Everybody.

542
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,870
Everybody.

543
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,710
Everybody, be quiet.

544
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,950
Be quiet.

545
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,350
Today, many

546
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,110
beauties and talented men gather here.

547
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,400
On such a grand event,

548
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,160
how can we lack

549
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,950
some elegant activities?

550
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,400
It's said that in recent years,

551
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,870
the pitch-pot game is popular in the capital.

552
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,830
So our restaurant

553
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,040
makes bold

554
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,230
to introduce this game

555
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,560
to today's event.

556
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,870
And the pitch-pot game…

557
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,320
The pitch-pot game

558
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:15,920
has simple rules.

559
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm good at this.

560
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:16,950
However,

561
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,950
in addition to betting on winning or losing,

562
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,070
our restaurant

563
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,640
has also come up with an idea.

564
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,230
That is,

565
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,160
to determine the winner

566
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,320
in accordance with

567
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,750
the number of bamboo arrows

568
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,950
thrown into the pot.

569
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,320
If any

570
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,320
childe

571
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,680
or lady

572
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,440
breaks the the record 

573
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,520
determined by our restaurant,

574
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,830
he or she will be 

575
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,990
our VIP later

576
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,160
to get our best services.

577
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,070
In addition,

578
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,590
all his or her expenses in our restaurant

579
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,640
will be all free.

580
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,440
Great!

581
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,280
That's nice.

582
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,830
Interesting.

583
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,800
Free food and drink.

584
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Zan.

585
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,870
Is there anyone

586
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,070
willing to sign up

587
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
to take this challenge?

588
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,230
Yunzhao,

589
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,350
I've heard a long time ago that

590
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,640
you are a master in this game.

591
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Hurry up and show us.

592
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,750
Yeah.

593
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,400
Try it.

594
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,400
No.

595
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,830
Wenming.

596
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,830
Is there anyone willing to take the challenge?

597
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,280
I won't go.

598
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,400
Your Ladyship, Your Ladyship.

599
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,160
Ning Yunyan's name has been signed up.

600
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,230
Do you think

601
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,070
she will attend it?

602
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,640
Based on my understand of her,

603
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,160
she will surely attend it.

604
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,160
Then we can take this opportunity

605
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,800
to make a fortune.

606
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,230
We can't miss this golden chance.

607
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,040
Your Ladyship,

608
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
how much do you think we can make?

609
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,830
50 taels?

610
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,710
5,000 taels.

611
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,830
5,000 taels?

612
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,520
But,

613
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,520
but Your Ladyship,

614
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,590
can you throw arrows into the pot?

615
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,920
I didn't expect my childhood pastime game

616
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
can be useful today.

617
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,560
Are you willing to take the challenge?

618
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,230
We can discuss it.

619
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,520
Ning Yunyan in Sky Room No.6

620
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,640
and Jun Zhenzhen in Sky Room No. 3.

621
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,590
Next, let's invite

622
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,680
the first challenger.

623
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,800
Sky

624
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,470
Room No.6,

625
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,200
Miss Ning Yunyan.

626
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,110
Yunyan?

627
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,110
Is she interested in

628
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,920
such an elegant activity?

629
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,640
And

630
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,590
Sky Room No. 3,

631
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,870
Miss Jun Zhenzhen. –Zan.

632
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,470
Zan, look!

633
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,160
Jun Zhenzhen?

634
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,320
Is that girl

635
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,990
who cancelled the engagement with Yunzhao?

636
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,680
Good!

637
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,640
It's her!

638
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,200
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,350
You signed me up?

640
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,520
Who signed me up?

641
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Is she qualified

642
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
for competing with me?

643
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,400
Who made this trick?

644
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,470
Don't go then.

645
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,230
No way.

646
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,950
My name has been reported.

647
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,640
If I don't show up,

648
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,870
it would defame my family.

649
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,520
Besides,

650
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,990
I'm good at it.

651
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,640
I'm not afraid of her.

652
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,710
Go.

653
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,710
It's her.

654
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,440
Yunyan.

655
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,590
Yunzhao.

656
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,070
Interesting.

657
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,800
Yunzhao.

658
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,590
Childe Ning.

659
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,230
Yunzhao.

660
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,830
Since you are interested in this game,

661
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,070
why didn't you tell me in advance?

662
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,640
It's just a whim.

663
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,200
I just heard

664
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,920
your name just now.

665
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,870
I don't know who's so shameless

666
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,640
to sign up for me.

667
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,640
Yunzhao.

668
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,110
Now that you're here,

669
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,320
play the game for me.

670
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,110
Show those who overestimate their strength

671
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,870
your excellent pitch-pot skills.

672
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,280
Forget it, Yunyan.

673
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,640
Yunzhao. Be good.

674
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Yunzhao.

675
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,470
Go, Childe Ning.

676
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:23,920
Stop it.

677
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,590
Yunzhao, come on.

678
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,640
Yunyan begs you.

679
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,400
Stop it.

680
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,070
Go.

681
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,680
Go.

682
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,280
Go ahead.

683
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,750
Don't make people wait.

684
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,320
Yunzhao.

685
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,470
No, Yunyan.

686
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,990
Ladies and gentlemen.

687
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,350
Next, let's welcome Childe Ning

688
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,920
to replace Miss Ning Yunyan

689
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,320
to take the challenge.

690
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,640
Go, go, go.

691
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,990
Come on, brother.

692
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,350
Good!

693
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,230
Come on.

694
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,680
Good!

695
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,870
Go, go, go.

696
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,830
Childe Ning.

697
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,520
Good!

698
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,320
Good!

699
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,950
Good!

700
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,560
Good!

701
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,440
Childe Ning.

702
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,280
I'd like to see

703
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,070
how she wins this game.

704
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,920
Do you think Jun Zhenzhen is a master?

705
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,830
She knows nothing about it.

706
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,200
My brother

707
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,470
must defeat her.

708
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,070
Let's go upstairs to enjoy the show.

709
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,560
Go.

710
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,640
Sorry.

711
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,470
Miss Jun.

712
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,160
It seems that

713
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,950
you have an elegant interest today.

714
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,520
So you are

715
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,590
Miss Jun.

716
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,640
Nice to meet you.

717
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,070
Nice to meet you, Childe Ning.

718
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,520
I thought

719
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,280
I would meet many people for once only in my life.

720
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,710
And now I see you.

721
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,320
I think

722
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,440
meeting you again

723
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,280
is more joyful

724
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,440
than seeing you once only.

725
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,350
Yeah.

726
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,470
What a coincidence.

727
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,800
You also know how to play a pitch-pot game.

728
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,590
I wonder

729
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,950
if you're as good at it

730
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,830
as playing go.

731
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,070
You have flattered me.

732
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,560
Instead,

733
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,470
it's my honor

734
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,440
to catch a glimpse of

735
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,070
your skill in this game.

736
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Sorry to trouble you,

737
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,110
Miss Jun.

738
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,590
As long as you don't mind

739
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,750
the rumor off the stage.

740
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,400
They may say whatever they want.

741
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,520
It has nothing to do with us.

742
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,560
Miss Jun Zhenzhen will play

743
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,830
against Childe Ning Yunzhao

744
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,230
in the pitch-pot game.

745
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,920
All bets will go to the winner.

746
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,950
The loser

747
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,440
will return double

748
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,800
the wager's money.

749
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,560
OK.

750
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,440
OK.

751
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,070
Yunyan,

752
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,160
your brother is going to play.

753
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,110
Shall we bet?

754
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,560
Certainly.

755
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,950
Clearly,

756
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,590
he will win.

757
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,950
Excuse me.

758
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,800
Please.

759
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,590
Miss Jun,

760
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,800
what would you pitch?

761
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,070
I bet on the first arrow.

762
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,750
OK.

763
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,400
Bet on the first arrow.

764
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,830
There are 3 rounds in total.

765
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,950
In the first two rounds,

766
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,640
each player gets 6 bamboo arrows.

767
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,950
There are 12 pots in total.

768
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,320
In the last round,

769
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,560
each player gets 12 arrows.

770
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,110
The winner is the player with more arrows into the pot.

771
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,830
Best of three.

772
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,230
I bet 100 taels on my brother.

773
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,950
I bet 100 taels on Childe Ning.

774
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,590
I bet 500 taels on Childe Ning.

775
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,750
I bet 100 taels on Childe Ning.

776
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,070
I bet 500 taels

777
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,160
on Childe Ning.

778
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,200
Great.

779
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,990
Great.

780
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,800
Great.

781
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:14,679
Miss Jun,

782
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,199
please.

783
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,159
Please.

784
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,590
You know what, my brother is good at it.

785
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,470
It's great.

786
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,590
Great.

787
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,070
Yunzhao is still so great.

788
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,680
Look.

789
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,230
Isn't it?

790
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:12,830
He is so great.

791
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,950
Let's wait and see Jun Zhenzhen making a fool of herself.

792
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,520
Miss Jun,

793
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,680
please.

794
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,590
It almost fell in.

795
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,350
I knew she couldn't make it.

796
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,270
Childe Ning got all 6 arrows in the pots.

797
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,400
Miss Jun got 5 of the 6 arrows in the pots.

798
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,590
Childe Ning won

799
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,030
in the first round.

800
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,310
Well done.

801
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,760
Well done.

802
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,870
So great.

803
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,790
Miss Jun,

804
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,310
when you were about to pitch just now,

805
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,550
your wrist inclined by half inch.

806
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,270
Keep steady this time.

807
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,760
Thanks for reminding.

808
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,240
Please.

809
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,440
You first.

810
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,480
Well done.

811
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Well done.

812
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,590
Well done.

813
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,270
Amazing.

814
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,960
Not bad.

815
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,110
She is great.

816
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,550
Yunzhao didn't play honestly.

817
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,440
Yes.

818
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,200
Yes.

819
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,350
Alright. Alright.

820
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,000
My brother won't lose.

821
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,110
Miss Jun got all 6 arrows in the pots.

822
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,350
Childe Ning got 5 of the 6 arrows in the pots.

823
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,510
Miss Jun won

824
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,590
in the second round.

825
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,830
Well done.

826
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,640
Well done.

827
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,550
Well done.

828
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,310
Well done.

829
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,400
Miss Jun,

830
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,960
we tied.

831
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,440
You gave me the chance.

832
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,400
I admit defeat.

833
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,960
You also gave me a chance.

834
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,000
Miss Jun,

835
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
how about playing at full stretch in the last round?

836
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,240
That sounds great.

837
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
I will.

838
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,200
Ladies and gentleman,

839
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,160
it's the last round now.

840
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,720
Do you want to

841
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,440
increase bet?

842
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,590
I'll increase the bet on Childe Ning by 300 taels.

843
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,350
I'll increase the bet on Childe Ning by 500 taels.

844
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,550
I'll increase the bet by 500 taels.

845
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,550
We'll increase the bet on Childe Ning by 1,000 taels.

846
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,960
1,000 taels.

847
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,550
Bet on Miss Jun.

848
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,070
Increase the bet.

849
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,110
I bet Miss Jun will win.

850
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,720
1,000 taels.

851
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,270
1,000 taels.

852
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,000
1,000 taels.

853
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,960
1,000 taels.

854
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,070
That's interesting. So busy.

855
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,640
I'll increase the bet by 2,000 taels.

856
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,830
I bet my brother will win.

857
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,590
Guests in Heaven Room No. 6

858
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,160
increase by 2,000 taels.

859
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,000
They bet

860
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,240
Childe Ning will win.

861
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,110
Go on. Go on.

862
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,550
So Miss Ning is going to battle with me.

863
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,200
Miss Jun is outstanding.

864
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,350
I'll increase by 1,000 taels.

865
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,070
Another 1,000 taels.

866
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,310
4,000 taels.

867
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,400
4,500 taels.

868
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,270
5,000 taels.

869
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,200
5,000 taels.

870
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,440
It's so interesting today.

871
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,830
Why are 5,000 taels again?

872
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,790
Why is the Ning Family

873
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,830
always related

874
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,680
to 5,000 taels?

875
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,640
It's still them two.

876
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,550
And

877
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,960
still 5,000 taels.

878
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,870
It's hard to tell who will win.

879
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,790
If I get the double amount of silver,

880
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,200
don't be jealous.

881
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
Please bet for me, host.

882
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,160
I bet 5,000 taels

883
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,830
on myself.

884
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,270
5,000 taels?

885
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,240
Miss Jun...

886
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,030
5,000 taels?

887
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,310
She spends the money on making a fool of herself.

888
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,270
Go ahead.

889
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,350
Go bet.

890
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,790
Miss Jun

891
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,110
bets 5,000 taels.

892
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,440
She bets that she will win.

893
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,400
Well done.

894
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,310
So awesome.

895
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,550
Players,

896
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,720
you may begin.

897
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,760
Great.

898
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,350
Yunzhao,

899
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,000
well done.

900
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,160
Well. Well.

901
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:50,870
Great.

902
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,760
I,

903
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,870
I told you that.

904
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,000
He's so great, right?

905
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,310
He got all arrows in the pots.

906
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,790
Childe Ning got 12 arrows in the pots.

907
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,350
Next, let's invite

908
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,270
Miss Jun.

909
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,270
You're really excellent.

910
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,760
Miss Jun,

911
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,070
please.

912
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,960
Jun Zhenzhen,

913
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,070
with a false marriage contract,

914
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,720
you cheated 5,000 taels of silver of my family.

915
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,270
Now in the public,

916
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,440
how are you going to cheat?

917
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,310
Yunyan.

00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:24,250
♫Rare to meet you again, tears well up in my eyes♫

953
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,330
♫You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind♫

954
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:27,970
♫It's me♫

955
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,490
♫You shuttle through the bottom of my heart♫

956
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,650
♫Has nature ever asked for any clues about the wind?♫

957
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,210
♫Any clues?♫

958
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,290
♫If my longing for you can be written down♫

959
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,330
♫Every word would be as strong as pouring rain falling down♫

960
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,050
♫You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again♫

961
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:49,330
♫Tears well up in my eyes♫
