00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

Episode 9

17
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,470
Runan

18
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,230
Jiuling Drugstore

19
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,710
Jiuling Drugstore

20
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,530
Deshengchang

21
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:46,370
Jiuling Drugstore

22
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,170
Jiuling Drugstore

23
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,890
Jiuling Drugstore

24
00:36:20,120 --> 00:02:55,110
Fang Mansion

25
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,110
What are you playing?

26
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,670
Why don't you play with me?

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Do you see I am playing?

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,390
I see you are quite happy.

29
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,830
Are you playing on a swing?

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,600
Pull me up.

31
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,600
Okay,

32
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,720
but you first need to answer me a question.

33
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,390
Which one is more handsome, me or Chengyu?

34
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,750
You.

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,720
Really?

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,080
Can you pull me up now?

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,550
Okay.

38
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,670
Be gentle. Be gentle.

39
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
Come up.

40
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,110
Thank you.

41
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,270
I don't want to carry you.

42
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,440
I mean for saving my life today.

43
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,550
If so, you should thank me.

44
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,200
Rubbish!

45
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,200
Why can't you find him after such a long search?

46
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,720
Mr. Song,

47
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,510
by Deshengchang's strength,

48
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,070
if they intend to hide him,

49
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,270
it is indeed hard for us to find him.

50
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,600
We've searched all yards

51
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,790
of the Fang family in Zezhou,

52
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,600
but could not find any trace of young master.

53
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,390
Have they

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,920
left Zezhou

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,950
for a village in the countryside

56
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,950
or a farther place?

57
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,270
A farther place?

58
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,390
Impossible.

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,350
Doctor Sun wouldn't lie to me.

60
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,600
Chengyu is indeed dying.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,790
For his conditions,

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,720
he can't travel far.

63
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,160
It's possible that he lives nearby

64
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,880
in one of the old houses in the suburbs.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,110
Send people to search for him.

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,040
Do it fast.

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,270
Got it.

68
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,070
Are you tired?

69
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,350
Put me down to have a rest.

70
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm not tired.

71
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,230
How is your foot?

72
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,440
It gets better.

73
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
How did you find me?

74
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,670
I was paid,

75
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,510
so I came to look for you.

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,320
Don't think

77
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,480
too much.

78
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
I beg you.

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,920
Okay.

80
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,760
Be careful.

81
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,600
Don't talk. Okay.

82
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,510
Only once, you promise. Only once. Only once.

83
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,920
No one else

84
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,230
would spoil you like me.

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,350
Come on. Come on.

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
A little higher.

87
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,230
You don't even need to walk

88
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,200
on my back.

89
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,230
Why do you sigh?

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,480
I thought of some past things.

91
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,110
Speaking of past things,

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,390
has Jiuling ever mentioned me to you?

93
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,040
Of course.

94
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,550
What did she say?

95
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,440
She said

96
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,920
you always spoiled her

97
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,070
and you are her best brother.

98
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
I didn't spoil her.

99
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,200
She was just being herself.

100
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,880
Every time I watched her,

101
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,790
I felt content.

102
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,350
Do you have to

103
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,880
risk your life for a flower only?

104
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,760
A flower only?

105
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
It's not a simple flower,

106
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,720
but a very precious herb.

107
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,640
It's difficult to find it.

108
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,080
It's purple immortal herb.

109
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,840
What are you doing?

110
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,910
This is purple immortal herb?

111
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,640
Give it back to me.

112
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,550
It's very important to me.

113
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,520
What do you want it for?

114
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,640
It's also very important to me.

115
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,470
Can you give it to me?

116
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,200
Okay.

117
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,840
It's yours.

118
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,230
Go.

119
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,790
Don't I need to carry you?

120
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,000
No.

121
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,760
Move ahead. No need. No need.

122
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,080
My lady,

123
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,880
you are back.

124
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,640
What's wrong with your leg?

125
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,470
Did you get hurt?

126
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,760
I'm fine.

127
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,080
It's not serious.

128
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,030
I just sprained my angle up the mountain.

129
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,000
Mr. Ling,

130
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,470
you didn't protect our lady well.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It has nothing to do with me.

132
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,550
She went to pick herb and got hurt in the mountain.

133
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,230
Zhenzhen,

134
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,400
are you alright?

135
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,440
I'm fine.

136
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,550
It's a little less painful

137
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,350
than the medicated bath.

138
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,520
So painful?

139
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,350
You finally admit it's painful to

140
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,520
take the medicated bath.

141
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,840
Zan.

142
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,960
Zan.

143
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,670
Why is he here?

144
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,880
He comes here

145
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,590
as he has finished his task.

146
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,080
He will be

147
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,910
a good helper.

148
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,280
And,

149
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,670
we won't charge extra money.

150
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,400
Miss Jun,

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,640
we meet again.

152
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,590
Mr. Lei,

153
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,080
let's hurry on with the journey.

154
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,910
Okay.

155
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,760
Get on the horse.

156
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,320
Set out.

157
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,910
Got it.

158
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,350
Well.

159
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,670
Go.

160
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,440
I'll help you get up.

161
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,840
This work is good.

162
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,760
What happened?

163
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440
Mom,

164
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,200
who made you angry again?

165
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,080
Jun Zhenzhen

166
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
is really thoughtless.

167
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,230
Grandma is also unreasonable.

168
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,710
If Doctor Sun can't cure Chengyu,

169
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,760
she may

170
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,640
find another doctor.

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,110
How could she allow Jun Zhenzhen to

172
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,230
take Chengyu away?

173
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,400
That's ridiculous.

174
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,670
Your grandma doesn't have other good ways,

175
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,110
so she adopted the master's advice.

176
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,550
Is Chengyu

177
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,590
living in the old house

178
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,440
in the east of the city?

179
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,110
That's where wind blows.

180
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,520
It is very cold in this season.

181
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,200
The old house in the east of the city?

182
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm not sure.

183
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,320
I just saw Shaoyao

184
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,400
picking up Chengyu's clothes secretly

185
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
and heading towards the east

186
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,960
at dusk by chance.

187
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
No matter it's true or false,

188
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,520
you have never seen that.

189
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,760
The master said

190
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,320
it's best that Chengyu's whereabouts

191
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,400
is a secret

192
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,590
to all members of the Fang family.

193
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,520
I know, mom.

194
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,590
So

195
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm here only to complain.

196
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,470
I didn't even mention it to Yuxiu.

197
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,320
I know you are sensible.

198
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,230
It's late.

199
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,760
Mom,

200
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,470
stop embroidering,

201
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,520
or it will harm your eyes.

202
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,280
Okay.

203
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,150
I'll listen to you.

204
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,590
Good girl.

205
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,280
Go.

206
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,350
Go out

207
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,880
and tell Mr. Song this message.

208
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,200
Got it.

209
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,550
Zhenzhen really

210
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,640
gave us a good idea.

211
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,440
The fox

212
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,030
will be exposed soon.

213
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,150
Miss Jun,

214
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,880
we're already in Runan City.

215
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,000
Your Ladyship,

216
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,000
we're home.

217
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Runan.

218
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,000
Master,

219
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,110
Zhenzhen,

220
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,640
we're home.

221
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
What's wrong, Zhenzhen?

222
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,880
I'm fine.

223
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,200
Did you recall anything?

224
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,030
Nothing.

225
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,520
What happened?

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,590
Why was Jiuling Drugstore

227
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
destroyed?

228
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,230
This plaque is passed down by ancestors.

229
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,400
How could it be broken?

230
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Jiuling Drugstore.

231
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,710
Jiuling.

232
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,960
It seems it is destiny.

233
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,400
There is a clinic passed down by ancestors,

234
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,710
which is named after me.

235
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,840
In this case,

236
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,000
I will reopen Jiuling Drugstore in Runan.

237
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,150
When I go back to the capital,

238
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,520
I can use the identity of doctor

239
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,710
to be safer.

240
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,640
Who

241
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,710
are you?

242
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Do you want this land?

243
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,280
I'm telling you.

244
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,110
The land of the Jun family

245
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,280
has long been sold to me.

246
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,080
It belongs to me now.

247
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,710
Bah.

248
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,520
Nonsense.

249
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,710
My lady doesn't know you,

250
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,670
but I do!

251
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,080
The title deed of the Jun family

252
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,960
is in our lady's hand.

253
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,320
Who sold this land to you?

254
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Who?

255
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,590
The old servant guarding the gate

256
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,400
of the Jun family.

257
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,030
I don't care

258
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,030
who you are,

259
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,840
I have paid for the land,

260
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,000
so

261
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,470
it belongs to me.

262
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,350
Understand?

263
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Your Ladyship,

264
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,710
he is a notorious local ruffian.

265
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,710
Obviously, he wants to occupy the ancestral property of the Jun family.

266
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,760
I don't want the land

267
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,200
but this plaque.

268
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,760
Jiuling Drugstore of the Jun family is destroyed.

269
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,520
Why does she want the plaque?

270
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,350
Why?

271
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,030
Why, indeed?

272
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,230
She doesn't want this big house

273
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,280
but the broken plaque.

274
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,400
This lady is thoughtful

275
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,280
and sensible.

276
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,080
Jiuling Drugstore still exists.

277
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
From today on,

278
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,030
Jiuling Drugstore is reopened.

279
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,470
I am the descendant of the Jun family,

280
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,670
Jun Jiuling.

281
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,960
My name is Jiuling,

282
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,960
and you are named Ling Jiu.

283
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,550
Okay?

284
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,470
From today on,

285
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,640
Jiuling Drugstore will specialize in incurable diseases

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,230
and cure all diseases.

287
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,670
If you find that I can't do it,

288
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,280
you may smash my plaque at any time.

289
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,320
And,

290
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,640
in the first month,

291
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
no consultation fee will be charged.

292
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,670
No consultation fee will be charged?

293
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,590
How could there be such a good thing?

294
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,320
She will not keep her words.

295
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,550
The same tea making gesture,

296
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,320
the same pitch-pot movement.

297
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,790
Now

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,280
she names herself Jiuling.

299
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,320
Are all these coincidences?

300
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,960
Or

301
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,280
you are her?

302
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,550
Is that true?

303
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,640
Yes, Mr. Song.

304
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,960
It's indeed eldest madame.

305
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,110
She changed her makeup

306
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,760
and wore a hood,

307
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,320
leaving through the back door

308
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,790
for the eastern suburbs.

309
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,910
It seems Mujin's words are true.

310
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,800
They really hide Fang Chengyu

311
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,310
in the old house in the east of the city.

312
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,280
Mr. Song,

313
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,519
what are we

314
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
going to do next?

315
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,950
Since young master is dying,

316
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,710
we'd better help him

317
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,190
so that

318
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,070
he won't suffer anymore.

319
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
You call our men

320
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,000
and take action tonight.

321
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:32,920
Got it.

322
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,430
It has been 20 years.

323
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,160
I should put an end

324
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,830
to all this.

325
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,430
Mom.

326
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:54,950
Son.

327
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,230
Son.

328
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,070
Haiping.

329
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,920
Are you feeling bad?

330
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,760
Haiping.

331
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,280
Who is that?

332
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,070
Aunt,

333
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,190
it's me,

334
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,430
Hu Gui.

335
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,710
Mr. Hu.

336
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,000
Haiping,

337
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,350
good news for you.

338
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,640
Your savior appears.

339
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,160
What does

340
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,760
that mean?

341
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,280
Do you know Jiuling Drugstore

342
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,070
in Runan?

343
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:17,880
Yes.

344
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,950
Jiuling Drugstore was reopened recently

345
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,400
and it doesn't charge patients for herbs.

346
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,470
Aunt,

347
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,070
take Haiping to see the doctor.

348
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,350
I told Haiping,

349
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,230
but he refused to go.

350
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,920
These years,

351
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,280
he has seen many famous doctors,

352
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,950
but none of them could cure his disease.

353
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,880
That is why

354
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,640
I come here.

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,520
Son.

356
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,800
When Jiuling Drugstore's reputation is ruined,

357
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,830
and she has to leave Runan,

358
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,350
I can truly

359
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,560
hold the land in my hand firm.

360
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,280
Aunt,

361
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,640
look at Haiping.

362
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,310
Haiping,

363
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,470
you should receive treatment.

364
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,350
Listen to me.

365
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,880
Since Jiuling Drugstore is reopened,

366
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,830
just go to see the doctor there.

367
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,640
Okay?

368
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,800
If she cures your disease,

369
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,760
you may make money early

370
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,230
to pay off the debts

371
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,560
you owed these years.

372
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,280
Yeah.

373
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,830
Son.

374
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,350
Son.

375
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,280
Mom.

376
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,160
How about going to see the doctor?

377
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,680
Go.

378
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,110
Son, go.

379
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,950
Go.

380
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,560
That's right.

381
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,040
Haiping,

382
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,640
aunt,

383
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,070
I'm going to ask two persons to carry you there.

384
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,800
Okay, okay. Okay.

385
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,880
Okay.

386
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Thank you.

387
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,560
Mom.

388
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,310
Be careful.

389
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,040
Time is limited.

390
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,560
I can only rent this simple house

391
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,070
as a clinic.

392
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:42,950
Here.

393
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,640
But luckily,

394
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,920
you can inquire the patients in front room

395
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,190
and live at the back room.

396
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,040
Mr. Lei is always steady.

397
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,950
Thank you.

398
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,430
It's good to have a house to live in.

399
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,190
And,

400
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,430
we won't stay here for long.

401
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,760
We will go back to Zezhou sooner or later.

402
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,590
Your Ladyship,

403
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,230
young master wants to buy you

404
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,470
the largest herbal medicine shop in Runan.

405
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,280
Why don't you accept it?

406
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,950
We just stay here for some days.

407
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,000
That'll be wasteful.

408
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,190
What's more,

409
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,400
I may use the money

410
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,560
to treat more patients

411
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,710
and provide them with more herbs.

412
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,070
Jiuling is right.

413
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,070
We can save the money

414
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,230
to help more people

415
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,230
by donating medicinal materials.

416
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,430
That'll be helpful.

417
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,430
Where is the uncle?

418
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,280
He left without telling anyone.

419
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,520
He comes and goes as he likes.

420
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,280
Perhaps

421
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,000
he has things to do.

422
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,430
Liu'er,

423
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,830
Liu'er,

424
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,470
make up this prescription.

425
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,710
OK.

426
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,310
Doctor Jun. Please sit down.

427
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,400
What's wrong?

428
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,070
I have a stomachache.

429
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,430
Stick out your tongue and I'll check.

430
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,160
It doesn't matter.

431
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,800
You're

432
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,950
attacked by morbid qi of years.

433
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
And there are worms in your stomach.

434
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,160
So you have an excruciating pain in the belly.

435
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,950
It's a symptom of constipation.

436
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,470
It doesn't matter

437
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,590
I'll prescribe for you.

438
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,000
Soup with betel nut and aconite is enough.

439
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,830
Doctor Jun,

440
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
I've got a prescription.

441
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,880
Let me have a look.

442
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,430
What a patient.

443
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,470
He comes to make a prescription

444
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,760
from another doctor in  Jiuling Drugstore.

445
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,590
This is a complete prescription.

446
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,230
Betel nut can promote qi and water,

447
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,710
kill worms and cure  indigestion.

448
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,160
No other herb is needed.

449
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,430
Liu'er,

450
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,350
prepare the herbs.

451
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,070
OK.

452
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,430
Jiuling Drugstore is

453
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,710
as true as they said.

454
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,230
Thanks, Doctor Jun.

455
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,190
Thank you.

456
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,190
You flattered me.

457
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,800
Please.

458
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,710
Doctor Jun.

459
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,880
Doctor Jun.

460
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,190
Doctor Jun,

461
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,110
please check my brother.

462
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,000
What's wrong?

463
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,000
Be careful.

464
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,400
Doctor Jun,

465
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,760
please check him.

466
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,680
It has been years

467
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,590
since he

468
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,430
couldn't walk.

469
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,640
Well, please check

470
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,800
to see if you can cure him.

471
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,710
Can you feel anything now?

472
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,710
Can Doctor Jun

473
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,350
cure strong Haiping?

474
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,640
No one

475
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,800
can cure him.

476
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,230
Can you feel anything now?

477
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,280
Doctor,

478
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,280
I just don't

479
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,800
want to lie on bed

480
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,040
like a loser.

481
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,880
As long as I can walk,

482
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,430
I'd rather live

483
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,640
as a beggar.

484
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,110
I heard that

485
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,400
you treat patients for free.

486
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,110
All

487
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,560
my family members

488
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,470
hope that I can recover,

489
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,280
doctor.

490
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,350
Don't worry.

491
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,520
Though it's a chronic disease,

492
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,280
it isn't incurable.

493
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
You came here

494
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
out of trust.

495
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,590
We promised

496
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,830
to cure patients.

497
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,190
So

498
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,710
if I can't keep my promise,

499
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,110
my reputation will be ruined.

500
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,830
Thanks, doctor.

501
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,230
Thanks, doctor.

502
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,640
Baotang.

503
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,520
Zan,

504
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,590
this is

505
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,190
the old servant of the Jun family.

506
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,880
Hello, sir.

507
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,710
Hello.

508
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,830
I'd like to ask you something.

509
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,280
Do you know that the Jun family

510
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,190
reopened Jiuling Drugstore?

511
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,830
You aren't locals, right?

512
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,190
We are new here.

513
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,310
Are you here to see a doctor?

514
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,110
Yes.

515
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,520
Miss Jun

516
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,800
reopened Jiuling Drugstore.

517
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
As a descendant of the Jun family,

518
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,470
she has

519
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,430
good medical skills.

520
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,350
Sir,

521
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,520
did you really serve in the Jun family?

522
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,920
Of course.

523
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,280
I worked there for years.

524
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,830
Now

525
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,070
everything has changed.

526
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,760
The old mansion is gone.

527
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,070
And all people

528
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:23,880
are gone,

529
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,710
or

530
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,350
I won't leave the Jun family.

531
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,280
Without a master in the family,

532
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,160
you earn a living in other ways.

533
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,000
That's understandable,

534
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,350
Sir,

535
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,350
are you familiar with Miss Jun?

536
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,800
Certainly.

537
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,950
Though she left years ago,

538
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,640
she has grown into

539
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,920
a graceful young lady now.

540
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,470
Her appearance

541
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,560
has not changed.

542
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,560
She liked me

543
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,880
when she was a little girl.

544
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,040
Now

545
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,560
I'm happy

546
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,640
to see her again.

547
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,000
Sir,

548
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,560
are you sure

549
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,520
you're telling the truth?

550
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,430
Sure.

551
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,310
What,

552
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,190
what can I get by cheating you?

553
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:22,750
♫The wind and rain chill the night♫

554
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,870

Fine.

575
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,070
I'll accept it.

576
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,680
She isn't you.

577
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,230
Jiuling,

578
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,590
you're

579
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,430
unique in the world.

580
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,920
Just after Jiuling Drugstore was opened,

581
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,040
we meet the tricky case,

582
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,110
Haiping.

583
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,350
What if we can't

584
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,400
cure him?

585
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,190
When he was 15,

586
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
he won the champion in the imperial examination for military personnel

587
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,590
and became famous in Runan.

588
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,400
However,

589
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,880
three years ago,

590
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,520
he got a strange disease.

591
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,310
He loses all his strength

592
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,310
and can't walk.

593
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,640
So I must cure him.

594
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,350
But...

595
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,110
I trust you.

596
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,880
You can walk.

597
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,400
Your Ladyship,

598
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,400
you're such a highly skilled doctor.

599
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,280
Jiuling,

600
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,160
I haven't walked for years.

601
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,520
I seem awkward, right?

602
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,280
You walk very well.

603
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,470
Grandma and mother

604
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,280
will be happy

605
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,310
to see you walking.

606
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,430
Now you can trust her.

607
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,160
I always trust her.

608
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,310
I'll send herbs

609
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,400
to strong Haiping now.

610
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,190
As you

611
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,800
just begin to walk,

612
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,160
don't walk too much.

613
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,000
Practice step by step.

614
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,680
I'll prepare medicated bath for you tonight.

615
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,310
Jiuling,

616
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,350
thank you.

617
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,470
Go wherever

618
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,190
you want to.

619
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,280
Have a look at kites.

620
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,680
Buy one if you like it.

621
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,430
Look at this.

622
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,520
Have a look.

623
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,310
Have a look at the kites.

624
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,230
Look, Jiuling.

625
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,710
Have a look.

626
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,160
Don't be completely attracted by those on the street,

627
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,190
mind your step.

628
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,760
I'm fine.

629
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,590
Jiuling,

630
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,160
look at that.

631
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,400
Come on.

632
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,400
Be careful.

633
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,920
This is great.

634
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:12,950
Look.

635
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,800
This one.

636
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,430
My sisters

637
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,560
often bought this for me,

638
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,590
but

639
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,190
I've never come out

640
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,110
and bought it alone.

641
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,560
Look at this one.

642
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,350
It's pretty.

643
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,000
Do you like it?

644
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,400
Here you are.

645
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:27,800
Santao,

646
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,280
pay money.

647
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,470
Well,

648
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:29,950
here you are.

649
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,110
Take it.

650
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,400
Let's move forward.

651
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,950
By the way,

652
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,400
I haven't selected

653
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,560
a gift for others personally.

654
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,800
When we go back

655
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,710
this time,

656
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,800
I'll select gifts

657
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,760
for grandma,

658
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,350
mother,

659
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,830
and

660
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,950
my sisters.

661
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,880
Have you decided what to buy?

662
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,880
Yes.

663
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,070
Well,

664
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,160
Grandma

665
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
likes jade,

666
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,920
so I'll

667
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,520
give her a big ring.

668
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,800
And mother likes

669
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,160
worshiping Buddha,

670
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
so I'll buy her a jade Buddha statue.

671
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,430
I'll also prepare gifts

672
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,430
for Yunxiu and Yuxiu.

673
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,560
However,

674
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,110
however,

675
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,880
Jiuling,

676
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,560
after

677
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,310
thinking hard,

678
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,920
I still can't choose

679
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,590
any good gift

680
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,640
for you.

681
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,070
In this case,

682
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,520
you may give me one when you have a choice.

683
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,680
No.

684
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,430
You cured my legs.

685
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,070
I should prepare you

686
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,710
a generous gift,

687
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,800
but,

688
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,350
but

689
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,070
I think

690
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,830
these gifts

691
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,640
are not good enough for you.

692
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,760
I am glad

693
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
to hear that.

694
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,590
You know what?

695
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,710
I prepared you a gift.

696
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,800
You give me a gift?

697
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,560
Liu'er.

698
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,280
Candied fruit.

699
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,710
What's this?

700
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,830
Open it.

701
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,070
You made it?

702
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,070
I prepared it

703
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,590
for you long ago.

704
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,110
I've waited for

705
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,950
the day

706
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,920
when you can walk wearing it.

707
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,800
I hope

708
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,640
it can go with you

709
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,430
wherever you want.

710
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,920
I will always wear it.

711
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,040
Let Liu'er help you take it.

712
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,950
I'll take it.

713
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,280
Walk for more a while.

714
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,470
OK.

715
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,520
Let's go ahead.

716
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,230
Be careful.

717
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,800
You are back.

718
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,560
Where did you go?

719
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,280
I'll escort you as agreed.

720
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,760
Don't ask me

721
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,070
anything else.

722
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,710
You're disappointed as I'm not her,

723
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,710
right?

724
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,960
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

725
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,080
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

♫Early morning♫

753
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,830
What else do you want to say to me?

754
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,710
Well,

755
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,520
if Princess Jiuling is still alive,

756
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,350
she wouldn't want to see you like this.

757
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,870
Would she

758
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,670
let you use her name?

759
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,560
My name is Jun Jiuling.

760
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,840
The clinic and I

761
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,469
share the same name.

762
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,359
This is quite normal.

763
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,149
I know you hope

764
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,280
Princess Jiuling is still alive,

765
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,760
but...

766
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:43,599
Stop.

767
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,839
I see.

768
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,150
You should learn to

769
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,390
forget something.

770
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,520
Forget?

771
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,120
Everyone tells me to forget her,

772
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,560
so do you.

773
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,230
Have you forgotten her?

774
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,840
She died young.

775
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,230
Everyone around has forgotten her.

776
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,950
You all want to erase her existence.

777
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,040
If I also forget her,

778
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,390
she'll be so lonely.

779
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,320
It's late.

780
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,870
What brings you here, mother?

781
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,910
Su Qi,

782
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,390
I don't understand.

783
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,080
The Fang family is nice to you.

784
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,000
Why did you do that?

785
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,600
I was forced.

786
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,710
Who is behind you?

787
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,230
Did you also kill

788
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,320
my son Nianjun?

789
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,950
No.

790
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,000
No.

791
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,430
I didn't.

792
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,040
It is...

793
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,840
Go check now.

794
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,360
Go.

795
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,870
Tell me

796
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,520
who is behind you.

797
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,870
Tell me!

798
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,630
Who is behind you?

799
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,710
Tell me now.

800
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,080
Let

801
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,080
Jinxiu go.

802
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,000
Go check there.

803
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,470
Mujin,

804
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,040
who

805
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,670
exactly are you?

806
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,910
Who ordered you to kill Madame Su?

807
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,670
Senior Madame,

808
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,040
she hides a poison pill in her teeth.

809
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,040
It's too late.

810
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,470
Mom.

811
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,040
Mom.

812
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,000
Lock Jinxiu up.

813
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,040
Without my permission,

814
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,000
no one can see her

815
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,080
Got it.

816
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,870
Go to the eastern suburbs.

817
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,320
♫Outline in my dream♫

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,760
