♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
In 10-odd years,

41
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,750
I've been engaged three times,

42
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,470
with Lu Yunqi who seemed to be from a dream,

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,640
with Childe Ning who's destined to miss me,

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,120
and with my cousin in depression and despair.

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,080
However, all these three engagements

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,400
do not truly belong to me.

47
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,590
Can I have an engagement

48
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,640
that truly belongs to me

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,510
in the rest of my life?

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,080
The couple gets married today.

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,150
The two of you,

52
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,230
bow…

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,040
Skip these unnecessary formalities.

54
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,040
The groom is weak

55
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,400
and can't walk.

56
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,640
Jump to the last step.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,760
Husband and wife bow to each other.

58
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,640
Done.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
Send the couple into the bridal chamber.

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,910
Congratulations, boss.

61
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,470
Congratulations, boss.

62
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,720
Congratulations. Congratulations.

63
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,440
Congratulations, boss.

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
Congratulations, boss.

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Congratulations, boss.

66
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,640
Congratulations. Congratulations.

67
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,960
That's the exact amount.

68
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,800
Cousin.

69
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,310
Do not call me cousin in the future.

70
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,190
Okay.

71
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,470
I'll call you Chengyu.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,910
What are you doing?

73
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,390
You…

74
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you…

75
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,750
Do you…

76
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,670
Really want to…

77
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,750
Want to…

78
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,270
What are you thinking?

79
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,910
It's the medicated bath.

80
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,270
I told you before.

81
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,310
Do you forget?

82
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,390
Medicated bath?

83
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,800
I don't need it.

84
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,390
Your Ladyship,

85
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,520
the water is boiled.

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,670
Shall I bring the barrel in?

87
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,830
Bring it in.

88
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,520
Okay.

89
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,030
Chengyu,

90
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,560
you refused to accept treatment

91
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,710
for the boundary between men and women.

92
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,840
Now we have got married.

93
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,470
You should accept treatment.

94
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,430
Do not listen to

95
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,800
Jinxiu's nonsense words in the future.

96
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:49,990
Okay.

97
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,280
Young master,

98
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,430
madame prepared the pears for you.

99
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,310
Put them here.

100
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,800
I know

101
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,470
our engagement

102
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,680
displeases many people.

103
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,470
But

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I have put it down.

105
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,520
Let's put an end to all this.

106
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,430
I had no idea you would come today,

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,280
so I didn't prepare tea for you.

108
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,280
Take this pear

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,310
as tea.

110
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,120
Today is her wedding day.

111
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,590
At this time,

112
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,310
she must have performed the wedding ceremony.

113
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,030
Forget it.

114
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,030
It's all over.

115
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,519
Chengyu,

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,520
the longer time you stay in it,

117
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,240
the more painful it will be,

118
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,959
but it also works better.

119
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
You must hold on,

120
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,710
even if

121
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,150
you may

122
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,240
faint in the end.

123
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,990
Does it hurt you?

124
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Not really.

125
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,560
Am I

126
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,120
a useless man?

127
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,910
Trust me.

128
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,910
You will recover soon.

129
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,310
If it really hurts too much,

130
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,080
you may shout out

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,520
and will feel better.

132
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,750
Get out.

133
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,870
Get out.

134
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,560
Chengyu,

135
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,870
you will faint in pain later.

136
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,710
I have to be here.

137
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,840
Get out.

138
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,680
Get out.

139
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,240
Okay.

140
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,400
I'll be at the door.

141
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:31,990
Your Ladyship,

142
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,560
why do you come out?

143
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,750
Cheng…

144
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
How is young master?

145
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,840
Chengyu is a good boy.

146
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,040
He's very strong.

147
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,480
But he must recover faster,

148
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,840
or it will be hard for him

149
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,600
to travel far.

150
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,400
Is he going to travel far?

151
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,600
It's possible.

152
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,550
Well,

153
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,040
we need to get prepared early.

154
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,430
And bring more herbs

155
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,160
for Chengyu.

156
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,600
Got it.

157
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
If we really decide to go,

158
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,080
how long will it last?

159
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,480
I don't know.

160
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,310
Remove toxin on wedding day?

161
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,640
It's special.

162
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,870
This boy

163
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,600
is really too weak.

164
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,920
If you can't keep your mouth shut, get out.

165
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,350
I'm going to start the acupuncture.

166
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,400
Good skills.

167
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,920
Who did you learn from?

168
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,040
It's my wedding day today.

169
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,600
Do you come uninvited

170
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,400
to give me any surprise?

171
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,400
It is a sham marriage.

172
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,430
You just want to cure his disease

173
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,280
more conveniently.

174
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,640
Is that right?

175
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,960
You are such a busybody.

176
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,920
It's indeed brusque of me

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,040
to come here today.

178
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,720
But it's because your wedding reminds me

179
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,350
of Jiuling.

180
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,920
When Jiuling got married,

181
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,550
I was not in the capital.

182
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,040
So when you get married today,

183
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,310
I'm here to express my congratulations.

184
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,310
What's the matter?

185
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,400
You left it behind the day before yesterday.

186
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,550
I'm afraid you forgot it,

187
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,870
so I drew a new one for you.

188
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,990
Is this seal so important?

189
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,280
Do you know Beiqi's betrayal

190
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,350
in the third year of the Taiyan period?

191
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
My father mentioned it.

192
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,160
There may be secrets behind it.

193
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,990
The silver for ransom

194
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,720
was not handed over to Beiqi,

195
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,600
but hidden by

196
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,670
some people on purpose.

197
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,110
So you mean

198
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,230
this seal

199
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,160
is related to

200
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,840
the missing silver?

201
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,400
Yes.

202
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,230
It's secret.

203
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,190
How do you know that?

204
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,230
The maid of the late emperor

205
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,520
drew it according to her memory.

206
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,480
So it is slightly different from

207
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,480
the real one.

208
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,790
But I heard that

209
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,960
the prince who ruled Zezhou

210
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,160
has become the emperor.

211
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,960
So even if you find out the truth,

212
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,870
what can you do?

213
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,990
It's just like an ant trying to shake a giant tree.

214
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,430
Truth is truth.

215
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,670
It will not be buried

216
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,520
as time goes by.

217
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,640
You think it's an ant trying to shake a giant tree.

218
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,190
But in my eyes,

219
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,280
it's a firm ant cave.

220
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,480
Why do you tell me?

221
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,160
Because I want to

222
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,870
make another deal with you.

223
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,750
What is it?

224
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
You investigate the Fang family

225
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,280
to find out the origin of this pattern for me.

226
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,640
I will help you find out

227
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,400
the person who is harming the Fang family in the dark,

228
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,480
and keep secret his conditions.

229
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,520
Okay.

230
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,750
But you have to promise one thing.

231
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,640
What is it?

232
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
No matter what the truth is,

233
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,990
do not hurt the Fang family.

234
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,480
Even if…

235
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,790
Even if they are accomplices.

236
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,600
The emperor’s order

237
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,550
must be obeyed.

238
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,040
Even if the Fang family

239
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,350
got involved in this matter,

240
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,520
they might be forced.

241
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,080
And the possibility is very high.

242
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,790
And one more thing…

243
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,350
Leave.

244
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,670
I will go to meet you

245
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,350
at noon tomorrow.

246
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,310
See you.

247
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,350
Don't miss it.

248
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,110
Don't miss it.

249
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,750
Have a look.

250
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,720
Is it fresh?

251
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,870
Is the marriage

252
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,640
between Miss Jun and Mr. Fang fake?

253
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,670
Lower your voice.

254
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,280
It will be heard.

255
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,920
I see why

256
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,400
you were in a great mood

257
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,990
when you came back yesterday.

258
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,550
Well,

259
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I was in a good mood

260
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,230
because Miss Jun agreed to

261
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,040
help me investigate the Fang family.

262
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,870
Do not think too much.

263
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,720
Zan,

264
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,280
it's weird.

265
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,790
I didn't say what I'm thinking.

266
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,350
How do you know I think too much?

267
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,750
Open the door.

268
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,160
Miss Jun.

269
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,800
Please.

270
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
Miss Jun.

271
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,350
Please take a seat.

272
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,990
You are

273
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,400
a married woman.

274
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,320
So we'd better not meet so often,

275
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,280
or it will cause gossip.

276
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,830
Am I right?

277
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
But you asked me to

278
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,400
investigate the Fang family in secret for you.

279
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,800
Yeah.

280
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,280
I have thought about it.

281
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
If the Fang family

282
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,870
really got involved in the official silver,

283
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,710
I should start from the seniors of Deshengchang.

284
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,070
Do you have a target?

285
00:19:59,230 --> 00:19:59,990
Yes, she is the one who has harmed

286
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,440
the Fang family in the dark in my guess.

287
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,070
Mother, please drink tea.

288
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,320
Zhenzhen.

289
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,680
Grandma,

290
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,400
aunt.

291
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,110
Though we know the marriage is fake,

292
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,800
you should call me mother before others.

293
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,640
I got it,

294
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,640
mother.

295
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,680
Zhenzhen,

296
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,350
sit down.

297
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,320
How is Chengyu

298
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,350
after the medicated bath?

299
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,710
Yesterday, he took the first medicated bath.

300
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,800
He could not bear it

301
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,440
and fainted in pain.

302
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,640
Fainted?

303
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,160
How is he now?

304
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,520
Should we find another doctor for him?

305
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,680
Don't be worried, mother.

306
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,950
It shows that

307
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,110
the medicated bath worked very well.

308
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,400
But,

309
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,590
Chengyu has had

310
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,950
too much toxin in his body after these years.

311
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,680
He has to go through all these.

312
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:45,950
Okay.

313
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,920
Chengyu needs to

314
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,070
remove the toxin first

315
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,800
and then have tonic food.

316
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,990
Medicated bath

317
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,990
is to remove the toxin inside his body.

318
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,920
After that,

319
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,350
I will fix his meridians with needles

320
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,950
and make decoction and food for him.

321
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Thank you, Zhenzhen.

322
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,950
Madame.

323
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,200
What's the matter?

324
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Shopkeeper Song is here.

325
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,560
He said he invited Imperial Doctor Sun

326
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,830
to see young master.

327
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,320
It's really him.

328
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,350
Zhenzhen.

329
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,560
Grandma.

330
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,710
Zhenzhen,

331
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,440
this is Imperial Doctor Sun.

332
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,040
He came to Zezhou

333
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,590
to visit his relatives this time.

334
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,160
Knowing that,

335
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,320
Shopkeeper Song went to invite him

336
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,440
to see Chengyu.

337
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,640
Thank you

338
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,590
for coming.

339
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,800
Imperial Doctor Sun,

340
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,400
please.

341
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,990
Imperial Doctor Sun,

342
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,470
how is Chengyu ?

343
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,800
Madame,

344
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,990
let's talk outside.

345
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,800
Let Mr. Fang have a rest.

346
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay.

347
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,990
His pulse

348
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,560
is extremely weak.

349
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,640
His body

350
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,400
has decayed inside.

351
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,830
Even a miracle-working doctor

352
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,070
can't save him.

353
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,640
Imperial Doctor Sun,

354
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,830
please save Chengyu.

355
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,520
Madame.

356
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:17,920
Mother.

357
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,710
Madame,

358
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,070
please restrain your grief.

359
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,110
Stop saying unlucky words.

360
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,560
Is your judgment accurate?

361
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,470
When he got married a couple days ago,

362
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,070
he looked spirited.

363
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,350
How would his conditions worsen so much

364
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,990
in only a few days?

365
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,320
It may be momentary recovery before death.

366
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,350
Or

367
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,440
he might have some tonic

368
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,800
to hold

369
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,870
his breath barely.

370
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,590
You usually decoct medicinal herbs

371
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,440
in the eastern kitchen.

372
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,560
Why do you do it here today?

373
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,870
The herbal smell

374
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,280
is also good for your body.

375
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,590
Okay.

376
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,680
Cover it.

377
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,440
Today,

378
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,560
an imperial doctor

379
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,440
will come to see you.

380
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,200
Do you give up on me?

381
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,920
I will never give up on you.

382
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,560
We decoct the medicinal herbs

383
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,640
for them.

384
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,070
For them?

385
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,950
After the medicated bath,

386
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,590
you are extremely weak.

387
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,560
I don't think they

388
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,680
can see anything wrong.

389
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,640
What does it mean?

390
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,950
You will know soon.

391
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,800
Be careful, mother.

392
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,350
Shaoyao,

393
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,470
go to the kitchen

394
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,350
to ask them to make some soup

395
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,320
for soothing the nerves for grandma and mother.

396
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,110
I got it.

397
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,800
It's really him.

398
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,710
I was wrong about him.

399
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,440
Zhenzhen,

400
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,830
what do you plan to do next?

401
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,560
This time, Chengyu was not exposed

402
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,990
because he is weak

403
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,040
after the medicated bath.

404
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,750
If they come again next time,

405
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,870
we can't fool them so easily.

406
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,830
I'm thinking about one thing.

407
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,990
Can Song Yunping

408
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,950
do all these things alone

409
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,750
without being exposed all these years?

410
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,830
Do you mean

411
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,640
he did all these under orders?

412
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,160
It's possible.

413
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,470
Grandma, mother,

414
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,070
I have an idea.

415
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,640
I wonder if

416
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,040
you will agree.

417
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,920
Tell us.

418
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,870
I want to

419
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,710
leave Zezhou with Chengyu.

420
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,680
What?

421
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,350
Are you going to Runan?

422
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,110
Yes.

423
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
First, it is convenient for me

424
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,470
to cure Chengyu's disease.

425
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,680
Second,

426
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,750
it can lure out the person in the dark.

427
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
It's the quickest way.

428
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,230
I will escort you.

429
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,110
You?

430
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,320
Do you trust me?

431
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,590
If I don't,

432
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,990
I won't work with you.

433
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,350
Only you have the privilege to

434
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,870
be escorted by me,

435
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,710
a prince of Tianyou.

436
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,870
How about paying me 10,000 taels?

437
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,990
You paid 5,000 taels

438
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,710
as the prize of the Lantern Festival.

439
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,750
You should pay more

440
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,920
to escort Mr. Fang, right?

441
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,870
That makes sense.

442
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,200
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

443
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,710
When we get to Runan,

444
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
I'll find out

445
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,350
who you are.

446
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,870
How

447
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,950
do you feel?

448
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,830
Good.

449
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,040
Where are we going?

450
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,920
You'll know it when we get there.

451
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,640
It'll be a long journey.

452
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,200
Have a rest first.

453
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:18,870
OK.

454
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Why hasn't Mr. Ling

455
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,400
come yet?

456
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,160
Did he change his mind?

457
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,750
He will come.

458
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,350
He has something else

459
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,560
to do in Runan.

460
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,320
Take care of Chengyu.

461
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,440
I'll go and check.

462
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,750
OK.

463
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,280
Miss Jun,

464
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,350
with so many men in Deshengchang,

465
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,520
why do you ask me to drive?

466
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,200
Because you escorted

467
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,440
the lantern well.

468
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,710
Liu'er,

469
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,640
it'll take more a while.

470
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,710
Have more rest.

471
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,040
Go.

472
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,800
Mr. Lei,

473
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,990
how many years have you been a driver?

474
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,160
14 years.

475
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,470
So your hand

476
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,990
was cut off in the accident back then?

477
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,590
It has been so many years.

478
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,590
I didn't expect that

479
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,110
you are the first one to mention it.

480
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,470
Back then,

481
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,800
I was an armed escort of Yiyou Agency.

482
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680
When escorting for the Fang family,

483
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,590
we met bandits.

484
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,560
The goods were robbed.

485
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,160
Those who traveled with me were killed,

486
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,950
but I survived.

487
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,350
Chengyu's father

488
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,200
was killed

489
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,280
in the accident?

490
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,920
Mrs. Fang,

491
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,400
we'll be out of Zezhou ahead.

492
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Where are we going?

493
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,950
Runan.

494
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,560
Madame,

495
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,870
what happened

496
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,230
to Chengyu?

497
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,590
I heard that

498
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,400
someone saw him

499
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,680
leaving the Fang family this morning.

500
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,230
You also know the rumor that the descendants

501
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,320
of the Fang family are cursed.

502
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,640
Do you also believe

503
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,950
such nonsense?

504
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,520
Whether I believe it or not,

505
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,680
Chengyu is the only

506
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,990
male descendant of the Fang family.

507
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,750
You heard what

508
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,920
the doctor said yesterday.

509
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,440
He said Chengyu

510
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,400
is dying.

511
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,230
Master Nianzhi of Dakong Temple

512
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,400
told me a way,

513
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,830
letting Chengyu leave the Fang family

514
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,920
may break the curse.

515
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,520
But now he needs

516
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,400
to be taken care of

517
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,950
from daily life to medication.

518
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
It's more convenient to stay at home.

519
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,400
Even if he leaves the Fang family,

520
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
we may arrange an individual house for him.

521
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,920
Tell me

522
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,070
where he is.

523
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,350
I'll send someone to pick him up

524
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,200
and place him properly. OK?

525
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,040
What do you think?

526
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,870
Shopkeeper Song,

527
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,920
don't worry.

528
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,710
He is now well taken care of.

529
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,950
The master said

530
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,040
it's the safest that

531
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,870
even the Fang family members

532
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,710
don't know

533
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,800
where he is.

534
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,830
Now

535
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,160
I don't know where he is, either.

536
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,830
Fine.

537
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,320
I hope what you do

538
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,470
can make you let go.

539
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,440
Thus, what Chengyu suffers

540
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,320
this time

541
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
is worthwhile.

542
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,920
Send people to find

543
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,350
where he is as soon as possible.

544
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,870
They can't hide him

545
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,710
in Zezhou under my nose.

546
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,990
Never!

547
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,519
Do you feel

548
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,349
bored on the way?

549
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,110
No.

550
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,439
It may be boring to those

551
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,400
who often travel.

552
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,200
However, it's interesting to me

553
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,160
as I've never travelled.

554
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,320
The plants outside

555
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,870
look alike,

556
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,070
but I can't take my eyes off them.

557
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,919
I felt the same in my first travel.

558
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,870
When I was a little girl,

559
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,590
I often travelled around with my father.

560
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,520
I thought perhaps I would

561
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,520
always travel this life.

562
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,920
My father said

563
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,350
our life is neither long nor short,

564
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,320
but the time

565
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,280
we travel is just long enough

566
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,710
for us to see the world.

567
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,200
Thank you

568
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,160
for letting me know that

569
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,470
the outside world is

570
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,590
much wider than that I imagined.

571
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,230
In the future,

572
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,350
you can try to ride horse.

573
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,680
It's different from riding in a cart.

574
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,520
Ride horse?

575
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,230
So my legs

576
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,990
will be healed soon?

577
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,040
After we get to Runan,

578
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,160
you'll recover soon.

579
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,070
I heard that

580
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,990
it's hard to ride horse.

581
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,560
You're so clever.

582
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,990
It won't be difficult for you.

583
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,680
I'm clever,

584
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,710
but you're cleverer.

585
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,870
Why do you say that?

586
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,040
Because you're good at pitch-pot game.

587
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,470
You also know that.

588
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,990
Naive.

589
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,110
Certainly an uncle

590
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,440
can't understand the fun of the young.

591
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,160
I'm not an uncle,

592
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,510
but a handsome young man.

593
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,350
Didn't your mother tell you

594
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,590
it's impolite to call

595
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,350
a young man like that?

596
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,830
Sir,

597
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,030
besides that,

598
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,920
she also told me

599
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,640
it's shameful

600
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,030
to eavesdrop.

601
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,920
And it's nastier to comment

602
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,830
before knowing

603
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,400
what others are talking about.

604
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,110
Childish boy.

605
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,400
I won't quarrel with you.

606
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,480
Go.

607
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,440
Who is he?

608
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,160
He is Mr. Ling

609
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,070
who escorts us.

610
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,110
Based on your ages,

611
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,640
you should call him brother.

612
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,030
I...

613
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,440
Go.

614
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,510
Chengyu,

615
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,350
do you want to try?

616
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,510
You'll be fine.

617
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,640
Santao,

618
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,400
here you are.

619
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,240
Liu'er,

620
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,070
come here.

621
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,030
I...

622
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,070
You'll be fine.

623
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,640
As I count backwards,

624
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,720
let's try.

625
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,400
Come on.

626
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,270
Come on.

627
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,590
Three,

628
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,000
two,

629
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,640
one.

630
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,270
Come on.

631
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,640
Try hard.

632
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,070
Chengyu,

633
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:58,870
hold them. Hold them.

634
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,070
Chengyu,

635
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,760
hold onto them.

636
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,400
I can stand up.

637
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,830
I can stand up.

638
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:15,790
Well.

639
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,350
I'll support you.

640
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,680
Move forward slowly.

641
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,760
Move as I move your leg.

642
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,790
Follow me.

643
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,440
Don't be hasty.

644
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,310
Well.

645
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,590
1.

646
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,350
Be careful. Be careful.

647
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,350
Great.

648
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,550
Great.

649
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,070
Be careful.

650
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,550
Hold it firmly.

651
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,790
Are you alright?

652
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,160
Yes.

653
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,110
Yes.

654
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,240
Let's try again.

655
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,440
OK.

656
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,830
OK.

657
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,510
Try again.

658
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,110
Be careful.

659
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,350
I'll support you.

660
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,760
Move forward slowly.

661
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,960
Move forward slowly.

662
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,160
Hold them.

663
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,310
Hold them.

664
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,310
I can stand up.

665
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,510
I can stand up.

666
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,310
Once I imagined

667
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,160
to go out of the Fang family,

668
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,550
but I didn't expect that

669
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,400
I can stand up and walk.

670
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,920
Chengyu,

671
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,270
you'll

672
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,160
go farther.

673
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,160
I'm sure.

674
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:08,870
Trust me.

675
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,960
Well.

676
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,000
Let's practice more.

677
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,760
Stand for a while.

678
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,270
Well, be careful.

679
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,240
Liu'er,

680
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,270
support him.

681
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,110
It's the same to Jiurong.

682
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,870
Being trapped in the Mansion of Prince Huai,

683
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,920
he also wants to go out

684
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,680
and see a broader world.

685
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,030
When can he

686
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,110
be as lucky as Chengyu is?

687
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,440
How do you feel?

688
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm fine.

689
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,030
Come on.

690
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,350
Have a rest.

691
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,590
Be careful.

692
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,760
Don't be hasty.

693
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,760
Take the time.

694
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,830
Well.

695
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,160
Eat something.

696
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,960
Mr. Ling is good at cooking.

697
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:03,830
I'll take it.

698
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,240
Please prepare food

699
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,030
for us from now on.

700
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,030
Don't push your luck.

701
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,550
I was paid to escort.

702
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,110
Mr. Ling, you're a miser.

703
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,510
Speaking of that,

704
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,310
Miss Jun,

705
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,030
we're two birds of a feather.

706
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,400
Well.

707
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,400
Let me count it for you.

708
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,760
You got a lot of money

709
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,070
for the Ning family breaking off the engagement,

710
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,000
for winning playing go

711
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,480
and

712
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,870
winning pitch-pot game in Jinyun Restaurant.

713
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,790
As a young lady,

714
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,240
why do need so much money?

715
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,640
I won't tell you.

716
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,270
Mr. Fang,

717
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,680
eat something.

718
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,830
Let's continue.

719
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,070
Young master.

720
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,960
Where is Zhenzhen?

721
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,870
She went around

722
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,240
to see if there are any herbs to pick.

723
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,310
Is it beautiful?

724
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,070
Yes.

725
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,310
Come on.

726
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,590
She shouldn't

727
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,760
go wild alone.

728
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,350
I'll...

729
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:13,790
Mr. Ling,

730
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,310
are you going to search for her?

731
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,830
Purple immortal herb.

767
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,470
♫You are like vast nature, while I'm a gust of wind♫

768
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,110
♫It's me♫

769
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,630
♫You shuttle through the bottom of my heart♫

770
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,790
♫Has nature ever asked for any clues about the wind?♫

771
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,350
♫Any clues?♫

772
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:35,430
♫If my longing for you can be written down♫

773
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,470
♫Every word would be as strong as pouring rain falling down♫

774
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,190
♫You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again♫

775
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:45,470
♫Tears well up in my eyes♫
