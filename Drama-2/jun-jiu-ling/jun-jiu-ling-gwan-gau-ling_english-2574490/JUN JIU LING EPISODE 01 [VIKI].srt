<i>His young brother, Chu Rang, ascended the throne. Not long after,</i>

22

<i>Zhizong's second daughter, Princess Jiuling,</i>

23

<i>according to an imperial edict, married beneath her to the Commander of the Martial Moral Ministry,</i>

24

<i>Lu Yunqi.</i>

25
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,630
May you live a long life, Your Majesty.

27
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Jiuling, what is wrong?

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,620
It's such an auspicious day, what's going on with you?

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,060
Chu Rang, why did you kill my imperial father?

30
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,200
Why do you say that?

31
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
I have already found out the truth.

32
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,100
My imperial father passed away because of your poisonous hands.

33
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,020
Killing an innocent person, you are so vicious!

34
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
The Imperial Physicians Hall has long come to a conclusion.

35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,200
Imperial Brother returned to Heaven because his chronic illness relapsed.

36
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,910
Could it be that you have heard some rumors?

37
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,490
Did you go to the imperial study the day my imperial father passed away?

38
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,030
After you left there,

39
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,800
did my imperial father return to Heaven because his chronic illness relapsed?

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,550
However, why did his neck have bright red strangulation marks?

41
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,880
It's him, Chu Rang!

42
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,640
It's he who killed my father!

43
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,190
You have been instigated by people, right?

44
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,160
You—

45
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,610
It's you who killed my imperial father.

46
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,930
Yes.

47
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,770
What will you do?

48
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,190
Have you found who told Jiuling of the matter?

49
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,830
- How's Jiuling? 
 - Replying to Your Majesty. We have placed severe punishment on her,

50
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,020
yet she will not confess.

51
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,830
I have checked thoroughly.

52
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,160
A maidservant named Bing'er has escaped.

53
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,440
Tell me. How should this Jiuling be disposed of?

54
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,350
This...

55
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,120
Your Majesty must have already decided long ago.

56
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,320
<i>I am just worried about</i>

57
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,720
<i>the fact that this Chu Jiuling has an older sister and a younger brother.</i>

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,550
Could it be that the three of them participated in this matter together?

59
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,870
No.

60
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,560
Among the three siblings,

61
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,430
Jiuli is the most innocent and Jiurong is not of age yet.

62
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,860
Only this Jiuling...

63
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,790
is extremely intelligent and meticulous.

64
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,230
She was doted on most by my imperial brother.

65
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,190
May I be so bold as to say, if she's so extremely intelligent,

66
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,510
then why would she...

67
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,260
Try to assassinate me?

68
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,880
If she had succeeded in the assassination, then her wish would have come true.

69
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,390
Since it wasn't a success, then she's asking for death.

70
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,640
If she dies, then I'll be at the mercy of the public and I cannot do anything to Jiuli or Jiurong.

71
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,460
See?

72
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,210
Is this child simple?

73
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,190
She is not simple at all.

74
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,940
I had Lu Yunqi marry her...

75
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,270
as a precaution.

76
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,010
Since she won't say, then there's no need to continue asking.

77
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,230
I understand.

78
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,090
This time, don't let anyone else escape.

79
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,440
I deserve to die.

80
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,220
Chu Jiuling, wake up and eat. After you eat, we'll send you on your way (to death).

81
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,400
Father, the guards outside have fainted but we must be quick.

82
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,970
All right.

83
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,200
Jiuling.

84
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,490
- Jiuling. 
 - Jiuling.

85
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,450
How could they harm you to this state?

86
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,490
- Her life is not in danger for now. Let's leave here immediately. 
 - All right.

87
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,400
Let's go. Hurry.

88
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,200
<i>My Lord, when I was on duty, I heard with my own ears</i>

89
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,940
<i>that His Majesty wants to kill Princess Jiuling.</i>

90
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,230
Father, walk quickly.

91
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,720
Come on.

92
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,470
This way.

93
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,580
Wait, Father.

94
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,750
Once the people from the Martial Moral Ministry find Jiuling missing, they will search the entire capital for sure.

95
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,020
At that time, none of us will be able to escape.

96
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,720
I, Zhenzhen, am not filial. I shall be your daughter again in another life.

97
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,850
<i> Jiuling, we have learned medicine from Father for many years. </i>

98
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,860
<i> We have long been a family. </i>

99
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,600
<i>The late emperor had been extremely gracious to my Jun family.</i>

100
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,330
<i> Having the chance to repay that grace now is our Jun family's fortune. </i>

101
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,870
<i> You must live well for me. </i>

102
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,730
<i>Fire!</i>

103
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,320
Jiuling!

104
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,220
<i>Hurry! Hurry!</i>

105
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,160
<i>Get water! Hurry and put out the fire!</i>

106
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,150
<i>Yes, My Lord. Hurry! Hurry!</i>

107
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,190
<i>Hurry! Hurry and put out the fire!</i>

108
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,000
<i>Hurry! Hurry up!</i>

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,840
<i>The water is here!</i>

110
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,360
<i>What?</i>

111
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,440
Jiuling died in a big fire?

112
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,250
When I got there, I was too late.

113
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,540
How did the prison catch fire?

114
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,420
I failed at my duty. When I was not aware,

115
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,300
the princess set herself on fire.

116
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,410
Herself on fire?

117
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,560
Jiuling is one of my most beloved nieces.

118
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,070
Since young, she was obedient and sensible.

119
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,080
Later on, she lived outside the palace for many years

120
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,360
and became arrogant.

121
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,330
She actually... She actually tried to assassinate me.

122
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,000
Since she is no longer with us,

123
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,420
I will not punish others for her crimes

124
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,820
nor continue to pursue this matter any further.

125
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,590
Thank you for your graciousness, Your Majesty.

126
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,800
<i>[Honest, Kind, Thoughtful, Cautious]</i>

127
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,650
Jiuling...

128
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,500
Master... My face...

129
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,890
Jiuling,

130
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,480
I used a secret technique to change your appearance and voice.

131
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,350
But sadly, your previous face and voice...

132
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,050
Master,

133
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,030
- what about Zhenzhen? 
 - Zhenzhen...

134
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,210
has died.

135
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,640
Zhenzhen stayed in the prison for you and set a fire to cover it up.

136
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,920
That was the only way everyone would believe that you died.

137
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,060
These years of you secretly learning medicine by my side

138
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,570
has been my and Zhenzhen's happiest years.

139
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,270
The emperor was so kind to me. You were in trouble.

140
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,830
How could Zhenzhen and I just stand by and watch?

141
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,050
Jiuling, our Jun family has willingly repaid that kindness.

142
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,500
<i>Here.</i>

143
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,470
<i>Eat.</i>

144
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,010
- I have to find Zhenzhen! I have to find Zhenzhen! 
 - Jiuling!

145
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,170
Let me go find her!

146
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,930
Jiuling!

147
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,840
You have to live well.

148
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,410
Don't let her sacrifice go to waste.

149
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:44,570
Ever since my father's death, my siblings and I have become a thorn in Chu Rang's side.

150
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,790
I promised to marry Lu Yunqi so he would let his guard down.

151
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,060
Even though my assassination failed,

152
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,700
he wouldn't hurt them.

153
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,210
Princess Jiuli and His Royal Highness Prince Huai

154
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,260
really don't have to worry about their lives for the time being.

155
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,300
As of today, your appearance has been changed to Zhenzhen's.

156
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,180
This was a last resort

157
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,300
but it's also a blessing in disguise.

158
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,440
Starting today, nobody

159
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,770
will connect you with Princess Jiuling.

160
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,480
Master may not know,

161
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,220
the emperor's personal maid told me

162
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,100
father died tragically in Chu Rang's hands.

163
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,710
<i>Princess!</i>

164
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,240
<i>Yu'er, where did you go?</i>

165
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,550
<i>Everyone's trying to find you.</i>

166
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,490
<i>Princess, I have something to report!</i>

167
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,220
<i>Before the late emperor died,</i>

168
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,000
<i>His Majesty secretly had Lu Tong enter the palace.</i>

169
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,600
<i> and...</i>

170
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,980
<i>and had an argument with the late emperor.</i>

171
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,040
<i>It turned into a violent dispute.</i>

172
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,560
<i>A violent dispute?</i>

173
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,010
<i>What were they arguing about?</i>

174
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,650
<i>I don't know the reason but</i>

175
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,560
<i>I personally saw, after the late emperor died,</i>

176
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,400
<i>there were strangulation marks on his neck; definitely not natural death as the imperial physician said.</i>

177
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,250
<i> [Here will lay the spirit of the deceased emperor] </i>

178
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,280
Master...

179
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,060
I can't let this go.

180
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,730
Child, the heavens have their own plan.

181
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,570
But you must live on in order to get justice.

182
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,070
You must cherish your life.

183
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,980
Live on...

184
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,410
Yes... live on.

185
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,600
Master, you lost your daughter because of me.

186
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,210
From now on, I will be Jun Zhenzhen

187
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,870
- I will live on for Zhenzhen. 
 - Good.

188
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,100
- Only through living can I get justice. 
 - Good.

189
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,270
Good child.

190
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,900
Master...

191
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,600
Master...

192
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,770
Master!

193
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,710
Master!

194
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,290
Master! Master!

195
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
Master!

196
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,500
Master! Master!

197
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,120
Master!

198
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,630
You're awake! Master!

199
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,140
Master, it's me, Jiuling.

200
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,240
- Master... 
 - When I saw the immortal flower,

201
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,930
I was so overjoyed.

202
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,660
I wasn't careful with my footing,

203
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,970
and fell down the mountain.

204
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,600
Don't talk anymore, save your energy.

205
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll take you back.

206
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,560
Hold on.

207
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,890
Hang on.

208
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,920
- Jiuling! 
 - Master.

209
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,310
There's no use, no use.

210
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,890
Just hold on, hold on!

211
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,020
Jiuling, this is my Jun family seal

212
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,970
that has been passed down through the generations.

213
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,890
Take it.

214
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,800
From now on, you're no longer Princess Jiuling.

215
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,450
You are Jun Zhenzhen.

216
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,830
No, no, I'm not anyone.

217
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,760
I only want Master to survive. Do you hear that?

218
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,330
- Master... 
 - There's something...

219
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:30,170
I have to leave it to you.

220
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,200
<i>Jiuling, I've been protecting A Li.</i>

221
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,280
<i> This is a seal handed down to me by the emperor before his death.</i>

222
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,110
<i>It's about the murder of the late emperor's father by the Beiqui people three years into his rule.</i>

223
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,150
<i>The emperor had suspected that this matter was related to Chu Rang.</i>

224
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,640
<i>So, he wanted me to investigate. Not long after,</i>

225
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,720
<i>he was killed by our enemies.</i>

226
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,080
<i>I believe this is the reason for Chu Rang's troubles.</i>

227
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,320
<i>It's also Chu Rang's weakness.</i>

228
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,570
<i>Now that you are weak, you must not return to Jing hastily. 
 (Modern day Beijing) </i>

229
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,110
<i>It's better to go to Zezhou first and investigate the matter thoroughly.</i>

230
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,610
<i>Zhenzhen's grandfather, of the Fang family, lives under the reign of the Zezhou family.</i>

231
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,250
<i>That's the best way to protect yourself.</i>

232
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,460
<i> [Jun Family Records]</i>

233
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,260
<i>[Third Year of Taiyan, seal]</i>

234
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,850
Chu Rang,

235
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,870
I'll get justice for my royal father.

236
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,760
Let the whole world know the truth.

237
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,210
<i> Ten miles south, at the Blue Cloud Worn Inn, </i>

238
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,140
<i>Runan's maid, Liu'er,</i>

239
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,270
<i>will wait there for you.</i>

240
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,110
<i> [Blue Cloud Worn Inn] </i>

241
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,270
Let me go!

242
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,510
What are you trying to do in broad daylight?!

243
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,720
What are you doing? Should I sell you for rent?

244
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,210
Do you have any rules? I'm going to report you!

245
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,390
You stayed here and ate for free for a month,  yet you want to report me?

246
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,510
Who lied to you? My Lady will be here soon!

247
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,970
If my money hadn't been stolen before, I wouldn't owe you anything!

248
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,280
Right, right. Keep lying.

249
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,990
How many times have I heard it already?

250
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,840
Your Master and Young Lady, some Runan military family,

251
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,960
are having you wait here for them.

252
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,830
I shouldn't have believed you, to begin with!

253
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,750
Our Old Master, the miracle physician, has been reborn.

254
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,460
He just wanted me to wait here for him. He'll definitely come!

255
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,490
How much does she owe? I'll pay.

256
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,920
My Lady, we're finally united.

257
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,400
All these years we haven't seen each other, you've gotten even prettier.

258
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,330
Our old servants didn't want to wait anymore.

259
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,280
They stole my money and ran off.

260
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,580
But now that we're together, everything will be fine.

261
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,100
Nobody will harm us anymore.

262
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,610
Don't cry anymore. You've had a stressful time.

263
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm going to seek shelter at Grandfather's place.

264
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,950
If you'd like, you can come with me.

265
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,500
Yes! I'll go wherever you go.

266
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,260
However, that place is a merchant's house.

267
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,210
I'm afraid that once you get to Zezhou, you will be miserable.

268
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,060
Whether it's a family of officials or merchants, I do not care.

269
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,610
My identity isn't important either.

270
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,510
Eat it. I'm not hungry.

271
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,390
Eat more. After we eat, we will go to Zezhou.

272
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,810
You have such strong hands. It's like the abacus owes you silvers.

273
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,010
I was never serious about this when I was young. It's not like you are unaware.

274
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,540
I broke De Shengchang's abacus many times. This is not bad.

275
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,770
Eldest Young Mistress. Second Young Lady.

276
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,600
Guests have arrived.

277
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,020
When have we not had guests? Why so panicky?

278
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,190
They said they are... Old Madam's granddaughter...

279
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,950
When did Old Madam have a granddaughter?

280
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,220
How come I don't remember?

281
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,040
I think I've heard it before, but

282
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,970
it's been a long time since they've made contact.

283
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,380
Someone who hasn't come in a long time suddenly shows up...

284
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,110
They are definitely here for a reason.

285
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,120
Let's go see.

286
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,650
You're Yuxian's daughter, Jun Zhenzhen?

287
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,710
Yes, Grandmother.

288
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,350
Come closer.

289
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,560
You don't look like Yuxian.

290
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,130
You probably look like your father.

291
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,400
After Yuxian married into Runan, she has never come back.

292
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,080
Yuxian has been gone these many years.

293
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,910
The news I've received... I don't know if it's real or fake.

294
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,290
How did your mother pass?

295
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,250
When Mother passed, I was only 3 years old.

296
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,290
She caught a cold and was treated for half a year but never got better.

297
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,160
She passed that winter.

298
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,340
Grandmother, we don't know Auntie's situation.

299
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,440
Just because she says so, how can we believe it?

300
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,630
Grandmother, this is the Jun family seal.

301
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,610
Zhenzhen, I'm not blaming you.

302
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,330
You said this is the Jun family seal, but do you have anything else?

303
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,080
Like anything of your mother's or Runan documents?

304
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,880
See? Just someone else here to take our money.

305
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,130
Sister, don't say so much.

306
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,260
Mother, how about we let Zhenzhen stay a little while?

307
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,350
In the meantime, we can send someone to Runan to investigate.

308
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,250
They'll find the truth.

309
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,760
If we continue, I'm afraid we'll hurt Zhenzhen's feelings.

310
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,320
You can stay for now.

311
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,830
Jinxiu, have someone clean the West Courtyard.

312
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,660
You all can go.

313
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,640
I want to chat more with her.

314
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,220
Yes.

315
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,890
When Yuxian left home, she didn't take anything.

316
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,140
The only thing she took was a bracelet.

317
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,270
That's the bracelet I gave her. She loved it.

318
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,280
Before her wedding, she would often joke

319
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,030
that she would leave this bracelet to her child.

320
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,590
This bracelet... Did she give it to you?

321
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,670
When Mother died, Father was distraught.

322
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,390
He buried it with her.

323
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,120
Do you still remember what kind of bracelet it was?

324
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,570
<i> Old Madam has a lot of jade...</i>

325
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,120
<i>She probably loves jade.</i>

326
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,560
I remember...

327
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,650
it was a green

328
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,940
jade bracelet.

329
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,830
It was crystal clear.

330
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,260
Since the courtyard is ready,

331
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,660
you can head over.

332
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,900
Thank you.

333
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,160
<i>I only just passed the first test.</i>

334
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,910
<i>If I really want to be established here, it'll come slowly.</i>

335
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,890
<i>I must obtain Old Madam's trust.</i>

336
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,080
<i>Zhenzhen, please protect me in Heaven</i>

337
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,040
<i>so I can find the secrets.</i>

338
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,700
You can stay here. And anyway, we don't know how long you'll be staying.

339
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,220
Zhenzhen, Eldest Sister has this temper.

340
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,940
Please don't take it to heart.

341
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,270
What do you mean by Zhenzhen?

342
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,970
Wait until her identity is confirmed before you get close.

343
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,940
Let's go.

344
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,290
Shameless.

345
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,950
Liu'er!

346
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,770
What did you say? Say it again!

347
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,810
- You— 
 - Okay, Liu'er, don't say anymore.

- Who wants to be close with her anyways? 
 - What an unruly servant!

350
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,020
- The servant takes after the master. 
 - Who's unruly?

It's better to stay away from oily foods and eat something lighter.

Jun Zhenzhen, you're purposely contradicting me?

Sister, you've misunderstood. I saw it and just casually said something.

394
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,920
Our Jun family owns medical clinics.

395

 - Yes.

My young mistress can learn what she wants.

but that our Lord Ning never mentioned this.

473

Since Lord Ning has already passed,

474
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,920
it's hard for me to believe just because you say so.

00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,710
Even though you don't know, it doesn't mean it's not true.

Did he mention that it saved his life?

487
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,480
Doesn't seem like Lord Ning was that kind of person.

488
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,870
You!

489
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,620
I heard that your family has been practicing medicine here for generations.

so how many debts

492
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,020
have you collected?

493
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,480
The Jun family saves people and people pay if they can. If they can't, it doesn't matter.

00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,350
That's a doctor's right.

But the patients, if they can pay, they should.

496

If they can't, they should give respect.

00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,370
You're right.

498
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,980

502
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,700
You're lying! My grandfather was definitely not this kind of person!

503
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,580
Back then, Old Lord Ning said he was coming home to get money.

504
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,640
But my grandfather refused again.

505
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,510
But Lord Ning didn't want to lose face

506
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,790
and didn't want to be indebted, so he created this contract.

507
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,060
Lady Ning, if you accept this engagement contract,

508
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,120
then it'll be a marriage agreement. If you don't accept,

509
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,460
then it'll be a contract of debt.

510

What do you mean?

511
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,580
This is what you gave to save a life.

512
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,660
If I take back this contract,

513
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,050
we don't owe each other anything.

514
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,140
Mother, give her the money

515
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,960
and tell her to get out!

516
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,780
Enough. Leave.

517
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,840
- Mother! 
 - Go!

518
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,980
Young Lady Jun, do you feel wronged?

519
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,190
Lady Ning, don't you also feel wronged?

520
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,310
Yes, as a mother, using all this effort

521
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,850
to raise my son, only to be bitten by a wild wolf.

522
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,370
This beast has no feelings.

523
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,270
I can't hit or curse it, yet I'm the one to be cursed and hit.

524
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,390
I do feel wronged and my heart hurts.

525
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,880
As a mother, I can stand it.

526
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,680
But I can't stand it when something like this happens to my kids.

527
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,310
Young Lady Jun, this engagement

528
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,130
is the biggest blessing of your life.

529
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,770
Our Ning family is philanthropic.

530
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,760
Supporting you in this life is hard and makes me sick.

531
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,560
Lady Ning,

532
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,160
I'm from the Jun family.

533
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,720
Whether they're beggars on the roadside or disaster victims who come to us,

534
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,490
we've always saved people, regardless of who they are.

535
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,550
Back then, if Lord Ning said he had no money, then it wouldn't have mattered.

536
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:04,650
But now that this engagement has been set and turned us into evil people, we also feel wronged

537
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,130
and sick.

538
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,320
Some things can change and some cannot,

539
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,640
such as a person's fate.

540
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,030
Some people, when they're born, will have a hard life no matter how hard they try for a better life.

541
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,720
- I remember the Ning family paid for the first official title. 
 - How did you know?

542
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,920
You bought people off regardless of their positions and made friends with the Officer of Prefectural Confucian School, right?

543
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,660
Lady Ning, don't panic.

544
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,760
I won't leak this information.

545
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,210
But I would like to tell you,

546
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,240
there are many things that can be solved with money.

547
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,160
Back then, the Ning family bought the official title

548
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,150
to get rid of the low social status.

549
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,030
And now, they bought the marriage contract to get rid of a bad reputation.

550
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,610
Isn't it the same?

551
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,920
Also, 2,000 taels will do.

552
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,220
Young Lady Jun has thought it through.

553
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,120
- Lady Ning, thank you for the compliment. 
 - This business is a good deal.

554
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,750
Go.

555
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,940
Get 2,000 taels.

556
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,020
Wait.

557
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,080
2,000 taels was the price before. Now it's changed.

558
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,240
5,000 taels.

559
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:23,020
