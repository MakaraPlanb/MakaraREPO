1
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,860
♫I don't want to regret in troubled times Let me change sincerity for eternity♫

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,700
♫Let's embark this journey for a slim portion of prosperity♫

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,380
♫I'd like to rewrite life, but your looking back breaks my heart♫

14
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:50,500
♫With you for the rest of my life, I'll risk everything and wait for the morning♫

15
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,700
♫Early morning♫

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,540
Episode 10

17
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:19,260
Fang Mansion

18
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,860
County Magistrate of Zezhou Li Changhong

19
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,620
Jiuling Hall

20
00:36:03,000 --> 00:02:13,630
Zezhou

21
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,240
Master,

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,800
it's here.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,320
Stop.

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,630
Have you figured it out?

25
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,320
Which room is the young master in?

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
The room where Eldest Madame stays.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,520
In the afternoon,

28
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,470
she sent medicine

29
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,360
for several times to that room.

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,270
Where are Jun Zhenzhen and her maid?

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,550
Never seen.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,750
Maybe it's a cover-up.

33
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,630
Young Lady might go elsewhere

34
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,470
to attract the public attention.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,910
While Eldest Madame secretly takes care of

36
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,190
the real young master.

37
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,960
That's right.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,080
She's a mother.

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,960
I don't believe

40
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,320
she would abandon her son.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,240
Do it.

42
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,880
Song Yunping!

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,110
Sure enough, it's you.

44
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,670
Stop.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,160
Stop.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,670
Song Yunping.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,630
What are you doing this for?

48
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,670
You two

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,800
join hands to plot against me?

50
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,520
What on earth

51
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,320
do you do this for?

52
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,960
For what?

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
For what?

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,910
For money!

55
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,830
Money?

56
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,910
You want money?

57
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,160
Father wanted to give you half of Deshengchang,

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,630
but you declined.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
My master wanted to make you an investor, but you declined.

60
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,830
Mother wants to make you the chief manager, but you also declined.

61
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,000
Song Yunping,

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
you declined all these!

63
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,000
That's given by you,

64
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,830
not what I want.

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,190
You just put on airs

66
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,830
to give me this in charity.

67
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,630
I don't want it.

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,030
I worked hard

69
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,440
all my life for Deshengchang.

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,320
But in the end,

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,670
in the eyes of your family,

72
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm still a dog.

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,360
What you said

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,390
disappoints me.

75
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,389
What do you take

76
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,550
our kindness to you as?

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,670
Oldster.

78
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Stop pretending to be mercy here.

79
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,440
Chengyu is not here,

80
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,950
right?

81
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,350
But it doesn't matter.

82
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,270
He won't live long anyway.

83
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,040
He would die

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,350
sooner or later.

85
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,110
Song Yunping.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,640
Say.

87
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,320
Did you

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
poison Chengyu?

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,830
Then let me answer you.

90
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,760
I poisoned Chengyu.

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,390
Madame Su was also arranged by me.

92
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,320
I arranged all this.

93
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,830
You!

94
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,670
You!

95
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,440
You cruel brat!

96
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,270
You…

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Song Yunping.

98
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,110
You even

99
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,880
did such

100
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
outrageous things!

101
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,830
Your Excellency.

102
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,790
Everybody has heard

103
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,760
what Song Yunping said.

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,550
Please do justice for the Fang family.

105
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,640
Take them away.

106
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,440
According to schedule,

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,040
grandma and mother

108
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
should expose

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,320
Madame Su and Shopkeeper Song now.

110
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,920
Now Chengyu can walk on the ground.

111
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,510
In a few days,

112
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,350
when we are back to Zezhou,

113
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,600
he must be able to act like ordinary people.

114
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,880
After that,

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,000
if I ask for the seal,

116
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,440
will grandma

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,830
tell me the truth?

118
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,480
Sister's wedding

119
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,790
is approaching.

120
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,670
These medical books

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,440
are really

122
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,550
obscure for me.

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,920
Look at these

124
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,920
medical records

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,000
and prescriptions.

126
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,160
So complicated.

127
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,350
Jiuling,

128
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,790
you must study very hard

129
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,270
before you are able

130
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,600
to treat many diseases.

131
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,640
Before,

132
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,880
I studied medicine from my father

133
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,950
and traveled everywhere.

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Studying medicine is the same as doing other things.

135
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,670
To be a great doctor,

136
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,950
we must make great efforts.

137
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm going to

138
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,640
learn to manage well

139
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,510
Deshengchang's business.

140
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,000
Previously,

141
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,110
I was just a good-for-nothing

142
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,270
to treat my disease

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,270
and wait for dying

144
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,440
at home.

145
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,320
I never expected that

146
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,790
I could still do business

147
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,640
and take up

148
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,720
the important task of the Fang family.

149
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,950
When you were alone,

150
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,670
what did you do?

151
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,200
At that time,

152
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,550
except for reading,

153
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,480
I actually

154
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,230
had nothing else to do.

155
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,920
Occasionally,

156
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,920
I would think about

157
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,230
what I could do

158
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,950
after I recovered.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,480
By the way,

160
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,510
I also thought about

161
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,390
how I could

162
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,550
shoulder the heavy responsibility of the Fang family

163
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,830
and how I learned to do business

164
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,390
like my grandpa

165
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,270
and my father

166
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,350
to do business well

167
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,640
for the Fang family.

168
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,880
I Also thought

169
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,200
about holding up the sky of the Fang family

170
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,830
to let the women of the Fang family

171
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,550
be free from worry

172
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
like other women.

173
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,200
Later,

174
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
I read a lot of business books

175
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,230
and read also

176
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,390
accounts of many shops.

177
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,760
When we get back to Zezhou this time,

178
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,160
you'll hold up a sky

179
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,110
for grandma

180
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,720
and mother.

181
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,880
Doctor Jun.

182
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,830
Doctor Jun.

183
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,000
-Haiping. -I've recovered!

184
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,830
I'm well!

185
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,070
I'm well now!

186
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,110
I've recovered.

187
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,640
Get up, please.

188
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,720
Get up, please.

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,670
You are a great doctor.

190
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,670
Let me check your recovery.

191
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,720
You recover well

192
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,230
Doctor Jun.

193
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,110
My legs have been paralyzed for four to five years.

194
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,270
Originally I thought

195
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,350
it was quite hard

196
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,550
for me to walk.

197
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,830
But now,

198
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,070
I can recover my strength.

199
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,070
I can even

200
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,760
lift heavy stones

201
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,070
and walk for dozens of steps.

202
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,720
I'll show you now.

203
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,550
No need.

204
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,640
I believe you.

205
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
You're just recovered now.

206
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,880
Be sure to conserve your energy.

207
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,029
Yeah.

208
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,640
Doctor Jun.

209
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,110
A few days later,

210
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,840
I will lift the huge stone

211
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,670
to go across the city.

212
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,590
I want everyone to know

213
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,960
Jiuling Drugstore

214
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,230
has the art of rejuvenation.

215
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,710
Yes.

216
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,550
Now that you've recovered so well,

217
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,590
I feel at ease.

218
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,520
Liu'er.

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,150
Take this medicine back.

220
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,230
In the future,

221
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,230
you must still be the strong Haiping in Runan.

222
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,110
Thank you, Doctor Jun.

223
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,670
Thank you, Doctor Jun.

224
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,110
I'm going to tell them

225
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,400
Jiuling Drugstore

226
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,470
has good-effect medicine.

227
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,760
Jiuling Drugstore

228
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,200
brings a patient back to life!

229
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,230
Yeah.

230
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,440
Doctor Jun is really wonderful.

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,840
You are a great doctor.

232
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,880
Well,

233
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,520
I…

234
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,710
Have a taste.

235
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,550
What kind of meat is this?

236
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,150
Zan.

237
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,150
Nothing is more delicious than dragon meat in Heaven.

238
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,880
And nothing is more delicious than donkey meat on the ground.

239
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,590
If you can't get used to it,

240
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,550
just eat something else.

241
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,030
That's your hometown dish.

242
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,440
I must be used to it.

243
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,470
A letter from Zezhou.

244
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,150
Song Yunping has been arrested and jailed.

245
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,590
We can start back to Zezhou now.

246
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
Why was Shopkeeper Song

247
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,470
put in jail?

248
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,550
Is something wrong at home?

249
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,550
I can explain it to you

250
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,760
on the way back.

251
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,280
Mr. Lei.

252
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,150
Get ready

253
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,150
and start back to Zezhou.

254
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,640
Zan.

255
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,030
We are going to return to Zezhou.

256
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
We are going to return to Zezhou.

257
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,230
Why did the carriage stop?

258
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,760
Mr. Lei.

259
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,080
Run forward.

260
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,230
Don't look back.

261
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,320
Got it.

262
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,110
All of you!

263
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,960
Follow me.

264
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,350
Yes.

265
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,200
What's the matter?

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,280
I don't know the situation yet.

267
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,400
Go.

268
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:21,710
Zan.

269
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,710
You are injured.

270
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,110
Don't worry.

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,550
Does it hurt?

272
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,880
Any clues

273
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,670
about those people just now?

274
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,350
I've checked it.

275
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,640
No clue.

276
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm afraid our way back to Zezhou

277
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,790
won't be peaceful.

278
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,790
There may be many ambushes waiting for us ahead.

279
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,350
Even if we change the route,

280
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,350
I'm afraid they can still find a trace of us.

281
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,350
Look out.

282
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,470
Young Lady.

283
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,910
The owner's letter said

284
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,550
Steward Gao has brought people to receive us.

285
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,400
If we change the route at this time,

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,960
I'm afraid we'll miss them.

287
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,030
In my opinion,

288
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,350
we can wait until we meet him

289
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,080
before we make a decision.

290
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,760
All right.

291
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,790
That's it.

292
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,200
Mount the horse.

293
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,910
Brother.

294
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Now that you're hurt,

295
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,000
take the carriage with us.

296
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,030
I'm all right.

297
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,520
Two brothers,

298
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,000
please let us in.

299
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,960
Lady,

300
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,230
you don't need to do this.

301
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,880
The food boxes you sent these days

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,080
are almost returned intact.

303
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,670
You'd better not bother.

304
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,520
Sister has always been very tricky.

305
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,790
These are all

306
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,150
her favorite dishes.

307
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,440
It's also good that

308
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,280
she has several bites of them.

309
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,150
Okay.

310
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
I'll send it in later.

311
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,320
Please leave.

312
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,400
If Senior Madame sees this,

313
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,640
she would scold us again.

314
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,790
Two brothers, please

315
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,320
protect sister well.

316
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,230
In the whole family,

317
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,550
only the second lady

318
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,230
cares about you.

319
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,670
She sent you

320
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,200
all your favorite dishes.

321
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,550
Would you like to have some?

322
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,110
I don't understand.

323
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,150
Mom.

324
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,400
Why do you do that?

325
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,350
I've always,

326
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,520
I've always been proud of the Fang family.

327
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,150
I always wanted to be a hero of the Fang family.

328
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,910
But in the end,

329
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,280
I find that I'm not a hero

330
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,760
and my mom

331
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,000
is the culprit of hurting the Fang family.

332
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,470
I thought

333
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,030
we had a clear conscience.

334
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,440
But it's all collapsed.

335
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,880
It's all collapsed.

336
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,760
Collapsed.

337
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,040
Baotang.

338
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,400
Let's go.

339
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,000
Okay.

340
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,070
Dash.

341
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,520
Young Master.

342
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
It's really you.

343
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,070
Steward Gao.

344
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,160
Your legs are really recovered?

345
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes.

346
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,000
Jiuling cured me.

347
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,950
Jiuling?

348
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,400
I mean Zhenzhen.

349
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,000
She changed her name.

350
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,880
Heaven blessed.

351
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,160
Thank Heaven for giving the Fang family

352
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,040
a great doctor as your wife.

353
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,280
I mentioned it in my previous letter to grandma.

354
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,190
Words in letter

355
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,040
are really different from what I see.

356
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,880
Let me see.

357
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,470
Young Master.

358
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,040
Young Master.

359
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,430
You are really recovered.

360
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,040
Let me see

361
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,880
Young Master, you are well.

362
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,230
That's nice.

363
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,950
Young master is all right.

364
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,560
He has been recovered.

365
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:03,920
Great.

366
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,160
You look good, too.

367
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,110
Great.

368
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,070
I really have to thank Jiuling.

369
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,800
You are really recovered.

370
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,230
Tell the Senior Madame.

371
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,470
Young Master is recovered.

372
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,800
Liu'er.

373
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,920
Come here.

374
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,470
Are you

375
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,710
feeling better?

376
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,800
It won't kill me.

377
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,000
When are you going to stop being like this?

378
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,280
Jun,

379
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,640
I promised to escort you.

380
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,310
I will keep my promise.

381
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,830
And others

382
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,160
are none of your business.

383
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,160
Zhu Zan.

384
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,590
Zhu Zan.

385
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,760
The destiny makes fools of people.

386
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
If I can go back,

387
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,310
I will live up to you.

388
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,920
Are you really fine?

389
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,310
You are really recovered.

390
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,000
You are well.

391
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,190
Good.

392
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,040
It's great that you've recovered.

393
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,470
Mrs. Fang.

394
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,830
Song Yunping has been jailed

395
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,470
for more than a month.

396
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,830
All kinds of interrogation methods were used.

397
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,040
But he just insisted that

398
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,560
no one ordered him

399
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,560
and he did all for money.

400
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,230
It won't help

401
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,350
to interrogate him again.

402
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,520
How about we

403
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
close the case?

404
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,880
Naturally, I listen to Your Excellency.

405
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,640
Since we're going to close the case,

406
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,830
you still need to be present.

407
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,680
Now your young master is not here.

408
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,470
When will he

409
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,470
come back to Zezhou?

410
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,680
I can't tell exactly

411
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,430
what would happen on his way back.

412
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,710
Maybe he will arrive soon.

413
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,110
It's better to be prudent.

414
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,430
When he arrives,

415
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,830
please remember

416
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,640
to tell me.

417
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,470
I'll go pick him up.

418
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay.

419
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,950
Thanks for your kindness.

420
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,710
This is my duty.

421
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,950
Then

422
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,950
I won't bother.

423
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,800
See you.

424
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,160
Please take your time.

425
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,680
Dash.

426
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,430
Stop.

427
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,680
Childe.

428
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,640
What happened?

429
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,070
Take a detour.

430
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,310
Childe.

431
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,880
This is the signal of peace

432
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,950
we agreed.

433
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,830
There's nothing wrong ahead.

434
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,040
I think something's wrong.

435
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,400
How did you know that?

436
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,760
It's narrow ahead,

437
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,470
which is the best location for an ambush.

438
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,470
Please believe him.

439
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,040
His judgment has never been wrong.

440
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,830
Young Lady.

441
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,070
Do as the childe says.

442
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,310
Go.

443
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,880
Take a detour.

444
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,110
It's annoying.

445
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,430
They travel slowly,

446
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,400
take detours

447
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,640
and change routes from time to time.

448
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,430
The men we arranged

449
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,470
failed to catch him after several attempts.

450
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,230
A burnt child

451
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,830
dreads the fire.

452
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,190
That's how his dad died.

453
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,000
So he is afraid of repeating the mistake.

454
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,000
He is cunning enough.

455
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,470
I went to talk with Mrs. Fang for several times.

456
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,430
But I learn nothing.

457
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,520
Whatever route he takes, he'll have to come back here.

458
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,950
Even in this world

459
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,640
there are thousands

460
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,310
of roads,

461
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,280
he can't avoid the road to the hell.

462
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,710
Can you stand it?

463
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,280
I can.

464
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,880
I have endured for all these years.

465
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,590
I can wait for this.

466
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,070
I'm sorry for this.

467
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,520
If you hadn't been exposed,

468
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,680
I would have never made such a decision.

469
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,470
I put you in jail

470
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
to learn

471
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,000
Fang Chengyu's whereabouts.

472
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,070
I'll leave to wait for the news.

473
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,400
The results are expected soon.

474
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,560
They would have to

475
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,000
stop making detours.

476
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,430
Stop.

477
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,760
Jun.

478
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,880
What's up?

479
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,400
The canyon ahead is a little weird.

480
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,430
But it is our only way.

481
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,230
We have to go through it.

482
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,430
You.

483
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,190
Be careful.

484
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,800
Childe Ling.

485
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,830
Be careful.

486
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,830
Line up.

487
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,830
Surround Miss Jun's carriage in the middle

488
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,920
to pass the canyon.

489
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,430
Kill.

490
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,520
Kill.

491
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,190
It's exactly the same

492
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,560
as what happened 14 years ago.

493
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,470
Mr. Lei.

494
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,560
Protect Miss Jun.

495
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,160
Kill.

496
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,950
Kill.

497
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,470
Everyone.

498
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,590
You want money

499
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,400
but we want to live.

500
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,040
Here are 30,000 taels of silver.

501
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,350
Let us go.

502
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,190
Okay?

503
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,040
We'd take

504
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,110
all the money

505
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,110
and all your lives.

506
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,470
Dodge.

507
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,190
Your Ladyship!

508
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,710
Mr. Lei.

509
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,040
These people were

510
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,920
those who destroyed your right arm?

511
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,950
It's them.

512
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,920
I finally meet them again.

513
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,710
Mr. Lei.

514
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
If I could get your right arm

515
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,000
temporary recovered,

516
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,280
would you like to accept it?

517
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,110
As long as I can fight against them again,

518
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,950
I will have no regrets in my life.

519
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,590
Okay.

520
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,040
Liu'er, bring me needles.

521
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,640
Your Ladyship.

522
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,040
Hurry up.

523
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,190
Young Lady.

524
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,640
You chose me as your bodyguard

525
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,560
because you want to help me fulfill my hope?

526
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,710
It's not true.

527
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,430
I just think

528
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,920
a man who can regret

529
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,880
for fourteen years

530
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,920
must be very reliable.

531
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,920
Protect Young Lady.

532
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,160
Yes.

533
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,830
Brothers.

534
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,470
Leave.

535
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,230
Go, go, go.

536
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,070
Hurry up.

537
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,560
Hurry up.

538
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,070
Mr. Lei is blessed by Heaven.

539
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,400
It seems

540
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,640
his right arm is saved.

541
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,710
Mr. Lei.

542
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,000
Did you apply

543
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,110
Green Lotus Stick Skills?

544
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,040
Young Lady.

545
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,190
I have no regrets in my life

546
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,880
since you make me use these skills again.

547
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,590
How is it?

548
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,920
Is everybody okay?

549
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,280
I think these bandits

550
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
should have reinforcements.

551
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,830
Everyone must be careful.

552
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,230
They are not bandits.

553
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,640
They are pretended by officers and soldiers.

554
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,710
That's why they were so brave.

555
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,470
You're right.

556
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,280
They are like those

557
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,070
who robbed and killed master back then.

558
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,000
They are definitely not ordinary mountain bandits.

559
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:31,880
Yes.

560
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,310
Only officers and soldiers

561
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,920
would shout kill.

562
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,350
It seems

563
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,430
we wrongly blamed Yiyou Escort back then.

564
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,800
Someone comes.

565
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,760
Stop.

566
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,880
Who are you?

567
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,400
Did your guys say

568
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,710
you meet bandits?

569
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,470
Exactly.

570
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,470
We are the garrison of Huaiqing Prefecture.

571
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,640
We are responsible for suppressing bandits.

572
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,920
Learning the news,

573
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,190
we rushed here.

574
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,950
Soldiers of Huaiqing Prefecture?

575
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,950
Who is the Commander-in-Chief?

576
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,520
Who is the civil corps leader?

577
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,430
Where are you stationed?

578
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,430
And who is the chief manager?

579
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,760
Do you have a written instruction for suppressing bandits?

580
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,920
On Baiheliang Mountain,

581
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,830
bandits are rampant,

582
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,760
burning, killing, looting

583
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,920
and committing all kinds of crimes.

584
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:23,920
Today,

585
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,560
another group of businessmen

586
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,280
and more than ten people including those from the Fang family

587
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,760
were ambushed

588
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,950
and all killed by them.

589
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,190
Take actions.

590
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,000
Since the mantis has appeared,

591
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,070
where are the finches?

592
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,040
Surround this group of people.

593
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,640
Yes.

594
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,830
Henan Prefecture handles cases.

595
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,880
Disarm, or kill.

596
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,160
Disarm, or kill.

597
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,400
Disarm, or kill.

598
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,830
The plan agreed with grandma was realized.

599
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,640
Those behind the scenes

600
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,280
are finally exposed.

601
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,230
Excuse me.

602
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,920
Who is Mrs. Fang?

603
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,800
Your Ladyship.

604
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,950
Young Lady.

605
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,470
Don't worry.

606
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,110
Your Excellency.

607
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,350
Ms. Cao from Deshengchang said

608
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,190
this matter

609
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,950
is at your disposal.

610
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,520
Thank you, Your Excellency.

611
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,470
Please interrogate them carefully

612
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,760
for their purpose

613
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,000
and who ordered them

614
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,040
to find out the perpetrators behind the scenes

615
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,160
and rehabilitate our family's unjust cases for more than ten years.

616
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,310
Please help us.

617
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,110
Don't worry, Childe Fang.

618
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,830
We will do our best.

619
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,920
Your Majesty.

620
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Are you still worried about the Fang family?

621
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,430
I thought

622
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,590
it's almost over.

623
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,470
I didn't expect that

624
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,640
the Fang family

625
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,230
stir trouble again.

626
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,710
You have to go to Zezhou.

627
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,040
I don't want Li Changhong

628
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,710
to have any accident.

629
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,000
Your majesty, rest assured.

630
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,110
I would make him

631
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,640
and the Fang family

632
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
disappear together.

633
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,800
All in all,

634
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,229
they have to

635
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,519
pass Baiheliang Mountain.

636
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,120
This time,

637
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,390
it must be foolproof.

638
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,229
In despair,

639
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,190
it's a great pleasure

640
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,870
to see reinforcements

641
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,190
who come suddenly.

642
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,150
But as a result…

643
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,120
The Fang family

644
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:59,150
would completely withdraw from Deshengchang this time.

645
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,560
For this day,

646
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
you've made painstakingly efforts.

647
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,710
It can be said that

648
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,710
you've worked hard for this for a lifetime.

649
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,910
The fame and wealth

650
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,560
are to be enjoyed for a lifetime.

651
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,630
Surely,

652
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,120
it's hard-earned.

653
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
I studied hard for 10 years

654
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,470
and got half a lifetime of official status.

655
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,430
I've been planning for 20 years

656
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,470
to get wealth for my future generations.

657
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,080
It's worthwhile.

658
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,910
I think the Heaven

659
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,150
is fair.

660
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,230
You are neither arrogant nor impetuous

661
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,710
but as tough as pine.

662
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,840
It's really admirable.

663
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,190
Your Excellency.

664
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,230
Your Excellency.

665
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,800
Bad news!

666
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,630
The country government,

667
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,910
the county government is being surrounded.

668
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,470
As ordered by  Commander-in-Chief

669
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,190
and the Prefecture Magistrate,

670
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,840
catch the thief Li Changhong.

671
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,190
Anyone who acts recklessly and disobeys orders

672
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,150
will be killed.

673
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,040
Your Excellency.

674
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,000
Grandma.

675
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,360
Mother.

676
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,840
Chengyu.

677
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,670
You can walk?

678
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,120
Am I right?

679
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,560
Yes.

680
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm all right.

681
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,190
Good, good.

682
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,470
Great.

683
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,910
It's great that you can walk.

684
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,080
Everything goes well.

685
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,560
Grandma,

686
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,910
now is not the time to talk.

687
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,520
Li Changhong has been jailed.

688
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,560
We need to get there as soon as possible

689
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,670
to avoid accidents.

690
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,520
Okay.

691
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,280
Zhenzhen,

692
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,560
let's go there now.

693
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,320
Grandma,

694
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,670
Zhenzhen has changed her name.

695
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,430
From now on…

696
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,390
Her name is Jun Jiuling.

697
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,950
Yes, yes, yes.

698
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,520
You mentioned it in your letter.

699
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,390
Jiuling.

700
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,390
It's a perfect ending.

701
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,470
Jun,

702
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,760
I'm leaving.

703
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,320
Good boy.

704
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,520
Thank you for your help.

705
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,120
Without…

706
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,230
No need.

707
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,710
You've paid me.

708
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Go, go.

709
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,560
Go now.

710
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,320
This way.

711
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,840
The Prefecture Magistrate said

712
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,800
according to the law,

713
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,760
you couldn't meet Li Changhong.

714
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,230
But because you are three generations of sufferers,

715
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,430
so he gave you an exception.

716
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,120
Before he's taken away,

717
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,320
you can meet him once

718
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,710
and ask him

719
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,230
about the situation.

720
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,280
Thank Prefecture Magistrate.

721
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,560
Li Changhong.

722
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,840
The Fangs have something to ask you.

723
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:10,800
Li Changhong.

724
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,520
Your Excellency.

725
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,840
Your Excellency, bad news.

726
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,120
Song Yunping has been assassinated.

727
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,600
Open the door.

728
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,000
Hurry up.

729
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,870
Open the door.

771
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,820
♫Every word would be as strong as pouring rain falling down♫

772
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,540
♫You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again♫

773
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,820
♫Tears well up in my eyes♫
