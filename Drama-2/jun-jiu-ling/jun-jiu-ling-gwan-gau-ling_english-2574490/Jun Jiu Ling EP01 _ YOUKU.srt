00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700

00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020

Episode 1

17
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,100
Upon Emperor Zhizong of Tianyou's death,

18
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,540
his younger brother Chu Rang succeeded to the throne.

19
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,140
Soon after,

20
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,020
Princess Jiuling, the late emperor's second daughter,
Second daughter of the late Emperor Zhizong Chu Jiuling

21
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,980
married Lu Yunqi, commander of the Arm Moral Department on imperial order.

22
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,180
Commander of the Arm Moral Department Lu Yunqi

23
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

24
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,460
Long may you reign,

25
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,580
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,660
Emperor of Tianyou Chu Rang

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,660
Jiuling, do you have any grievances?

28
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,340
This is your red-letter day.

29
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,660
What's the matter with you?

30
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,580
Chu Rang,

31
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,100
why did you kill my father?

32
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,060
What makes you say so?

33
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,820
I've found out the truth.

34
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,860
My father

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,820
died distressingly in your hands.

36
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,620
You committed fratricide.

37
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,900
How vicious you are!

38
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,020
The imperial hospital has long since had a definitive conclusion.

39
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,620
My brother died of a relapse of an old affliction.

40
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,700
Did you hear any rumors?

41
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,980
Didn't you go to the imperial study

42
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,540
the day my father died?

43
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,540
After you left,

44
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,820
didn't my father die of the incurable relapse

45
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,860
of an old affliction?

46
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,900
But

47
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,100
why was there a red mark of strangulation

48
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,660
around his neck?

49
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,540
It is him!

50
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,980
Chu Rang!

51
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,820
It was him who killed my father!

52
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,260
Are you at someone's instigation?

53
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,980
You…

54
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,580
It was you who killed my father.

55
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,620
Yes.

56
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,780
So what are you going to do?

57
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,940
Have you found out the person

58
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,860
who tipped Jiuling off?

59
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,380
How is Jiuling doing?

60
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,460
Your Majesty,

61
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,500
she's been given a torture.

62
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,540
But she

63
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,940
just refused to confess.

64
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,860
I've checked scrupulously

65
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
and found a servant girl

66
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,220
named Bing'er had run away.

67
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,820
What do you think

68
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,020
I should do with Jiuling?

69
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Well…

70
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,740
Your Majesty must have long since made your own judgement.

71
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,380
Deputy Commander of the Arm Moral Department Jin Shiba
I'm just worried that

72
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,380
since Chu Jiuling has an older sister and a younger brother,

73
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,820
could it be the three of them

74
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,220
are involved in this together?

75
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,620
No.

76
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,860
Of the three siblings,

77
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,100
Jiuli is the most simple-minded one,

78
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,060
Jiurong is still underage,

79
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,820
and only Jiuling

80
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,380
is the highly intelligent

81
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,100
and thoughtful one

82
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,340
who is the apple of my brother's eye.

83
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,460
I venture to ask.

84
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,020
Since she is highly intelligent,

85
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,300
why did she…

86
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,300
Try to stab the emperor?

87
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,420
If she had managed to stab me,

88
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,140
she would certainly have had her wish fulfilled.

89
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,980
If not,

90
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,540
she was asking to die.

91
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,140
If she died,

92
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
my concern of public sentiments

93
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,940
would of course prevent me from doing anything to Jiuli and Jiurong.

94
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,420
You see,

95
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,140
is she a simple child?

96
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,260
She's anything but simple.

97
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,420
I asked Lu Yunqi to marry her

98
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,220
for just such an eventuality.

99
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,980
Since she keeps silent,

100
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,180
there's no need to go on asking.

101
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,780
I see.

102
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,260
This time

103
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,380
don't let anybody get away again.

104
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,420
I'll risk any danger to do my duty.

105
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,420
Chu Jiuling,

106
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,140
get up for the meal.

107
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,220
I'll take you on the way to hell after the meal.

108
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,060
Chu Jiuling's teacher Doctor Jun Yingwen

109
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,260
Father,

110
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,220
the prison guard outside has been knocked out.

111
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,140
We must hurry.

112
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,000
OK.

113
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,620
Jun Yingwen's daughter Jun Zhenzhen
Jiuling.

114
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,280
Jiuling.

115
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,240
Jiuling…

116
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,620
How could they hurt you like this?

117
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,300
Her life is not in danger for the moment.

118
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,940
Let's get out of here quickly.

119
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,440
OK.

120
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,120
Go.

121
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,340
Get a move on!

122
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,620
Your Excellency,

123
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,860
I heard when I was on duty today

124
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,820
that His Majesty is going to kill Princess Jiuling.

125
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,620
Father,

126
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,260
hurry up.

127
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,819
Here.

128
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,320
This way.

129
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,780
Wait a moment, father.

130
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,740
People of the Arm Moral Department will search through the capital

131
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,820
once they find Jiuling is gone

132
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,020
and none of us can escape by then.

133
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,900
As an unfilial daughter,

134
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,660
I'll be your daughter again in my afterlife.

135
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,300
Jiuling,

136
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,340
for years we've been studying medicine under my father,

137
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,900
and we are a family.

138
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,780
The late emperor

139
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,260
bestowed great kindness on our Jun family.

140
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,020
Now our Jun family is lucky

141
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,980
to have a chance to repay his kindness.

142
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,140
Please be alive and well for me.

143
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,700
There's a fire!

144
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,220
Jiuling!

145
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,620
Be quick!

146
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,100
Be quick!

147
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,580
Be quick!

148
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,080
Be quick.

149
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,980
Get some water

150
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,740
to put out the fire.

151
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,900
Aye, Your Excellency.

152
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,940
Be quick!

153
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,740
Be quick! Be quick! Be quick!

154
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,740
Hurry up!

155
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,940
Be quick to put out the fire!

156
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,540
Be quick!

157
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,180
Hurry up!

158
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,900
Be quick, be quick.

159
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,460
Here's the water.

160
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,620
What?

161
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,340
Jiuling died in a fire?

162
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,660
I was already a step behind

163
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,340
when I got there.

164
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,700
How could there be a fire in a place for detention?

165
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,580
It was caused by my negligence of duty.

166
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,180
In a moment's negligence,

167
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,260
Princess Jiuling

168
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,060
started a fire to burn herself.

169
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,300
Burn herself?

170
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,780
Jiuling

171
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,020
is my favorite niece.

172
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,780
She was docile and sensible when she was a child.

173
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,100
Later, she was raised outside the palace for many years

174
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,100
and became arrogant and willful.

175
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,350
She even…

176
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,470
She even tried to stab me.

177
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,230
Since she's no longer in this world,

178
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,710
I

179
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,110
will not inculpate others

180
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,910
and pursue the case further.

181
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,670
Thank you for your divine grace, Your Majesty.

182
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,590
Jiuling.

183
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,550
Master.

184
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,470
My face…

185
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,790
Jiuling,

186
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,950
I

187
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,150
have changed your disfigured face and voice

188
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,150
with a secret prescription.

189
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,590
It's just a pity that

190
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,230
your original face and voice…

191
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,150
Master.

192
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,390
Where's Zhenzhen?

193
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,830
Zhenzhen…

194
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,270
is no longer in this world.

195
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,710
Only by letting Zhenzhen stay in prison in your place

196
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,030
and start a fire to cover all this up

197
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,030
could we make Chu Rang believe you were dead.

198
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,470
The years when you were secretly studying medicine under me

199
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,750
are also the happiest time for me and Zhenzhen.

200
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,870
The late emperor bestowed heavenly grace on me.

201
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,830
When you were in distress,

202
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,430
how could Zhenzhen and I

203
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,830
look on indifferently?

204
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,390
Jiuling,

205
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,110
our Jun family repaid the kindness of our own volition.

206
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,310
Try it.

207
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,070
Let me have a look.

208
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,110
How nice!

209
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,270
Jiuling!

210
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm going to see Zhenzhen.

211
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,310
Jiuling!

212
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,030
Let me go and see Zhenzhen!

213
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,870
Jiuling!

214
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,670
You must live well.

215
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,550
Don't let Zhenzhen's kindness go to waste.

216
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,990
Ever since my father's death,

217
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,110
my siblings and I

218
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,670
have become a thorn in Chu Rang's flesh.

219
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,110
I promised to marry Lu Yunqi

220
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,830
also to make him let down his guard.

221
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,790
Even if I failed in my assassination in the palace,

222
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,990
he wouldn't lay a hand on my siblings.

223
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,070
Princess Jiuli

224
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,550
and His Highness Prince Huai

225
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,550
indeed need not worry about the safety of their lives for the time being.

226
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,070
With things as such,

227
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,560
turning your face into Zhenzhen's

228
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,000
is something I did under the force of circumstances,

229
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,480
but it's also a blessing in disguise.

230
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,760
From now on,

231
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,200
nobody

232
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,160
will be able to associate you

233
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960
with Princess Jiuling of Tianyou.

234
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,560
There's something you don't know, master.

235
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,560
My father's maid-in-waiting once told me

236
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,320
he died distressingly in Chu Rang's hands.

237
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,880
Your Highness.

238
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,080
Bing'er.

239
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Where have you been?

240
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,720
Everybody is looking for you.

241
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,960
The late emperor's maid-in-waiting Bing'er
Your Highness,

242
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
I have

243
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,920
something important to report to you.

244
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
Before the late emperor's sudden death,

245
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
His Majesty

246
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,160
came into the palace secretly with Commander Lu.

247
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,720
And…

248
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,839
And he had an argument with the late emperor.

249
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,279
It developed into a fierce altercation.

250
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,879
An altercation?

251
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,200
About what?

252
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,360
I don't know why they started the altercation.

253
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,960
But I saw with my own eyes

254
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
a mark of strangulation

255
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,800
around the late emperor's neck.

256
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,520
It was by no means what the imperial doctor said as

257
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
relapse of an old affliction.

258
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,280
Master,

259
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm not going to take it lying down.

260
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,320
Child,

261
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
the Lord of Heaven will show justice.

262
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
But you must stay alive to seek justice.

263
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,480
Your life

264
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
is something you must cherish.

265
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,080
Stay alive?

266
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,020
Yes.

267
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,480
Stay alive.

268
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Master,

269
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,800
you lost your daughter because of me.

270
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,440
From now on, I will be Jun Zhenzhen.

271
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,920
I'll stay alive and strong for Zhenzhen.

272
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,000
OK.

273
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,040
Only by staying alive

274
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,040
can I seek justice.

275
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
Good child.

276
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,160
Master…

277
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
Master…

278
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
Master.

279
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Master!

280
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,360
Master!

281
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,400
Master.

282
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,360
Master.

283
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,200
Master.

284
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,320
Master.

285
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Master…

286
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,480
Master.

287
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,440
Master,

288
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,160
you've come around.

289
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,400
Master.

290
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,280
Master,

291
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,800
I am Jiuling.

292
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Master.
When I

293
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,320
saw the purple immortal herb,

294
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,600
I was overjoyed.

295
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,040
I didn't watch my step

296
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,600
and fell off the cliff.

297
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,000
OK, stop talking for now.

298
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,200
Save your strength first.

299
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,720
Let me take you back.

300
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,920
Let me take you back.

301
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,520
Put up with the pain.

302
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,170
Jiuling!

303
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,250
-Master. -You are…

304
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,850
You are doing it in vain.

305
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,130
You are doing it in vain.

306
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,930
Help!

307
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,170
-Jiuling… -Help!

308
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,530
Jiuling,

309
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,570
this is our Jun family's heirloom,

310
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,050
a jade pendant.

311
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,170
Keep it safe with you.

312
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,690
Remember

313
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,810
from now on,

314
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,770
you are no longer Chu Jiuling.

315
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,970
You are

316
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,970
Jun Zhenzhen.

317
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,290
No.

318
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,610
I'm nobody.

319
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,210
I only want you to be alive.

320
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,130
Do you hear me?

321
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,530
Master.

322
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,490
Now…

323
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,570
there is one thing…

324
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,330
I must…

325
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,250
tell you about.

326
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,090
Jiuling,

327
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,810
in the pages of my personal letters

328
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,530
there is a strip of note given to me by the late emperor when he was alive.

329
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,210
It is about the killing of the late emperor's father

330
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,210
by the Beiqi people in the third year of his reign.

331
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,650
The late emperor suspected

332
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,010
it had something to do with Chu Rang,

333
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,570
so he ordered me to look into the case covertly.

334
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,450
Soon afterwards,

335
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,690
he was killed by Chu Rang.

336
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,570
I think this is why Chu Rang started the attack on you

337
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,450
and also his Achilles heel.

338
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,250
Now being alone and weak,

339
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,130
you must not return to the capital hastily

340
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,410
and fall into a trap set for you.

341
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,850
You might as well go to Zezhou first

342
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,250
to get to the bottom of the case.

343
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,890
Zhenzhen's maternal grandfather's Fang family

344
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,090
is a big family with big business in Zezhou.

345
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,570
It's the best place for you to stay.

346
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,930
Chu Rang,

347
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,850
I'll definitely get all this back for my father

348
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,690
and bring the truth to light.

349
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,450
In the Biyunpo Inn 5 kilometers to the south,

350
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,450
a servant girl named Liu'er from my old house in Runan

351
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,450
will be waiting for you there.

352
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:55,330
Biyunpo Inn
Let go of me!

353
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:55,650
Go!

354
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,570
What are you guys doing

355
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,570
in broad daylight?

356
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,330
What are we doing?

357
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,450
Selling you to offset your room rent.

358
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,650
Do you still have a sense of law?

359
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,930
I'm gonna bring you guys to court.

360
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,050
After lying and freeloading for a month,

361
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,210
you even want to bring me to court?

362
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,810
Who lied to you?

363
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,690
My lord and Miss Jun are sure to come.

364
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,050
Had my money pouch not been stolen,

365
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,730
why would I owe you room rent?

366
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,570
Yes, yes, yes.

367
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,350
Make up stories.

368
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,330
Keep making up stories.

369
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,810
Which I've heard for the umpteenth time.

370
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,330
Your lord and Miss Jun,

371
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,850
the Jun family in Runan,

372
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,050
reincarnation of the great doctor Hua Tuo,

373
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,810
they asked you to wait for them here…

374
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,450
I shouldn't have believed you in the first place.

375
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,570
You bumpkin!

376
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,730
My lord is indeed the reincarnation of a miracle-working doctor.

377
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,810
They indeed asked me to wait here.

378
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,210
They are sure to come.

379
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,570
How much does she owe?

380
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,650
I'll pay.

381
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:40,970
My lady,

382
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,730
I've finally seen you after a long wait.

383
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,170
We haven't met for years,

384
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,450
and you look even prettier.

385
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,410
People who followed me from the old house

386
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,810
didn't want to wait.

387
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,330
They snatched my money pouch and ran away.

388
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,570
It's alright now.

389
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,050
I'm with you,

390
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,090
so nobody can bully us.

391
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,210
Don't cry, Liu'er.

392
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,690
You've had a hard time these days.

393
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,660
I'm going to

394
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,460
my maternal grandfather's Fang family for shelter.

395
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,180
You can come with me

396
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
if you like.

397
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,980
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

398
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,820
Where you are going

399
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,580
is where I am going.

400
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,060
Just that

401
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,980
the Fang family is a household of merchants.

402
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,180
I'm afraid you'll feel it's below your status

403
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,220
once you are in Zezhou.

404
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,180
I don't care whether it is an official's

405
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
or a merchant's family.

406
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,700
Because status doesn't matter.

407
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,580
Help yourself to it.

408
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm not hungry.

409
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,220
Eat more.

410
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,660
We'll set out for Zezhou when you finish.

411
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,540
Second daughter of the Fang family Fang Yuxiu
You are ticking off the beads so hard

412
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,340
like the abacus owes you silver coins.

413
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,180
I have no sense of hand strength since I was a child.
First daughter of the Fang family Fang Jinxiu

414
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,220
You know this, my younger sister.

415
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,340
I've broken so many abacuses

416
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,540
here at Deshengchang.

417
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,580
This one will not be the last.

418
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,820
Ladies.

419
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,700
We have a visitor at home.

420
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,700
When have we ever stopped having visitors at home?

421
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,940
Why are you so flustered?

422
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,740
She says she's the old lady's…

423
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,220
daughter's daughter.

424
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,220
When did grandma have a granddaughter born to a daughter?

425
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,060
Why don't I remember?

426
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,660
I seem to have heard it from mother.

427
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,700
But

428
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,860
they've been out of touch for years.

429
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,460
Someone who's been out of touch for years suddenly comes to visit.

430
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,220
She must want something.

431
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,580
Let's go

432
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,180
and have a look.

433
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,180
Old lady of the Fang family nee Cao
Are you Yuxian's daughter

434
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,100
Jun Zhenzhen?

435
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Yes, grandma.

436
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,220
Come closer.

437
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,660
You don't look like Yuxian.

438
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,260
Maybe you look like your father.

439
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,580
Yuxian had never been back

440
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,340
since she married in Runan.

441
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,460
Over so many years after Yuxian's death,

442
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,420
the news I've heard is a mixture of truth and half-truth

443
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,820
which is hard to make out.

444
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,780
How did your mother pass away?

445
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,980
I was only three years old when she died.

446
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,900
She unfortunately caught a cold

447
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,700
and didn't get cured for well over half a year.

448
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,260
She didn't survive the winter that year.

449
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,580
Grandma,

450
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,620
we know nothing

451
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,940
about what happened to Aunt Yuxian.

452
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,460
Mere words are no proof.

453
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,180
How can we be sure

454
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,340
she's the child of the Jun family?

455
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,340
Grandma,

456
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,900
this is the Jun family's heirloom, a jade pendant.

457
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,300
Master Fang's first wife nee Liu

458
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,740
Zhenzhen,

459
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,300
it's not that I'm being harsh.

460
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,380
As you said, this is the Jun family's jade pendant.

461
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,900
Do you have anything else?

462
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,940
Such as something that belonged to your mother

463
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,180
or paperwork in Runan?

464
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,420
Turns out

465
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,340
she's another slacker who wants to bum money off our Fang family.

466
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,420
Older sister,

467
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,020
why don't you save your breath?

468
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,300
Mother,

469
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,740
how about doing it this way?
Master Fang's concubine nee Su

470
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,820
We'll let Zhenzhen stay for now

471
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,220
and send people to Runan to inquire about her.

472
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,460
What is false cannot be true,

473
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,780
and what is true cannot be false.

474
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,620
If such a stalemate goes on,

475
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,820
I'm afraid it'll chill the child's heart.

476
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,500
Let her stay for now.

477
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,180
Jinxiu,

478
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,100
send people to clean the courtyard of the West Pavilion.

479
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,580
All of you withdraw.

480
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,100
I'll talk to her more.

481
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,340
Aye.

482
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,700
When Yuxian left home,

483
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,980
she brought nothing with her

484
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,540
but a bracelet.

485
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,620
I passed it on to her

486
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,780
and she liked it very much.

487
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,420
Before she got married,

488
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,110
she often joked that

489
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,270
she'd leave the bracelet to her child.

490
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,110
Did she

491
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,590
leave the bracelet to you?

492
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,550
When my mother died,

493
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,230
my father was deeply grieved

494
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,470
and buried that bracelet with my mother.

495
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,470
Do you still remember

496
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,030
what kind of bracelet it was?

497
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,790
Most of the old lady's jewelry is made of jade.

498
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,510
I reckon

499
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,150
she must have a preference for jade.

500
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,670
I can vaguely remember

501
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,670
it was an emerald green

502
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,590
jade bracelet

503
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,830
in a quite translucent color.

504
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,830
The courtyard of the West Pavilion has been cleaned up.

505
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,030
Shaoyao,

506
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,150
take her there.

507
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,270
Thanks, grandma.

508
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:31,770
Aye.

509
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,670
What happened just now

510
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,070
is only the first hurdle for me to settle down in the Fang family.

511
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,910
But it's not easy

512
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,030
to really keep a foothold here.

513
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,390
Now I must find an opportunity

514
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,030
to win the trust of the Fang family.

515
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,870
Zhenzhen,

516
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,310
please bless me with your spirit in heaven

517
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,030
to find out the secret in Zezhou as quickly as possible.

518
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,070
Make do with the lodging.

519
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,870
Nobody knows how long you are gonna stay anyway.

520
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,510
Zhenzhen,

521
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,110
such is my older sister's character.

522
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,670
Make sure you don't take it to heart.

523
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,910
What Zhenzhen?

524
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,590
Wait until her identity is confirmed.

525
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,230
Don't claim a family connection randomly.

526
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,670
Go, go, go.

527
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,310
Shame on you!

528
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,150
Liu'er.

529
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,790
What did you say?

530
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,190
Say that again!

531
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,250
You…

532
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,110
Enough, Liu'er.

533
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,830
Say no more.

534
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,150
You called her older sister

535
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,550
and she might as well take it with delight.

536
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,910
Who wants to claim a family connection with you?

537
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,110
How unruly!

538
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,150
A servant girl

539
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,190
is the same as what her master is like.

540
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,030
Who's the unruly one?

541
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,910
Someone deserves to be cursed

542
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,590
since she won't listen if you talk nicely.

543
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,230
-What did you say? -What do you want?

544
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,110
Enough.

545
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,590
Say that again.

546
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,110
Liu'er, say no more.

547
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,230
Older sister, let's go back first.

548
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,270
Don't be angry, older sister.

549
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,550
I didn't teach her properly.

550
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,630
We…we are going for now.

551
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,690
Let's go.

552
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,790
My lady,

553
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,070
I won't do it again.

554
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,750
Look.

555
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,670
We've just come to the Fang family.

556
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,030
We'd better be cautious with what we say and do.

557
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,110
Some people

558
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,630
say awful things

559
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,910
not necessarily out of bad intentions.

560
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,390
While some people say nice things

561
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,230
not necessarily out of good intentions.

562
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,530
What awful,

563
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,330
good intentions,

564
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,530
good intentions and not necessarily…

565
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,890
You are confusing me.

566
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,050
Are you thirsty?

567
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,090
Let me get you a cup of water.

568
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,610
Once you've been through a lot,

569
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,410
you'll come to understand it naturally.

570
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,050
Have some tea.

571
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,410
Come of think of it.

572
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,610
In his letter, His Lordship asked me

573
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,210
to bring something

574
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,530
from the old house in Runan.

575
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:27,970
He said

576
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,290
I must give it to you myself.

577
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:31,710
Here it is.

578
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:33,890
What's this?

579
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,810
I don't know.

580
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,530
What does it say?

581
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,450
It's so important.

582
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,810
This is a marriage contract with Mr. Ning.

583
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,850
Mr. Ning?

584
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,690
I know.

585
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,330
He's the man countless girls

586
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,010
dream of marrying.

587
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,210
If Zhenzhen was still alive,

588
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,050
this could be a good marriage.

589
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,890
But I must not acknowledge it.

590
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,489
My lady,

591
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,369
don't be shy.

592
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,210
Who in our mansion doesn't know

593
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,450
this is a good marriage?

594
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,609
Grandma,

595
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,130
this is a good dish the kitchen cooked today.

596
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:46,929
Please help yourself to some more.

597
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:47,449
OK.

598
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,049
Grandma, if you are coughing today,

599
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,689
you'd better eat less oily food

600
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,250
and eat something bland instead.

601
00:34:59,370 --> 00:34:59,930
Jun Zhenzhen,

602
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,290
you are embarrassing me on purpose, aren't you?

603
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,330
You've got me wrong, older sister.

604
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,570
I just saw it

605
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,690
and blurted out.

606
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,570
The Jun family had been running a hospital since the days of their ancestors.

607
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,330
She said so because she knows something about medicine.

608
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,930
Did your father let you inherit the family's profession

609
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,210
and pass on the medical skills to you?

610
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,290
Yes.

611
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,850
It's good to have a skill.

612
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,330
But don't learn it

613
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,450
afterwards.

614
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,450
Learn how to do business from your older sisters.

615
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,690
My lady will learn whatever she likes.

616
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,290
Why must she learn how to do business?

617
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,410
What's more, it's not that the Fang family doesn't have a male heir.

618
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,810
Don't you have a young master?

619
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,730
Why must a woman learn how to do business?

620
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,810
Liu'er, it's not up to an outsider like you

621
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,810
to tell us what to do with our household matter.

622
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:36,730
Grandma,

623
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,170
the Jun family is a family of scholars.

624
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,570
A scholar can't possibly have raised

625
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,090
such a daughter who doesn't know the rules.

626
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,310
As I see it,

627
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,690
there's no need to wait for the news from Runan.

628
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,050
While it's not completely dark,

629
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,570
let's just kick them out early.

630
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,730
It's OK if you don't wait for the news from Runan.

631
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:49,810
Look carefully.

632
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:50,970
My lady,

633
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,850
show them the marriage contract.

634
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,330
To make their jaws drop.

635
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,050
Show it.

636
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:55,710
Enough!

637
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,650
What marriage contract?

638
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,450
Just show it.

639
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,450
Why?

640
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,810
You are an impostor

641
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,730
and your marriage contract is also fake?

642
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,490
It doesn't look fake.

643
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,330
Are you engaged to the Ning family?

644
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,490
Yes.

645
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,490
You should have taken out the marriage contract earlier

646
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,850
so as to avoid misunderstandings on the part of the family members.

647
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,250
My family is not what it used to be after the unforeseen misfortunes.

648
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,210
The marriage contract

649
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,210
was signed before.

650
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,250
I don't know whether it's still valid now or not.

651
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,930
I don't think it counts as a proof.

652
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,010
You underestimate the Ning family a lot.

653
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,170
Mr. Ning

654
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,010
has a noble reputation

655
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,770
as a man of integrity.

656
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,570
Since it is a marriage contract signed by the elder members of both families,

657
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,570
the engagement is still there

658
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,930
while the people are not.

659
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:24,810
I'll take you

660
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,770
to visit his family some other day

661
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,180
and get to know him.

662
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,460
Grandma,

663
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,980
we don't have to do it so soon.

664
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,460
That's settled then.

665
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,820
Have dinner.

666
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,580
Zhenzhen,

667
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,940
try this fried whitefish in rice wine,

668
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,940
a signature dish of Zezhou.

669
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,020
You can't get to taste it elsewhere.

670
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,100
Thank you, grandma.

671
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,020
Jun Zhenzhen!

672
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Pack up your stuff

673
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,060
and go back to Runan!

674
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,940
You are not welcome in our Fang family.

675
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,100
What happened, Jinxiu?

676
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,860
Grandma is taken ill with anger

677
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,220
because of your marriage.

678
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:10,860
What?

679
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,540
Stop being a hypocrite.

680
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,300
Didn't you go to grandma's room last night

681
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,020
and urge her to go to the Ning family today?

682
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:17,760
I…

683
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,780
I indeed went to grand…

684
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,780
No need to explain.

685
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,940
Nobody wants to listen.

686
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,580
For the sake of your damn marriage,

687
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,700
grandma was taunted by the mother and daughter of the Ning family

688
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,020
to the point of having a heart pain

689
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,340
and almost passed out when she came back.

690
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,060
If you still have a sense of shame,

691
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,540
pack up your stuff now

692
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,340
and piss off at once!

693
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,540
Be quick to change the water.

694
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,180
Don't go in.

695
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,260
How much more anger do you want to make grandma feel?

696
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,940
Are you done gawking?

697
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,260
Get out of here when you are.

698
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,100
Don't be an eyesore here.

699
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,020
Doctor,

700
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,780
how is she doing?

701
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,180
Judging from her pulse condition,

702
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,580
the old lady is stricken by pent-up anxiety.

703
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,300
Grandma has an anxiety-induced illness

704
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,700
which has to be cured with a mental treatment.

705
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,820
Mrs. Ning.

706
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,780
Take a seat.

707
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,420
The old lady of your family has been here this morning.

708
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,500
Are you here for the same thing?

709
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,420
Exactly.

710
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,960
Liu'er.

711
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,500
It's not that

712
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
I don't acknowledge this marriage contract.

713
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,820
It's just that my father-in-law

714
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,620
had never mentioned this matter.

715
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,820
Besides,

716
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,860
since the old gentleman has already passed away,

717
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,340
your one-sided story

718
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,660
can hardly convince me.

719
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,900
That you didn't know it

720
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,020
doesn't mean there's no such thing.

721
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,500
This marriage contract bears

722
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,940
the old gentleman's signature in black and white.

723
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
This can't be wrong, right?

724
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,940
It is a marriage bond,

725
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,220
not a feud.

726
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,980
Sometimes you can't get things done only with tricks.

727
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,940
Even if you get what you want for a while,

728
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,380
you'll have a hard time for the rest of your life.

729
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,660
Such being the case,

730
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,340
how are you going to

731
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,020
take back the marriage contract

732
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,620
and make me call off the engagement?

733
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,380
Miss Jun,

734
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,820
as I said,

735
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
my father-in-law had never mentioned this.

736
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,660
Not even the life-saving grace?

737
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,300
That shouldn't be the way the old gentleman usually behaved.

738
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,080
You…

739
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,260
I heard your family

740
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,460
has been medical practitioners in this place for generations.

741
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,060
Your family must have saved countless lives.

742
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,540
I wonder how many marriage pledges you've got

743
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,380
in return for your life-saving grace.

744
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,420
When people of our Jun family treat illnesses and save lives,

745
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,700
we take money if the patients have some,

746
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,140
and dispense with it if they don't.

747
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,900
This is the obligation of a doctor.

748
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,780
But for people who get the treatment,

749
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,980
it is their obligation to pay money if they have some

750
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,660
and pay respects if they don't.

751
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,220
This is also their obligation.

752
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,340
Yes.

753
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,500
The payers should pay money

754
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,620
and the collectors should collect money.

755
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,980
But the marriage of other people's child

756
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,740
must not be your bargaining chip.

757
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,980
That concerns a person's fate of a lifetime.

758
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,020
But the old gentleman didn't pay money.

759
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,980
Nonsense!

760
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,740
My grandpa was not such kind of man!

761
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,740
Back then, the old gentleman said he'd go home to get money,

762
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,380
but my grandpa refused repeatedly.

763
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,460
But the old gentleman didn't want to lose face

764
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,660
and owe others a favor,

765
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,740
so he decided to arrange this engagement on the spot.

766
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,900
Mrs. Ning,

767
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,700
if you acknowledge this engagement,

768
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,460
it is a marriage contract;

769
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,820
if you don't,

770
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,460
then it is an IOU.

771
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,940
What do you mean?

772
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,380
If you pay the life-saving money,

773
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,060
I'll take the marriage contract back

774
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,140
and we'll get even with each other.

775
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,020
Mother,

776
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,060
give her the money,

777
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,620
send her away and let her piss off!

778
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,340
Enough.

779
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,260
Get out.

780
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,940
Mother!

781
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,780
Get out!

782
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,960
Do you feel much aggrieved, Miss Jun?

783
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,880
Don't you also feel much aggrieved, Mrs. Ning?

784
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,080
Yes.

785
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
I put in painstaking care

786
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,800
to raise my son like a treasure,

787
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,320
only to have him suddenly bitten by a vicious dog.

788
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,760
That beast

789
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,120
has no human sympathy,

790
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,640
and I can neither beat nor scold it.

791
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,480
If I do beat or scold it,

792
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,120
I'll be labeled as ungenerous.

793
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,040
How aggrieved and distressed I am!

794
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,640
But as a mother,

795
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,720
I can lump it

796
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
when such a thing happens to me.

797
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,840
But when it happens to my children,

798
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,880
I cannot.

799
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,520
Miss Jun,

800
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,720
for you, this marriage

801
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,920
will give you a higher social position and a life of wealth.

802
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,320
We are a family of good Samaritans,

803
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,200
but helping you improve your lot

804
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,800
both aggrieves and disgusts me.

805
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,560
Mrs. Ning,

806
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,520
being a good Samaritan is also a tradition that runs in my Jun family.

807
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,360
Whether it is roadside beggars

808
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,480
or disaster victims who come to our door,

809
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,040
we've always treated illnesses and saved lives

810
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,960
while asking for nothing in return.

811
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,520
Back then, the old gentleman

812
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,080
could have just said he had no money.

813
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,640
But signing a marriage contract

814
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,200
which makes us as wicked people now

815
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,600
also aggrieves

816
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
and disgust us.

817
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,600
Some things can change,

818
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,400
but some can't.

819
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,880
Like one's fate.

820
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,640
Some people were born a lowlife

821
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,600
and they can't have a life of wealth

822
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,040
by marrying up.

823
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,320
As far as I remember, the Ning family

824
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,000
bought its first official rank, didn't it?

825
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,720
How did you know?

826
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,600
You bought off people in high and low positions

827
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,920
and latched onto the prefecture's education officer.

828
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,720
Right?

829
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,440
No need to panic, Mrs. Ning.

830
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,680
I'm not going to spread the history of how your family got rich.

831
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,680
I just want to tell you

832
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,280
there are many things in the world

833
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,760
that can indeed be done with money.

834
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,360
Back then, your Ning family bought an official rank

835
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,920
to get rid of its low social class.

836
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,120
Now won't it be the same thing for you

837
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,760
to buy this marriage contract

838
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:49,920
to get rid of a bad reputation?

839
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,480
You…

840
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,320
What's more,

841
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,600
2,000 taels of silver will be enough.

842
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,600
You are a good bean counter, Miss Jun.

843
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,280
I'm flattered, madam.

844
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,840
This is a good deal.

845
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,920
Go.

846
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,200
Bring 2,000 taels.

847
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,680
Wait a moment.

848
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,640
2,000 taels was the price just now.

849
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,800
Now it's different.

850
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,080
5,000 taels.

851
