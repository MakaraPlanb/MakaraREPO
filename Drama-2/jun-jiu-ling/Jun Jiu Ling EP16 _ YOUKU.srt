00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,220
♫Swords tell all the scars, and I sigh for fleeting life♫

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,500
♫Once we meet, how can I like to be apart?♫

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,380
♫Walking alone with cold in heart, I deep hide the past♫

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,420
♫I keep love and hatred deep in heart, naive no more♫

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,700
♫My memories roll when I see you again♫

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,020
♫I only dare to be gentle in my dream♫

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,900
♫This kiss is boiling with your complex♫

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Intimacy has disturbed the stars♫

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,220
♫Take art of healing as a weapon to guard the homeland♫

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,740
♫I'm not swallowed by sorrow and hatred♫

Episode 16

17
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,490
Fang Mansion

18
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,790
Baicao Drugstore

19
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,330
Jiuling Drugstore

20
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:19,450
Jiuling Drugstore

21
00:35:37,130 --> 00:02:08,960
Jiuling Drugstore

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,190
Is Dr. Jun here?

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,910
Our madam asked Dr. Jun

24
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,270
for a home visit.

25
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,000
Your madam's illness is nothing serious.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
This prescription is correct.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,110
She is supposed to keep taking it for a few more days.

28
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,320
Dr. Jun,

29
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,750
you'd better go and have a look.

30
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,880
Why don't you understand?

31
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,270
According to

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,630
what our lady said,

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,190
your madam will be fine

34
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,110
if she takes the medicine on time.

35
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,190
Someone.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,440
Invite Dr. Jun to our mansion.

37
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,030
What are you doing?

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,670
Dr. Jun,

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,520
the situation is urgent.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,910
Madam's illness cannot be delayed.

41
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,800
Please see

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,830
if there is any serious problem in person.

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,960
Dr. Jun,

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,750
please.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,550
Fine.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,000
Liu'er,

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,470
get the medicine box and let's go.

48
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,800
Don't worry,

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
we'll be right back.

50
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,320
Dr. Jun,

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,080
please.

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,190
Who exactly are these people?

53
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,110
Why are they so aggressive?

54
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,110
Maybe it's just an ordinary visit.

55
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,000
If she hasn't come back

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,750
after two hours,

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,030
let's ask His Lordship for help.

58
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,630
OK.

59
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,830
Dr. Jun,

60
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,520
come with me.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,520
Please.

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,600
Third Madame,

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Dr. Jun is here.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,190
Dr. Jun,

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,160
our master

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,800
likes our madam's voice best.

67
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,520
But she has been dumb for several days.

68
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,390
See if

69
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,600
there's any good way

70
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,630
to make her get well soon.

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,320
Come here.

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Madam, please.

73
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,320
How is it,

74
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,390
Dr. Jun?

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,790
You needn't worry about it.

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,320
It's just

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,350
a dumb voice caused by

78
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,440
common dryness fire and heat.

79
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,480
You just need to rest for a few days.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,600
You don't have to spend so much money.

81
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,670
It's nothing.

82
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,600
I just want to make a sound as soon as possible.

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,160
She can make a sound

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,830
soon after taking this medicine with warm water.

85
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,070
OK.

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,390
Madam.

87
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,920
How are you,

88
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,920
madam?

89
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,720
What's wrong?

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Dr. Jun,

91
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,790
your medicine won't harm her throat, will it?

92
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,950
Why can't our madam even make a sound

93
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,350
after drinking it?

94
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,670
It's OK.

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,920
Just wait a moment.

96
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,760
OK.

97
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,350
Madam.

98
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,830
Madam.

99
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,760
Nanny Huang.

100
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,920
Madam,

101
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,920
you can speak.

102
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,830
Nanny Huang.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,110
Nanny…

104
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,110
Huang.

105
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,390
I can speak.

106
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,640
My voice is all right.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes.

108
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,830
You're fine. Nanny Huang.

109
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,070
Nanny Huang.

110
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,070
Nanny Huang.

111
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,670
Why is her voice

112
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,600
so similar to

113
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,480
my former voice?

114
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,320
I can speak.

115
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,270
Great.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,640
Yunqi,

117
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,510
here you are.

118
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,720
Yunqi.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,920
Your voice is fine.

120
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,950
Call my name.

121
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,040
Yunqi.

122
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,350
Wrong.

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,200
Again.

124
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,110
Yunqi.

125
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,550
Again.

126
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
Yunqi.

127
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,600
Yunqi.

128
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,760
Yunqi.

129
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,270
Wrong.

130
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,600
She wouldn't call me in such a charming voice.

131
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,480
Be natural.

132
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,720
Yunqi.

133
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,270
Yunqi.

134
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,390
I heard

135
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,390
you like Cao's snacks,

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,510
so

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,950
I bought some specially.

138
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,950
But

139
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,550
they opened the door late,

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,600
and I was afraid that

141
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,950
the food they made by force

142
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,390
was not delicious,

143
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,720
so I waited

144
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,270
four more hours.

145
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,230
You won't be angry with me

146
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,920
for coming so late, will you?

147
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,920
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

148
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,830
We are

149
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,480
going to be married soon.

150
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,670
In fact,

151
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
we shouldn't be so distant.

152
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,350
How about

153
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,440
calling me Yunqi?

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,640
Yunqi.

155
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
Yunqi.

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,670
Yunqi.

157
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,270
Who is she?

158
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,270
This is Dr. Jun.

159
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,720
She cured

160
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,790
my voice.

161
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,920
Are you Jun Jiuling?

162
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,160
Yes,

163
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,480
I'm Jun Jiuling.

164
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,720
Go on.

165
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,350
Yunqi.

166
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Yunqi.

167
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,880
Yunqi.

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,440
Yunqi.

169
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,230
Yunqi.

170
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,350
Yunqi.

171
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,790
Why did you change your name?

172
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,790
Runan Jiuling Drugstore is the ancestral property of my family,

173
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,070
so I named myself so.

174
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,670
Nanny Huang,

175
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,080
go and bring 1,000 taels of silver

176
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,230
for Dr. Jun.

177
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
1,000 taels.

178
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,760
It should be 1,000 taels for diagnosis

179
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,709
and 1,000 taels for medicine.

180
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,670
Give her 10,000 taels.

181
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,000
Well…

182
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
Third Madame, please stay.

183
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,110
Thank you.

184
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,280
But

185
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,230
I'll take

186
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,230
as much as it should be.

187
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,590
Go.

188
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,280
Yes.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,960
2,000 taels of silver.

190
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,470
The rest of the money

191
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,110
is for you to change the name of Jiuling Drugstore.

192
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,550
Your Excellency,

193
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,030
Jiuling Drugstore

194
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,470
has been handed down for a hundred years.

195
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,760
If I change its name now…

196
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,590
So what?

197
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,000
Take the money

198
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,150
and change the name.

199
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,880
And

200
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,960
your name

201
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,080
needs to be changed, too.

202
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,230
So this is Lu Yunqi's private house.

203
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,400
He actually…

204
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,840
It's pathetic to think about Her Highness Princess Jiuli.

205
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,520
She is a princess. So what?

206
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,230
Her husband keeps a woman in his private house,

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,840
and makes it known to everyone.

208
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,840
Stop it. Come on.

209
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,910
Your Ladyship, are you OK?

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,590
Your Ladyship.

211
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,110
Your Ladyship.

212
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm fine.

213
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,470
It turns out that Third Madame

214
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,640
is the woman raised by Lu Yunqi in his private house.

215
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,000
I didn't expect

216
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,910
my sister to live such a life.

217
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,280
Does she know this?

218
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,840
I'm not there.

219
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,790
Who can she talk to

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
about these sufferings?

221
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,640
He is ill.

222
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,150
He must be ill.

223
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,350
The woman he raises

224
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,350
is just the shadow of Chu Jiuling

225
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,590
with only a similar voice.

226
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,960
What does he mean by doing this?

227
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,910
He likes me?

228
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,790
Chu Rang married me to Lu Yunqi.

229
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,790
I thought he deliberately humiliated me.

230
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,470
Didn't

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,910
he?

232
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,000
It's disgusting to be liked

233
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,840
by such a man.

234
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
Your Ladyship, are you okay?

235
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,150
Don't,

236
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,670
don't scare me.

237
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm fine.

238
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm fine.

239
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,590
Let's go.

240
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,710
Jiuling,

241
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,840
all the Mid-Autumn Festival gifts prepared at home

242
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,470
have been sent.

243
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,640
OK.

244
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,470
You have been in a bad mood

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
since your home visit.

246
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,200
Here is different from Zezhou.

247
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,640
Did anything happen to you?

248
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,440
No.

249
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,910
You can say it if you like.

250
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,640
It's okay if you don't want to.

251
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,840
It's all over.

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,110
I haven't had time to ask you.

253
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,710
Are you used to living here?

254
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,790
Yes, it's pretty good.

255
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,670
Were you worried when I wrote to

256
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,150
ask you to come?

257
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,880
Don't you know

258
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,670
if I was worried?

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
If you were worried,

260
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,960
you wouldn't have come to help me.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,640
Miss Fang.

262
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,200
Childe Ning.

263
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,150
I studied behind closed doors recently,

264
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,840
so I didn't know that you had come to the capital city.

265
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,590
You came to her again?

266
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,350
Yes.

267
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,320
Miss Jun.

268
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,910
Childe Ning.

269
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Childe Ning,

270
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,760
what can I do for you?

271
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,550
I have something

272
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,710
to say to you.

273
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,350
The teahouse happens to have new tea.

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,760
Is it convenient for you,

275
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,350
Miss Jun?

276
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,710
We sent a load of things.

277
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,520
I wonder if Jiuling got it or not.

278
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,110
Sooner or later

279
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,230
she'll get it.

280
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,640
Grandma,

281
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,640
it's different

282
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,440
one day early

283
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,230
or one day late.

284
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,880
What's the difference?

285
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,030
Tell me about it.

286
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,590
For example,

287
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,350
if the fish arrives one day earlier,

288
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,840
it will be fresher than one day later.

289
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,840
It is true that one's early action

290
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,350
is more useful than late action.

291
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,880
Chengyu,

292
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,590
there are fish in your gift,

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,880
huh?

294
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,590
Yes.

295
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,910
Jiuling likes to eat fried pickled blanquillo from Zezhou.

296
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,030
This dish 

297
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,110
isn't delicious without the water of the local Yanghu Lake.

298
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,760
When can Chengyu

299
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,880
pay so much attention

300
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,400
to us?

301
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,880
Zhenzhen likes fried pickled blanquillo.

302
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,000
So it appears

303
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,030
on the dining table of Jiuling Drugstore.

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,710
But

305
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm afraid

306
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,840
the fish will be dead and not fresh

307
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,080
on the way.

308
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,440
No way. No way.

309
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,080
I specially prepared a bucket of water from the Yanghu Lake.

310
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,200
I told them

311
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,640
to change the water carefully all the way.

312
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,760
In this way,

313
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm sure the fish will be still alive

314
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,350
when arriving in the capital city.

315
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,590
The fried fish

316
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,440
must exactly 

317
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,710
like the fish she had eaten

318
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,590
in our house.

319
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,670
He said

320
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,000
he understood,

321
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,080
but he still has

322
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,710
deep feelings for Jiuling in his heart.

323
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,400
Grandma,

324
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,000
mother,

325
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,440
let's have this dish

326
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,470
for dinner today.

327
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,910
Maybe the gifts

328
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,880
will arrive in

329
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,320
the capital city tonight.

330
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,710
So

331
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,440
we can

332
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,200
have the same dish

333
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
with Jiuling.

334
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,910
OK.

335
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,790
The fish sent to the capital city

336
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,520
is more delicious.

337
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,710
Miss Jun, please.

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,840
Sure enough, good tea.

339
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,400
Childe Ning, don't you have something to ask me?

340
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,200
This is the first time

341
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
I have done such a thing.

342
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,350
I don't know if that's good

343
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,350
and if that's right.

344
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,000
Go ahead.

345
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,710
Would you like to 

346
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,400
watch the lanterns with me on the 15th day?

347
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,280
All right.

348
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,710
I planned to go, too.

349
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,710
We can just

350
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,910
have dinner together

351
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,280
and then

352
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,000
go together.

353
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,230
I mean,

354
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,280
Miss Jun,

355
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,280
would you like to 

356
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
watch the lantern with me alone?

357
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,110
Childe Ning,

358
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,520
I thought we had made it clear

359
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,400
the last time I gave you pears.

360
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,110
At that time,

361
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,000
I really

362
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,960
appreciated you.

363
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,400
I fully understood

364
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,550
your gift of pears.

365
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,230
Therefore, after I learned that you were married to the Fang family,

366
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,280
I really gave up on you.

367
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,350
But after I saw you again in the capital city,

368
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,110
I learned that you set up

369
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,590
such a thrilling elaborate trap

370
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,470
in Zezhou and Runan,

371
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,030
that your engagement is false

372
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,760
and that you are still unmarried.

373
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,230
Miss Jun.

374
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,280
it's a lie to say

375
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm unmoved.

376
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,470
Childe Ning,

377
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,190
our engagement is over.

378
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,760
Let's be

379
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,710
done with the past.

380
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,519
Some words…

381
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,070
Miss Jun,

382
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,950
let me finish,

383
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,230
will you?

384
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,190
I've been thinking about it

385
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,559
for nearly a month.

386
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,310
It took me only three days

387
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,830
to study the most difficult scriptures.

388
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,640
But it took me

389
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,590
seven days to study

390
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,640
whether I like you.

391
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,560
After studying,

392
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm sure I have feelings for you.

393
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,070
I know my decision,

394
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,920
but I can't guess what you think.

395
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
Since I can't guess,

396
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,540
♫The wind and rain chill the night.♫

397
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,900
♫In lonely and cold autumn, the dream lasts long.♫

398
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,380
♫Beams of moonlight♫

399
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,180
♫shine beside me.♫

400
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,060
♫I'm not afraid of the long and arduous journey.♫

401
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,980
♫Tormented by lovesickness, we still need to move on.♫

402
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:28,780
♫Beside the window who is dressing up?♫

403
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,940
♫I will always remember♫

404
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,980
♫those old days and beautiful memories.♫

405
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:42,740
♫Don't be afraid to spend years in love and hate.♫

406
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,540
♫The human world is cold,♫

407
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,060
♫where partings and reunions are common.♫

408
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,980
♫The past story♫

409
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,660
♫is like a dream in the old times.♫

410
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,340
♫Turning back and looking at each other,♫

411
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,620
♫we find that life is pretty long.♫

412
00:19:03,620 --> 00:17:49,160
♫Don't forget what I used to be.♫

413
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,350
I'll just ask you.

414
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,160
Miss Jun,

415
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,430
you don't have to answer my question now.

416
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,560
There are two days and one night

417
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,640
before the night of the 15th day.

418
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,470
You can think about it.

419
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,640
No,

420
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,880
I can answer you now.

421
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,680
I appreciate your invitation,

422
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,640
but I'm sorry.

423
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,350
Could you

424
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,590
tell me why?

425
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm not right for you.

426
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,190
Moreover, I don't consider marriage now.

427
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,640
The first sentence

428
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,160
is an external reason.

429
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,950
The second one

430
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,680
is to follow your heart.

431
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,710
The answer is as straight

432
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
as your chess style.

433
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,190
Did you

434
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,760
look for patients before?

435
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,160
You knew it?

436
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,950
So I came here today

437
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,470
to thank you

438
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,190
with tea.

439
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,560
Zhu Zan.

440
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,520
Why are you here?

441
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,430
I didn't follow you.

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,710
I say it in all honesty.

443
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,000
Zhang Baotang chose the time and place.

444
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,590
Where are they?

445
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,950
They are buying dried meat slices next door.

446
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,350
The dried meat slices next door are the best in the capital city.

447
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,230
What are you two doing here?

448
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,190
I asked Miss Jun to watch the lanterns with me

449
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,070
on the night of the 15th day,

450
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,190
but she refused.

451
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,280
Then I'll take my leave.

452
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,830
You refused to watch the lanterns with him.

453
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,160
How about watching lanterns

454
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,920
with me?

455
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,160
OK.

456
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
You're not serious.

457
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,640
Why am I not serious when you ask me to watch the lanterns?

458
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,710
You're

459
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,160
a little shameless.

460
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,190
Would you like to sit down?

461
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,880
Childe Ning is different from you

462
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,110
in asking me to watch lanterns

463
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,190
alone.

464
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,110
What's the difference?

465
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,710
He has another intention.

466
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,070
You're not like him,

467
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,680
are you?

468
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,800
Certainly not.

469
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,800
So I can say yes

470
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,880
to your invitation.

471
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,400
Young Master,

472
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,350
did Miss Jun promise to watch the lanterns with you?

473
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,070
15th day is the day of reunion.

474
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,190
She naturally wants to accompany her family.

475
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,400
Shall we go home now?

476
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,350
No,

477
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,520
let's go to the Imperial Academy to review the book.

478
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,070
What's the prize this year?

479
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,680
I know only ancient chess games,

480
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,520
but they are solved already.

481
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,560
I won't expose you this time.

482
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,310
But I'll split

483
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,710
the prize in half.

484
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,190
Can we just get down to business?

485
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,070
Is there any progress on what we talked about

486
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,880
last time?

487
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,920
The change of Imperial Doctor Sun to Imperial Doctor Jiang

488
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,430
-may be… -Zan.

489
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,680
Zan,

490
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,230
taste this.

491
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,680
Miss Jun is here, too.

492
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,710
Zan,

493
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,040
you have an appointment.

494
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,800
She came uninvited.

495
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
It has nothing to do with me.

496
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,520
Your Ladyship,

497
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,400
something happened.

498
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,280
Last time you said Dr. Feng was the best doctor of bone setting in the capital city.

499
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,040
Someone came to him for treatment, but something went wrong.

500
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Now they are clamoring for an explanation

501
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,950
in Baicao Drugstore.

502
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,880
Let's go.

503
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,400
Zan,

504
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,350
aren't you going with her?

505
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
She always makes trouble.

506
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
I'm busy,

507
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,760
OK?

508
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,000
Zan…

509
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,760
Let's go and have a look, too.

510
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,590
Baotang,

511
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,160
did you forget what happened in the rotisserie last time?

512
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,400
Sit still

513
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
and wait for him to come back.

514
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,070
Yes.

515
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,590
I must smash Baicao Drugstore.

516
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
Look what you have done to my buddy.

517
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,800
He can't even walk.

518
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,830
Can a broken leg

519
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,230
be cured in just a few days?

520
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,430
Only gods can do that.

521
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,520
You shouldn't see a doctor,

522
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,280
but an immortal.

523
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,070
Yeah.

524
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,310
In just a few days?

525
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,110
It has been a long time.

526
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,430
If Miss Jun didn't say

527
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,880
you were the best doctor of bone setting in the capital city,

528
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
-we wouldn't have come to you. -Excuse me.

529
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,000
OK. OK. OK.

530
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,920
Take it easy, everyone.

531
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,880
Calm down.

532
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,830
Miss Jun,

533
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,640
it was also your fault.

534
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,350
Yes.

535
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,350
Can I see his wound first?

536
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,000
Please

537
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,880
have a look.

538
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,520
Hold on.

539
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,760
Do you feel it?

540
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,000
Miss Jun,

541
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,590
how is it?

542
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,560
Is the bone not set?

543
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,560
Are you kidding me?

544
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,070
I've been practicing medicine for half my life.

545
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,430
Can't I even set this bone?

546
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,680
Dr. Feng did a good job.

547
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,920
Your friend's leg wound

548
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,280
healed well.

549
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,560
Why does my buddy

550
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,800
still hurt so much?

551
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,160
Dr. Feng,

552
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,160
would you please show me

553
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,070
your technique of bone setting again?

554
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,350
I'll see if it's the same as mine.

555
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,560
Bear it.

556
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,520
OK.

557
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,040
Let me show my slight skill.

558
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,470
Sorry to bother you.

559
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,920
Bear it.

560
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,880
Bear it.

561
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,710
Easy does it.

562
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,070
Bear it.

563
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,920
The first step is to explore.

564
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,560
The second step is to press.

565
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,880
The third step

566
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,230
is supposed to massage here, right?

567
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,000
What's the matter?

568
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,070
What happened?

569
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,520
Why is the bone here still broken?

570
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,920
I did set it.

571
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,760
Speak.

572
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,470
Cat got your tongue?

573
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,280
Pain is a good thing.

574
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,160
This shows that

575
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,800
his wound is healing.

576
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,070
There is a record in the "Collection of Dong's Medical Records" that

577
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,350
a kind of bone injury is healed and then cracked.

578
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,680
This is

579
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
the case of his leg injury.

580
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,950
Yes.

581
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Sir,

582
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,880
your friend's wound

583
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,230
will heal in a few days.

584
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,470
Don't worry.

585
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,190
Bro,

586
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,470
how are you feeling now?

587
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,350
Much better.

588
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,680
It doesn't hurt so much anymore.

589
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,110
Thank you, Miss Jun.

590
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,640
Thank you, Dr. Feng.

591
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,760
Dr. Feng, I'm really sorry.

592
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,230
I have only such a good buddy.

593
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,920
Today I was ill-tempered

594
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,160
and smashed your drugstore.

595
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,280
I will make an apology someday.

596
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,920
I'll pay you no matter how much it is.

597
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,110
Sorry.

598
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,560
Thank you, Miss Jun.

599
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
-Thank you. Thank you. -Come on.

600
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,470
Thank you.

601
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,710
Go.

602
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,230
Miss Jun.

603
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,350
Dr. Feng, don't do this.

604
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,350
Miss Jun.

605
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,520
Leave.

606
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Today, thanks to your timely discovery,

607
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,830
otherwise

608
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,880
his leg

609
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,110
would be completely crippled.

610
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,880
You cured him yourself.

611
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,800
It has nothing to do with me.

612
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,590
Then I'll leave.

613
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,950
Your Ladyship,

614
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,880
go back yourself.

615
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,000
I have to go to Deshengchang

616
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,230
to ask Shopkeeper Liu about something.

617
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,110
OK.

618
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,680
Go.

619
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,040
No bad. No bad.

620
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,800
You're so idle.

621
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,640
I was afraid the Imperial Academy of Medicine caused some trouble

622
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,590
and you couldn't handle it.

623
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,280
Replacing Jiang Youshu

624
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,520
is more troublesome than I thought.

625
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,950
Is he unwilling

626
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,110
or Imperial Doctor Sun unwilling?

627
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,640
It was His Majesty who appointed him

628
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,710
to treat His Highness Prince Huai

629
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,950
and said he has excellent medical skills.

630
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,680
Jiang Youshu,

631
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,230
judging the situation,

632
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,640
naturally knows 

633
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,710
how to handle it for His Majesty.

634
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,680
I find one more thing strange.

635
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,280
What is it?

636
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,710
Why did Lu Yunqi

637
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,800
want to change

638
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,920
the imperial doctor too?

639
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,680
Although

640
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,830
at last he knew it was his Majesty's instruction

641
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,040
and gave up.

642
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,950
Don't you think it's weird?

643
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,800
He must be able to see why.

644
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,400
Why did he violate His Majesty's instruction

645
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,000
and secretly investigate what happened?

646
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,190
Maybe it's because of Her Highness Princess Jiuling.

647
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,310
I don't think so.

648
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,070
If he really cared about Jiuling,

649
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,000
he wouldn't raise a woman outside.

650
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,880
It doesn't conform to common sense.

651
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,560
Anyway, I have asked Sanbing

652
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,110
to keep an eye on Lu Yunqi secretly.

653
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,560
I will never let him

654
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,470
do anything out of line.

655
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,110
Pay the money quickly.

656
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,190
Don't push my mother.

657
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,560
How dare you challenge me!

658
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,880
Sir,

659
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,040
he's just a child.

660
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,190
Don't take him seriously.

661
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,430
I'll make up for

662
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,800
last month's tax soon.

663
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,590
Let me sell the oranges today.

664
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,310
Go to hell!

665
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,070
Sir.

666
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,040
How dare you make money on the street

667
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,520
without paying me the tax?

668
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,000
Daydreaming. Let me sell the oranges.

669
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
I'll make it up to you.

670
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,800
It's none of your business.

671
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,760
-Are you OK? -I'll

672
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,680
teach you a lesson.

673
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,110
What a great official!

674
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,640
Let me see

675
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,950
how you will teach me a lesson.

676
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,880
Your Lordship.

677
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
I dare not.

678
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,760
You dare not?

679
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,760
But you showed

680
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,710
a different attitude to them just now.

681
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,040
They owe two months' tax money

682
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,430
and still want to do business on the street.

683
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,350
This is against the rules.

684
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,520
I can't explain to other merchants.

685
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,640
Even so,

686
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,310
you were so rude.

687
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,950
They are just a woman and a kid.

688
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,590
How can they match your brute strength?

689
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,640
Who are you?

690
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,350
I…

691
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,590
I…

692
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,350
Your Lordship. Your Lordship.

693
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,160
I was wrong. I was wrong.

694
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,310
Get out of here.

695
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,680
OK. OK.

696
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,230
Get out of the way.

697
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,040
Get out of the way.

698
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,710
Your Lordship, you're awesome.

699
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,680
So discerning at a young age.

700
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,760
Thank His Lordship.

701
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,590
Thank the lady.

702
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,760
Thank you, Your Lordship.

703
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,040
-Thank you, miss. -Not at all.

704
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,430
Come on.

705
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,350
Come on.

706
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,800
Madam,

707
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,680
has business been bad lately?

708
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,230
I remember that

709
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,230
before, the tax standard

710
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,470
for small businesses going from street to street

711
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,920
was not high.

712
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,590
I'm afraid you don't know that

713
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,190
the standard has long been changed.

714
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,470
You're talking about the system of the late emperor.

715
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,920
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

716
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,560
the Ministry of Revenue has reduced the tax,

717
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,680
but in fact,

718
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,350
there are three more taxes.

719
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,640
In this way,

720
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,710
the tax is twice

721
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,350
as much as before.

722
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,470
Thank you.

723
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,430
Thank you.

724
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,470
No,

725
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,880
This system doesn't conform to the people's wishes

726
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
and collects money everywhere.

727
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,190
I can't leave it alone.

728
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,680
What do you want to do?

729
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,590
I will write a memorial to His Majesty

730
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,230
to revise the tax standard.

731
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,800
You must be careful in this matter, Zhu Zan.

732
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,800
Although you agree with the system set by the late emperor,

733
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,000
His Majesty has only

734
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,680
modified it on this basis.

735
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,560
If you write a memorial openly,

736
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,070
you will slap His Majesty in his face.

737
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,160
You may go to prison

738
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,830
no matter whether you can make it.

739
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,920
Jun,

740
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,350
I thought you were a fair man.

741
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
I never thought

742
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,040
you also play safe.

743
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,350
It is obvious to all that

744
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,400
the system set by the late emperor is good,

745
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,920
but it is also obvious

746
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,310
which is more important

747
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,280
compared with the people

748
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,070
all over the country.

749
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,950
If you're afraid of getting into trouble,

750
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,350
just stay away.

751
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,830
Zhu Zan,

752
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,950
although the later emperor is no longer here,

753
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,710
the system he set for the people

754
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,710
is deeply rooted,

755
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,070
remembered

756
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,070
and recognized among the people.

757
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,160
The late emperor

758
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,950
is remembered by the people.

759
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,110
Why can't

760
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,520
Jiurong be cured?

761
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,520
The Imperial Academy of Medicine is useless.

762
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,830
Your Majesty, calm down.

763
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,950
His Highness Prince Huai not only has a cold.

764
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,640
His condition has been repeated for a long time.

765
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,160
Now it's really difficult to cure him.

766
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,310
Repeat?

767
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,040
That's because

768
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,710
the Imperial Academy of Medicine has poor skills.

769
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,040
It turns into a chronic disease in this case.

770
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,190
His Highness Prince Huai

771
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,520
is young and weak,

772
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,000
so it is easy for him to get sick.

773
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,830
The people in the Mansion of Prince Huai Palace are all good-for-nothings.

774
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,280
How did they take care of Prince Huai?

775
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,920
They should all be guilty.

776
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,800
Listen,

777
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,070
Prince Huai

778
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,160
is the only son of the late emperor.

779
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,590
You must do your best.

780
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
If anything happens to Prince Huai,

781
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,520
how can 

782
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,560
I face the late emperor?

783
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,470
I will do my best to heal

784
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,880
His Highness Prince Huai.

785
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,190
I didn't expect His Highness Prince Huai's illness

786
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,310
to be so difficult.

787
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,040
I'm afraid whether he can be cured

788
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,280
depends on these days.

789
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,880
I think

790
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,000
we've done everything we need to do.

791
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,280
The medicine

792
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,520
just doesn't work.

793
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,640
What can we do?

794
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,560
Every man

795
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,430
has his destiny.

796
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,590
This is His Highness Prince Huai's destiny.

797
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,160
He can't blame anyone else.

798
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
Just

799
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,830
in case.

800
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,070
No one pays attention to His Highness Prince Huai when he is alive.

801
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,000
If he dies,

802
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,520
the whole world will watch.

803
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,110
Well,

804
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,000
shall the disease be treated

805
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,880
or not?

806
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,590
Someone wants to watch him die.

807
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
I think the disease

808
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,800
can be cured,

809
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,280
but we can't treat it.

810
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,000
His Majesty is capricious.

811
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,230
To put it bluntly,

812
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,040
our lives are still

813
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,310
not secure enough.

814
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,470
We may become scapegoats in the end.

815
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,150
Well…

816
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,280
Well,

817
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,430
what should we do?

818
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,360
We can't

819
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,360
treat it

820
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,390
or not treat it.

821
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,709
This is a dead end anyway.

822
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,390
Indeed.

823
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,520
If we want not to be scapegoats,

824
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,080
His Highness Prince Huai's illness

825
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,670
must be reasonable.

826
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,909
If he suffers from any incurable disease,

827
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,630
all the people

828
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,120
can't say anything about us.

829
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,150
Right.

830
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,390
How about

831
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,190
scrofula?

832
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,559
Scrofula?

833
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,760
I'm surprised you thought of that.

834
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,040
Recently, Jiuling Drugstore has become more popular.

835
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,470
It would be great if we could take this opportunity

836
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,119
to get rid of Jiuling Drugstore.

837
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,710
Good.

838
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,360
Kill three birds with one stone.

839
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,910
Yes.

840
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,000
Great.

841
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,120
Thank you for your advice.

842
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,080
My honor.

843
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,560
I'll be on my way.

844
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,950
Take care.

845
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,120
This is not a drugstore.

846
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,430
I think it has clearly become a medical school for preaching and teaching.

847
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,840
You're exaggerated.

848
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
I'm not.

849
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,950
Including this one,

850
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,710
you've instructed five doctors all morning.

851
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,840
As the saying goes,

852
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,080
one doctor can cure only a few patients

853
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,000
while a lot of doctors can cure numerous patients.

854
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:35,950
Have you heard of it?

855
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,080
Your Ladyship,

856
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,150
you are really kindhearted and merciful.

857
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,910
Get to work.

858
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,600
Master,

859
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,710
now the doctors in the whole city

860
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
are not angry at her

861
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,040
for saying that they can  cure the patients,

862
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,520
but proud of it.

863
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,800
They even expect her

864
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
to say they can cure them,

865
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,630
because as long as she says so,

866
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,320
they can cure them.

867
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,520
Even if they really can't cure them,

868
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,190
she will give them directions

869
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
to cure them.

870
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,520
That's all?

871
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,670
Nowadays,

872
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,950
many doctors

873
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,120
will go to Jiuling Drugstore

874
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,840
to wait for her to answer questions.

875
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,670
They show a different attitude now.

876
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,190
They think

877
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,560
they have wronged Dr. Jun.

878
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,080
She neither opposes the doctors in the whole city

879
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,760
nor looks down on the common people.

880
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,840
Her act,

881
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,430
her act shows the benevolence of the doctor

882
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,760
and of the Bodhisattva.

883
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:39,840
Master,

884
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,320
if anyone provokes them

885
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
against Dr. Jun in the future,

886
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,120
no one will be fooled again.

887
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,870
Well done.

888
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,630
Get busy.

889
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,150
Yes, master.

890
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,910
The fire is too big.

891
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,000
You just eat oranges here.

892
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,280
Come and give me a hand.

893
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,950
I'm going out with Her Ladyship later.

894
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,670
I don't have time to help you.

895
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,870
Where are you going?

896
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,390
Decoct your medicine.

897
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,000
What are you doing?

898
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,120
Don't stop.

899
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,080
Jiuling said that

900
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,470
the medicine should be stirred continuously for four hours.

901
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,320
It can't be interrupted,

902
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,910
you know?

903
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,630
You can't stir it like this.

904
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,800
You have to stir in one direction,

905
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,280
you know?

906
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,280
OK. OK. OK.

907
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,150
Got it.

908
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,560
Add this herb when it's sticky.

909
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,230
OK.

910
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,800
What are you laughing at?

911
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,230
I laugh at your fear of Her ladyship Jinxiu.

912
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm not afraid of her.

913
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,360
She was, after all, Miss Fang.

914
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,040
Now she is a bookkeeper of Jiuling Drugstore.

915
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,430
I just respect her.

916
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,360
Whatever.

917
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,560
How is it?

918
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,120
Your Ladyship.

919
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,760
Your Ladyship.

920
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,120
This is how it turned out, huh?

921
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,040
Yes, Your Excellency.

922
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,360
The story has now

923
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,470
spread all over the capital city.

924
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,360
They say Miss Jun

925
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,710
is a teacher

926
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,520
and living Bodhisattva.

927
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,390
This is going to be difficult.

928
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,910
It seems that

929
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,910
it's hard for Imperial Doctor Jiang to incite those doctors again.

930
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,760
She hasn't changed her name yet, huh?

931
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,800
No, Your Excellency.

932
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,040
Although some people have changed their minds about her,

933
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,520
some doctors haven't.

934
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm going to have some more people

935
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,000
continue to visit Jiuling Drugstore.

936
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,760
No need.

937
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,840
Let's solve it quickly.

938
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:54,950
Yes.

939
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,910
Dr. Jun.

940
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,230
Dr. Jun.

941
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,600
Dr. Jun.

942
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,390
Oh, dear.

943
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,150
There are a lot of people from Arm Moral Department out there.

944
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,600
People from Arm Moral Department?

945
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,000
It's not their first time here.

946
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,710
What happened?

947
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,040
They ask Her Ladyship for a home visit again?

948
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,670
No.

949
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,150
Well…

950
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,190
Well…

951
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,080
Well…

952
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,280
Did His Excellency Lu come in person?

953
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,560
Yes.

954
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,840
He finally came.

955
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,870
Whether it is a blessing or a curse,

956
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,840
it can't be avoided.

957
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,280
Let's go to see.

958
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,430
Miss Jun.

959
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,470
This…

960
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,360
Your Excellency Lu, what do you want to do?

961
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,910
You know it.

962
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,120
I can't comply with

963
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,040
your previous orders.

964
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,560
You can't?

965
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,390
Why did you promise me?

966
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,870
I didn't dare not to refuse.

967
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,040
You were paid for it.

968
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,710
At that time, I didn't dare not take the money,

969
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,280
and later I didn't dare to return it.

970
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,190
You didn't

971
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,950
dare?

972
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,080
But you dare not to keep your word.

973
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,670
You take the money and don't do anything.

974
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,000
I think

975
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,360
you are so brave.

976
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,360
I ask you again.

977
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,230
Rename it

978
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,280
or not.

979
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,110
♫Outline in my dream♫

980
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,550

981
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:58,750

♫Any clues?♫

1019
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,750

♫You take me as a stranger when we finally meet again♫

1022
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:31,790
♫Tears well up in my eyes♫
