There was a hiking pole next to the cliff.

370
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,790
Someone must have tricked the man
with it and pushed him from behind.

371
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,230
You mean Se-wook killed all these people?

372

I think Se-wook...

That fire from the storage.

375
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,540
Someone trapped us in there
and set fire on purpose.

376

Did you tell the police?

377
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,070
I did, but there was no evidence.

378
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,890
They checked the storage building,
but the door wasn't locked.

379
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,540
And there was no sign of arson.

380

I went to see Se-wook before he died.

384
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,430
I asked him about the yogurt
and potato bombs,

385
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,110
which caught him off guard.

386
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,770
He thought I knew something.

393

We can catch the murderer then.

408

Even if we fail, we'll find evidence

541
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,350
I'm serious.

542
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,950
Mr. Jang who died in
Mujin Valley three months ago

543
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,670
also told me before he died

544
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,400
that he saw a man in a bloody uniform.

545
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,700
It's not just him.

546
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,010
Gi-yeong, who died in Oerae Valley,

547
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,460
came for the first time in a while.
He also said he saw that man.

548
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,910
And Mr. Hwang, who nearly died in
Jeonmukgol because the rope broke,

549
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,800
saw him, too.

550
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,790
I saw a guy with a ranger's uniform.

551
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,010
His hands and clothes
were covered in blood.

552
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,890
You were in an accident in Jeonmukgol?

553
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,480
It was the road I took every day,
but the rope broke and I nearly died.

554
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,260
If it weren't for the hiker passing by,
I would have died.

555
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,210
I heard you saw a man in a uniform
before the accident.

556
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,180
Was it him?

557
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,340
Who is this?

558
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,890
Do you know him?

559
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,320
Did you see this man?

560
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,960
It wasn't a man.

561
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,280
It was a ghost. The grim reaper.

562
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,890
Anyone who has seen that ghost

563
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,830
has died.

564
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,480
[Lee Da-won]

565
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,450
[Lee Da-won]

566
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,670
[Lee Da-won]

567
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,850
You scared me.

568
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,920
What are you doing here?

569
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:31,250
[Jirisan]

570
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,440
[He came back to the mountain.]

571
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,170
[And suddenly people started dying.]

572
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,610
[She's still on the mountain
like Yi-gang said.]

573
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,370
Lee Da-won!

574
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,840
[Still no answer from the commander?]

575
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,270
[Please check this.]

576
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,740
[We found a pink cell phone.]

577
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,000
It's covered in blood.

578
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,890
Did she go missing trying to find that?

579
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,330
Why did Da-won record that conversation?

580
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,340
When you're stranded,

581
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,980
[you panic and do illogical things.]

582
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,750
[He said it wasn't him this time.]

583
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,350
[You shouldn't have come back.]
