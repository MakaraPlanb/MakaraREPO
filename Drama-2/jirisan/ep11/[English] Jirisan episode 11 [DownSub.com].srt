The most representative summer disaster
is a torrential downpour.

425
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,100
There's a saying,
"clouds hang on the mountain ridge."

When rain clouds can't pass over huge
mountains over a thousand meters high,

427
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,930
local torrential rainfall can occur,

428
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,390
which is unpredictable by weather forecast
and is therefore dangerous.

[Such local torrential rainfall
is dangerous]

430
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,850
[because it's pouring on the top
of the mountain but clear below,]

431
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,960
so it's hard to estimate the danger.

432
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,230
The rougher the geographical features,

433
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,840
the more water it'll collect,
increasing ever so fast.

Like the expression,
"water comes standing,"

it might be too late
