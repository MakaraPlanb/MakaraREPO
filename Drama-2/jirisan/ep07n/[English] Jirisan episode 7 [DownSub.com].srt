-Are these fireproof tents?
-Yes.

100 percent safety.

-Goodness.

-Here, take this.

we can find out where the fire started.]

Okay, I'll call you back.

542

Why aren't they picking up?

543

The banner in your bag...

544
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,830
Is that the closures banner
from last year?

545
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,930
Why?

546
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,200
Is it illegal to take what's thrown away?

547
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,140
Did you take one? Or were there more?

548
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,910
What if there were more?

549
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,460
Where did you put them?

550
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,970
The storage?

551
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,660
The one where we found the snakes?

552
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,600
Yes. I'll come down too. See you there.

553
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,010
I'll take a shortcut through the
pine tree forest, so it won't be too long.

Hey, kids.

556
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,860
I'm not a bad person.

557
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,790
Don't you remember me? I'm a park ranger.

558
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:41,560
No?

Hey...

Where are the adults?

568
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:51,780
Mom went to the mountain.
There's no one else.

If the resin catches on fire,

578
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,040
we can't control the flames
just by indirect suppression.

579

We can't even fly
helicopters in this night.

580

What's more dangerous is

581
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,260
the wind blows
from top to bottom at night.

582
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,190
Worst case scenario,
it could spread to the town.

-Darn it.
