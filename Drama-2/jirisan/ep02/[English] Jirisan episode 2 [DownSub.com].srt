That little girl was so stubborn.

182
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,560
She didn't want to go to a friend's house.

183
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,400
Just to the mountain.

184
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,210
What a tough girl.

185
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,400
She didn't come down for three days once.

186
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,690
-Who does she think she is, a "partisan"?
-"Partisan"?

187
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,320
She drove me crazy.

188
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,630
Grandma!

189
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,320
What are you doing here
slacking off all day?

190
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,820
What do you think?
I'm keeping the customers happy.

191
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,890
Since you're out here,
bring us some more pancakes.

192
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,530
Yes, bring more pancakes.

193
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,120
Your pancake's the best.

194
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,110
Stop eating the darn pancakes!

195
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,390
What did you say?

196
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,970
-Hey! Sorry, I'm late.
-Not at all.

197
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,400
-Ma'am.
-Hello, Captain! Welcome.

198
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,760
Did you eat? You want something?

199
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,280
Scallion pancakes, of course.

200
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,290
Scallion pancakes!

201
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,650
Hey, bring some scallion pancakes!

202
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,460
-Pour me a cup.
-Take a seat.

203
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,840
Goodness. Sit down.

204
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,800

205

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,870
Seriously!

209
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,720
What? I'm busy.

210
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,790

that fogs up often?

[What are you saying?]

212
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,860
There was a yellow ribbon.

213
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,420
A ribbon?

214
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,400
The one illegal hikers use?

215
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,420
Then it must be the restricted area.

216
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,730
There's one 4km away from Mujin Valley.

217
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,250
[It's got a great view, so hikers
like to go there to take photos.]

218
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,300
[And it often gets foggy.]

219
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,520

220
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,960
Yes. Isn't this your day off too?

221
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,890
Are you on patrol for illegal hiking?

Why are you chasing me?

226
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,250
That's what I want to ask.

227
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,820
Do you have permission to be here?

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,650
Come down with me.

232
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,630
I'll guide you down the mountain.

233
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,400
It's your day off, right?

234
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,220
You're not wearing a uniform,
climbing alone with no partner.

235
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,790
So don't mind me
and do what you need to do.

236
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,810
I'll go down on my own.

237
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,490
This isn't your first time, is it?

238
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,890
You know so much about what we do.

239
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,780
You must have gotten away
our patrol quite often.

240
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,330
Illegal harvesting?

241
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,890
Or poaching?

242
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,360
It's not like that.

243
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,580
Let me see your rucksack.

244
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,470
I said it's not like that!

245
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,150
Then why are you here?

246
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,340
If you're collecting plants
or hunting illegally,

247
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,360
it won't end at paying a fine.

248
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,340
Should I call the cops?

249
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm not here for hunting or plants.

250
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,740
I'm here because there's something
I need to find.

251

252
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,410

You know, the air current of Mount Jirisan

275
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,330
is blocked by the tall, rugged topography,

276
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,380
so it's prone to
local torrential rainfall.

There's a man who's been
searching for his dead father for a year.

310
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,480
The name of the missing is Hong Sang-gyu.

311
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,670
He was in huge debt
after his business went down.

312
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,900
He had no transaction record
because he had such bad credit.

313
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,180
And his phone was off too,
which made it hard to investigate.

314
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,130
They've checked all the security cameras
in the mountain just in case,

315
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,520
but because there was no evidence
of him coming here,

316
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,250
the case was closed without a search.

317
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,620
The police gave up, and so did we,
but the son didn't.

00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,730
Why do you think the police
closed the case a year ago?

321
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,330
Because they're dumb?

322
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,900
No. It's because they weren't sure
that he came to Mount Jirisan.

323
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,680
He took a restricted path,
so he wasn't on the security camera.

324
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,540
Chances are
he entered through Mujin Valley.

Mujin Valley is over 7.5km long.

You don't even know what purpose he had
or where he entered through,

his father, we should stop him.

342
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,740
