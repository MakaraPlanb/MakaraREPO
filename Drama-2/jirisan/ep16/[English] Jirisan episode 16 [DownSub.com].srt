You devoted your entire life here,

186
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,560
but this is how they treat you?

187
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,970
Let's end it here, Dad.

188
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,600
You've done enough.

189
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,050

192

193
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,510

194
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,930

195
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,750

196

197

203

[He led us here on purpose.]

204
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,530
He couldn't have gone far.

205

206
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,710

207
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,540
[I don't see him. He's gone.]

208
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,950
It's Sol. He's the murderer.

209
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,060
Gu-yeong and Il-hae followed him,
but they lost him on the mountain.

210
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,630
We must find him quick
before Sol gets rid of the evidence.

211
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,460

212
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
We must find Sol.

213
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,550
[Gu-yeong, Il-hae. Switch the frequency
to the shared channel.]

214
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,220
Where was his last location?

215
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,940
Byeori Forest in Deokseoryeong.

216
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,020

217

[An SOS reported in Deokseoryeong.]

218

220

in Byeori Forest of Deokseoryeong.]

221
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,500
[He can't be far.]

222
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,040
Search 3km within Byeori Forest.

223
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,850
It must be a bedrock area.

224
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,660
Like Black Bridge Valley Shelter,
with a cave.

225
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,240
It's most likely the bedrock
northwest or south of Byeori Forest.

226
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,550
We're the closest. We'd get there first.

227
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
Let's think of this as
finding a stranded hiker.

228
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,690
He's here somewhere.

229
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,600
This way!

230
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,760
There's a trace of someone
going northwest.

231
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,360
We'll search that area.

232
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,970
So you found it.

233
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,750
After all that's happened,

234
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,100
you still stayed on the mountain
to capture me?

235
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,770
See?

236
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,820
I told you ghosts exist.

237
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,090
People don't believe me, though.

238
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,580
You're the murderer.

239
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,430
That's right.

240
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,840
I killed all those people.

241
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,370
All these victims... Why?

242
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,860
Because they didn't remember.

243
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,310
They didn't remember

244

[I've tried many times to kill myself,]

251

[but I was saved by others every time.]

252
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,050
[So if I'm on the mountain,]

253
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,200
[I thought they wouldn't be able
to find me.]

254
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,130
[So I brought a poisoned yogurt there.]

255
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,440
Oh, hello.

256
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,290
Please help me. I'm lost.

257
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,350
[I didn't recognize him at first.]

258
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,640
[I thought maybe I could have
some mercy on him before I'd die.]

259
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,300
You're from Black Bridge Valley?

260
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,060
That's right.

261
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,120

-Beekeeper's Sol?
-Yes.

271
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,420
What a coincidence.

272

of what his father had done.

the flooding accident.

-When did you leave?

549
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,220
Step back!
It's dangerous! Please step back.

550
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,790
Today's sun is exactly
the same as tomorrow's sun!

551
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,630
It's nothing special.

552
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,940
Be careful!

553
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,540
-It's dangerous.
-Ma'am.

554
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:43,800
-This way.
-Step back.

555
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,110
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Please step back.

556
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:49,340
Be careful, please step back.

557
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,620
Wait.

558
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,740
You should know better.

559
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,470
Why?

560
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:03,330
I've never seen the sunrise with ease.

561
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:07,110
Can't I enjoy it with my daughter?

562
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,650
Please step back!

563
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,500
Please!

564
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:18,110
It's dangerous here.
You can see fine from back there.

565
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,170
Step back.

566
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,860
Step back, please.

567
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:26,430
Watch your step, you'll fall.

568
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,960
-Where?
-Where is it?

569
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:38,060
Please step back.

570
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,000
Sorry, let's move back.

571
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,060
-Oh, really?
-It's from that way.

572
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:01,920
Yi-gang!

573
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,240
I was just about to call you.

574
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:07,290
Hyun-jo.

575
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:10,910
Hyun-jo's breathing again.

576
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,600
He's getting treated in a different unit,

577
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,120
but all his signs are returning to normal.

578
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,730
The sunrise!

579
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,840
Happy New Year!

580
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,180
Happy New Year!

581
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,240
Happy New Year, everyone!

582
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,310
-Happy New Year!
-You, as well!

583
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,450
One, two, three.

584
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,560
Thank you.

585
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:40,910
-Could you...
-Of course.

586
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:43,640
Thank you.

587
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,970
Okay, on three.

588
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:50,819
One, two, three.

589
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,890
-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot.

590
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,790
[You don't see things anymore, right?]

591
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,479
[Yes.]

592
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:14,010
I don't see them anymore.
