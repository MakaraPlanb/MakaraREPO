00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,849
Flooding is a natural disaster.

183
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,440
It has nothing to do with crimes.

184
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,170
No one knew it would be pouring
on that day.

185
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,650
They just happened to be there

186
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,750
and made an unfortunate choice.

187
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,890
It's all coincidence.

188
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,500
And today's the same.

189
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,160
[Anyone can get into an accident
and die on the mountain.]

190
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,390
[No one knows what will happen.]

191
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,380
I found it.

192
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,860
I found it!

193
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,920
Who are you?

194
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,230
Are you all right?

195
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,490
See?

196
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,260
If we had cable cars,

197
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,030
this accident wouldn't have happened.

198
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,430
How can you say that in this situation?

199
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,750
If cable car construction started
and all trees were cut down,

200
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,520
we would have died.

201
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,140
We only survived
because the trees blocked the landslide.

202
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,250
Trees can be planted again.

203
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,860
Seriously.

204
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,330
You think trees are Lego blocks?

205
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,330
It can't be reversed
if you plant some trees.

206
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,730
Same as a village.

207
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,720
That town down there

208
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,250
is where I was born and raised.

209
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,500
But more and more people are leaving.

210
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,390
When everyone leaves one by one,

211
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,370
the whole village will vanish.

212
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,760
If you care so much about your hometown,
how could you do such a thing?

213
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,120
It's him! The cable car man.

214
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,940
You'll regret this.

215
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,940
[Black Bridge Village
is gone because of you.]

216
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,170
I'm not leaving!

217
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,320
You've taken the hometown
away from the villagers.

218
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,970
I said I'm not the one

219
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,740
who put the dead animal in the well.

220
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,060
I swear.

221
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,040
Yi-gang.

222
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,310
I don't think this is the way to Fox Hill.

223
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,010
The victim wouldn't be
where an avalanche already happened.

224
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,910
They would have gone somewhere else
even if they got injured.

225
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,560
To where?

226
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,870
Where there's
an emergency telegraphic repeater.

227
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,040
The repeater temporarily
amplifies the terminal signal,

228
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,230
connecting it to the base station.

229
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,250
In other words,
you'll be able to use a cell phone.

230
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,310
That phone won't work.

231
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,690
[Emergency Telegraphic Repeater]

232
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,330
Sir!

233
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,700
-Are you all right?
-Yi-gang.

234
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,730
What happened?

235
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,450
He's been bleeding for a while.
We need a support team.

236
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,230
He's too cold!
I think it's a hemorrhagic shock.

237
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,580
Haedong One.

238
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,180
Current location Clown Rock.

239
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,620
We have a critical victim here.
Can we get a support team?

240
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,760
[Site of road damage.]

241
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,700
[We're approaching via
an alternative route.]

242
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,010
[Apricot Tree Valley,
proceeding with the rescue.]

243
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,780
[Wind is slowing down the process.]

244
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,300
Is the rescue at Beombawi Rock done?

245
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,510
Yes, sir.

246
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,050
-Over here.
-Yes, right here!

247
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,650
-911, please!
-Coming!

248
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,140
-Well done.
-Be careful.

249
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,930
[Gu-yeong. Another SOS reported
at Clown Rock, Mujin Valley.]

250
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,240
Can you make it?

251
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,520
Yes. I'll leave now.

252
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,840
Gu-ho and Jin-hyung. Come with me.

253
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,460
-What a day.
-Let's go.

254
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,210
[Yi-gang.]

255
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,850
[The support team is on its way.]

256
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,370
Hyun-jo, you put him on your back.

257
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,650
I'll assist Hyun-jo down
and join the support team.

258
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,750
You stay with him.

259
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,300
-Got it.
-I'll come, too.

260
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,560
No.

261
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,240
We must get down as quick as possible

262
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,680
since he's in a bad state.

263
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,200
Radio me if anything happens.

264
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,580
Be careful.

265
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,480
There will be another support team.
Please wait here.

266
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,290
I can go down, too.

267
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,300
I must go down with them.

268
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,090
I'll come, too! I can make it!

269
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,860
Hold on.

270
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,720
Not with those legs.

271
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,280
There's a cave not far away.
Let's wait there.

272
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,880
But...

273
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,850
Help!

274
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,120
Over here!

275
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,770
-Wait. Did you hear that?
-Help!

276
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,750
Help me!

277
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,190
Over here! Help!

278
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,330
On the cliff!

279
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,790
Over here! Save me!

280
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,760
Are you okay?

281
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,230
Yes!

282
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,190
Jeong Gu-yeong speaking.
We found a stranded hiker

283
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,290
1.5km from Mujin Valley,
on the southwest cliff.

284
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,700
We don't have the gears to rescue her.

285
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,830
[Any support team available?]

286
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,790
Apricot Tree Valley
is still in the process of rescuing.

287
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,350
Ranger Team A joined
Jingye-ri at the damaged road.

288
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,490
Since the only way to get there
is a detour,

289
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,590
it'll take more than five hours
for the rescue.

290
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,710
Will you be okay by yourself?

291
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,730
You're going by yourself?

292
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,280
Dong-hyup, get ready to go up with me.

293
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,450
Yes, sir.

294
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,010
I'll go.

295
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,000
You must keep watch here.

296
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,910
I know you don't trust me.

297
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,730
But I've been training
with Gu-yeong for months.

298
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,110
I can do this. Please let me go up.

299
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,250
[Support team just left.
I'll take about two hours.]

300
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,760
Okay.

301
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,500
-Can you hear me?
-Yes!

302
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,700
Rangers with gear will come to rescue you!

303
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,640
It'll take a couple of hours.

304
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,660
Please wait patiently!

305
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,160
Okay!

306
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,930
All right!

307
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,780
Let's go.

308
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,050
Are you hurt anywhere else?

309
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,360
You should watch out
for hypothermia on a rainy mountain.

310
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,030
Let me know if you need anything else.

311
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,000
What is that sound?

312
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,030
Sounds like an avalanche.

313
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,050
An avalanche?

314
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,240
Mount Jirisan
mostly consists of land soil.

315
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,310
Heavy rain can easily lead to an avalanche

316
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,320
because the soil holds water.

317
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,890
Then this place can collapse, too.

318
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,460
Let's go down. Quick.

319
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,350
Don't worry. This bedrock area is safe.

320
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,300
Don't lie.

321
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,790
That's what they said then, too,
but the whole building was swept away.

322
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,150
What are you saying?

323
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,760
The building was swept away after we left.

324
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,430
You mean

325
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,240
Dowon Valley in 1995?

326
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,420
Yes.

327
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,200
[Those who've left all survived,]

328
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,610
but the rest all died.

329
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,020
I can't die here. I must leave.

330
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,040
-It's dangerous.
-Move!

331
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,390
Watch out!

332
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,970
Watch out!

333
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,190
The trees are slanted.
They can fall. It's dangerous.

334
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,000
-Let's go back.
-Move!

335
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,600
When there's a flood,

336
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,780
you must stay and wait for rescue!

337
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,790
That's the protocol.

338
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,380
Didn't you hear what I said?

339
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,040
They didn't die because they stayed.

340
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,520
They just made a choice.

341
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,660
And it happened to be an unfortunate one.

342
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,590
No! They gave up!

343
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,690
Because they were scared.

344
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,050
-They gave up!
-No!

345
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,980
They got scared, that's why!

346
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,530
How many times did I tell you
not to stand surety for anyone?

347
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,890
He didn't mean to...

348
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,690
Whatever.

349
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,050
So what are you going to do now?

350
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,190
You even got the house confiscated.

351
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,420
So what's the plan?

352
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,430
Gosh, this is frustrating.

353
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,220
Your son and daughter-in-law
had life insurance.

354
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,630
Here's the list of the payable

355
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,560
and the non-payable.

356
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:58,820
Here.

357
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,510
Please check their identification

358
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,610
and the insurance period.

359
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,560
But in cases of deaths from disasters,
there are some steps to take.

360
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,620
You might not get the benefit

361
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,270

sweeps everything away,

If it's been a popular wishing spot
for this long,

419
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,570

I wished to become a good father.

422

The fact that you're wishing that
already proves you're a good father.

423

Take everything out here.

545
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,000
And some water, too.

546
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,940
-What's this?
-Over there.

547
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,380
I'll bring the rest
to the fire department.

548
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,610
Okay. Go ahead.

549
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,540
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

550
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,310
-Knock yourself out.
-Thanks a lot.

551
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,070
What? You're eating without us?

552
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,000
-Great work!
-Thanks.

553
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,650
-How did it go?
-We brought the injured hiker.

554
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,370
Well done.

555
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,090
Wait.

556
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,030
-Where's Yi-gang and Hyun-jo?
-They'll be right here.

557
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,180
Great work, sir. Have some!

558
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,330
-Sir.
-Nice job.

559
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,950
Hey.

560
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,760
Great work.

561
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,400
Go eat something.

562
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,390
Hey.

563
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,290
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

564
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,790
I'm not a child.

565
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,240
-Grandma.
-What is it?

566
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,710
Thank you.

567
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,970
What?

568
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,920
What's wrong with her?

569
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,610
My goodness.

570
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,330
Hello.

571
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,640
We briefly met up there.

572
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,250
I'm Kang Hyun-jo, a national park ranger.

573
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,570
I want to ask you something.

574
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,720
What is it?

575
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:40,130
I heard you were in the office building
during the flood in 1995.

576
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,400
Yes. So?

577
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:52,010
Do you remember them?

578
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,470
Well... Not really.

579
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,300
They were also in the office building
back then.

580
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,170
They must have been
with the volunteer firefighters.

581
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,890
I think there were people like them there.

582
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,240
Why do you ask?

583
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,190
Did anything in particular happen to them?

584
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,460
Maybe an argument

585
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,480
or common interest?

586
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,050
I'm not too sure.

587
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:32,120
It was a matter of life and death.
All I remember is that

588
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,930
we escaped the building together.

589
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,290
But...

590
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,350
I don't think they fought.

591
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,580
Have you seen Yang-sun?

592
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,880
No.

593
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,200
-Have you seen Yang-sun?
-No.

594
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,920
We can just walk down and take the bus.

595
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,320
Please get in. You have a lot of stuff.

596
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,250
It's really okay though.

597
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,010
Get home safe!

598
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,650
Take care!

599
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,290
Hurry up!

600
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,730
-Come help.
-Okay.

601
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,400
Did Yang-sun go to the main station?

602
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,830
-She mobilized.
-What?

603
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,020
[I'll shoot the rope thrower.]

604
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,580
[Please grab the rope
and tie it to the tree.]

605
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:02,800
Is that her?

606
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,400
I'll go first.

607
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,900
[Commander, we're at the cliff now.]

608
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,640
Good job. How's her state?

609
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,920
[A mild injury, but she's all right.]

610
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,340
[I'll bring her down right away.]

611
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,740
Okay. Keep the walkie on at all times.

612
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,550
[-Yes, sir.]
-Yang-sun, come down safely!

613
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,560
[Okay!]

614
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,990
You go, Yang-sun!

615
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:15,040
This is Yang-sun's first dispatch.
I'll save her more food.

616
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,220
[-Oh, gosh!
-Watch out!]

617
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,120
[Lee Yang-sun]

618
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,790
[Haedong Station]

619
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,090
[Jirisan]

620
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,650
Yang-sun!

621
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,290
Bring a lifebuoy!

622
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,180
[Seo Yi-gang, withdraw!]

623
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,490
[Going to the valley now is suicide!]

624
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,630
Gu-yeong! No!

625
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,320
[Could I see the daily log
during the flood?]

626
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,920
[It wasn't an accident.]

627
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,980
[It's all my fault.]

628
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,460
[You should talk to Yi-gang.]

629
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,090
What? What's going on?

630
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,000
[So what's the evidence you can use
to prove who the murderer is?]
