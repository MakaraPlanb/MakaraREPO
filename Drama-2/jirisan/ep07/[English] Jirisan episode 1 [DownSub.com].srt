to a signal zone on his own.

359
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,720
We're trying to reach him,
but he's not picking up.

360
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,770
I think his battery ran out.

361
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,340
[The support team's on their way,]

362
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,200
[but it'll take them three
and a half hours minimum.]

363
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,450
You're our only hope.

364
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,260
You have to find him.

365
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,960
Let's split up.

366
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,270
Look for the signal zones on GPS.

367
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,780
We'll only search those areas.

368
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,180
We'll look for survival points
not suicide points.

369
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,990
Yes!

370
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,920
[Reception area on the way
from the habitat to Bidam Cliff.]

371
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,640
[He'll be there. Hurry!]

372
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,070
[Golden time's up.]

373
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,120
Even if he's alive,

374
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,690
he'll be ill.

375
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,920
[Those that want to live
instinctively look for these places.]

376
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,350
[Between big rocks.]

377
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,580
[Under a big stump.]

378
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,150
[Among tightly-woven bushes.]

379
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,390
[Under a big rock carved like a cave.]

380
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,700
[Where you can hide from
the wind and rain.]

381
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,250
[Where you can keep warm.]

382
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,410
[He came to live.]

383
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,480
[He would surely have found
a place like that.]

384
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:07,380
[Jirisan National Park
Haedong Ranger Station]

385
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,300
Any progress?

386
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,410
Not yet.

387
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,020
He's nowhere to be seen.

388
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,450
I've looked in all the places
you mentioned.

389
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,920
But he wasn't there.

390
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,930
[He's still alive.]

391
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,450
[He must be here somewhere.]

392
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,240
But where?

393
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,140
[Those that want to live
instinctively look for these places.]

394
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,950
[Where you can keep warm.]

395
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,810
[Between big rocks.]

396
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,230
Where are you?

397
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,170
What is it?

398
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,650
Have you seen a weird mark
made with twigs and rocks?

399
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,620
No.

400
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,430
Something rectangular.

401
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,360
Never seen it.

402
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,630
Why do you ask? Just look for the hiker.

403
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,690
What about a black rock then?

404
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,210
What's wrong with you?

405
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,060
There must be an oak tree nearby.

406
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,960
Oak leaves were scattered around.

407
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,800
What on earth?

408
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,300
Do you mean Sangsuri Rock?

409
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,030
Is there such a place?

410
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,290
Is it near here?

411
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,480
But that's outside the reception area.

412
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,910
He's there.

413
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,760
He has to be there.

414
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,270
Don't you get it?

415
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,930
If he's there,
he couldn't have sent the text.

416
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,570
We've looked everywhere else.

417
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,000
So please.

418
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,780
Let's make it our final place.

419
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,420
Yi-gang!

420
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,720
Over here!

421
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,980
Yi-gang!

422
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,010
[I found him!]

423
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,190
[The hiker found under Sangsuri Rock
at Bidam Cliff!]

424
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,940
His state?

425
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,730
Answer me!

426
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,320
[He's unconscious.]

427
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,260
[He's too cold.]

428
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:29,650
His pulse and breathing?

429
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,250
[Seung-hun!]

430
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,950
[Seung-hun! Wake up!]

431
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,640
Hey! Stop!

432
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,600
You all right?

433
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,840
I'll just carry him on my back.

434
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,260
Put him on my back.

435
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,580
-Be careful.
-Come down carefully!

436
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,090
-Slowly!
-Be careful!

437
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,670
[Ranger]

438
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,960
Are you okay?

439
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,700
Over here!

440
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,960
There they are.

441
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,830
Check him.

442
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,090
Pulse and breathing, normal.

443
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,370
Great!

444
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,470
Take the lady to the hospital.

445
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,850
Yes, sir.

446
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,050
Take care of her.

447
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,410
-See you in a bit.
-Okay.

448
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,390
We're at the bottom.

449
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,570
He's breathing fine, sent to the hospital.

450
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,420
[Come down safe.]

451
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,090
Great work.

452
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,560
Thank you.

453
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,240
Where's Yi-gang?

454
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,090
She'll be passed out.

455
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,210
Well done, Yi-gang.

456
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,950
[Why aren't you responding?]

457
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
[Hey! Can you hear me?]

458
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,000
[Hey, Yi-gang!]

459
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,560
[Did she just turn it off?]

460
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,680
Hurry up!

461
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,100
Aren't you going to train?

462
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,560
In just a second...

463
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,160
Are you here to play?

464
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,970
How can you save anyone at that speed?

465
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,250
If Mount Jirisan's one thing, it's big.

466
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,730
Stranded hikers will be dead
while you rest like that.

467
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,410
I think... I'm really dying.

468
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,270
You got your patrol area assigned, right?

469
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,030
Have you been there?

470
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,130
No, not yet...

471
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,030
Our main task is to guard this mountain.

472
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,960
You must have
all the place names, tree species,

473
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,150
and distribution of vegetation
memorized by heart.

474
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,960
Demon Seo...

475
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,400
Do you have a death wish?

476
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,790
Well...

477
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,280
Even if I die...

478
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,650
Can I have a sip of water?

479
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,550
Yes. At Sonbawi.

480
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,250
Okay. Coming.

481
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,780
This is Sonbawi?

482
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,590
Son, as in hand?

483
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,930
They're making it harder to go down.

484
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,250
Why would they have a date at
such a tough place, not a pub?

485
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,440
That's so annoying.

486
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,760
Should I... hold your hand?

487
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,980
Shut it and follow me.

488
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,830
Wait... Slow down...

489
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,170
How did you find this place?

490
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,470
It wasn't me.

491
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,450
He did.

492
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:37,830
Newbie.

493
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,970
Yes?

494
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,070
How did you know about this place?

495
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,590
Well, umm...

496
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,000
Let's say... the mountain told me.

497
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,470
The mountain?

498
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,500
That's believable.

499
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,950
People have been serving Mount Jirisan
from before the Three Kingdoms.

500
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,430
Being an object of faith
for such a long time

501
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,570
can't just be a superstition.

502
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,480
There's energy in this mountain
that's difficult to explain.

503
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,500
That's what I mean.

504
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,800
This time, for instance.

505
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,090
There's no reception here,
but a text message was sent.

506
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,570
The mountain saved the kid.

507
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,070
Stop the nonsense.

508
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,590
So what is that?

509
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,060
Oh, right.

510
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,820
This...

511
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,890
was how the partisans kept in touch.

512
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,780
When they fell behind
or was out of contact,

513
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,680
they made a code like this to communicate.

514
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,790
That's still there?

515
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,980
They pick a spot
that no one else will discover.

516
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,490
A place that won't be...

517
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,260
destroyed in the wind.

518
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,350
Like this place.

519
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,620
What does that mean?

520
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,260
It was to signal their location.

521
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,640
Or so we assume.

522
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,010
I must go now.

523
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,710
Thank you for calling me.

524
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,790
I'm Kim Sol,
a cultural resources researcher.

525
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,830
If you happen to find another
historical place, please call me!

526
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,130
All right.

527
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:31,060
This must be quite valuable.

528
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,170
We could...

529
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:40,430
use this when we can't use radio
or cellphones on unregistered trails.

530
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,330
It's perfect for signaling
a lost hiker's location.

531
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,310
Look.

532
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,610
Pretend these rocks are Bidam Cliff.

533
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,580
Here...

534
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,030
Stick a twig in.

535
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,340
See? It's right where Sangsuri Rock is.

536
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,180
Now tell me.

537
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,940
How did you know?

538
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:27,090
I saw it.

539
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,260
It's not my first time.

540
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,490
I keep seeing...

541
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,850
where lost hikers are in this mountain.

542
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,160
