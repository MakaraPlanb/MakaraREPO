Is that why you caught so many snakes?

363
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,900
You could've wiped out the whole species!

364
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,460
-You look like a snake!
-What did you say?

365
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,200
What have those poor snakes
ever done to you?

366
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,760
I should have known when you winked at me.

367
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,830
-Hey! Who do you think you are?
-How dare you kill all those snakes?

368
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,720
-Why mess with me?
-What did you say?

369
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,370
-Get off of me!
-What?

370
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,970
-Darn it!
-Come at me!

371
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,100

372
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,900
Yes.

373
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,610
He's tall but very plain-looking.

374
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,920
I wouldn't say he is plain.

375
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,930
He's not normal, though.

376

Is that so?

377
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,830
What a shame. He's so young though.

378
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,340
23 black and 18 yellow rat snakes,

379
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,530
and 53 tiger keelbacks.
That's 94 in total.

380
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,270
Well done.

381
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,790
Thanks a lot.

382
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,520
Good night.

383
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,170
Oh, right.

384
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,500
We should head back now.

385
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,760
Okay.

386
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,160
This trail is a lot worse
than other restricted areas.

387
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,140
Not even herb collectors come here.

388
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,830
And since there are no humans,
it's animal paradise.

389
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,320
And...

390
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,860
This is the only graveyard
where you can see Cheonwangbong Peak.

391
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,460
Is this it?

392

396
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,160
We've got special patrol to do.

397
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,030
How come you came with me
without a question?

398
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,260
You always yell at me for saying nonsense.

399
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,820

00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,780
Darn it. Who do they think they are?

403
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,420
Hurry up before it gets dark.

404
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,950
What if we get caught again?

405
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,720
How else will we pay the fine?

406
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,520
Are we going to starve the kids?

407
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,170
It's either do or die.

408
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,850
What are you doing? You go that way.

409
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,510
How could such a graveyard
still remain in a national park?

410
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,490
Aren't illegal properties
subject to demolition here?

411
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,300
For the graves that were here
before it became a national park,

412
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,700
families often don't agree to move them.

413
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,960
Like that one.

414
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,620
Chuseok is over,
and Cold Food festival is not here yet.

415
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,020
No one will come for a while,
which means no injuries.

416
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,870
Not only families come here.

417
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,390

a lot under a stone table.]

420

Homemade bombs used by poachers
who hunted moon bears in the 60s and 70s.

426
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,980
Bear liver and gall bladder
were considered a luxury back then.

427
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,090
So the poachers set them up
here and there on Mount Jirisan.

428
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,070
It's kind of like a landmine.

429
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,970
But they're still on the mountain?

430
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,440
In the 60s, when the national park
was established,

431
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,590
everyone including the villagers searched

432
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,520
and removed any remaining bombs.

433
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,460
But they couldn't reach
the deep restricted trails.

434
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,360
This is Mount Jirisan, after all.

435
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,800
But how did this old junk explode?

436
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,780
The casing of a potato bomb
is entirely sealed with wax.

437
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,460
And because no wind or rain could get in,

438
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,940
the detonator and explosive
must have remained inside.

439
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,980
We keep telling them not to enter.

440
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,940

for any dangerous objects.

No.

this is a huge problem.

because of a park ranger's mistake.

to the mountain that day

475
