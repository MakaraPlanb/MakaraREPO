How do you know about that?

188
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,460
Did the mountain tell you that, too?

189
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,640
I found out while doing some investigation

190
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,250
after what happened to Lee Se-wook.

191
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,120
All the victims were

192
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,060
from Black Bridge Valley.

193
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,170
I'm sure the murderer
has some relation to the village.

so I don't remember the details.

But...

199
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,800
I just remember there being
many funerals in a row.

200
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,710
First it was my mom,

201
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,060
then Se-wook's dad,

202
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,800
and then my father's was the last one.

203
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,250
How did they die?

204
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,500

died in an accident.

205
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,940
My father...

206
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,800
committed suicide.

207
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,130
But why...

208
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,030

210

you mentioned?

213

214
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,210
that the village disappeared not because
of the cable cars or the demolition,

215
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,310
but because of the goblin lights.

216

I have no clue what that could be.

222
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,740
My father saw it, too,

223
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,300
but we never found out what it was.

224
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,430
And...

I left Mount Jirisan.

229
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,280
Because both my parents passed,
I went to a relative's house in Seoul.

230

They were close from childhood,

234
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,800

on Woong-soon a lot.

and changed the place and time.]

545
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,020
Please... Don't kill me

546
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,030
-Can you see me?
-Yes.

547
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:44,520
I've been seeing you. Not just me.

548
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,130
Everyone who'd seen you died.

549
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,720
Please let me go.

550
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,480
What he said is true...

551
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,130
You finally came...

552
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,230
Can you see me?

553
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,670
Yi-gang...

554
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,780
[Lee Da-won]

555
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,220
Yi-gang...

556
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,280
[Can you hear me?]

557
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:52,950
[Leave.]

558
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,390
Forget everything that happened here.

559
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,510
Leave the mountain.

560
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,030
Forget it all.

561
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,890
Forget everything.

562
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,410
And have a better life.

563
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,220
Please...

564
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,330
Don't ever come back.

565
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,380
Hyun-jo...

566
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,810
Hyun-jo!

567
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,660
Kang Hyun-jo!

568
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,380
[Kang Hyun-jo!]

569
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,770
Yi-gang.

570
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,780
[Kang Hyun-jo!]

571
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,220
Kang Hyun-jo!

572
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,460
[Jirisan]

573
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,140
[Hyun-jo's on the mountain.]

574
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,330
Are you sure you saw him on the mountain?

575
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,130
[The remaining are those three.]

576
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,070
Plus, Sol and Woong-soon.

577
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,790
What is it about?

578
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,520
[People who lived in that village
have been dying.]

579
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:40,950
The answer is on the mountain.

580
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,040
[I'm sorry.]

581
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,140
I found out
why Se-wook's father passed away.

582
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,450
[-That's all we can do.
-I need to see the incident report.]

583
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,140
[Let's say goodbye to Hyun-jo.]

584
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,370
[Some wanted to leave,
but some wanted to stay.]

585
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,640
Could I come in for a sec?
