But I've been doing this all my life.

542
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,720
I can't just stop
because I'm scared of a ghost.

543
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,730
Do you mean

544
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,250
that ghost you saw?

545
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,230
All herb collectors know about that ghost.

546
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,850
We all went up on a spiritless day
since we're all scared of the ghost.

547
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,210
Whoever saw that ghost has died.

548
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,070
So the story you told me before,

549
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,040
it's really true?

550
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,350
I'm serious.

551
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,950
Mr. Jang who died in
Mujin Valley three months ago

552
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,670
also told me before he died

553
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,400
that he saw a man in a bloody uniform.

554
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,700
It's not just him.

555
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,010
Gi-yeong, who died in Oerae Valley,

556
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,460
came for the first time in a while.
He also said he saw that man.

557
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,910
And Mr. Hwang, who nearly died in
Jeonmukgol because the rope broke,

558
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,800
saw him, too.

559
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,790
I saw a guy with a ranger's uniform.

560
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,010
His hands and clothes
were covered in blood.

561
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,890
You were in an accident in Jeonmukgol?

562
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,480
It was the road I took every day,
but the rope broke and I nearly died.

563
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,260
If it weren't for the hiker passing by,
I would have died.

564
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,210
I heard you saw a man in a uniform
before the accident.

565
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,180
Was it him?

566
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,340
Who is this?

567
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,890
Do you know him?

568
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,320
Did you see this man?

569
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,960
It wasn't a man.

570
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,280
It was a ghost. The grim reaper.

571
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,890
Anyone who has seen that ghost

572
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,830
has died.

573
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,480
[Lee Da-won]

574
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,450
[Lee Da-won]

575
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,760
[Ranger]

576
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,670
[Lee Da-won]

577
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,850
You scared me.

578
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,920
What are you doing here?

579
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:31,250
[Jirisan]

580
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,440
[He came back to the mountain.]

581
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,170
[And suddenly people started dying.]

582
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,610
[She's still on the mountain
like Yi-gang said.]

583
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,370
Lee Da-won!

584
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,840
[Still no answer from the commander?]

585
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,270
[Please check this.]

586
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,740
[We found a pink cell phone.]

587
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,000
It's covered in blood.

588
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,890
Did she go missing trying to find that?

589
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,330
Why did Da-won record that conversation?

590
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,340
When you're stranded,

591
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,980
[you panic and do illogical things.]

592
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,750
[He said it wasn't him this time.]

593
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,350
[You shouldn't have come back.]
