Qi.

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,530
I've wanted to marry you,

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,740
but there is something important
I haven't told you.

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,130
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,890
Hear me out.

33
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,700
I was exiled to the frontier fortress as a child.

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,420
Only you treated me like your friend.

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,700
We wrote to each other after our parting.

36
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,940
When I was all alone in Bianjing,

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,850
you were my only friend.

38
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,810
I made up my mind

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,810
the moment I first met you.

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,420
I've always been in love with you.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,940
Zhuo Wen Yuan...

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,850
I just realized

43
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,970
I'm not telling this for your sake,

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,210
but for mine.

45
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,180
I know.

46
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,180
I know that clearly.

47
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,260
You and Yan Yun Zhi

48
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,690
are in love with each other.

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,410
However...

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,260
However, falling for you

51
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,330
was my own choice.

52
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,380
Even the best hunter

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,020
can't get any reward

54
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,330
if there is no game around to hunt.

55
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,900
We're adults now.

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,820
This may be a great bow for me when I was little,

57
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,130
but it doesn't do well for me now.

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,050
You can have it back.

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,130
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

60
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,770
I'll say this one last time.

61
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,970
My heart only has a place for Yan Yun Zhi alone.

62
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,380
You should stop wasting your time on me.

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,850
Only then

64
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,210
can we still be friends.

65
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,020
See you around.

66
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,130
If it weren't for our childhood,

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,900
things could have been different for us.

68
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,570
Sang Qi.

69
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,330
You left me with no other choice.

70
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,580
You're back.

71
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,450
Did you go out with Zhuo Wen Yuan?

72
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,050
How do you know?

73
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,450
Should I not know?

74
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,540
Don't take it wrongly.

75
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,450
Since you were away for so long,

76
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,610
should I know what you talked about?

77
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,770
Yes, you should know.

78
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,330
As if I cared.

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,170
What's so funny about it?

80
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,980
I'm serious.

81
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,610
Don't you want to know what we talked about?

82
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,700
Of course.

83
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,050
But I shouldn't know.

84
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,380
Who cares?

85
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,260
It's the good manner.

86
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,290
I shouldn't know

87
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,100
what you talked about,

88
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,010
but I am concerned about it.

89
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,170
That doesn't mean

90
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,860
you needn't make it up to me.

91
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,050
Are you still mad at me?

92
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,660
Was that enough?

93
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,050
You're still upset?

94
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,210
Come on.

95
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,010
I'm not mad at you.

96
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,580
When we get married,

97
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,490
where should we hold the wedding?

98
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,140
Married?

99
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,730
Isn't it a little too soon to discuss that?

100
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,210
But there should be a proposal
before that, right?

101
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,730
Yes.

102
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,490
That is the proper procedure.

103
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,820
But the proposal

104
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,380
is usually handled by our parents.

105
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,580
They are in charge of the family visit.

106
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,540
But the wedding is different.

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,170
We can decide

108
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,610
what we want for the wedding.

109
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,420
You only get this chance once.

110
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,890
I want it to be memorable for you.

111
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,380
Let's have it in the Imperial College.

112
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,380
We met and fell in love here.

113
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,050
I'm sure it'd be meaningful for Yu as well.

114
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,660
Fair enough. We'll have it in the Imperial College.

115
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,490
However,

116
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,140
I want to hold a banquet with my maiden family
at the frontier fortress.

117
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,450
Sure. As you wish.

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,940
Well,

119
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,980
what about the names of our kids?

120
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,210
Tell me.

121
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,420
How should we name them?

122
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,490

I have great news for you.

136
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,890
He...

137
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,170
He actually said he wanted to marry me.

138
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,700
I didn't expect he would

139
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,770
be so thoughtful and attentive.

140
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,490
He knows the Imperial College
holds a special place in my heart.

141
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,730
He proposed we should hold our wedding

142
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,450
at the Imperial College.

143
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,730
I told him

144
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,610
I'd like to have a banquet with my maiden family
at the frontier fortress.

145
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,700
He agreed without any hesitation.

146
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,100
He even told me

147
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,450
one of our kids could take my surname.

148
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,770
The other kid can take his surname.

149
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:34,940
In that case,

150
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,260
we will have two kids...

151
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,490
No, he said there would be more than two kids.

152
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,730
We could have a bunch of children.

153
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,820
I feel so shy.

154
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,090
Two children...

155
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,090
If we have four children,

156
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,780
two will take his surname,

157
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,940
the other two will take mine.

158
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,020
(The daughter of Sang family has grown up.)

159
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,530
(So, the day has finally come for me.)

160
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,730
Yu.

161
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,050
(Cenotaph of the beloved son, Sang Yu)
I have great news for you.

162
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,490
Qi lived up to your expectation.

163
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,650
She is ranked 18th place
of the Second Class Degree.

164
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,460
As promised,

165
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,220
we'll announce our relationship

166
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,900
after the imperial examination.

167
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,020
Not only that,

168
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,220
I stayed up all night to prepare the bridewealth.

169
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,730
I'll propose to her today at your residence.

170
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,340
Yu, I won't let you down.

171
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,970
I'll do whatever I can

172
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,940
to take great care of Qi.

173
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,340
Impressive.

174
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,850
It seems your destiny is intertwined
with our Sang family.

175
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:50,970
Grand Commandant Sang.

176
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,020
I've heard you were close with Yu.

177
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,850
You never stop visiting his grave
even after so many years.

178
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,610
It was my greatest honor

179
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,900
to be his friend.

180
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,700
But Yu and Qi are not the same.

181
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,050
I'll get straight to the point.

182
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm against your marriage with Qi.

183
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,460
Does something concern you,
Grand Commandant Sang?

184
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,700
Whatever you demand,

185
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,820
I'll do my best to meet the requirement.

186
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,580
I'll be frank.

187
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,260
I had hoped for someone else to marry her.

188
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,090
I'm grateful that you helped my daughter
finish the imperial examination.

189
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,260
But she is my only daughter.

190
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,460
I won't let her feel aggrieved.

191
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,530
I must find her

192
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,290
a husband who can keep her safe.

193
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,780
Grand Commandant Sang.

194
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,850
I understand your concern.

195
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,490
But I will propose nonetheless.

196
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,730
I'll keep trying until you agree.

197
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,530
I will prove my resolve.

198
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,530
Suit yourself.

199
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,530
Let's see how long you can keep it up.

200
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:51,970
Leave.

201
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,580
Yu, I'll leave for now.

202
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,020
(Cenotaph of the beloved son, Sang Yu)

203
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,500
(Grand Preceptor's Residence)

204
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,260
You are back.

205
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,730
Greetings, Mother.

206
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,940
I have an announcement for you.

207
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,700
Did you get into

208
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,050
some sort of trouble again?

209
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,970
I only came to tell you that

210
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,730
because I've graduated.

211
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,700
I'm in love with someone.

212
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,140
I hope to get your blessing.

213
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,730
Allow me to propose to her.

214
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,460
Sure.

215
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,220
I've been worried

216
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,530
about your marriage.

217
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,580
The bridewealth is ready.

218
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,220
Whose daughter is it?

219
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,090
The Sang family.

220
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,610
Grand Commandant Sang?

221
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,170
I heard the rumors.

222
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,220
But I'm surprised you want to marry her.

223
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,820
You already know?

224
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,050
I was worried...

225
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,850
I know what worries you.

226
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,850
Those from the Sang family

227
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,940
are usually very expressive.

228
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,580
That's why people gossip about them.

229
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,780
Were you worried I might disagree

230
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,850
with your plan?

231
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,970
I don't care about the gossips.

232
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,940
I've been in love with her for so long.

233
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,460
She is energetic and cheerful,
thoughtful and gentle.

234
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,580
She forms her own opinions,

235
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,940
unlike average young ladies.

236
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,650
I understand.

237
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,290
She sounds like a nice person.

238
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,340
I was told she grew up at the frontier.

239
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,090
So, she must be strong.

240
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,820
Our Yan family will have plenty of grandchildren.

241
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,020
But she does take great care

242
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,900
of her family.

243
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,530
Her cooking is outstanding too.

244
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,290
A virtuous lady indeed.

245
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,220
I can see why Grand Commandant Sang
is so fond of her.

246
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,580
He treats her well.

247
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,780
She must be at the right age for marriage now.

248
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,780
But since Grand Commandant Sang is so fond of her,

249
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,290
what are your chances?

250
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,650
I haven't talked to Grand Commandant Sang formally

251
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,490
about this matter.

252
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,260
It's all right.

253
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,490
With my help,

254
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,900
everything will work out just fine.

255
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,650
Let's not wait any longer.

256
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,340
Today is a good day.

257
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,580
We must go there right now.

258
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,650
Mother, take the bridewealth with you.

259
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,700
It's an important day,

260
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,290
I need someone important with me.

261
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,940
Try to calm down a little!

262
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,820
Check the inventory,

263
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,020
make sure we have everything.

264
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,020
Yes, Madam.

265
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,850
Lian Pian.

266
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,850
Lian Pian?

267
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,610
Where is she?

268
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,610
Master, what's the matter?

269
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,580
It's a serious matter,

270
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,220
so why didn't you inform me?

271
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,530
Young Master Yan and I are not in love.

272
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,580
We didn't do anything inappropriate.

273
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,090
You?

274
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,170
You and Yan Xiao Lang?

275
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,650
How silly of me.

276
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,850
I forgot you were about the same age as Qi.

277
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,170
It's time you get married as well.

278
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,340
You've served the Sang family for years.

279
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,170
I never paid you too much attention.

280
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,140
I didn't notice

281
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,020
you had special feelings for Yan Xiao Lang.

282
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,090
I'm just a servant.

283
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,850
The Yan family is beyond my league.

284
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,050
If he can decide for his own marriage,

285
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,050
I don't mind at all.

286
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,970
You can marry him as my goddaughter.

287
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,380
If the Yan family doesn't buy it,

288
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,530
it's not like

289
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,700
the Sang family is too concerned
with rites and traditions.

290
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,730
I can include your name in our genealogy book.

291
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,650
Father.

292
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,700
You're the best father in the whole Bianjing!

293
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,460
No! You're the best father in the entire world!

294
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,220
Lian Pian, I'm your sister now.

295
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,340
Sis... Young Lady!

296
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,220
You...

297
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,490
Sister.

298
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,220
Come.

299
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,610
What's wrong?

300
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,780
I'm fine.

301
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,650
Po.

302
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,610
Close all the gates.

303
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,730
Make sure no one comes in.

304
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,650
Father, why are we closing all the gates?

305
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,460
Lian Pian.

306
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,090
Don't you find my father odd?

307
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,290
His mood is unpredictable.

308
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,490
Not at all.

309
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,820
I think he is nice.

310
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,730
Say "Sister."

311
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,610
Sister.

312
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,410
My younger sister.

316
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,970
Come now, follow me
to the Grand Commandant's Residence.

317
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,340
The Grand Commandant's Residence?

318
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,050
For what?

319
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,780
I must propose to Lian Pian today.

320
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,340
Hold on.

321
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,140
It'll be double the delight

322
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,050
and joy.

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,650

Sorry.

We do not accept any visits today.

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Please come some other day.

335
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,700
You must let me in.

336
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,820
It concerns

337
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,530
the future of the Sang family.

338
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,410
We from the Yan family don't
enjoy being kept at the doorstep.

339

Madam Yan.

340
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,050
I apologize.

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,410
Please come in.

342
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,170
I'll inform my Master.

Madam, please.

I didn't expect you to visit so soon.

Grand Commandant Sang.

348
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,170
I guess you know why I'm here.

349
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,980
Since it's about marriage,

350
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,500
let's get down to business.

351
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,620
If you're willing to accept it,

352
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,290
I'll be glad for sure.

353
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,860
This is the children's decision.

354
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,460
I'm here for the sake of rite.

355
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,170
Welcome.

356
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,620
Yan Yan mentioned it yesterday,

357
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,290
and now he brought so many gifts for the proposal.

358
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,700
Yan Yan must have got
his strong-willed personality

359
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,290
from his parents.

360
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,100
Both he and his mother are quick to take action.

361
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,890
I underestimated him.

Let's go.

363
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,130
I didn't get a close look.

364
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,410
But now I can see how lovely she is.

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,820

373
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,700
Sang Qi.

374
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,980
You will soon be my daughter-in-law.

375
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,940
What?

376
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,220
- No!
- You got it all wrong.

377
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,370
Madam Yan.

378
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,940
You misunderstood.

379
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,170
Yan Yan isn't marrying me.

380
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,410
I'm not marrying Yan Yan either.

381
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,770
Look at you.

382
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,700
Calm down, don't be so nervous.

383
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,770
Your tongue is twisted.

384
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,740
I'm serious.

385
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,290
Madam Yan.

386
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,580
Sang Qi is marrying me.

387
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,410
Is this a misunderstanding?

388
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,530
Yes.

389
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,460
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

390
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,650
I told you yesterday.

391
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,890
I'm a man of my word.

392
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,370
I'm serious about marrying you.

393
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,460
Madam, for your information,

394
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,130
people already know

395
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,290
about my relationship with Sang Qi.

396
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,170
I'm visiting

397
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,620
to inform Grand Commandant Sang
of our relationship.

398
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,580
Then, I'll propose to Sang Qi formally.

399
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,130
Grand Commandant Sang,
this is the letter containing my Eight Characters.

400
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,980
Not now.

401
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,650
Deputy Chief Yan, first comes, first served.

402
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,500
A proposal is no child's play.

403
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,620
Your parents must be present for the matter.

404
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,410
Why are you here all by yourself?

405
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,860
Do not try to take away the Yan family's bride.

406
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,050
Madam Yan.

407
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,010
It's best that you ask Yan Yan who he's here to

408
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,220
propose to.

409
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,130
Yes.

410
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,050
The Sang family only has one daughter.

411
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,530
Do you expect my son to marry the servant?

412
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,820
Yan?

413
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,740
Outrageous!

414
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,130
Your father is the Grand Perceptor!

415
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,890
How can you marry a servant?

416
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,410
Madam Yan.

417
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,700
That was a little inappropriate.

418
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,100
Lian Pian and I grew up together.

419
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,130
I treat her as my equal.

420
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,220
We do chores together

421
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,860
and eat at the same table.

422
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,620
Right, Father?

423
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,820
Our family has never looked down on Lian Pian.

424
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,410
Right, Father?

425
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,100
Madam Yan.

426
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,010
I couldn't introduce her to you
because of the sudden visit.

427
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,620
I basically raise Lian Pian myself.

428
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,220
I see her as my daughter.

429
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,500
Yes!

430
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,050
I'm planning to include her name

431
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,170
in our genealogy book.

432
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,860
That will officially make her
the Third Young Lady of the Sang family.

433
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,050
Grand Commandant Sang,
we are both reputable families.

434
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,860
How could you agree to this nonsense?

435
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,890
A servant

436
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,860
can never marry into my family!

437
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
Even as a concubine

438
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,340
or a nameless mistress,

439
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,170
I still won't allow it!

440
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,010
Sang Qi is the only one

441
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,740
who deserves to be married to the Yan family!

442
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,340
Mother, I'm not marrying Sang Qi.

443
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,820
I must marry Lian Pian!

444
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,460
Silence!

445
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,940
Madam Yan, calm down.

446
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,650
I'm afraid today

447
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,130
is not the best time for a proposal.

448
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
Lian Pian, don't worry.

449
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,010
Deputy Chief Yan.

450
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,650
You should come at another time.

451
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,460
Madam Yan,

452
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,740
you should discuss it with your son.

453
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,170
I may be a martial artist,

454
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,500
but when it comes to my children's marriage,

455
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,770
I won't make any reckless decisions.

456
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,010
Well said, Grand Commandant Sang.

457
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
We shall leave now.

458
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:01,860
Yan Yan!

459
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,100
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

460
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,010
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
I'm happy that you came to propose.

461
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,650
But I didn't know

462
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,250
it'd turn out this way.

463
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,620
A lot has happened today.

464
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,890
My mood is all ruined.

465
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,980
Whether Yan Yan deserves to marry Lian Pian

466
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,170
depends on what he does after this.

467
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,700
I couldn't propose because

468
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,530
of Madam Yan's tantrum,

469
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,290
are you disappointed?

470
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,860
Are you getting restless?

471
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,050
Me?

472
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,890
Not at all.

473
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,500
You brought your letter of Eight Characters

474
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,770
to my residence,

475
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,980
you're not going anywhere.

476
00:23:59,650 --> 00:23:59,980
Indeed.

477
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,050
You father said

478
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,290
I should come at another time.

479
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,700
I'll come again very soon.

480
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,370
Father.

481
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:10,770
Grand Commandant Sang.

482
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,770
When did you come here?

483
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,940
I think I should come here more often.

484
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,170
Grand Commandant Sang, I shall go now.

485
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,770
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
Stay safe.

486
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,020
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

487
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,220
Father.

488
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,130
Do you have something to tell me?

489
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,340
What was that all about?

490
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,130
Both men who came today

491
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,290
were disappointing.

492
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,130
I know.

493
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,890
You think Madam Yan is too strong-willed

494
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,010
and worried Lian Pian might
get bullied after marrying Yan Yan.

495
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,860
I understand your concern.

496
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,250
But what about the Deputy Chief?

497
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,460
First of all, they both came to propose.

498
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,940
He handed me the letter as soon as they arrived.

499
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,250
Does he have no respect for me at all?

500
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,100
Secondly, Yan Yun Zhi is the son
of Chancellor Yan's concubine.

501
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,620
Chancellor Yan never cares too much

502
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,650
about his own son,

503
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,530
it'll be worse for you.

504
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,860
He came without even informing his father.

505
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,980
Thirdly, he has a weird personality.
He does things his own way.

506
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,580
He's obnoxious.

507
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,340
He's obnoxious?

508
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,620
Father, don't forget,

509
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,770
you're an obnoxious old man.

510
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,770
I'm an obnoxious young lady.

511
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,220
We both have weird personalities.

512
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,460
So why do you look down on him?

513
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,130
In that regard,

514
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,170
Zhuo Wen Yuan can do much better than him.

515
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,410
Why do you bring him up?

516
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,530
Can you not poke at my sore spot?

517
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,770
This has nothing to do with him.

518
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,170
You...

519
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,530
Father!

520
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,620
(Agarwood)

521
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,980
Lian Pian.

522
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,890
Don't get upset

523
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,500
over what Madam Yan said just now.

524
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,980
Don't worry, Young Lady.

525
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,250
I was ready for it anyway.

526
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,100
It was a lot better than I had imagined.

527
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,580
Madam Yan's reaction

528
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
had me frightened as well.

529
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,050
But don't worry, Lian Pian.

530
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,650
Both my father and I support you.

531
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,820
We're making you part of the family.

532
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,580
Your name will be in our genealogy book.

533
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,460
It's not to please the Yan family.

534
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,010
We do so because I already

535
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,250
see you as my sister.

536
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,940
I appreciate the thought.

537
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,130
But

538
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,620
I feel conflicted to call you my sister

539
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,010
after so long.

540
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,370
You should help Deputy Chief Yan too.

541
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,370
Judging by Master's temper,

542
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,100
he won't be easy to please.

543
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,580
(Erudite)

544
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,340
Such an outrageous mistake.

545
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,740
You've embarrassed the Yan family!

546
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,740
I didn't say I was marrying Sang Qi.

547
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,700
It was you who misunderstood.

548
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,700
The order will be given to us soon.

549
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,100
Until then,

550
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,620
stay inside the house.

551
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,860
You're not going anywhere.

552
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,290
Mother!

553
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,130
I'll handpick a wife for you as soon as I can

554
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,620
so you can get married.

555
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,860
Don't even try to consider

556
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,980
the lowly women out there.

557
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,460
Lian Pian is not a lowly woman.

558
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,170
She is a daughter of a reputable family.

559
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,940
She is just a servant.

560
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,220
She has no place in our family.

561
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,700
(Erudite)

562
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
I'm going out anyway.

563
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,940
(Erudite)

564
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,340
Noble Consort, Young Master Zhuo
requests an audience with you.

565
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,130
Let him in.

566
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,860
Aunt, you're in a good mood today.

567
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,530
Did something great happen?

568
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,290
I got a little closer to His Majesty.

569
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,290
His Majesty rewarded me tonight.

570
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,100
Sit.

571
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,980
Everything is going well for the Zhuo family.

572
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,580
You must make progress with the daughter
of the Sang family.

573
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,890
Everyone in the Imperial College knows
Sang Qi and Yan Yun Zhi

574
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,700
are madly in love.

575
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,010
Fighting for a chance at her

576
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,170
is basically pointless.

577
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,290
Does it matter?

578
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,820
Do not mind the trivial matters.

579
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,620
Without their parents' consent
and a proper procedure,

580
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,890
there are chances they might not get married.

581
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,460
With your wits,

582
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,290
you can employ some tricks to alienate them.

583
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,180
(Qingfeng Restaurant)

584
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,530
(Qingfeng Restaurant)
You are spending the night alone too, Miss Su.

585
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,770
I was bored of staying at home.

586
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,580
I came to check out the streets.

587
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,250
I have this sudden feeling

588
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,890
that you and I are in the same boat.

589
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,620
In the same boat?

590
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,580
Is this supposed to be a joke?

591
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,700
Not at all, Miss Su.

592
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,050
I was making fun of myself.

593
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,290
Very well, Mr. Zhuo.

594
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,580
Why trouble yourself with worries
on this pleasant night?

595
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,980
It's only a waste of time.

596
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,130
(Qingfeng Restaurant)
Why not go home and enjoy some wine?

597
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,410
With some drinks,

598
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,820
anyone can enjoy the night alone.

599
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,140
(Qingfeng Restaurant)

600
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,010
It's pointless to drink alone.

601
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,530
Our meeting is part of fate's plan for us.

602
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:10,580
Miss Su.

603
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,290
Since we're already at the Qingfeng Restaurant,

604
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
why don't we go inside

605
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,290
and have a little chat?

606
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,890
I don't mean to pry,

607
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,050
but something still baffles me.

608
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:32,890
Is it about me?

609
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,890
Enlighten me.

610
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,250
Yan Yun Zhi keeps his distance from you.

611
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,740
And now he announced his relationship
with Sang Qi.

612
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,700
Why are you still obsessed with him?

613
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,860
That's because

614
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,220
you don't know him like I do.

615
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
How so?

616
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,650
I remember

617
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,770
when I was eight,

618
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,890
my elder brother and I were playing
hide-and-seek in the garden.

619
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,530
I was searching for him blindfolded

620
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,820
for quite some time.

621
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,370
I was getting impatient and walked quickly.

622
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,130
I started grabbing anything I could,

623
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,580
and I grabbed someone.

624
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,290
I was so happy.

625
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,010
What happened next?

626
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,530
Then, I realized I grabbed his hand instead.

627
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,650
Yun Zhi held my hand,
and we walked for some distance.

628
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,130
He only raised his head when we reached the eaves.

629
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,100
He asked my brother to come down.

630
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,860
Later on,

631
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,220
my brother made fun of him over this matter.

632
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,580
He asked Yun Zhi why he didn't say anything,

633
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,700
and whether he was trying to take advantage of me.

634
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,410
Yun Zhi answered with a stiff expression.

635
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,980
Back then,

636
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,530
I walked into a flower bed

637
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,700
with Chinese Roses.

638
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,860
The plants were full of thorns.

639
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,890
If I fell into the bushes,

640
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,250
I'd be badly hurt.

641
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,170
Yan Yun Zhi did what anyone should.

642
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,940
If I were the one who held your hand,

643
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,170
would you fall in love with me instead?

644
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,860
Miss Su.

645
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,820
You knew all along

646
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,530
that Yan Yun Zhi

647
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,460
doesn't love you.

648
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,770
At this point,

649
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,620
I should take my leave.

650
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,290
See you.

651
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Miss Su, wait.

652
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,220
I know you are a gentle person.

653
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,050
But you wouldn't give up easily.

654
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,370
Do you believe in destiny

655
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,980
or will you decide the future yourself?

656
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,370
As you said,

657
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,500
Yan Yun Zhi doesn't love me.

658
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,170
I have no place in his heart.

659
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,700
Should I force him into loving me?

660
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,130
If you can't have his heart,

661
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,700
you can first get close to him.

662
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,220
When a bond is formed between two people,

663
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,810
as they eat at the same table

664
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,170
and share the same bed,

665
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,370
it's only a matter of time

666
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,700
before you can win his love.

667
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,700
Miss Su, I want to have Sang Qi for myself.

668
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,610
But do you

669
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,850
want to have Yan Yun Zhi's love?

670
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,060
(Qiqiao Festival)
Great!

671
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,700
Miss, the shop is closed.

672
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,020
We cannot serve you.

673
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,980
It's your honor to have me

674
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,740
(Wang's Dumplings)
as your customer.

675
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,260
Who do you think you are?

676
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,570
How dare you chase me away?

677
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,130
I'll get the Grand Tutor's men

678
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,850
to trash your shop.

679
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,090
Don't be so full of yourself.

680
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,460
You?

681
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,980
The daughter of the Grand Tutor

682
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,540
is drinking all by herself on this festive night?

683
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:30,810
You...

684
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,090
Just you wait.

685
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:32,890
Stand aside.

686
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,740
Leave.

687
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,020
No one dares to bullies a woman when I'm around.

688
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,260
(Wang's Dumplings)

689
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,220
Now go away.

690
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,850
Let's go.

691
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,650
So it's you.

692
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,850
You could at least thank me.

693
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,330
It's what a man should have done.

694
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,020
Miss Song.

695
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,650
You look gorgeous in the dress.

696
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,780
I bet you went to the Magpie Bridge tonight.
[*Usually with one's lover]

697
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,370
I'm not as debauched as you, Zhuo Wen Yuan.

698
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,220
Only Yan Yun Zhi

699
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,220
can walk the Magpie Bridge with me.

700
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,090
I can be certain

701
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,300
that you'll be alone tonight.

702
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,540
You...

703
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,260
Speak about yourself.

704
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,980
You should try winning Sang Qi back

705
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,700
instead of mocking me.

706
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm lonely?

707
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,130
What about you? You failed to win her heart

708
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,940
with the displays of affection.

709
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,020
You even embarrassed yourself.

710
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,410
Miss Song, getting upset at me
won't do you any good.

711
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,610
I won't fall for it.

712
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,810
I won't waste any time cheering you up.

713
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,330
Cheering me up?

714
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,650
I wouldn't need you

715
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,090
even if all men went extinct.

716
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,610
Jing Mu.

717
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,610
Yes.

718
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,460
Please escort Miss Song back to her home.

719
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,300
It's too dangerous for her
to be out here alone at night.

720
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,130
Yes.

721
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,300
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

722
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,460
Go back to your master.

723
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,570
I don't need his help!

724
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:07,940
Hold still.

725
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,700
Stay still.

726
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,130
Qi Lang.

727
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,780
San Lang. What is it?

728
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,650
Qi Lang.

729
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,170
After you were ambushed at the border of Jingzhou

730
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,540
and the assassination towards Official Wei,

731
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,130
I've been investigating

732
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,300
for leads the Wei family might have left.

733
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,090
Have you learned who the mastermind is?

734
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,060
Not yet.

735
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,650
When we arrived at the Wei Residence,

736
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,370
someone got ahead of us
and went through the house.

737
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,780
But there were witnesses in the neighborhood.

738
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,700
Recently,

739
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,700
a man who sells the Wei family's furniture off

740
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,300
has been to the house.

741
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,330
He may seem like a merchant

742
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,810
who sells the furniture off,

743
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,980
but he's actually a spy from Xizhao.

744
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,300
If he has the order to search this place

745
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,130
and is in contact with his comrades,

746
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,090
he's likely to know who the mastermind is.

747
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,610
Now

748
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,780
there is hope to find out which official
is commanding

749
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,370
and contacting Xizhao.

750
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,370
Yes.

751
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,570
This is their hideout.

752
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,700
Since Yu was involved,

753
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,130
you'd want to join the investigation.

754
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,170
That's why I notified you.

755
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:16,700
Come.

756
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,170
Qi Lang, some of the goods here

757
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,570
have been transported away.

758
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,330
Let's go inside.

759
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:54,170
Yes.

760
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,570
No sudden movement!

761
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:09,980
Unveil it.

762
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,890
This should be the plant Xizhao uses.

763
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,810
It has never been seen in Bianjing.

764
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,570
The powder that poisoned Sang Qi

765
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,220
must have been extracted from this plant.

766
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,700
Tell us,

767
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,060
who ordered you to transport the plants here?

768
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,650
I didn't bring the plants here.

769
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,460
I was hired to guard the smuggled salt.

770
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,500
Then I'll transport the salt

771
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,410
to other places based on the orders.

772
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,650
Probably someone was given the order
to bring the plants here.

773
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:04,890
San Lang, come with me.

774
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,170
I suspect

775
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,260
someone in Bianjing sells the smuggled salt

776
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,330
to Xizhao.

777
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,020
They traded it

778
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,540
to have Xizhao's poisonous plants
transported here.

779
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,650
Both the mastermind and Xizhao profit.

780
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:33,940
This place

781
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,170
should be one of the hideouts they use

782
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,740
for their illicit business.

783
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,410
They all have the pass.

784
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,780
They can travel freely.

785
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,410
Whoever is working in the dark

786
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,460
put great effort into securing

787
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,460
this transportation route.

788
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,020
The Wei family is incapable of pulling this off.

789
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,850
Don't you find the scent odd?

790
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,130
Now that you said it,

791
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,410
it smells pretty pleasant.

792
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,330
Pleasant?

793
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,060
Yes.

794
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,980
It's about the same fragrance

795
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,700
used by the ladies.

796
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,540
There is no way this is fragrance.

797
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,780
My nose hurt when I entered.

798
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,540
Qi Lang.

799
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,220
You don't look so good.

800
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,700
Your nose is swelling.

801
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,260
You should go home and rest.

802
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,500
Well...

803
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,740
Leave the rest to me.

804
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,570
It's the Prefecture Court's duty after all.

805
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,330
My men will seal off this warehouse

806
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,090
and secure evidence.

807
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,540
I'm counting on you.

808
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,890
It's part of my job.

809
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,620
(Qingfeng Restaurant, Shuiyue Shop)

810
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,330
Yan Yun Zhi and Yan San Lang

811
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,570
caught us off guard this time.

812
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,090
The warehouse has been raided.

813
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,410
The goods are now confiscated.

814
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,700
But fortunately,

815
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,570
they didn't find the ledger.

816
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,300
Be more cautious with the operation.

817
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,460
Yan San Lang has eyes and ears everywhere.

818
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,410
Remember,

819
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,610
do not operate near that warehouse.

820
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,300
Yes.

821
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,570
And reduce the number of deliveries.

822
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,130
They are waiting for us to make a mistake.

823
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,260
Madam Zhang.

824
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,460
Please proceed as Young Master Zhuo ordered.

825
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,220
Yes.

826
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,060
Young Master.

827
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,940
What news do you bear?

828
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,410
Yan Yun Zhi proposed,

829
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,980
but Grand Commandant Sang didn't give his consent.

830
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,020
Madam, Miss Su is here.

831
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,370
Come in.

832
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:12,780
Madam.

833
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,570
You are here, Lan.

834
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:16,980
You came at bad timing.

835
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,540
The orders for the imperial examination
came in today.

836
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,020
Yun Zhi is currently away.

837
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,650
(If you can't have his heart,)

838
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,220
you can first get close to him.

839
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,780
When a bond is formed between two people,

840
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,410
as they eat at the same table

841
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,700
and share the same bed,

842
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,940
it's only a matter of time

843
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,170
before you can win his love.

844
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,570
I came to have a chat with you.

845
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,850
I know you'll be alone in the house,

846
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,090
so I prepared some snacks for you.

847
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,260
I appreciate it.

848
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,220
It's been so long since you last came here.

849
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,090
Please, have a seat.

850
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,890
I know I shouldn't visit

851
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,810
because of my past with him.

852
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,740
After all, Yun Zhi

853
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,170
went to the Grand Commandant's
Residence to propose.

854
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:17,610
What was that?

855
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,610
