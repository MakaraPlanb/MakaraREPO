(Zhuo Wen Yuan, appointed as Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Personnel)

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,780
Zhuo Wen Yuan, appointed as Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Personnel.

34
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,110
This guy

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,110
usually fools around.

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,390
But to think he would be able

37
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,180
to get such good results.

38
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,860

It appears that Miss Sang...

41
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,140
I expected she wouldn't be appointed.

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,670
Please enjoy yourselves today.

44
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,620
I have prepared

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,780
fruit wine that has a low alcohol content.

46
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,190
I've already informed Scholar Feng as well.

47
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,220
So he won't

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,220
suddenly show up

49
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,030
and punish you.

50
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,750

51
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,580
- Come. Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,270
Have a seat.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,750
It has been a while.

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,620
Indeed.

55
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,700
Zhuo.

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,700
You scored the highest results,

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,310
and you were appointed as the Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Personnel.

58
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,830
Your future will be prosperous indeed.

59
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,110
How did that saying go again?

60
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,220
When you get lucky...

61
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,470
"Don't forget your friends when you get rich".

62
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,910
It's no wonder you didn't make the ranks.

63
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,980
Who cares?

64
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,140
I must get on Zhuo's good side first.

65
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,750
Don't forget about your old classmate

66
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,470
in the future.

67
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,420
Of course, I wouldn't.

68
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,190
We are all classmates.

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,980
Please continue to look after me in the future.

70
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,620
So humble.

71
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,860
But speaking of which,

72
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,860
Deputy Chief Yan's teaching was exceptional

73
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,750
this year.

74
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,220
And I heard he went to Grand Commandant Sang's
Residence to ask for his daughter's hand.

75
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,140
I suppose he is going to acquire success
in both love and career this year.

76
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,670
Didn't that fell through?

77
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,710
Then...

78
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,710
Since it fell through,

79
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,950
it doesn't count.

80
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,670
Even if Grand Commandant Sang agreed,
the marriage could be canceled at any time.

81
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,500
Even if they were married,

82
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,740
they could still get divorced.

83
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,220
That is why they say that you sure can
be sure about your drinking capacity,

84
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,550
but don't be so sure about your words.

85
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,020
All right. All right. Zhuo.

86
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,550
Please. Let's enjoy the dishes.

87
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,110
Yan Yan, have you seen Sang Qi?

88
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,180
Drinking your sorrows away?

89
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,990
But you can't get drunk off of this.

90
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,550
I'm not.

91
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,300
I'm trying to summon courage.

92
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,180
I took this opportunity

93
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,460
and got out of the house.

94
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,430
Deputy Chief,

95
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,060
why don't you help cover for me
while I go to see Lian Pian?

96
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,590
You promised you would

97
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,460
bring Lian Pian happiness, didn't you?

98
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,060
Then, you should think things through

99
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,950
carefully.

100
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,060
And you must persevere.

101
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,590
But don't drink.

102
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,900
Drinking won't solve your problems.

103
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,870
What's going on, Yan Yan?

104
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,340
You only drank a few cups of wine,
and you're already tipsy?

105
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,670
Song Luo Tian.

106
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,060
You're heartless indeed.

107
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,110
You're acting high and mighty

108
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,110
as if you were the top scholar.

109
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,340
You didn't even make it into the list!

110
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,390
Just wait and see.

111
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,990
You got into that Prefecture Court
or something, didn't you?

112
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,780
Who knows

113
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,460
who will serve the other in the future?

114
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,390
(Imperial College)
Young Lady, I'm fine.

115
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,110
Today is the announcement of the results.

116
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,500
I won't spoil your mood.

117
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,060
I feel happy too.

118
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,620
What are you saying?

119
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,300
It's fine if you're unhappy.

120
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,830
I have ways to cheer you up.

121
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,300
(Imperial College)
The Imperial College is holding a banquet today.

122
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,430
After we see the results,

123
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,990
I'll treat you to a feast
and a good time, all right?

124
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,220
You're the one who is expecting good results.

125
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,150
Why are we celebrating for me instead?

126
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,390
Because you're my little sister.

127
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,740
The Third Young Lady of the Sang family.

128
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,270
Of course, I have to treat you.

129
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:57,990
Let's go.

130
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,710
Young Lady,

131
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,950
it's no wonder that Young Master

132
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,340
wanted you to study here.

133
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,590
I can tell that this is a special place

134
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,390
the moment I entered.

135
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,020
How about it?

136
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,270
Do you want to study here too?

137
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,340
Don't tease me, Young Lady.

138
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,150
I am just a servant.

139
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,780
I can understand a storytelling script at best.

140
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,990
How could I possibly study here?

141
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,550
Well, you know more than enough words.

142
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,830
Either way,

143
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,670
I am confident that there will be

144
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,710
more and more female students
in the Imperial College in the future,

145
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,740
including you.

146
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,150
Let's go.

147
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,660
(Decree of Appointment)

148
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,990
Why isn't

149
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,340
Sang Qi's name on the list?

150
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,220
(Zhuo Wen Yuan, appointed as Vice Minister)
His Majesty has already been kind enough

151
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,430
to allow her to study here.

152
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,870
His Majesty can't possibly
let her become an official.

153
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,620
- That's right.
- Indeed.

154
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,900
I guess even if women can make it into the list,

155
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,340
they'll still have to go home

156
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,620
and serve their husbands
and take care of their children.

157
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,060
It's more than enough for them
to know a few words to manage the household.

158
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,180
- Right.
- That's right.

159
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,950
I heard

160
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,710
Deputy Chief went to the Grand
Commandant's Residence for marriage.

161
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,430
And Yan Xiao Lang

162
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,670
got together with her maid.

163
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,270
I had already expected this a long time ago.

164
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,870
From the start,

165
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,500
the Sang family already had ulterior motives.

166
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,950
You're right.

167
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,390
They come from different classes and backgrounds.

168
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,300
She doesn't deserve him.

169
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,590
So that's what happened.

170
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,110
Lian Pian, let's go.

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,620
Qi, you're here.

172
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,390
Everyone is already here.

173
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,830
I wasn't able to make it to the list.

174
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm ashamed of facing you, Deputy Chief.

175
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,180
Don't be disappointed.

176
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,390
You've already proven yourself.

177
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,350
You're late.

178
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,790
What's going on?

179
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,060
Why is everybody pulling a long face
seeing me here?

180
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,790
Everyone got their appointments

181
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,860
with their own merits.

182
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,590
You should all be happy.

183
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,350
You were on the list as well.

184
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,830
But you weren't appointed.

185
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,660
But everyone in Bianjing

186
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,350
knows how well you did.

187
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,620
This isn't fair.

188
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,420
That's right.

189
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,540
Even those who scored lower marks than you did
manage to land positions in the ministry.

190
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,350
They should give an explanation for this.

191
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,590
Sang Qi, at least you made it into the list.

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,790
And what about me?

193
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,390
I... I have to stay back for another year.

194
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,300
Guo Cheng, didn't you say you wouldn't
get drunk off fruit wine?

195
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,470
I'm not. I'm not drunk...

196
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,830
Wine does not make a man drunk,
but he is already confused.

197
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,300
We'll leave now.

198
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,740
Excuse us.

199
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,540
Slowly now.

200
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,860
An entire year...

201
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,980
That's enough. You guys don't have to comfort me.

202
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,790
I've already decided.

203
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,660
I, Sang Qi, won't give up.

204
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,230
But you're right too.

205
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,180
Since I made the list,

206
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,390
I deserve the same opportunities

207
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,060
as you do. Right?

208
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,620
Well, you're a tough one.

209
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,540
We've never had a woman
as an official in our dynasty.

210
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,740
I am the first female student
of the Imperial College.

211
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,300
I, too, can become
the first female official in our dynasty.

212
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,270
That's right, Sang Qi.

213
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,830
I will continue to support you

214
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,620
and help you

215
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,910
get back what you deserve.

216
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,030
Qi, we've known each other for many years.

217
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,390
I'll always support you too.

218
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,230
And I will be joining
the Ministry of Personnel soon.

219
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,100
I will gain more ways and contacts to help you.

220
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,180
Thank you.

221
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,660
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

222
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,740
As your teacher, I have to advise you.

223
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,500
You haven't even joined
the Ministry of Personnel yet.

224
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,230
As a new member joining the court,

225
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,790
you should learn

226
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,500
how to manage your own duties first.

227
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,950
The Deputy Chief of the Imperial College
is not a position of high status either.

228
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,060
Neither do you have much authority.

229
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,660
I will be able

230
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,540
to have more opportunities and a brighter future.

231
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,230
It's fine.

232
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,590
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

233
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,660
Thank you for your reminder.

234
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,150
But it's enough for me

235
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,620
to help Sang Qi.

236
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,180
Let's go.

237
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,470
Yan Xiao Lang.

238
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,950
Am I drunk?

239
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,150
Ow...

240
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,860
What my mother said

241
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,150
must have made you feel awful.

242
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,910
I talked to my mother.

243
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,060
Even though she still disapproves...

244
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,300
Yan Xiao Lang, maybe we should just give it up.

245
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,950
You're still mad after all.

246
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,740
I will try my best to get
my mother's approval as soon as possible.

247
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,660
Wait for me, all right?

248
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,660
Then what if she won't?

249
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,100
Would you let go of me first?

250
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,710
I will never.

251
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,270
You are the only one for me, Lian Pian.

252
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,790
Qi, what's on your mind?

253
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,470
The appointment?

254
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,300
Or Yan Yan and Lian Pian?

255
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,660
I thought

256
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,300
as long as I could get into
the Imperial College and study hard,

257
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,180
I would be able to change

258
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,150
the society's perception of women.

259
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,740
But I tried so hard

260
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,540
and in the end,

261
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,980
I was still restrained by societal norms.

262
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,860
My name was on the list.

263
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,980
But I was not appointed.

264
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,390
Lian Pian is a wonderful girl.

265
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,230
But Madam Yan still said
those awful things about her.

266
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,540
Qi.

267
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,950
What do you want to do the most

268
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,590
if you receive an appointment?

269
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,620
I want to go back to the Imperial College.

270
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,500
I thought about it a lot.

271
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,660
From when I entered the Imperial College

272
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
and met you and everyone else

273
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,270
until we are going our separate ways now.

274
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,180
I finally understood

275
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,790
why my brother wanted me
to join the Imperial College

276
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,950
and why he wanted me
to strive to get good results.

277
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,030
Perhaps he had already expected this.

278
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,500
That's why he wanted me

279
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,740
to help the women in this world

280
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,100
fight for this opportunity.

281
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,540
If I can go back to the Imperial College

282
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,390
and teach others...

283
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,100
No.

284
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,830
Even if I could just

285
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,590
get a minor position in the Imperial College,

286
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,620
that would already have great significance,

287
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,950
and I wouldn't disappoint my brother.

288
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,420
Qi.

289
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,270
Even if I

290
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,620
have to risk my position as Deputy Chief,

291
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,230
I will get you the title
and accreditation you deserve.

292
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,980
I said I wanted to become your colleague.

293
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,660
You're usually a stickler for the rules.

294
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,390
Why aren't you saying anything about it?

295
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,500
If you can stay in the Imperial College,

296
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,910
you will already be the greatest role model

297
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,790
for women to study.

298
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,180
That is much more significant
than me lecturing students every day.

299
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,790
Let's go.

300
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,340
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

301
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,590
I'll go inside now.

302
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,660
Rest early.

303
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,500
Go on.

304
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,620
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
Bai Shi.

305
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,830
I'm going to make a trip to the palace tomorrow.

306
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,830
Aren't you going to ask for her hand in marriage?

307
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,470
I have to ask His Majesty

308
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,350
to give Sang Qi her due appointment first.

309
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,660
If I ask her father for her hand now,

310
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,270
everyone will know

311
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,350
that she is my wife-to-be.

312
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,790
Rumors will spread.

313
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,270
They'll say that Sang Qi was only able
to stay in the Imperial College

314
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,300
because of me.

315
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,910
I can't let her go through that.

316
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,790
You're indeed thoughtful, Young Master.

317
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,300
Yan Yun Zhi.

318
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

319
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,230
You didn't come here

320
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,830
to show me what a wooden dummy

321
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,180
is like, right?

322
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,660
I was thinking of a matter.

323
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,750
It concerns Your Majesty's reputation
among the people.

324
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,780
I wish to ease Your Majesty's burden.

325
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,380
So I hope that Your Majesty will allow me

326
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,950
to do so.

327
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,540
Well, given your hesitance,

328
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,900
you don't appear convincing.

329
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,990
What is the matter? Tell me.

330
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,540
I would like to ask Your Majesty

331
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,140
to give Sang Qi an official position.

332
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,990
That's it?

333
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,540
Would that affect my reputation?

334
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,870
Firstly,

335
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,870
Sang Qi did make it into the list.

336
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,540
It is within all reason for her
to be awarded an official position

337
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,420
and for her to serve the imperial court.

338
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,380
Secondly,

339
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,140
Sang Qi

340
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
is the first example of a woman
studying in the Imperial College.

341
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,780
Everyone in the nation knows of this.

342
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,710
If she can become a female official,

343
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,060
then Your Majesty's benevolence
and efforts to push for education for all

344
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,780
would certainly be a great deed
recorded in history.

345
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,990
You make it sound so reasonable.

346
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,300
But do you know

347
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,380
how controversial it is
for a woman to become an official?

348
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,900
Now, what's this other thing

349
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,990
about easing my burden?

350
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,750
The Imperial College is short
of a Manager of the Archive.

351
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,900
It is a position neither too high nor too low.

352
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,470
Sang Qi is the perfect candidate.

353
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,710
If someone opposes it,

354
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,230
then I, as her teacher

355
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,110
and her superior,

356
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,350
will be the one to face the criticisms.

357
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,590
Your Majesty will not have to worry about that.

358
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,590
In doing so,

359
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,830
Your Majesty will have upheld the fairness
of the imperial examination

360
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,870
and quell the disputes among the people.

361
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,780
Wouldn't that be a win-win?

362
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,950
The Manager of the Archive
of the Imperial College.

363
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,830
Very well.

364
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,620
(To serve the people.
Appoint her as the Manager of the Archive.)

365
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,630
Yan Yun Zhi.

366
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,750
What if I was the one

367
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,060
who opposed the decision?

368
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,830
Your Majesty has already written
the decree of the appointment,

369
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,750
haven't you?

370
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,580
(Appointed her as the Manager of the Archive
of the Imperial College)

371
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,180
You must have bewitched me
with your honeyed words, haven't you?

372
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,140
I wouldn't dare.

373
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,020
You wouldn't?

374
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,630
I think you most certainly would.

375
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,420
I wouldn't dare.

376
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,990
Young Master.

377
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,660
Bai Shi. Help me change my clothes.

378
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,020
We'll make a trip to the Sang Residence.

379
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,830
I see you have

380
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,540
good news to tell Miss Sang.

381
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,710
Mind your steps.

382
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,380
When did Lan get here?

383
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,260
Young Master, I asked the servants about it.

384
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,470
Miss Su often comes to visit Madam

385
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,780
when you're not around.

386
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,420
And she usually stays for quite a while

387
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
and gets along very well with Madam.

388
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,140
Would you like to greet her?

389
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,510
Qi Lang!

390
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,470
Qi Lang,

391
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,750
why didn't you tell the family

392
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,020
that you went to ask for her hand in marriage?

393
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,020
You're unruly indeed.

394
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,180
I've already made it clear

395
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,420
about who I want to marry.

396
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,990
But it was against your wishes.

397
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,540
So both of you pretended you didn't hear.

398
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,870
I won't allow you to refute me.

399
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,230
I'm telling you,

400
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,830
we will never allow you to marry that Sang Qi.

401
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,830
That's fine.

402
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,470
Then, I'll just leave the family
and start a new one on my own.

403
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:33,870
You...

404
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,470
Young Master.

405
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,710
Wouldn't this be too direct?

406
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,350
Your expression is full of happiness.

407
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,900
Miss Sang will be able to know it right away.

408
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,180
Right.

409
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,020
You're right.

410
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,870
I should pretend that things didn't go well.

411
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,300
And give her a surprise later.

412
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,060
That's a good idea.

413
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,540
(Agarwood)

414
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,590
Young Lady, try the snacks I made.

415
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,860
All right.

416
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,060
(Muyan Pavilion)

417
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,110
Qi.

418
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,020
What's going on, Deputy Chief?

419
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,110
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

420
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,900
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,830
I wasn't able to get His Majesty to let you

422
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,990
work as the Manager of the Archive.

423
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,140
Oh, you had me worried there!

424
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,900
I wondered what the matter was.

425
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,510
Well, this matter is resolved.

426
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,380
So you already know.

427
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,300
That's right.

428
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,590
Thanks to Zhuo Wen Yuan.

429
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,510
He had someone
from the Ministry of Personnel put a word in.

430
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,510
I'm the Imperial College's
Manager of the Archive now.

431
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,230
I'm your colleague now.

432
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,020
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

433
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,590
That's right.

434
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,260
He and you...

435
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,870
Deputy Chief.

436
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,900
Let's not argue
over who gets the credit over this matter.

437
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
Sang Qi's happiness is the most important thing.

438
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,110
Deputy Chief was worried

439
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,230
that it might be inappropriate

440
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,300
for you to do such a thing
as you just joined the Ministry of Personnel.

441
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,060
But you already settled it today.

442
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,510
I never try to gain anything from you, Sang Qi.

443
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,590
I've always been sincere.

444
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,870
A thousand gold is worth nothing
before your smile.

445
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,180
We've been friends for so many years.

446
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,990
Don't say things like that.

447
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,420
It grosses me out.

448
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,060
Have a seat, Deputy Chief.

449
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,470
It's fine. There's no need.

450
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,180
I only came to tell you this.

451
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,260
Since this matter is already settled,

452
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,020
I'll take my leave now.

453
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,230
(Muyan Pavilion)
You just came, and you're already leaving?

454
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,780
I have some matters to attend to.

455
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,350
What a surprise indeed.

456
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,500
(Secretariat Chancellery)

457
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,950
Lan.

458
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,380
I heard you've been visiting my mother recently.

459
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,510
But you didn't tell me about it.

460
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,380
You've been very considerate.

461
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,630
I was only visiting her
because I had time on my hands.

462
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,750
That's perfect, then.

463
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,870
There are some things
I would like to talk to you about as well.

464
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,230
It has been a while since we had a chat too.

465
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,540
Let's find a place to talk.

466
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,180
Young Master. Miss.

467
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,020
Lan.

468
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,750
You've visited my mother many times.

469
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,750
Are idle talk all that you've done with her?

470
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,300
You must be bothered

471
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,590
because I told her

472
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,590
that you asked for Sang Qi's hand in marriage.

473
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,990
She must have tried to stop you, didn't she?

474
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,140
I am serious about that.

475
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,750
No one and nothing

476
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,180
will stop me.

477
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,950
You think too much.

478
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,110
To be very honest with you,

479
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,950
my feelings for you ceased

480
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,260
the moment I heard you asked
for her hand in marriage.

481
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,590
But as a friend,

482
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,780
I'm worried

483
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,900
about your actions.

484
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
You abruptly went to ask for marrying
her at her residence.

485
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,510
You must not have made proper preparations.

486
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,230
Her family

487
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,420
isn't as familiar with you as my family is.

488
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,140
Grand Commandant Sang
will definitely not accept it.

489
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,540
The Three Letters and Six Rites
are essential when it comes to marriages.

490
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,470
Not only do you need to
send your letter of Eight Characters,

491
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,590
but you will need to write
a letter of proposal as well.

492
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,470
Missing any of those will make you
appear rash and inappropriate.

493
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,540
Thank you for reminding me.

494
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,420
Oh, right.

495
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I prepared some snacks for Madam Yan as well.

496
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,900
I left them on the horse carriage.

497
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,830
Bai Shi, help Wen Yuan

498
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,060
to get those things.

499
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,750
Bai Shi?

500
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,230
Miss.

501
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,300
Young Master, should I go?

502
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,540
Or should I...

503
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,630
Go on. Come back quickly.

504
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,300
Yes, Young Master.

505
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,180
Yun Zhi, you mustn't be hasty.

506
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,590
This is an important matter
in your life, after all.

507
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,630
We have been friends for many years.

508
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,060
If there's anything I can help with,

509
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,630
I hope you won't mind

510
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,140
and let me know.

511
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,900
All right. I will.

512
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,750
But I heard

513
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,350
Grand Commandant Sang
has already rejected you once.

514
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,300
Are you sure that you will be successful next time?

515
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,900
If I fail, I'll just try again.

516
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,870
Until he agrees.

517
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,510
(Secretariat Chancellery)
Bai Shi!

518
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,540
Is Deputy Chief home?

519
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,470
Deputy Chief is home...

520
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,660
Wen Yuan.

521
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,710
But...

522
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,020
Lan is here as well?

523
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,140
She is here?

524
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,870
Qi?

525
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,660
(Secretariat Chancellery)
Why are you here, Lan?

526
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,060
I came to keep Madam Yan company.

527
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,990
Well, then, next time,

528
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,510
you can bring me along with you.

529
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,990
Qi, have you been here for long?

530
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,630
No.

531
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,380
I was just about to go back.

532
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,020
Then, I'll send you back...

533
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,630
No need.

534
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,180
Lan.

535
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,110
You're about to go back, aren't you?

536
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,470
Will you give me a ride back?

537
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,020
I can have a chat with you
on the carriage as well.

538
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,660
I don't mind. Let's get on the carriage.

539
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,260
Thank you.

(Secretariat Chancellery)

541
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,180
What did you tell her just now?

542

(Secretariat Chancellery)

543
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,540
Come to think of it,

544
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,950
I should apologize to you, Lan.

545
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,180
I understand your feelings for Deputy Chief.

546
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,900
But you should know

547
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,350
that feelings can't be forced.

548
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,590
But...

549
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,780
But I met Yun Zhi first.

550
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,780
There is no such thing as who came first in love,

551
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,420
isn't there?

552
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,940
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

553
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,380
Qi!

554
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,420
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
Qi.

555
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,470
I know

556
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,060
you saw Su Jie Yu and me together today.

557
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,780
But please don't misunderstand.

558
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,710
She came to see my mother.

559
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,260
There is nothing between us!

560
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,420
You look exactly

561
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,630
like how I was

562
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,630
when I wrote the right answer
during the exams but crossed it off.

563
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,780
Yes. Right.

564
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,260
I've reflected upon myself.

565
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,660
I was wrong.

566
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,870
That has to be the correct answer, right?

567
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,180
Yan Yun Zhi.

568
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,540
Yes.

569
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,990
You are not allowed
to be alone with any other woman again.

570
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,300
Of course. I promise.

571
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,830
Qi.

572
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,590
I hope

573
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,380
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
you will rest early today.

574
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,110
Because I need you to wake up early tomorrow.

575
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,110
Wake up early?

576
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,710
Grand Commandant Sang.

577
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,830
I came in haste last time.

578
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,710
I did not consider all the proper etiquette.

579
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,230
Today, I have written a letter of proposal,

580
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,420
and I have prepared all the bridewealth as well.

581
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,660
Please reconsider, Grand Commandant Sang.

582
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,020
Please allow me to take care of Sang Qi

583
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,830
for the rest of her life.

584
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,510
Father, this will do, right?

585
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,350
I'm thinking

586
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,510
that such an important matter

587
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,750
cannot be decided so easily.

588
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,110
If you think that there is something lacking,

589
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,950
please let me know immediately.

590
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,380
I'll make the arrangements right away.

591
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,420
Father, if you don't accept it,

592
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,060
I will.

593
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,300
Hold on.

594
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,990
I'm not late, am I?

595
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,110
It looks like you chose to come
today as well, Deputy Chief.

596
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,823
Grand Commandant Sang,

597
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,020
(Letter of Eight Characters)
for your daughter's hand in marriage.

598
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,230
Please consider allowing me to marry her.

599
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,870
Have you gone mad, Zhuo Wen Yuan?

600
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,900
This is the most serious decision
I have ever made.

601
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,300
You...

602
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,780
It seems

603
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,540
my Qi is well-liked.

604
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,060
I wondered

605
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,750
why you weren't the first to be here

606
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,470
for such an important occasion.

607
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,260
Good.

608
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,660
I think you stand a good chance.

609
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,420
- Father!
- Wait!

610
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,470
Grand Commandant Sang,

611
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,260
you should know

612
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,830
that Sang Qi and I have
long been in love, don't you?

613
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,870
You won't try to separate
a pair of lovers, would you?

614
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,350
(Letter of Eight Characters)
Grand Commandant Sang is just observant.

615
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,350
He knew that Sang Qi and I grew up together.

616
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,180
I understand and care for Sang Qi

617
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,630
more than you do.

618
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,510
Then have you asked
Sang Qi's opinion in this matter?

619
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,420
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

620
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,900
I have always thought of you as my closest friend.

621
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,710
We have always been

622
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,180
just that as well.

623
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,990
You've seen how Deputy Chief

624
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
and I got together.

625
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,380
Why are you doing this today?

626
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,660
Hurry up and go back.

627
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,470
Leave!

628
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:49,950
Qi.

629
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,780
I know you and Deputy Chief are in love.

630
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,630
But I have a chance to fight

631
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,990
for my love as well, don't I?

632
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,990
Besides,

633
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,140
I think Grand Commandant Sang favors me more.

634
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,780
One's parents should have the final say
when it comes to the matter of marriage.

635
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,830
My marriage

636
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,750
will be decided by myself.

637
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,060
Qi.

638
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,380
In that case,

639
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,900
we'll settle this the Sang way.

640
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,870
Fine.

641
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,020
Marriage is not a game.

642
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,420
Don't blame your daughter

643
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,710
for bullying an old man like you.

644
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,660
Qi!

645
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,140
Your father is

646
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,420
as skilled as ever.

647
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,950
Qi!

648
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,950
Qi, please stop messing around.

649
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,630
Grand Commandant Sang!

650
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,470
Qi!

651
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,750
What are you guys doing?

652
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,340
It is pointless for Qi and I

653
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,310
to fight here.

654
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,230
You guys should be the ones doing this.

655
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,900
A duel to decide the marriage.

656
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,470
Whoever wins will get to marry Qi.

657
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,180
Father.

658
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,550
I told you. I'll decide my own marriage.

659
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,790
What are you trying to do?

660
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,070
I get the final say in the Sang family.

661
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,710
I'll decide the rules.

662
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,340
You...

663
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,270
I have the say.

664
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,470
How about it?

665
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,620
Do you dare to duel?

666
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,790
- Why wouldn't I?
- Why wouldn't I?

667
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,420
Welcome everyone

668
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,580
to the Sang Residence's duel
for Young Lady Sang's marriage.

669
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,180
We hope that all young and capable
gentlemen will participate.

670
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,550
Welcome everyone

671
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,660
to the Sang Residence's duel
for Young Lady Sang's marriage.

672
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,790
We hope that all young and capable
gentlemen will participate.

673
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,500
(Sang)

674
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,340
Don't worry.

675
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,510
(Haoran Hall)
Today, the Sang family

676
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,140
has set up a stage here.

677
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,620
There are two things

678
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,340
we would like to announce
to the people of Bianjing.

679
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,660
First of all, the Sang family

680
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,860
has a new young lady.

681
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,820
My newly adopted daughter,

682
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,470
Lian Pian.

683
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,660
Great!

684
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,100
Secondly,

685
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,820
we will be hosting a duel
for my daughter, Sang Qi's marriage

686
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
right here.

687
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,030
Everyone here can be a participant

688
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,230
as well as a witness.

689
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,660
The Sang family is not concerned

690
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,270
about statuses and backgrounds.

691
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,550
As long as you are a young, unmarried man

692
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,470
of a suitable age, good character,

693
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,710
and are able to stand your ground

694
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,230
on this stage,

695
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,230
you may ask for Second Young
Lady Sang Qi's hand in marriage.

696
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,580
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

697
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,100
Great!

698
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:31,860
Young Master.

699
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,750
Didn't Grand Commandant Sang say

700
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,340
it was just a duel between you and Wen Zhuo Yuan?

701
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,580
Why has it turned into a battle

702
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,340
where every capable young man is allowed to join?

703
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,550
Grand Commandant Sang is most right to say that.

704
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,070
If it was just a duel between

705
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,340
Zhuo Wen Yuan and me,

706
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,310
it may be a fair fight,

707
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,140
but there are so many pairs of eyes here.

708
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,620
People may suspect
and say things about the Sang family,

709
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,950
and cause disputes between our families.

710
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,140
It risks causing tensions.

711
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,990
It makes sense when you put it that way.

712
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,710
Besides, I know

713
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,620
that the Sang family has been
practicing martial arts for generations.

714
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,990
They've been staying at the frontier
for many years. They favor the strong.

715
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,380
If I can't even handle the others,

716
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,070
how would I earn Grand Commandant Sang's approval?

717
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,140
Aren't you going to warm up?

718
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,420
No need.

719
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,470
Then, remember this.

720
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,660
Take care of yourself out there.

721
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,100
Don't get hurt.

722
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,180
I don't want to see bruises on your face.

723
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,990
Don't worry.

724
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,420
I am your senior.

725
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,900
Zhuo Wen Yuan's skills are inferior to mine.

726
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,230
Just get ready to become my wife.

727
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,070
Grand Commandant Sang,

728
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,380
I will win for sure.

729
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,820
I won't let Yan Yun Zhi

730
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,790
take Sang Qi away.

731
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,660
I may have organized this duel.

732
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,750
But my intention

733
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,820
was not to go against my daughter's will.

734
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,070
I'm giving both you and Yan Yun Zhi a chance

735
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,790
to prove your determination to marry her.

736
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,030
Your fate

737
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,580
lies in your own hands.

738
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,470
If you can do it, fight.

739
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,660
If you can't, give up.

740
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,270
Yes.

741
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,180
Zhuo Wen Yuan, the battle hasn't begun yet.

742
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,990
It's not too late for you to leave now.

743
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,230
Qi, if you're trying to get me to quit,

744
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,900
you can stop now.

745
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,580
I am not someone who quits

746
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,860
before even trying.

747
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,340
Qi, you can choose not to choose me.

748
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,990
You can choose Yan Yun Zhi.

749
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,340
But you can't stop me from pursuing you

750
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,660
and trying to marry you.

751
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,100
Zhuo Wen Yuan, you and I
have been friends for many years.

752
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,180
I don't want to see both of you

753
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,340
fight and get into a dispute out there.

754
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,270
I don't want to just speak without actions.

755
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,510
I want to prove my words.

756
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,420
I am going out there for sure.

757
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,100
Out of the way.

758
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,750
What's going on?

759
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,340
Back off!

760
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,660
Sang Qi, how could you do this?

761
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,030
How could you have Yan Yun Zhi
fight with someone over you?

762
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,860
I won't forgive you

763
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,900
if he gets hurt!

764
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,580
Miss Song.

765
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,860
You must have gotten all dressed up

766
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,990
to try and steal the attention today.

767
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,990
But...

768
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,380
That scent on you

769
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,340
is way too strong.

770
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,990
Did you use all of the perfume and aromatics

771
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,310
in a perfume store?

772
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,950
You're just tasteless.

773
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,580
This is a rare type of aromatic

774
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,860
my father specifically got me.

775
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,100
I'm the only one who has this in all of Bianjing.

776
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,860
Perhaps I am too ignorant, after all.

777
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,790
I've never smelled something so pungent.

778
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,990
This is strange.

779
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,510
There are so many people here.

780
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,710
But why isn't Yan Xiao Lang around?

781
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,380
Can you stop fanning yourself?

782
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,660
It seems no one dares to come onto the stage.

783
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,900
If there is no one else,

784
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,990
we will proceed to the final duel
with both of them.

785
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
Whoever wins

786
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,900
will be able to marry my Sang Qi.

787
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,230
Song Luo Tian from the Song family will duel!
