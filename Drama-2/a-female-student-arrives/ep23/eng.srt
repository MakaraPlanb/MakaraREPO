How's it?

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,510
It went well.

30
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,230
Ding Hao's statement

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,310
was unpolished.

32
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,910
He started

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,360
contradicting himself very soon.

34
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,040
It's worse than that.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
He doesn't know anyone

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
except for Grand Preceptor Yan

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,800
and Yan Yan.

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,950
We asked him the names

39
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,590
and he gave the wrong answers.

40
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,440
Deputy Chief,

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,830
I deserve some credit as well.

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,510
He was terrified

43
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,240
when I was interrogating him.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,720
If it weren't for me,

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,470
your investigation wouldn't be as easy, right?

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,190
Right, it's all thanks to you.

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,030
San Lang, have you recorded it?

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,160
I heard everything

49
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,160
in the next room.

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,080
I noted everything.

51
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,630
Now that his statement doesn't add up,

52
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,160
I can request for His Majesty

53
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,470
to reassess the case.

54
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,160
In that case,

55
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,720
Yan Yan will be fine, right?

56
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,670
That depends on His Majesty's decision.

57
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,240
We'll know in a few days.

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,110
We'll have to wait.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,520
Yan Xiao Lang!

60
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,800
Lian Pian!

61
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,440
Xiao Lang.

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,190
Lian Pian.

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,550
It's getting late.

64
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,800
Say it while you can,

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,880
you might not get the chance again.

66
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,600
You've suffered a lot.

67
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,000
It couldn't have been easy for you.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is nothing.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm much tougher than this.

70
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,630
I got too bored,

71
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,000
so I've been practicing
the Body-hardening Technique

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,190
my master taught me.

73
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,190
See?

74
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,080
I've become stronger.

75
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,030
Relax, silly girl.

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,720
Don't worry about me.

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,190
I did nothing wrong, so I fear nothing.

78
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,320
In a few days,

79
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,910
I'll leave this place as a free man.

80
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,910
One thing is certain.

81
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,910
Once I'm released,

82
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,520
we must settle the wedding.

83
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,720
I don't care if my mother beat me up.

84
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,960
I'll explain it to her.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
I will marry you.

86
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,080
I don't need your fancy words.

87
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,390
As long as you're safe,

88
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,240
I'll stay by your side

89
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,470
even if I can't be part of the family.

90
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,270
Lian Pian.

91
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,520
Sir.

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,390
They are in the moment

93
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,440
and basked in love,

94
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,070
please give them some time.

95
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,920
Stand aside.

96
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,790
(Prison)
Stand aside.

97
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,950
Let go.

98
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,640
Lian Pian!

99
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,510
Give us a little more time!

100
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,040
Lian Pian!

101
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,600
Xiao Lang!

102
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,390
Xiao Lang!

103
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,230
Xiao Lang! Xiao Lang!

104
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,640
Let go.

105
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,070
Xiao Lang!

106
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,040
Let go now!

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,110
Aren't you here to take him out with you?

108
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,760
We are.

109
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,510
Continue this when you're home.

110
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,510
I still want to go home on time.

111
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,110
We'll talk later.

112
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,200
If you're so great at acting,

113
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,760
you should start a play together.

114
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,000
Go on.

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,670
(Prison)
Just go!

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,110
Let's go.

117
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,830
Thank you for your service.

118
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,040
Don't mention it.

119
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,070
If my mother saw it,

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,670
she would be furious.

121
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,760
We proved Ding Hao's statement was false

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,070
and bailed you out,

123
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,720
but every official in the imperial court

124
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,480
keeps their hands out of your case.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,040
Only Grand Commandant Sang and Yan San Lang

126
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,110
are still defending you.

127
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,230
I knew this would happen.

128
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,760
No one wants to side with
the losing side. I'm not surprised.

129
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,000
What do you plan to do?

130
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,390
What else can I do?

131
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,640
Official Yan told me when I was released

132
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,270
that I couldn't return to
the Prefecture Court for work.

133
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,070
Even if I did,

134
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,070
I wouldn't be able to work on the case.

135
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,550
Of course,

136
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,390
I can make use of my network

137
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,350
to keep investigating.

138
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,830
I've met a lot of people

139
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,920
and learned many things over the years.

140
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,440
Judging by your spirit,

141
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,320
it seems we have nothing to worry about.

142
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,110
Our family

143
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,390
will never be part of these corrupted dealings.

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
We must

145
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,760
get to the bottom of it.

146
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,790
Yes. We have no time to waste.

147
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,040
The Song family might employ other schemes.

148
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,790
We can't let our guard down.

149
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,390
Come to our residence for now.

150
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,200
Never mind, I appreciate the thought.

151
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Going to your house

152
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,110
will only cause you more trouble.

153
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,040
That would make me an ingrate.

154
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,790
But...

155
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,950
I know you don't mind.

156
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,670
But I can't accept your offer.

157
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,390
Not to mention that the Yan Residence

158
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,070
needs someone to take care of it.

159
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,000
Young Lady.

160
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,200
Can I stay and keep Yan Xiao Lang company?

161
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,440
This place is deserted.

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,320
He can barely take care of himself.

163
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,110
If you are willing,

164
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,320
that will be great.

165
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,830
Let's clean this place up.

166
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,580
(Erudite)

167
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,070
Qi.

168
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,230
You fell asleep.

169
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,000
Deputy Chief.

170
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,790
Have you not slept well lately?

171
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,000
With what happened to the Yan family,

172
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,070
I can't sleep soundly.

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,350
But it's all right.

174
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,550
I'm fine.

175
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,590
Take a walk with me.

176
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,820
(Morning Dew Pavilion)

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,710
Aunt.

178
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,520
You were sloppy

179
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,520
with the Yan family's case.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,760
We didn't have the time.

181
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,840
Shifting the suspicion onto the Yan family
was more than enough.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,640
Fair enough.

183
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,760
Our target is not the Yan family anyway.

184
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,910
Remember,

185
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,960
cut the loose ends.

186
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,320
I understand.

187
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,840
I've heard rumors

188
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,790
that Song Jia Yin was telling people

189
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,550
that she was your rightful wife.

190
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,910
What now?

191
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,200
Are you planning something under my nose?

192
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,910
It wasn't my intention.

193
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,880
She's acting on her own.

194
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm not against the idea.

195
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,440
The Song family is just as influential
in the imperial court as the Sang family.

196
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,200
They've been working closely with us.

197
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,590
The Song family has always sided
with the winning sides.

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm wary of the risk they pose.

199
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,640
But if you marry Song Jia Yin,

200
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,230
your marriage

201
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,200
will save us a lot of trouble.

202
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,150
I beg to disagree.

203
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,000
Even if they side with us now,

204
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,030
they might abandon us for their gain.

205
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,350
When we work with the Song family,

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,550
we must always stay alert.

207
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,640
Great effort

208
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,110
doesn't guarantee great results.

209
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
If we must join hands with anyone,

210
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,470
it should be the Sang family.

211
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,710
Don't you dare bring them up.

212
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,640
Ever since Sang Qi came back to the capital,

213
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,520
you've wasted so much time over that girl.

214
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
She thwarted our plans time and time again.

215
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
Joining hands?

216
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,030
We should eradicate them!

217
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,960
It's time to set aside
your personal feelings for her.

218
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,880
Aunt.

219
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,080
Please give Sang Qi and me another chance.

220
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,030
What now?

221
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,080
Do I have to repeat every order

222
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,520
I give you?

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,520
Even if I agreed,

224
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,910
Sang Qi made her stance clear.

225
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,550
She is going to spend her life with Yan Yun Zhi.

226
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,400
Aunt, I have an idea.

You must be exhausted.

237
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,230
You brought me here so I could have fun.

238
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,960
Of course I should enjoy myself.

239
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,470
I enjoy every second

240
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,150
I spend with you, and I feel happy.

241
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
I've been thinking.

242
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,590
I want to spend more time

243
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,550
alone with you.

244
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,670
So why did you bring me to the mountain?

245
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,590
You could just visit me at my residence.

246
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,440
It's different.

247
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,350
There are too many distractions.

248
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,910
I want to have a more intimate time

249
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,400
with my loved one,

250
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,320
like this very moment.

♪May this budding romance♪

252
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,840
Why are you bringing it up now?

253
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,230
You hated it when I beat around the bush.

254
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,880
Now I just get to the point.

255
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,840
But you can't get used to it.

256
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,550
You are such a handful.

257
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,440
Your change is too sudden for me,

258
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,590
I need time to get used to it.

259
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,080
Besides,

260
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,110
what do you mean I'm a handful?

261
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,030
Then just leave me be.

262
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,030
I won't let you leave me.

263
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,320
You do the exact opposite

264
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,150
of what I say.

265
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,710
I even clean up after your mess.

266
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,910
Aren't you the handful?

267
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,110
What? Won't you do it for me?

268
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,350
On the contrary,

269
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,230
I will.

270
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,230
I'll be glad to do so.

271
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,790
Qi.

272
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
Are you feeling better lately?

273
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,150
I'm much better now.

274
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,910
After some quiet time out here on the mountain,

275
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,320
I feel much better now.

276
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,910
Shouldn't you thank

277
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,080
whoever brought you here?

278
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,910
Do you mean

279
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,670
my pony?

280
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,960
Young Master!

281
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,840
Bai Shi is back.

282
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,350
Calm down. What is it?

283
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,440
Miss Sang.

284
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,320
Grand Commandant

285
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,760
has been arrested by His Majesty.

286
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
What happened?

287
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,400
We should head back first.

288
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,790
Let's go.

289
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,710
(Grand Morale)
What happened?

290
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,470
I'm not sure either.

291
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,760
Grand Commandant and I
were discussing strategies.

292
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,880
Then a bunch of soldiers came

293
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,080
and arrested him with a royal decree.

294
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,590
That's not right.

295
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,640
My father came for the Yan family's defense,

296
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,710
but he never crossed any line.

297
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,320
He wouldn't have offended His Majesty.

298
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,550
It might not be the Yan family's case.

299
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Their target was

300
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,110
Grand Commandant Sang.

301
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,670
But...

302
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,640
Qi Lang, Qi.

303
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,520
What have you learned?

304
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,400
Nothing yet.

305
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,000
San Lang.

306
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
Could you arrange a meeting

307
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,230
with Grand Commandant Sang

308
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,910
or Grand Preceptor Yan?

309
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,080
It might be linked to Yan family's case.

310
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
That might be difficult for the time being.

311
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,880
(Grand Morale)
His Majesty ordered for Grand Commandant

312
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,030
to be sent to prison.

313
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,000
I have no power to intervene.

314
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,760
Grand Preceptor Yan is still in
the Prefecture Court's prison,

315
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,840
but His Majesty has ordered
to tighten the security.

316
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,710
I might have to make some requests.

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,440
How about this?

318
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,470
San Lang.

319
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,440
You and Yan Yan set up a meeting
with Grand Preceptor Yan.

320
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,350
Qi and I will request an audience
with His Majesty.

321
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,350
We need answers.

322
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

323
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,110
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

324
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,820
(Grand Morale)

325
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,080
His Majesty is busy.

326
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,030
Please leave.

327
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,150
His Majesty refuses to see us.

328
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,670
I understand.

329
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,840
We've been waiting here for a day.

330
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,550
We should get some food.

331
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,910
It won't do us any good

332
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,200
if we overwork ourselves.

333
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Let's go to the Qingfeng Restaurant.

334
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,230
We can ask around there.

335
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,790
Let's go.

336
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,500
(Qingfeng Restaurant)

337
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,880
Let's sit here.

338
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,590
Miss Sang, Mr. Yan, wait.

339
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,470
What's wrong?

340
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,350
I know you understand.

341
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,680
With the recent event,

342
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,310
it's best that we don't serve you.

343
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,040
Please don't make it difficult for me.

344
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,800
It's all right.

345
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,880
Deputy Chief, let's go somewhere else to eat.

346
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,310
I don't mind that.

347
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,560
But I must know why we can't stay.

348
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,190
But I...

349
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:46,950
Deputy Chief Yan!

350
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,920
You know it clearly yourself.

351
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,230
What else can it be?

352
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,640
Grand Commandant Sang was arrested by His Majesty.

353
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,950
Given his status,

354
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,830
it must be some heinous crime.

355
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,830
Perhaps

356
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,640
he's involved in treason.

357
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,160
Qi.

358
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,160
I don't mind if you have your dinner

359
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
in the restaurant.

360
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,280
However,

361
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,950
if your family really did get on

362
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,640
His Majesty's bad side,

363
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,400
the imperial court

364
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,000
might think we are his accomplice

365
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,350
for gathering in the same place.

366
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,640
How will we explain then?

367
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,590
With all due respect,

368
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,230
you are bad luck for everyone, Qi.

369
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,070
You are not welcome anywhere.

370
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,160
I think

371
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,040
you and Deputy Chief Yan should
return to the Imperial College

372
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,880
and stay put.

373
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,280
Miss, this way.

374
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,590
Mr. Zhuo.

375
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,280
Song Jia Yin, you asked me out

376
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,190
but were late yourself.

377
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,160
So why do you look so gleeful?

378
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,920
I apologize.

379
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,160
I'm late only because something great

380
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,430
happened.

381
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,830
I'm not interested in whatever good news you have.

382
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,280
Let's get down to business. Don't waste my time.

383
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,280
Mr. Zhuo, be patient.

384
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,160
Hear me out.

385
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,400
This great news

386
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,800
concerns both you and me.

387
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,680
Both of us?

388
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,680
Guess who I met downstairs.

389
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,160
Sang Qi and Yan Yun Zhi!

390
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,520
Mr. Zhuo, calm down.

391
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,590
Let me finish.

392
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,110
Sang Qi has fallen from her grace.

393
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,520
Without her father's support,

394
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,470
not even Yan Yun Zhi could keep her safe.

395
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,640
I seized the opportunity

396
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,830
to lecture her well just now.

397
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,430
Everyone in the Qingfeng Restaurant

398
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,350
chased her out.

399
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,310
Consider yourself avenged.

400
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,590
You are the Young Lady of the Song family.

401
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,280
When will you

402
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,800
stop being so reckless?

403
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,190
His Majesty was never clear
with his stance about the Sang family.

404
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,710
We don't know

405
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,710
what might happen.

406
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,280
If you ruffle Sang Qi's feathers,

407
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,560
she might bring down the Song family.

408
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,880
What will you do then?

409
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,470
I...

410
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,230
Whether it was good news or not,

411
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,520
I hope you think it through.

412
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,070
I have work to see to.

413
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,400
Goodbye.

414
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,340
(Grand Morale)

415
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,830
Qi.

416
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,800
Don't let that woman get under your skin.

417
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,040
I know.

418
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,230
Harsh words always come
when we lose power and influence.

419
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,310
It's normal.

420
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,760
I'm not surprised.

421
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,350
Whatever happens,

422
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
we'll face it together.

423
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,430
I'm worried about my father.

424
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,110
He's old.

425
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,520
What if the prison is too unbearable for him?

426
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,710
Don't worry.

427
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,110
He is Grand Commandant after all.

428
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,590
Judgment hasn't been passed.

429
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,280
No one will dare to hurt him.

430
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,160
I'll figure something out.

431
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,160
I'll find a way to arrange a meeting

432
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,000
with him.

433
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,110
Noble Consort, may I know why I was

434
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,190
summoned here?

435
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,950
According to my nephew,

436
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,640
you're a woman of pure heart and great refinement.

437
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,310
However, you seem depressed lately.

438
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,110
He asked me to make some arrangements for you.

439
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,950
Arrangement from Mr. Zhuo?

440
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,000
Calm down.

441
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,190
His Majesty arrives!

442
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,640
Your Majesty.

443
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,070
At ease.

444
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,830
And this must be

445
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,230
Miss Su.

446
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,000
I am Su Jie Yu. Greetings, Your Majesty.

447
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,040
At ease.

448
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,350
I thought you looked familiar.

449
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,920
That name sounds familiar too.

450
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,310
Very observant, Your Majesty.

451
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,070
She is the first bluestocking in Bianjing

452
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
that I mentioned the other day.

453
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,710
But what brought

454
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,470
the two of you together today?

455
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, Your Majesty.

456
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,400
Others might think

457
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,430
I don't deserve to be

458
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,070
in the presence of Miss Su's scholarly grace.

459
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,880
I'm very well-educated myself.

460
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,070
Jokes aside,

461
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,230
Miss Su here

462
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,710
has been anxious lately.

463
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,280
She came here for some advice.

464
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,880
She is of marrying age

465
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,640
and in search of a good suitor.

466
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,760
But none of the candidates

467
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,160
is to her liking.

468
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,760
It took me quite a while

469
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,760
to ease her worries a little.

470
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,880
Now that Your Majesty is here,

471
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,160
I wonder if Lan here

472
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,560
could have Your Majesty's blessing?

473
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,110
You're an interesting person, Noble Consort.

474
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,190
You haven't asked me to betroth your nephew

475
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,920
a wife.

476
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,040
But you're helping Lan first.

477
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,680
However,

478
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,230
I must grant you

479
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,350
that request.

480
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Miss Su, if any man caught your eyes,

481
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,920
I'll arrange the marriage for you.

482
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,110
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

483
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,500
(Prefecture Court)

484
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,000
Time is short.

485
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,400
Call me when you're done.

486
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Yes.

487
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,560
Father!

488
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,070
Why are you here?

489
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,040
Father.

490
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,280
Let's keep it brief.

491
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,920
Before you go arrested,

492
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,710
did you notice anything suspicious?

493
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,680
Not at all.

494
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,430
It was too sudden.

495
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,710
I discussed Yan family's case with His Majesty.

496
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,430
His Majesty seemed persuaded.

497
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,400
But I was arrested as soon as I got home.

498
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,040
That means

499
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,800
you didn't know

500
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,590
it was Grand Preceptor Yan
who got you dragged into this.

501
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,560
Yan? Why would he do that?

502
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,950
I don't know.

503
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,280
I only heard rumors.

504
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,000
Qi.

505
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,830
Do you ever suspect

506
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,520
that I was involved in any form of treachery?

507
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,560
It's not the time for jokes!

508
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,110
We have no time for that!

509
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,040
Fine.

510
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Deliberate plan, stealth operation,

511
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,310
and perfect cooperation.

512
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
Are you capable of these?

513
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,710
Can you?

514
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,520
A daughter knows her father best.

515
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,800
But this plot

516
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,160
is very well-thought.

517
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,920
I'm afraid it won't be easy

518
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,070
to resolve this crisis.

519
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,760
I know.

520
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,350
But we must find out

521
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,350
why Grand Preceptor Yan betrayed you.

522
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:23,800
Sit.

523
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,310
Yan.

524
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,920
Father.

525
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,800
What happened this time around?

526
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,110
Why was Grand Commandant Sang arrested?

527
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,680
It's because

528
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,830
a witness testified against Sang Wei.

529
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,470
A witness?

530
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,520
But Ding Hao's statement
was proven to be false, wasn't it?

531
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,830
It wasn't Ding Hao.

532
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,310
It's someone close to you.

533
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,520
Someone close to us?

534
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,380
(Muyan Pavilion)

535
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,310
Wei Zhan Hong fell off a cliff.

536
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,070
But why did he show up again?

537
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,190
He even testified.

538
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,680
Sang Qi, Official Yan said that on the day

539
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,950
Official Wei was ambushed, you were there too.

540
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,520
Did you notice anything suspicious?

541
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,400
That day,

542
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,350
(Wei Zhan Hong and Official Wei
split up and went separate ways.)

543
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,230
(When I finally found Official Wei,)

544
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,520
(he was already dead.)

545
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,160
But according to Zhou Wen Yuan,

546
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,560
he saw Wei Zhan Hong jump from the cliff.

547
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,190
After he jumped off the cliff,

548
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,830
the imperial court sent people
to search for his body.

549
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,470
But they couldn't find the remain

550
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,310
due to the harsh terrain.

551
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,880
In the end,

552
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,710
they closed the case because
they thought Wei Zhan Hong had died.

553
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
It's been so long.

554
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,280
If Wei Zhan Hong came back
to testify as a witness suddenly,

555
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,310
something must be amiss.

556
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,590
Our top priority is to find Wei Zhan Hong.

557
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,920
We must confront him.

558
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,110
That is the only way

559
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,400
to prove Grand Commandant Sang's innocence.

560
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,470
But we don't know where he is.

561
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,310
Yan San Lang, do you have any lead?

562
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,640
Wei Zhan Hong's return was a secret.

563
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,350
The Prefecture Court didn't receive any news.

564
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,190
Now,

565
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Wei Zhan Hong must have been hidden somewhere.

566
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,280
Not to mention

567
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,880
the Prefecture Court is not in charge of the case.

568
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,110
It won't be easy to track down

569
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,070
Wei Zhan Hong.

570
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,070
Time is running short.

571
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,800
We'll split up and gather information.

572
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,350
We must find Wei Zhan Hong at all costs.

573
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,000
That is our only option.

574
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,560
Let's start now.

575
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,400
Let's go.

576
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,920
Things don't add up.

577
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,830
Someone must have orchestrated this plot.

578
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,310
The person knew Wei Zhan Hong was alive.

579
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,520
Or perhaps Wei Zhan Hong was saved before

580
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,070
he jumped.

581
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,040
And then they kept him hidden away.

582
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,280
They waited for

583
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
the right timing

584
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,310
to send Wei Zhan Hong back to Bianjing as a witness

585
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,310
to give a false statement

586
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,230
so Grand Commandant would be arrested.

587
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,350
I don't understand.

588
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,160
Wei Zhan Hong's father died because of Xizhao.

589
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,040
Why would he still work for Xizhao

590
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,470
to frame my father?

591
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,230
The mastermind

592
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,190
is skilled at tactics.

593
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,640
Perhaps Wei Zhan Hong was tricked into helping.

594
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,230
Unfortunately for them,

595
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,710
when they sent out

596
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,920
Wei Zhan Hong for their plot,

597
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,040
they also exposed their existence.

598
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,590
If we find Wei Zhan Hong,

599
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,430
we can trace the tracks

600
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,470
back to the mastermind.

601
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,520
Official.

602
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,680
We found nothing.

603
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:11,950
Come.

604
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,430
- Come.
- Come.

605
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,280
Sang Qi.

606
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,800
Why do you call

607
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,760
for this gathering?

608
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,110
I haven't seen you since graduation.

609
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,350
Since I have some free time today,

610
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,950
I hope to meet up.

611
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,430
Where are Zhuo Wen Yuan and Yan Yan?

612
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,590
I heard Zuo Wen Yuan is now

613
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,000
the rising star of the Ministry of Personnel.

614
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,640
Perhaps he's too busy.

615
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,070
Yan Yan and his family...

616
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,680
Don't poke at their sore spot.

617
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,470
Enough about that.

618
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,350
Dig in.

619
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,110
- Let's dig in.
- Eat up.

620
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,190
Dig in.

621
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,160
My father was framed and sent to prison,

622
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,950
but truth prevails.

623
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,310
I believe His Majesty will get to the bottom of it

624
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,920
and clear my father's name.

625
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,760
Indeed.

626
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,400
Grand Commandant Sang is a righteous man.

627
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,950
He is loyal to the imperial court.

628
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,680
We have no doubt

629
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,040
about his morality.

630
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,310
Fortune favors the strong,

631
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,310
his name will be cleared.

632
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,000
Thank you.

633
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,000
By the way,

634
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,280
people from our cohort have quite eventful lives.

635
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,040
First, the Wei family got into trouble

636
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
and Wei Zhan Hong died.

637
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,350
Then the Yan and Sang families

638
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,680
got caught up in lawsuits.

639
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,760
But from what I heard,

640
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,880
the imperial court never found Wei Zhan Hong's body.

641
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,590
Perhaps he is still alive.

642
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,920
He is presumed dead.

643
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,640
No one heard from him afterward.

644
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,430
It's unlikely that he still lives.

645
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,310
- That makes sense.
- Indeed.

646
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,760
Father, are you going out?

647
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,350
I have a discussion with some officials.

648
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,190
You're in a hurry.

649
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,280
Did something happen to the imperial court?

650
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,520
Speak your mind. What do you want to know?

651
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,800
I heard that a witness testified against

652
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,470
Grand Commandant Sang.

653
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,230
Is Grand Commandant in danger?

654
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,760
What else do you know?

655
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,310
This is confidential information.

656
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,070
His Majesty interrogated him personally.

657
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,800
Even now,

658
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,470
I still don't know the identity of that witness.

659
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,470
Grand Commandant San's case is unlike anything.

660
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,470
You must not be caught up in it.

661
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,640
The officials are all in fear.

662
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,560
Do not cause any trouble.

663
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,400
The Sang family is in trouble,

664
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,430
I must help them.

665
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,520
What can you possibly do?

666
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
The situation in the imperial court is
treacherous and unpredictable.

667
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,350
The signs are clear,

668
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,590
even my hands are tied.

669
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,560
What more can you do?

670
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,350
Yun Zhi, a righteous man must
stay away from possible dangers.

671
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,230
Watch your back.

672
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,830
I asked around in the city.

673
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,800
I got nothing.

674
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,560
Song Luo Tian doesn't seem to know anything either.

675
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,040
I was secretly monitoring the Song Residence.

676
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,830
There was nothing unusual.

677
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,310
I asked around.

678
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,950
Not even the officials have any clues.

679
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,160
Does no one in the entire city of Bianjing

680
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,400
know Wei Zhan Hong's whereabouts?

681
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,760
Perhaps

682
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,920
someone might.

683
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,180
(Zhuo Residence)

684
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,110
If Zhou Wen Yuan knows where Wei Zhan Hong is,

685
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,830
that will mean he is the mastermind.

686
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,590
I hope I'm wrong about this.

687
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,700
(Zhuo Residence)

688
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,710
Miss Sang.

689
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,160
My Young Master welcomes you inside.

690
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,800
Deputy Chief Yan, sorry.

691
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,590
Only Miss Sang is invited to get in.

692
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,920
Don't worry.

693
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,760
I've been Zhuo Wen Yuan's friend for years.

694
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,520
He won't harm me.

695
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,680
I'll be right back.

696
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
Stay cautious.

697
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,950
Qi, you're finally here.

698
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,800
It was usually me who often
went over to your residence.

699
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,950
I lost count of how many times I've been there.

700
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,590
This is the first time
you have come here as a guest.

701
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,950
I have some questions for you.

702
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,400
Have patience.

703
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,800
We can save it for later.

704
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,160
Let me show you around.

705
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,680
Come.

706
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,590
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

707
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,760
This way.

708
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,000
Qi.

709
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,800
You should have a meal here.

710
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,470
I'll ask the cook

711
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,710
to prepare your favorite cuisines.

712
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,400
- We can have braised pork hocks...
- Zhuo Wen Yuan.

713
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,470
Can we get down to business?

714
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,800
I was hoping we could catch up

715
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,000
and have a chat.

716
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:05,800
Never mind.

717
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,800
I know you came because of your father.

718
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
I can help you clear his name.

719
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,710
I can't get him his title back,

720
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,280
but at least his life will be spared.

721
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,520
Do you really have Wei Zhan Hong with you?

722
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,360
Wei Zhan Hong?

723
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,040
Isn't he dead?

724
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,670
If he's not here,

725
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,230
how do you clear my father's name?

726
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,950
I have my ways.

727
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,150
But this is a serious matter.

728
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,230
Grand Commandant is charged
for connection with Xizhao.

729
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,190
No official wants to be involved.

730
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,800
As an outsider,

731
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,320
I don't share any ties with Grand Commandant.

732
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,560
I should just mind my own business.

733
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,040
Unless...

734
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,040
Unless he becomes my family.

735
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,560
Then I will risk my life and wealth

736
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,390
to clear his name.

737
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,190
Family?

738
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,870
You want me to marry you?

739
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,280
No, Qi.

740
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,800
I'm not forcing you.

741
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,360
But this is the only way

742
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,280
we can save your father.

743
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,120
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

744
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,760
You threaten me with my father's life.

745
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,470
Do you not remember

746
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,230
how he looked after you and cared for you

747
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,840
at the frontier fortress?

748
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,470
What have you become?

749
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,870
Who was the one that changed?

750
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,840
We used to be inseparable.

751
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,950
But ever since you met Yan Yun Zhi,

752
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,910
we started to grow apart.

753
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,360
I did so much for you.

754
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,910
But Yan Yun Zhi, who you just met means more to you

755
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,280
than I ever will.

756
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,080
And now you want to marry him.

757
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,320
Qi, trust me.

758
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,150
Yan Yun Zhi will only bring you sufferings.

759
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,230
You will always be in danger because of him.

760
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,630
Only I can keep you safe.

761
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,840
Only I can protect your family.

762
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,910
You will understand someday

763
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,080
that I am the best option you have.

764
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,390
I've said it before.

765
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,870
We can only be friends.

766
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,910
But I want to be more than just a friend!

767
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,840
You can decide whether your father

768
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,080
lives or dies.

769
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,900
(Muyan Pavilion)

770
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,360
I never thought Zhuo Wen Yuan was so obsessive.

771
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,710
He threatened me with my father's life.

772
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,910
Although he denied

773
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,870
having Wei Zhan Hong in his hands,

774
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,800
to turn this case around,

775
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,910
we need Wei Zhan Hong to withdraw his confession.

776
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,870
There is no other way.

777
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,560
Zhuo Wen Yuan must be connected to this plot too.

778
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,560
I refused to seek Zhuo Wen Yuan's help

779
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,040
because I feared

780
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,950
he might be connected.

781
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,390
But I didn't expect

782
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,150
he'd become such a person.

783
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,710
Qi.

784
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
People can change easily.

785
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
We don't know what they'd become.

786
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:47,910
Don't worry.

787
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,800
We will come up with a sound solution.

788
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,390
Judgment of your father's case hasn't been passed on.

789
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,870
We can still save him.

790
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,950
I will find Wei Zhan Hong

791
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,040
and clear your father's name.

792
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,230
I hope so.
