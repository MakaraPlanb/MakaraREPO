00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,480
Mr. Zhuo,

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,190
Prefecture Court has decided to act.

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,120
What do you plan to do?

32
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,630
Let's wait and see what happens.

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,800
Yan Yun Zhi and the others
don't have solid evidence yet.

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,270
Otherwise, they wouldn't just

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,040
tail us.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,360
Tell your people to stay put

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,630
and lie low for now.

38
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,680
Are we going to keep wasting our time with them?

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
The salt route has been stalled.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,830
The plantation trade is ruined as well.

What is Xizhao

42
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,080
going to do in the long run?

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,320
We're in sensitive times right now.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,880
We have to be careful.

45
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,470
If they get anything else on us,

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,470
you and I will both be in danger.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,000
One wrong move and all will be lost.

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,390
That's why

49
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,910
we need to remain calm.

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,270
Mr. Zhuo,

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,880
I suggest you make your decision soon.

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,080
Xizhao is only cooperating with the Zhuo family

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,390
because there is something for us to gain.

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,030
Now, you've entered the court

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
and gained authority.

56
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,440
But you haven't made good on your promises.

57
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,320
It would do you no good

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,160
to upset Madam Zhang.

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,360
Why are you here?

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,270
I haven't seen you in a few days.

61
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,750
I was worried if you weren't feeling well,

62
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,320
so I came over to check on you.

63
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,000
You're thoughtful indeed, Madam.

64
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,880
Darling,

65
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,240
you've been terribly busy

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
with work lately.

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,550
I prepared some wine and snacks.

68
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,270
Why don't you come to my room
to enjoy and relax a little?

69
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,750
I see.

70
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,670
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

71
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,110
Let me do this

72
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,240
as an apology.

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
Since Madam is sincere,

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,630
you shouldn't refuse, Mr. Zhuo.

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you, then.

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,320
Darling!

77
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,160
What are you doing?

78
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,390
I'm teaching you the rules of the Zhuo family.

79
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,830
See if you would dare

80
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,080
to listen in again.

81
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,390
You...

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,960
Come on, Qian Jiu.

83
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,270
Let's go to her room and enjoy the wine.

84
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,390
We shouldn't waste her efforts.

85
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,080
Thank you, Madam.

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

87
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,720
you heartless man!

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,240

Doesn't it?

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,040
Look. This is new.

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,640
(Tea)
Yes.

99
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,040
Smell this.

100
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,070
It smells nice.

101
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,550
This is top-quality aromatics.

102
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,480
It does smell nice.

103
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,350
Yes.

104
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,950
- Smell this.
- Look at this.

105
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,510
How dare you touch me

106
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,830
in broad daylight?

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
Me?

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,390
I didn't touch you!

109
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,440
Are you denying it?

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,200
What's a big man like you
doing before a perfume stall?

111
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,670
That's right.

112
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,880
You even acted suspiciously.

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,830
Your eyes are like a rat's.

114
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,950
I can tell you're not a good person.

115
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,790
That's right.

116
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,480
No, I have to find someone!

117
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,160
It wasn't me!

118
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,040
Listen to me!

119
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,440
It was just a misunderstanding!

120
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,600
I need to find someone!

121
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,160

122
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,950

124
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,950
Why did you ask to see me

all of a sudden?

126
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,640
Son-In-Law,

127
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,550
you're still in the dark.

128
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,880
Trouble is about to befall us!

129
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,320
Why do you say so?

130
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,550
I just heard from a reliable source

131
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,350
that among those Xizhao people
who stole the ledger for us,

132
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,640
some survived.

133
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,670
The Prefecture Court is interrogating them
in secret right now.

134
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,550
They are about to get a confession!

135
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,440
Is this true?

136
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,040
You, young people, are too rash and careless.

137
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
How could you let

138
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,390
the Prefecture Court get a hold of the evidence?

139
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Is your source reliable?

140
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,600
That doesn't matter.

141
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,950
It's better to believe the rumors

142
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,070
than doing nothing right now.

143
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,670
No matter if it's true or not,

144
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,110
we can't let our guard down.

145
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,720
And I heard from Luo Tian

146
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,550
that the government offices around Bianjing

147
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,230
are mobilizing elite officials

148
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,720
to the Prefecture Court.

149
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,350
Doesn't this prove

150
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,070
that they are about to make their move?

151
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,600
Don't worry, Father-In-Law.

152
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,510
I will

153
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,440
handle this.

154
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,950
This...

155
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,230
Young Master.

156
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,270
I was incapable.

157
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,070
I lost track of her.

158
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,670
And I embarrassed you as well.

159
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,110
But Young Master, you know me.

160
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,270
I would never do such an unscrupulous thing!

161
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,550
All right. All right.

162
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,510
We believe in you.

163
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,110
Deputy Chief,

164
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,640
something is wrong with Madam Zhang, after all.

165
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,160
She is definitely someone not to be belittled.

166
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,880
We thought we would

167
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,070
follow her as she tries
to make contact with her companions

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,920
to find the other hideouts of Xizhao.

169
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,320
But she got away.

170
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,350
That's all right.

171
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,350
Sooner or later, she'll get herself caught.

172
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,320
We can use the evidence we found

173
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,670
on the corpse now.

174
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,670
San Lang,

175
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,000
have you made the arrangements I asked?

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,880
I've made

177
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,950
all the arrangements accordingly.

178
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,110
We can leave at any moment.

179
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,550
It's time to reel in the net.

180
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,510
Capture them.

181
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,200
Yan Yan.

182
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,070
Present!

183
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,550
Get the men and come with me.

184
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes!

185
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,510
Young Master.

186
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,000
What did you guys find

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,350
when you examined the body?

188
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,640
The victim has hard calluses on their fingertips,

189
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,110
but their palms are smooth.

190
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,880
A musician?

191
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,600
Scissors.

192
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,320
Ambergris.

193
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,840
Only Shuyu Hall will use this

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,790
in all of Bianjing.

195
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,280
Take him away!

196
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,880
Yes!

197
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,350
His face is oily and covered in herpes.

198
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,880
He must have been exposed
to oil and fumes for a long time.

199
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,710
There are calluses on the palms
and burns on the back of the hands.

200
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,640
I think...

201
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,470
He used to be a cook.

202
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Discreetly investigate
all the inns and restaurants nearby.

203
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,030
See if there are any missing cooks lately.

204
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,000
Understood.

205
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,000
Sir.

206
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm back!

207
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,200
Stop!

208
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,200
Get him!

209
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,710
Stop!

210
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,080
Don't move!

211
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,000
There are marks on his shoulders

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,230
and clear indentations.

213
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,200
A porter.

214
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,470
(Tea)

215
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,030
Search carefully!

216
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,670
Yes!

217
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
Over there!

218
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,400
Chase after him!

219
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,640
Move!

220
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,230
His feet appear to have been
soaked in water for a long time.

221
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,880
Dry lips. Dark skin.

222
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,110
He was probably...

223
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,000
A fisherman.

224
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,760
Fresh fish!

225
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,880
Take that!

226
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Don't move!

227
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,840
Take him away!

228
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,110
Those men have been
serving Xizhao for many years.

229
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,150
If the Prefecture Court
gets a confession from them,

230
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,790
the consequences will be unimaginable.

231
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,280
Everything we've worked
so hard to build in Bianjing

232
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,470
will be ruined as well.

233
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,520
Mr. Zhuo.

234
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,280
Can't you use your authority in court

235
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,350
to help Xizhao overcome this difficulty?

236
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,350
After the incident with Wei Zhan Hong,

237
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,110
His Majesty has grown wary of me.

238
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,110
The Zhuo family won't get involved
any further either.

239
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,350
Lest we risk getting ourselves into trouble.

240
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,640
I have never put off

241
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,080
a single thing you asked of me.

242
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
I have tried my best to fulfill every one of them.

243
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
But now that Xizhao is in trouble,

244
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
are you going to stand by and do nothing, Mr. Zhuo?

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
We are in the same boat.

246
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,840
If Xizhao falls,

247
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,200
will the Zhuo family be able to get away?

248
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,640
I'm in a difficult position right now as well.

249
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,080
Besides,

250
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,110
that piece of information might not be reliable.

251
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,320
It might be Yan Yun Zhi's tactic

252
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,350
to lure us out.

253
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,520
To rush into action right now

254
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,150
would cost us an even bigger loss.

255
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,150
If Mr. Zhuo refuses to help us, fine.

256
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,320
I will report this matter accordingly.

257
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,790
As for what to do,

258
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,470
Madam Zhang will decide.

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,080
Take them to the prisons.

260
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,760
Yes, sir!

261
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,710
- Move!
- Move!

262
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,910
Hurry up!

263
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,640
Move faster!

264
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,550
Will someone come and save them?

265
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,670
Someone will come.

266
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,550
But they might come to silence them instead.

267
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Qian Jiu.

268
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,840
You're back.

269
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,030
You went out today and never came back.

270
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,440
So I've been worried.

271
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,400
I heard from Mr. Zhuo

272
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,710
that our contact points in Bianjing

273
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,400
have all been destroyed.

274
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,080
I wanted to warn them.

275
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,590
But the Prefecture Court

276
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,080
had already planned an ambush.

277
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,790
I didn't have a chance to tell them at all.

278
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,520
So,

279
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,000
our people

280
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,670
have confessed?

281
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,590
They have captured more of our people again.

282
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,910
I fear the situation will only get worse.

283
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,280
I have gathered men from outside the city.

284
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
Tomorrow, we will sneak into
the Prefecture Court.

285
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,350
We can't let these people
fall into the Prefecture Court's hands.

286
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,230
I've been planning for all these years.

287
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,320
I can't let all my efforts be in vain.

288
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,150
The Prefecture Court came prepared.

289
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,030
It will be a dangerous trip.

290
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,440
Please let me go with you

291
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,230
to assist you.

292
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,590
Qian Jiu.

293
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,760
You've been by my side the longest.

294
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,230
You may be my subordinate,

295
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,550
but I've always thought of you as family.

296
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,230
I can't let you come with me.

297
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,840
If anything happens to me...

298
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,790
you will be the person in charge of Xizhao.

299
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,550
You must lead and restore Xizhao.

300
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,470
Madam Zhang! But...

301
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,760
I've made my decision.

302
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,790
You need not say more.

303
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,350
Understood.

304
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,470
Mr. Zhuo,

305
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,590
you heard everything.

306
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,760
You do not have to be so guarded against me.

307
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,110
We are allies, after all.

308
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,110
I won't stand aside and do nothing tomorrow.

309
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,550
Tomorrow night, I will have my men

310
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,710
cause trouble in Bianjing.

311
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,320
The Prefecture Court will have
to send people to solve the matter.

312
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,030
You can infiltrate the cell
when the security is loosened.

313
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,030
That will be helpful.

314
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,230
I'll trouble you then, Mr. Zhuo.

315
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,200
You should decide what to do next too.

316
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,440
What do you mean, Mr. Zhuo?

317
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,200
No matter what happens tonight,

318
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,960
the government won't let things go that easily.

319
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,550
You can't stay in Bianjing anymore.

320
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,960
These are customs clearance documents.

321
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,960
(Custom Clearance Pass)
It'll ensure that you can leave safely.

322
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,320
I left some money
and land deeds inside the box as well.

323
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,880
(Owner, Zhuo Wen Yuan)
Those will last you for the rest of your life.

324
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,840
So you've planned all of this for me.

325
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,670
I'm just doing this for myself.

326
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,670
So you never cared about me, after all.

327
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,520
(Wanchang Banknotes)

328
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,400
You sure spent a lot

329
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,030
to protect yourself.

330
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,400
Qian Jiu.

331
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,080
Don't listen to Madam Zhang.

332
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,670
Xizhao is not worth sacrificing your life for.

333
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,320
As acquaintances,

334
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,590
I don't want to see you get hurt.

335
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,760
Please leave.

336
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,230
Mr. Zhuo,

337
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,840
if things fall through,

338
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,320
have you thought about what to do?

339
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,840
Whether I have a backup plan or not,

340
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,550
I don't have a choice.

341
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,230
Mr. Zhuo.

342
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,350
I'm afraid I have to let you down.

343
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,870
(Prefecture Court)

344
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,590
Young Master,

345
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,160
the Prefecture Court is in a mess right now.

346
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,710
Xizhao is prepared to make their move as well.

347
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,400
This operation must be successful.

348
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,920
Failure is not an option.

349
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,190
Understood.

350
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:02,920
Sir,

351
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,430
you've returned.

352
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,710
Someone came to make a report earlier.

353
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,400
They said that there was a mob fight
on the west side of the city.

354
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,760
Official Yan wants you to handle it.

355
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,560
What?

356
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,190
Again?

357
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,470
What is going on tonight?

358
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,430
These cases keep happening one after another.

359
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,040
Where is Song Luo Tian?

360
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,830
Official Song is taking care
of other cases right now.

361
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,560
He hasn't returned yet.

362
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,950
That guy.

363
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,070
Can't count on him when you need him.

364
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,710
Never mind.

365
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,070
Come on, let's make another trip.

366
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,190
Yes.

367
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:34,521
Let's move.

368
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,560
Let's go.

369
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,400
Where are you guys going
in the middle of the night?

370
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,040
Attack.

371
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,400
Keep them alive!

372
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
Didn't I say to keep them alive?

373
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,430
So it was you.

374
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,110
We meet again,

375
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,110
Deputy Chief Yan.

376
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,230
Take her away.

377
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes!

378
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,760
How is it?

379
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,760
She's dead.

380
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,640
A carved token?

381
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,310
Could this belong to the head of the Xizhao Group?

382
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,520
Madam Zhang is the head of Xizhao?

383
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,230
Split up and interrogate
the Xizhao criminals immediately.

384
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,520
We can't waste another moment.

385
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,230
All right.

386
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,190
Yan Yan, head to the Zhuo's Residence immediately.

387
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,520
Bring Zhuo Wen Yuan in for questioning.

388
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,310
Yes!

389
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,640
Let's go!

390
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,350
Qi.

391
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,070
(Qingxin Hall)

392
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,040
How is the interrogation going?

393
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,680
After seeing their leader's death,

394
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,160
they confessed.

395
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,590
They identified Madam Zhang
as the head of the Xizhao Group.

396
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,800
Qian Jiu is her right-hand woman.

397
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,040
But they don't know

398
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,190
who was the person in the court
conspiring with Xizhao either.

399
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,590
At least we learned something.

400
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,950
Deputy Chief,

401
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,190
has Qian Jiu not confessed

402
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,880
who Xizhao's ally is yet?

403
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,760
She only admitted that she works for Xizhao.

404
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,310
She refused to say anything else.

405
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
Let me see her.

406
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,590
I want to ask her about my brother.

407
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,000
So it's your turn to interrogate me, Miss Sang.

408
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,190
Qian Jiu.

409
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,710
I'm not here to interrogate you.

410
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,800
I want to ask you something.

411
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,110
Don't waste your time.

412
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,520
I won't give up anyone.

413
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,710
I'm not here about that.

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I just want to know

415
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,830
how my brother died.

416
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,110
He is just a scholar.

417
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,640
He had nothing to do with Xizhao.

418
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,470
Why did you have to take his life?

419
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,400
It has already been so long,

420
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,350
and you still can't let it go.

421
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,280
Fine.

422
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,040
The night is long.

423
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,160
There is nothing else for me to do.

424
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
I'll tell you the truth.

425
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,040
I did not intend to kill him at first.

426
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,280
But he went to a place he shouldn't have.

427
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,110
He saw things he shouldn't have.

428
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,350
Excuse me.

429
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,190
I'm here to pick up some medicine.

430
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,720
(Spring's Touch)

431
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,590
Sir, your medicine.

432
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,560
Thank you.

433
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
(Name list: Ministry of Justice...)
Sang Yu accidentally took

434
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,230
a secret letter from Xizhao
that contained a name list at the apothecary.

435
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,350
Sang Yu.

436
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,190
Deputy Chief is looking for you.

437
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:23,800
All right.

438
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,470
We got the name list in the end.

439
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,110
But Sang Yu saw it.

440
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,760
To avoid unnecessary trouble,

441
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
I had to silence him.

442
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,590
Why did he get the name list in the apothecary?

443
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,230
Who was meant to receive that name list?

444
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,640
Tell me!

445
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,560
Does it still matter?

446
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,160
Either way, I killed your brother.

447
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,350
If you want revenge,

448
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,800
come and get it.

449
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,710
I am a sitting duck

450
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
right now.

451
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,430
You get to decide

452
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,040
if I live or die.

453
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,190
If you miss this opportunity,

454
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,110
you'll regret it.

455
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,110
Tell me.

456
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Did Zhuo Wen Yuan have anything to do with this?

457
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
Miss Sang,

458
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,920
Mr. Zhuo is only a cover I sought in Bianjing.

459
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,190
Everything between us is just an act.

460
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,430
There are no feelings whatsoever.

461
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,800
You, on the other hand,

462
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,310
have been leaving broken hearts everywhere.

463
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,880
You make men fall all over for you.

464
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,040
If you came to Qingfeng Restaurant,

465
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,760
you would definitely take the title
of the top courtesan from me.

466
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,280
Qian Jiu.

467
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,710
Your leader is dead.

468
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,230
The others have confessed.

469
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,430
Why are you still so determined to hide it?

470
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,110
I will admit to what I did.

471
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,880
But I won't accuse the innocent.

472
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,350
Please leave,

473
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,400
Miss Sang.

474
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,710
It was a night of full moon in early summer.

475
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,920
I asked my friend to prepare some fine wine,

476
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,040
and I enjoyed it with Qian Jiu on the boat.

477
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We had a wonderful time.

478
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,310
Nothing out of the ordinary happened that night.

479
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,760
She even played the guqin for me.

480
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,400
What was the tune

481
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,710
she played that night?

482
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,160
Official Zhuo.

483
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,070
I asked you to cooperate with the investigation.

484
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,430
I didn't ask you to tell me about these things.

485
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,560
Official Yan.

486
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,040
You said

487
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,950
to tell you everything
regardless of how detailed they may be.

488
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,430
The clue to this investigation

489
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,920
may lie within these everyday affairs.

490
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,400
Please don't be hasty

491
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,000
and allow me to tell you everything.

492
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,040
That's enough.

493
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,230
I only have one question.

494
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,310
Qian Jiu lived in your residence.

495
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,110
She is a Xizhao thief.

496
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,230
So, you aren't involved in this matter at all?

497
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,160
Then let me ask you something as well.

498
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,950
Official Yan is an official
of the people in Bianjing.

499
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,950
Could it be that you were involved
in every single case

500
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,110
of fraud, deception, and kidnapping in Bianjing?

501
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,710
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

502
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,640
you're being casuistic!

503
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
Official Yan,

504
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,110
I only refuted you once.

505
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,160
And you've already lost your temper.

506
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,310
But ever since I stepped inside this room,

507
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,830
you've kept pushing me.

508
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,350
You treated me like a criminal.

509
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,640
I'm only here to assist you
with your investigation.

510
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,230
Do you plan to convict me right here, right now?

511
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,800
You...

512
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,470
Official Yan.

513
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,920
I still have work to do tomorrow.

514
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
I shall take my leave now.

515
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,400
(Confession)

516
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,830
Young Master,

517
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,040
the Prefecture Court has captured Qian Jiu.

518
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,160
This is bad for us.

519
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,590
Yan Yun Zhi is cunning
and has a lot of tricks up his sleeves.

520
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,190
I'm worried she will give us up.

521
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,920
Mr. Zhuo.

522
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,830
Are you here to save me?

523
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,680
You're here to send me off.

524
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,000
You shouldn't have come back.

525
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,400
You shouldn't have come either.

526
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,040
You should let your men

527
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,560
handle something as trivial as this.

528
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,040
Could it be...

529
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,040
that you can't bear to let me go?

530
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,560
You should know

531
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,310
what punishments you will face.

532
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,800
But I don't want you to suffer

533
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,830
through all of those.

534
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,310
Mr. Zhuo!

535
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Aren't you worried that I will change my mind

536
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,430
and give you up instead?

537
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,920
Mr. Zhuo,

538
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,350
this is the last joke I will make.

539
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,590
Please take care of yourself.

540
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,400
Qian Jiu has confessed

541
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,190
and signed the papers.

542
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,160
The truth about my brother's death

543
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,110
has finally come to light.

544
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,280
But I don't understand

545
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,640
why she didn't give up

546
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,110
the person behind all of this.

547
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,680
She may never tell us.

548
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,710
I still want to try.

549
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,710
She is determined to stay silent and die.

550
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,710
I don't think she will tell you.

551
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,640
I'll try again.

552
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,150
(Confession, Qian Jiu)

553
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,400
I've already confessed.

554
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,950
Why have you come again?

555
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,430
Because you're still hiding something.

556
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,520
Xizhao has been committing evil deeds
for many years.

557
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,360
Xizhao would not have been able
to stay hidden for so long

558
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,390
if they did not have an inside person
within the court.

559
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,320
Sang Qi.

560
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,710
You and Yan Yun Zhi

561
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,040
just want justice for Sang Yu.

562
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,520
Xizhao has fallen.

563
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,080
You got what you wanted.

564
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,670
I advise you

565
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,320
to let go of things.

566
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,670
Those who have been working with Xizhao

567
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,040
are still at large out there.

568
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,520
As long as they are still out there,

569
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,840
there will be no peace in this world.

570
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,280
I already have one foot in the underworld.

571
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,000
Matters in this world

572
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,230
have nothing to do with me anymore.

573
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,910
Qian Jiu.

574
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,760
If you can help the court get rid of these vermin,

575
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,150
His Majesty may spare your life.

576
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,710
Even an ant struggles to live.

577
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,600
Do you really not care about your life at all?

578
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,040
They taught me how to kill
and how to lie since I was a child.

579
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,630
I've never lived like a person.

580
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,950
I've long been a living corpse.

581
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,470
In this world,

582
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,230
he was the only one who treated me with kindness.

583
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,430
And now...

584
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,560
We can't go back anymore.

585
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,080
Who is that person?

586
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,630
Is he Zhuo Wen Yuan?

587
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,910
Qian Jiu!

588
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
Quick, get the physician!

589
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,230
No need.

590
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,150
I've learned poisons since I was young.

591
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,870
This poison

592
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,670
has no cure.

593
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,560
If you knew it was poisoned,
why did you still eat it?

594
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Because...

595
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,150
this is the last thing...

596
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,430
I can do for him.

597
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,390
Excuse

598
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,560
me.

599
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,470
I'll take a nap for now...

600
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,710
There will be other ways.

601
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,470
Sir,

602
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,190
we've checked all the officers

603
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,390
who have come in contact with the food.

604
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,560
We didn't find anything suspicious.

605
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,600
To be able to get the poison into the prison
without anyone noticing.

606
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,190
How capable, indeed.

607
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,320
Qi Lang.

608
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,600
Did you find anything from the poison?

609
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,910
This poison did not come from Xizhao.

610
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,470
I can't find any other clues yet.

611
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,870
Killing her

612
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,760
to silence her forever.

613
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
The person Qian Jiu tried so hard to protect

614
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,280
wanted her life so badly.

615
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
I will inform His Majesty of this

616
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,150
along with the other matters in court tomorrow.

617
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,230
No matter what,

618
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,470
we've eliminated huge trouble

619
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,670
for the court by bringing down the Xizhao Group.

620
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,080
Thank you

621
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,430
for both of your help.

622
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,630
How about this?

623
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
Come with me to the palace tomorrow.

624
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,040
I'll try to ask His Majesty to reward you guys.

625
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,120
I just want my father to return safely

626
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,760
and justice for my brother.

627
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,280
I don't need anything else.

Either way,

637
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,040
the truth about Brother Yu's death
has come to light.

638
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,910
I'm sure he will be able

639
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,430
to rest in peace now.

640
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,950
But I didn't expect

641
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,840
His Majesty doesn't want
to pursue the matter any further.

642
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,320
Zhuo Wen Yuan got off easy.

643
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,430
You and Sang Qi made such an achievement.

644
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,600
But he only gave words of praise.

645
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,670
He didn't say anything else
about the marriage either.

646
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,000
It's not fair at all.

647
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,080
Indeed, we don't have evidence

648
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,360
to prove that Zhuo Wen Yuan is allied with Xizhao.

649
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,120
It makes sense that His Majesty
won't pursue the matter any further.

650
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,280
Besides,

651
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,190
Qi and I didn't help the Prefecture Court

652
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,230
for rewards.

653
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,710
His Majesty has agreed to release my father.

654
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,630
Let's go and pick him up.

655
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,080
No need to rush, Sang Qi.

656
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,470
His Majesty's decree will take a while

657
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,670
before it reaches the prison.

658
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,710
How about this?

659
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,320
I will personally go
and pick up Grand Commandant Sang.

660
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,760
I guarantee that he'll be able

661
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
to return to his residence today.

662
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,120
Go back and prepare

663
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,190
to receive him.

664
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,320
All right.

665
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,150
All right.

666
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,280
Let's go.

667
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,770
(Muyan Pavilion)

668
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
Qi.

669
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,280
what are you...

670
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,870
I'm making snacks for my father.

671
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,600
So he can have freshly made snacks

672
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,150
when he comes back later.

673
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:46,910
In that case,

674
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,230
I should contribute too.

675
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Let me help you.

676
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,560
Do you know how to make snacks?

677
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,230
I don't，

678
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,470
but I can learn.

679
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,520
Young Lady,

680
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,190
I'll check on the stove in the kitchen.

681
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,150
Wash your hands first.

682
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,600
I'll let you knead the dough.

683
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,560
Kneading the dough is the hardest part.

684
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,280
All right.

685
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,630
I've seen someone knead it before.

686
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,520
I think this is how we do it.

687
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,840
That's not how you knead it.

688
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,760
- I'll show you.
- I...

689
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,520
Watch closely.

690
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,560
Fold the dough backward and push it forward.

691
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,280
Repeat the same method.

692
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,760
Knead until you reach the end

693
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,390
and flip it over.

694
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,320
Then...

695
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,040
Like this?

696
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,390
