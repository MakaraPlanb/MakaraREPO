It's not proper for you to behave this way.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,910
What's not proper about this?

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,910
You

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,910
can't stand seeing someone
more attractive than you.

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,390
Miss Song,

34
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,590
you should leave.

35
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,860
Stop making it difficult for Qi.

36
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,820
All of you are always on Qi's side.

37
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,950
I can't stand it.

38
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,460
I'm not leaving either way.

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,500
You can drive me out

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,270
if you can.

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,910
It's the first I heard anyone made such a request.

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,030
Very well then.

43
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,350
You...

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,350
How dare you touch me?

45
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,740
Did you think the Song family is nothing?

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Listen.

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,910
Drag me out if you can!

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,270
Pardon me for doing this, then.

50
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,820

Put me down!

52

Zhuo Wen Yuan!

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,270
Put me down!

Qiong Yu!

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,910
Everyone, get back to your reading.

56
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,270
All right, there's nothing to see.

57
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,580
Put me down! Do you hear me?

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,740
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,070
Miss Song, you can let go now.

60
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,580
Yin, are you all right?

61
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,270
Mr. Zhuo,

62
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,020
you usually look considerate towards women.

63
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,540
I didn't expect you to be this rude.

64
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,460
I do treat women nicely,

65
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,510
except those who go against Sang Qi.

66
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,070
Both of you came to the Archive.

67
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,350
You don't know the etiquette nor keep quiet.

68
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,820
I can't treat people like you nicely.

69
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,870
All right, I'm not so good at arguing.

70
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,820
But Yin is different.

71
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,150
In Bianjing,

72
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,710
Yin is not scared of anyone.

73
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,630
Yin.

74
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,100
All of you always take Qi's side

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
and bully me!

76
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,100
I clearly won the bet.

77
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,300
But Director Chief Yan helped her got out of it.

78
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,630
Both of us are Young Ladies
of prestigious families.

79
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,300
Where's the difference?

80
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,150
I know

81
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,430
all of you say I'm arrogant, willful

82
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,630
and don't know my place behind my back.

83
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,710
But I'm doing this

84
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,820
because I like him.

85
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,230
What did I do wrong?

86
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,660
Where did I do wrong?

87
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,540
Enough.

88
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,460
I...

89
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,460
Calm down a bit.

90
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,100
If you keep making a scene,

91
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,150
it'll be more embarrassing.

92
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,350
What are you doing?

93
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,790
Nothing.

94
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,630
It's rare to see you being so cute.

95
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,180
I forbid you to say that!

96
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,460
I...

97
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,260
I'm not badmouthing you.

98
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,670
I think

99
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,420
you behaving like this

100
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,740
is more lovable than being arrogant.

101
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Why don't you change your behavior?

102
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,390
Lovable... Lovable?

103
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,700
All right.

104
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,700
Stop bearing grudges against Sang Qi.

105
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,980
I lost to Yan Yun Zhi during the tournament.

106
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,300
When it comes to losing face,

107
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,980
I have it worst than you.

108
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,670
What is it again?

109
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,230
Are you going back home later?

110
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,830
Wait for me for a moment. I'll send you.

111
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,700
Yin?

112
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,910
Why are you stunned?

113
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,790
Nothing.

114
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,830
Miss Song, let's go.

115
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,140
Father.

116
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,420
Isn't this our golden boy, Mr. Zhuo?

117
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,020
What brings you here?

118
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,550
Father, he sent me home.

119
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,070
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Zhuo.

120
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,300
Mr. Zhuo,

121
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,140
I'm already home.

122
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,420
You can leave now.

123
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,790
We'll meet some other day.

124
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,950
Jia Yin,

125
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,350
go back to your room first.

126
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,980
Grand Tutor Song,

127
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,670
I have something to discuss with you.

128
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,910
Let's go to my study.

129
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,260
This way, please.

130
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,510
Tell me, what is it?

131
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,390
Do you still remember

132
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,910
the warehouse that was confiscated?

133
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,420
Yes.

134
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,300
Wasn't it cleaned up already?

135
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,860
It's not as clean as you thought.

136
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,950
May I ask

137
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,390
if you used that warehouse

138
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,230
for Miss Song's aromatic?

139
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,070
Yes, I did.

140
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,510
You should be careful now.

141
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm afraid

142
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,510
you're being watched now.

143
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,390
Is this true?

144
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,070
It's highly likely.

145
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,580
You must be prepared.

146
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,790
I'm not badmouthing you.

147
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,070
I think

148
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,460
you behaving like this

149
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,950
is more lovable than being arrogant.

150
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Why don't you change your behavior?

151
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,180
Get out of my way!

152
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,990
- Leave!
- Go!

153
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,310
I...

154
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,060
No one dares to push a woman in front of me.

155
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,990
Song Jia Yin,

156
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,020
what's wrong with you?

157
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,460
You must remember

158
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,140
that you're the future wife of Deputy Chief Yan.

159
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,670
You can't think of another man.

160
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,940
But

161
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,500
Mr. Zhuo is also one
of the Four Bachelors of Bianjing.

162
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,310
He's also the top scholar
of the imperial examination.

163
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,620
Even Father said

164
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,110
that he's now a popular official.

165
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,670
He's no worse than Deputy Chief Yan.

166
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,790
The main point is, he treats me well.

167
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
What I meant

168
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,620
is to marry the most outstanding man in Bianjing.

169
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,190
But these two men have their own merits.

170
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,110
I have to give up one of them.

171
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,580
It's so hard for me.

172
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,700
How can I choose

173
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,380
between these two people?

174

(A Place for the Talented)

175
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,940
(Gathering of Scholars)

176
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,700
I didn't know the Imperial College

177
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,910
has so many collections of books.

178
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,500
It'll be great if I can study here.

179
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,230
What's on your mind?

180
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,430
Imperial College used to recruit students
from prestigious families.

181
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,230
It rarely opens its enrollment to the public now.

182
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,700
If you can enroll here,

183
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,380
you'll have to thank heaven for its blessing.

184
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,870
Let me help you.

185
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,500
Everything is great here.

186
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,940
But there's a female teacher here

187
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,870
that doesn't make sense.

188
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,430
I even heard

189
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,350
Manager Sang managed
to enter the Imperial College

190
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,190
because she's the daughter
of the Grand Commandant.

191
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,020
Maybe opening it to the public

192
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,870
is just to make way for prestigious families

193
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,060
like the Sang family.

194
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,580
Exactly.

195
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,060
You're right.

196
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
I was indeed blessed because of my family

197
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,550
to study at the Imperial College.

198
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,430
However, passing the examination with honor

199
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,430
and my official rank

200
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,350
are based on my effort.

201
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,750
You can simply say whatever you want.

202
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,380
- He's right about that.
- That's right.

203
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,550
I can prove it to you.

204
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,260
All right.

205
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,140
But it won't involve the horseback archery skill.

206
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,310
That's what you learn at home,

207
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,940
which has nothing to do with the Imperial College.

208
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,020
Of course.

209
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
If I were to write
an imperial examination article here,

210
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,750
it'd be wasting your time.

211
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,460
The Archive is my workplace.

212
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,260
Why don't you test me here?

213
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,230
What do you think?

214
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,260
How do you want me to test you?

215
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,820
There are hundreds of books here.

216
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,350
Altogether, there are thousands of books.

217
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,460
It may be a lot,

218
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,020
but I learned them all by heart.

219
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,430
Pick any book.

220
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,310
As long it's here,

221
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,460
I can find it for you.

222
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,550
All right.

223
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,110
"Laozi Zhi Gui".

224
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,550
It's not that hard, right?

225
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,820
"Laozi Zhi Gui".

226
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,310
"Laozi Zhi Gui"

227
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,310
is written by the Taoist hermit
of the Western Han Dynasty, Yan Zun.

228
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,790
The interpretation of Laozi

229
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,620
is expressed in verses.

230
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,460
But I recommend

231
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,910
reading Heshang Gong's Commentaries

232
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,310
along with this book.

233
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,790
It should be more beneficial.

234
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,020
What do you think?

235
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,790
Is this the book you want?

236
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,430
I indeed enter the Imperial College

237
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,380
as the Grand Commandant's daughter.

238
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,940
But I received far more criticisms

239
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,350
than others.

240
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,550
The so-called opening to the public

241
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,620
is not a gimmick.

242
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,500
It's to let everyone

243
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,550
treat every student fairly.

244
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,460
There's no need to be particular

245
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,460
nor criticize others.

246
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,310
They only need to study

247
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,110
at the Imperial College without worries.

248
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,430
- She's right.
- That's right.

249
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,580
She has a point.

250
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,670
We

251
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,190
only need to study.

252
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,670
Qi,

253
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,790
that was a great defense.

254
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,580
It was rational, and you know
when to advance and retreat.

255
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,060
That's because you taught me well

256
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,190
and showed good examples.

257
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,910
I rarely compliment you.

258
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,580
Why are you flattering me now?

259
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,020
I was complimenting myself.

260
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,350
You're my favorite person.

261
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,110
So I should compliment you

262
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,550
on raising your value a little.

263
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,460
It

264
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,990
would show that I have great taste.

265
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,060
Moreover,

266
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,260
from now on,

267
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,820
you'll have to work hard

268
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,620
to make me proud.

269
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,700
Manager Sang.

270
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,260
Then, I'll get back to work.

271
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm going to strive hard now so I can make you proud.

272
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,750
- Let's drink.
- Here.

273
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,500
Qi Lang, there you are.

274
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,700
Why are we meeting today?

275
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,990
Isn't your birthday soon?

276
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,670
I want to know if you have plans.

277
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,350
I've forgotten about it.

278
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,020
I've been too busy

279
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,670
with Qi's appointment at the Archive.

280
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,500
I know you don't like making it grand every year.

281
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,380
So we waited until the right moment

282
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,500
to remind you.

283
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,910
So?

284
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,430
Are we going to have a meal

285
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,750
like before?

286
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,550
We should let it go this year.

287
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,910
I have other plans.

288
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,020
See?

289
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,580
I told you Qi Lang

290
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,460
would ignore us this year.

291
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,140
So you lost.

292
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,190
Qi Lang, I was wrong about you.

293
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,140
How's the investigation on the warehouse?

294
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,020
It's falling into place.

295
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,110
Today, we found
a group of suspicious salt merchants.

296
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,230
We're about it capture them.

297
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,910
You can wait without worries.

298
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,990
I hope we can

299
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,670
find out who's the mastermind.

300
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,670
Let's have a drink.

301
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,990
We'll talk about it later.

302
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,060
Young Master,

303
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,870
do you have other plans
for your birthday this year?

304
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,350
How come I don't know anything about it?

305
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,700
Qi will make arrangements
for my birthday this year.

306
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,140
But does Miss Sang know your birth date?

307
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:34,990
Sister.

308
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,190
Sister!

309
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,350
Sister.

310
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,110
Why are you here?

311
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,230
I'm on duty now.

312
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,670
Can't we talk at home tonight?

313
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,700
I can't. It's urgent.

314
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,020
I can't wait until tonight.

315
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,990
Now that you have all grown up
and become an official,

316
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,500
and my matter is not important anymore?

317
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,790
Of course, not.

318
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,190
What is it?

319
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,870
I ran into a huge problem lately.

320
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,430
I want to know what you think.

321
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,060
Between Deputy Chief Yan and Zhuo Wen Yuan,

322
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,460
who is better as your brother-in-law?

323
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,580
Sister, I understand your dilemma.

324
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,790
Lately, I've been thinking about something too.

325
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,500
Do you think I should be the Chancellor

326
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,380
or the Grand Commandant?

327
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
You spent too much time with Yan Yan

328
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,820
that you started teasing me.

329
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
Sister, it hurts.

330
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,140
Let go. I was wrong.

331
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,460
If my subordinates saw this,

332
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,670
how am I supposed to face them?

333
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,110
It's the most important event in my life.

334
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,140
You should be more serious about it.

335
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,580
I thought you wanted to marry into the Yan family.

336
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,990
Why does Zhuo Wen Yuan come into the picture?

337
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,940
I did think of Deputy Chief

338
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,140
because he's the only one
in Bianjing who's worthy of me.

339
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,110
But

340
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,940
Zhuo Wen Yuan has been more popular lately.

341
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,060
The most important thing

342
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,380
is that he treats me nicely.

343
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,910
When did that happen?

344
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,990
You've never told me before.

345
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,380
Stop messing around first.

346
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,940
What matters most

347
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,260
is who I should pick between these two.

348
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,140
It's so frustrating.

349
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,830
I have an idea.

350
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,500
It's the most important thing in my life.

351
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,020
Are you going to let this coin decide?

352
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,220
The head is Deputy Chief Yan.

353
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,620
The tail is Zhuo Wen Yuan.

354
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,070
Trust me.

355
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,830
Flip it.

356
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,550
It's head.

357
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,710
For an important thing like this,

358
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,430
it should be decided after three rounds.

359
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,740
I'll do it again.

360
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,590
Since you're swayed,

361
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,980
that means you're not thinking
about Deputy Chief Yan,

362
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,100
but Zhuo Wen Yuan.

363
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,260
You have a point.

364
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,220
Not bad, my brother.

365
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,500
After you've become an official,

366
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,710
you've become smarter now.

367
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,710
I'm glad to know that.

368
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,590
Since I've already decided,

369
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm going to tell Sang Qi.

370
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,380
All right, you can get back to work.

371
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,310
I'm leaving now.

372
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:06,910
Let's go.

(Gathering of Scholars)

376
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,590
Miss Song, you're here again.

377
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,020
But you dress more decently this time.

378
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,790
What do you want to tell me?

379
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,590
Don't disturb the students reading.

380
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,980
Qi, is it confirmed

381
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,860
between you and Deputy Chief?

382
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,710
Although

383
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,220
I'll be the official wife
and you'll be the concubine

384
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,620
when we marry into the Yan family,

385
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,100
it'll be better

386
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,310
to have a person all to myself.

387
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,140
I'm here to tell you

388
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,190
that I'm not going to fight you
over Deputy Chief anymore.

389
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,980
I'll let you have him.

390
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,550
What is it that you're up to now?

391
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,500
I've taken a fancy on Mr. Zhuo.

392
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,020
Mr. Zhuo?

393
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,620
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

394
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,260
Enough.

395
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,620
I've already made it clear to you,

396
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,590
so stop asking.

397
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,430
That's all for now.

398
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,590
Let's go.

399
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,190
Qi.

400
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,980
Deputy Chief, what are you doing here?

401
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,340
Today is the First Day of the Eighth Month.

402
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,470
It's customary to sort out
the Imperial College's registers.

403
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,670
I'm here especially to help you.

404
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,070
You're so nice to me.

405
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,190
Let's go.

406
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,790
Why is it messy again?

407
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,860
Qi,

408
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,100
I found the register the year I studied here.

409
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,220
See if you can find my name.

410
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,740
It's my brother!

411
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,590
Yes, this is your brother.

412
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,070
I should be on the next page.

413
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,430
Can you find my name?

414
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,300
(Yan Yun Zhi, Birthday,
the Eighth Day of the Eighth Month)

415
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,860
Shu...

416
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,830
Who's Shu Zhe Yu?

417
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,070
Yan Yan!

418
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,380
Deputy Chief, what brings you here?

419
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,830
I'm here to see you.

420
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,070
See me?

421
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,220
Did I do something wrong
at Imperial College again?

422
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,620
I've already graduated from Imperial College!

423
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,100
Don't tell me you're also in charge
of the Prefecture Court.

424
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,020
Stop talking nonsense.

425
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,220
Do you know what day
is the Eighth Day of the Eighth Month?

426
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,590
Eighth Day of the Eighth Month?

427
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,100
Let me think.

428
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,470
I know!

429
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,710
It's the day I stayed at the Grand
Commandant's Residence for a month.

430
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,980
It's a day related to me.

431
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,260
It's related to you?

432
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,470
I have no idea.

433
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,620
Forget it.

434
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,790
To make you read between the lines

435
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,020
is a waste of time.

436
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,190
I'll just tell you.

437
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,380
The Eighth Day of the Eighth Month is my birthday.

438
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,710
It's your birthday?

439
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
I see.

440
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
Are you going to treat me to dinner?

441
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,550
You...

442
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,710
Forget it.

443
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,830
I want you

444
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,860
to deliver these words

445
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,070
to Sang Qi word for word.

446
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,790
Not a word less.

447
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,470
The Eighth Day of the Eighth Month is my birthday.

448
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,140
Tell Sang Qi this.

449
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,260
Why don't you tell her yourself?

450
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,070
Don't ask questions.

451
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,020
Go now.

452
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,310
I'll go now.

453
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,980
Where are you going? It's the wrong way.

454
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,470
What day is The Eighth Day of the Eighth Month?

455
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:35,790
The Grand...

456
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,550
You...

457
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,830
It's your birthday.

458
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,340
Can I count on him?

(Agarwood)
Master Sang,

460
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,860
I ran into Deputy Chief
at the Prefecture Court just now.

461
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,740
He told me...

462
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,140
Yan Xiao Lang, why are you back so late?

463
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,710
Director Chief delayed me.

464
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,710
He was...

465
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,590
I shouldn't have waited if I knew.

466
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,790
Why are you waiting for me?

467
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,830
Yan Yan,

468
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,950
you've been staying with us

469
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,190
for a month, right?

470
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,500
Why can't you clean up your room?

471
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,620
Lian Pian can't even

472
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,020
go in your room.

473
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,140
That's right.

474
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,590
She's waiting for you to come back to clean it up.

475
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,620
I've been helping you to stop her for a while.

476
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,620
Why would you stop her?

477
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,620
Why are you so stupid?

478
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,470
Think about it.

479
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,140
What if she opens the door

480
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,670
to find a smelly and dirty room

481
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,140
where she can't even step a foot inside?

482
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,710
What would she think of you?

483
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,860
What are you going to do after that?

484
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,590
Since you're back,

485
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,140
I'll go clean up your room.

486
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,470
Wait right there!

487
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,430
Stop.

488
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,670
Come in when I let you.

489
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,860
Let's enjoy the swing.

490
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,190

494
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,550
I reminded Qi that it's my birthday today,

495
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,260
not because I wanted her to celebrate it for me.

496
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,830
I didn't want her to regret

497
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,020
missing it in the future.

Past noon.

504

Past noon?

505
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,590

forgive me for troubling you.

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,620
A toast for you.

560
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,430
Lian Pian, eat more.

561
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,220
Where's my glass?

562
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,190
Pour me a glass.

563
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,670
Let's drink.

564
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,710
Here.

565
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,710
You look unhappy.

566
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,190
No, I'm not.

567
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,980
You must tell if you're not happy.

568
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,260
You'll feel better after you let it out.

569
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,830
Why are you saying that?

570
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Drinking wine with close friends,

571
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,830
with stars all over the sky above

572
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,710
and my loved one next to me,

573
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,670
why would I be unhappy?

574
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,500
Since it's not that,

575
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,790
it means you have regrets.

576
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,100
I already said it's nothing.

577
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,860
Because I didn't celebrate your birthday.

578
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,740
You... Did you know?

579
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,790
Of course, I know.

580
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,670
Then...

581
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,710
Do you like it?

582
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,790
I made it especially for you.

583
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,620
I stayed up for several nights.

584
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,310
Of course, I like it.

585
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,980
Thank you.

586
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,910
Now, you accept it pretty quickly.

587
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,500
I wonder who was the one you refused it back then.

588
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,020
This is different from that one.

589
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:58,790
See this?

590
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,590
This embroidery

591
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,140
is better than that one.

592
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,100
It's so pretty.

593
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,830
I learned this for many nights

594
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,020
after pestering Lian Pian.

595
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,310
It's more troublesome than martial arts.

596
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,020
I appreciate it.

597
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,500
But you know it's my birthday.

598
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,310
When I tried hinting at you,

599
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,340
why did you pretend not to know?

600
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,100
So, you knew it's called hinting.

601
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,430
First, you handed me the register at the Archive.

602
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,620
After that,

603
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,100
you sent Bai Shi to beat around the bush

604
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,340
with Lian Pian.

605
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,380
Finally,

606
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,140
you went to see Yan Xiao Lang. Am I right?

607
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,590
Yes.

608
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,670
You can just tell me directly.

609
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,430
Why did you have to set a trap?

610
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,020
I knew you liked doing this.

611
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,310
So I had to get back at you.

612
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,620
I've always known your date of birth.

613
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,980
But

614
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,140
since you like to give people a hard time,

615
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,620
I should make you suffer for a change.

616
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,620
What do you call this again?

617
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,380
"Having a taste of your own medicine".

618
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,140
Do you like it?

619
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,500
Yes.

620
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,710
Almost as charming as me.

621
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,190
But

622
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,620
I still hope you can be more direct next time.

623
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,790
Of course.

624
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,740
I've learned my lessons today.

625
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,140
This is the biggest game I've set up.

626
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,740
I even had to pay for the price.

627
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,910
You sound unhappy about it.

628
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,830
I'm happy.

629
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,380
No, you're not.

630
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,980
Yes, I am.

631
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,020
You're not happy at all.

632
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,980
I am happy about it.

633
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,500
I wouldn't dare...

634
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,830
Why would I not be happy?

635
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,190
That's more like it.

636
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,470
Swing it.

637
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,790
All right.

638
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,740
Higher.

639
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,470
Higher!

640
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,220
Higher.

641
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,380
Young Lady!

642
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,950
Young Lady, something bad has happened!

643
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,980
Young Lady, something happened.

644
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,220
The Yan family is in trouble.

645
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,260
Prefecture Court raided the Yan Residence.

646
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,340
Grand Preceptor and the rest are arrested.

647
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,380
Mr. Yan and Lian Pian have rushed over.

648
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,620
Master said

649
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,430
to find someone to clarify this matter.

650
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,830
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

651
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,500
Let's go.

652
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,260
(Grand Preceptor's Residence)
Stop. You're not allowed to enter.

653
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,380
Yan Yan! Lian Pian!

654
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,830
Young Lady.

655
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,670
What happened?

656
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,500
Why is Grand Preceptor Yan arrested?

657
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,100
I'm not sure either.

658
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,740
I was stopped when I arrived.

659
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,500
They refused to say anything

660
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,070
and made me wait here.

661
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,500
Something has happened at my home.

662
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,100
What's the point of waiting?

663
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,190
Yan Xiao Lang.

664
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,140
Calm down.

665
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,260
Since this matter involves Grand Preceptor Yan,

666
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,430
it must not be a small matter.

667
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,020
These guards wouldn't know if you asked them.

668
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,100
I'll ask Yan San Lang.

669
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,980
Song Luo Tian?

670
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,380
Song Luo Tian,

671
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,910
explain to me, what's going on?

672
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,220
Guards, arrest him.

673
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,910
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

674
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,380
Stop it!

675
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,550
Mr. Song,

676
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,310
something happened to the Grand Preceptor.

677
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,500
We want to clarify this matter quickly.

678
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,340
It's not the time for you two

679
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,980
to bicker now.

680
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,950
Who are you to speak up?

681
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,140
Do you think you can order me around

682
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,980
because the Grand Commandant
accepted you as his goddaughter?

683
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,380
You're still a servant girl, no matter what.

684
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,860
Out of my way!

685
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,910
Song Luo Tian, you...

686
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,590
Sang Qi, stop.

687
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,740
What exactly is going on?

688
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,740
Deputy Chief Yan, the Prefecture Court
had issued an order for the arrest.

689
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,790
Please don't stop us.

690
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,020
We would not

691
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,380
delay the Prefecture Court from arresting them.

692
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,500
But you must have a reason to arrest him, right?

693
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,950
Qi Lang! Sang Qi!

694
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,500
(Grand Preceptor's Residence)

695
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,790
Calm down.

696
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,670
Let him make the arrest.

697
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,980
I'll explain it to you later.

698
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,470
Let's go.

699
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,430
- Go!
- Go!

700
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,550
Yan Yan.

701
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,310
Yan Xiao Lang!

702
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,220
Lian Pian.

703
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:23,980
San Lang,

704
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,380
we'll wait for you at Grand
Commandant's Residence.

705
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,100
All right.

706
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,740
(Grand Preceptor's Residence)

707
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,140
Let's go.

708
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,470
Official Yan, what exactly is going on?

709
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:47,740
Water.

710
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,590
Official Yan, say something.

711
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,790
Lian Pian, let him catch his breath first.

712
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,860
Things have already come to this.

713
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,590
There's no use to worry now.

714
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,140
I guess Sang Qi is more thoughtful.

715
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,190
But this matter happens
to the Yan family too suddenly.

716
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,790
So it's natural for you to get anxious.

717
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,790
Why is the Yan family
being investigated so suddenly?

718
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,550
Speaking of it, it's very odd.

719
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,620
Didn't you tell me

720
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,590
to investigate the salt route
based on the clues at the warehouse?

721
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,190
Based on our deduction,

722
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,620
the goods of Xizhao,
the salt grains in the warehouse,

723
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,860
and the fragrance of Song Jia Yin

724
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,620
are linked together.

725
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,220
If nothing goes wrong

726
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,020
while following these clues,

727
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,950
we should get a hold of something
about the Song family.

728
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,220
That's right.

729
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,950
I investigated based on our deductions.

730
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,950
I was indeed fishy.

731
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,910
It led me to a salt merchant named Ding Hao.

732
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,830
We've arrested this man.

733
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,260
He obviously looks like a coward.

734
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,860
Before we even started torturing him,

735
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,260
he turned in his superior himself.

736
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,310
If that's the case,

737
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,980
wouldn't that lead exactly to the Song family?

738
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,430
Why is the Yan family being implicated?

739
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,590
Let me finish.

740
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,380
I thought it was the Song family too.

741
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,910
But Ding Hao insisted

742
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,710
that the Yan family
made him sell smuggled salt and official titles

743
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,790
for the Grand Preceptor's Residence.

744
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,430
Also, it wasn't a baseless accusation.

745
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,100
He turned in a full set of the ledger

746
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,790
with every transaction recorded.

747
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,340
Wait a minute.

748
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,710
Did you say he turned in a full set of the ledger

749
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,950
with everything recorded clearly?

750
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,740
Exactly.

751
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,220
All the dates, the sum of money,

752
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,020
and those involved in the transactional

753
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,020
are recorded in the ledger.

754
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,620
Those involved in illegal salt trading

755
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,070
don't make a set of a ledger.

756
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,910
This is clearly a setup.

757
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,830
I'm aware of that too.

758
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,590
But I dare not keep this matter a secret.

759
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,550
So I can only report this to His Majesty.

760
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,310
His Majesty gave his order the same night

761
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,310
to capture Grand Preceptor
and seal the Grand Preceptor's Residence.

762
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,500
Everyone in the Yan family will be investigated.

763
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,430
Even Yan Xiao Lang is not an exception.

764
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,670
Will Yan Yan be tortured?

765
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,580
You can rest assured of this.

766
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,780
He'll be at my Prefecture Court.

767
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,300
I'll watch him so that nothing will happen to him.

768
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,670
The Song family still found out.

769
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,750
But I think they found out not too long ago.

770
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,910
It looks like they set up this plot in a rush.

771
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,270
The evidence appears solid,
but it's full of loopholes.

772
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,380
We must prove

773
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,510
the Yan family's innocence quickly

774
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,620
before they make another move.

775
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,030
What should we do now?

776
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,670
San Lang,

777
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,670
can I see Ding Hao?

778
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,270
Sure, you can.

779
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,300
You've always helped

780
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,580
the Prefecture Court anyway.

781
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,340
No one will say anything if you go.

782
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,270
But

783
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:50,860
he can only be brought for trial now

784
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,710
because he has already confessed.

785
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,580
So we can't torture him now.

786
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,780
Won't he keep on accusing the Yan family then?

787
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,300
There's no other way now.

788
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,270
Qi Lang, it's up to your methods now.

789
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,860
You said Ding Hao is timid.

790
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,060
Yes.

791
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,990
Deputy Chief,

792
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,990
put me in prison.

793
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,190
I was wrong!

794
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,780
I won't do it again!

795
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,300
After we finish interrogating this criminal,

796
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,620
it'll be your turn.

797
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,620
Official, let me explain...

798
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,540
Save it

799
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,750
for later.

800
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,060
Take him away.

801
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,620
Yes!

802
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,860
Get up!

803
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,710
Official, let me explain.

804
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:53,910
Go!

805
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,380
Official!

806
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,540
Official!

807
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,230
Quiet!

808
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,060
I...

809
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,300
Move it!

810
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,190
I...

811
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,510
Go in!

812
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,230
Wait here for now.

813
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,620
You will be interrogated soon.

814
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,540
Let's go.

815
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,780
Were you the one who was interrogated just now?

816
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,510
Stop talking.

817
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,190
I can't take it anymore.

818
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,190
I don't want to remember it.

819
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,860
I don't want to recall it.

820
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,990
I don't even dare to remember.

821
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,060
It was extremely inhumane and ruthless.

822
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,540
I dare not think back.

823
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,950
You don't look like

824
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,140
you were tortured.

825
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,100
Who says there must be traces
after being tortured?

826
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,910
Have you heard of suffocation?

827
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,100
No.

828
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,430
It was my first time too.

829
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,430
They placed this sheet of paper

830
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,670
on your face.

831
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,750
They sprayed a mouthful of water on it.

832
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,670
If you keep quiet,

833
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,380
they'll place another layer
and spray a mouthful of water on it

834
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,750
until you can't breathe!

835
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,140
Just like what they did to me!

836
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,670
Listen.

837
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,860
Being unable to endure it comes second.

838
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,230
The main thing is there's no trace at all.

839
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,710
There's no way to reason it.

840
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,470
It's useless!

841
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,470
The third layer...

842
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,430
The third layer was my last draw.

843
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,620
Do...

844
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,990
Do they even show any respect to the law?

845
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,950
Are you serious?

846
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,950
If they disrespect the law,

847
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,820
we won't be thrown in here.

848
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:57,990
Then...

849
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,820
Then what did you do to get caught?

850
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,710
Do you know

851
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,860
about the arrest of Master Yan's family
some time ago?

852
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,710
I have a close relationship

853
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,990
with their Young Master.

854
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,380
That's why I'm captured.

855
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,270
I can't even catch my breath.

856
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,780
I can't even breathe!

857
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,230
Here they come!

858
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,910
Help me up! Quickly!

859
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,820
Hide! Hide!

860
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,190
I was wrong!

861
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,100
I was wrong! Stop punishing me!

862
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,100
I won't do it again!

863
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,300
I'm not here for you this time.

864
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,580
They're looking for you.

865
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,990
Guards! Take her away.

866
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

867
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:50,750
I...

868
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,670
- I will...
- I...

869
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,100
I don't want to go!

870
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,300
May luck be with you!

871
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,710
You must live!

872
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,300
Stay alive!

873
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,580
Sit.

874
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,060
I said, sit!

875
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,670
Ding Hao, right?

876
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,950
Yes.

877
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,580
I'm sure you're aware

878
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,030
of why we're meeting here.

879
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,620
I understand.

880
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,030
No,

881
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,140
you don't understand.

882
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,580
Isn't this about salt smuggling?

883
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,820
Salt smuggling is a small matter
that's not worth mentioning.

884
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,950
What I want

885
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,140
is the Yan family.

886
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,030
Yan... Yan family?

887
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,860
I already told you everything.

888
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,300
Yes, you did confess.

889
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,380
But what you confessed

890
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,270
is not enough for me to convict them.

891
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,060
I'll give you one more chance.

892
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,670
If you don't tell me everything,

893
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,340
I will never let you go

894
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,270
until I get them convicted.

895
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,140
Official, I've told you everything I know.

896
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,670
You're making it difficult for me.

897
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,140
Guards!

898
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

899
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,910
Official.

900
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,230
Official!

901
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,580
I shall see

902
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,580
how long you can keep this for the Yan family.

903
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,510
Official.

904
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,270
Official!

905
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,300
Official.

906
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,670
All right, I'll tell you!

907
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,780
Official, I'll tell you!

908
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,950
Official, I'll tell you everything I know!

909
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,230
I'll confess everything.

910
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,430
Official.

911
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,580
Official,

912
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,620
I'll tell you everything I know.

913
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,220
(Prison)

914
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,510
Then, we'll start from the Yan family's ledger.

915
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,710
All right.
