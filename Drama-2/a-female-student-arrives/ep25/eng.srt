and await trial.

30
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,943
Your Majesty.

31
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:45,024
Your Majesty!

32
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:47,823
Yan,

33
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:49,943
I order you to investigate the case thoroughly.

34
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:51,424
Wei Zhan Hong will be handed over

35
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:53,863
to your Prefecture Court
for interrogation and custody.

36
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:56,583
Investigate and verify
the ledger after you find it.

37
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:59,263
If Grand Commandant Sang
is not involved in this matter,

38
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:01,384
he should be released as soon as possible.

39
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,144
I shall obey your orders.

40
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:08,863
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:13,024
I have a presumptuous request.

42
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:15,823
It's about the marriage bestowal.

43
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:17,623
This marriage

44
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,304
is my grace to Miss Su.

45
00:02:21,023 --> 00:02:21,984
If you want to change it,

46
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,064
Miss Su must first agree to it.

47
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,463
I'm exhausted.

48
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,944
You're dismissed.

49
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:31,224
Yes, Your Majesty.

50
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:32,023
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:45,463
Qi.

52
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,383
Deputy Chief,

53
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,383
don't be hasty.

54
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,623
We'll find a way.

55
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,224
Thank you, Official Yan.

56
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,743
My father's case is finally overturned.

57
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,823
Too bad we don't know who's the mastermind.

58
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,543
It's expected.

59
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:18,504
If Zhuo Wen Yuan were the mastermind,

60
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:19,743
he wouldn't

61
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,103
expose himself this easily.

62
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:22,663
There are many ways to hide.

63
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:25,663
I've indeed taught him well.

64
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:28,704
It must be hard on you

65
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:30,743
when he humiliated you in public that day.

66
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:32,584
Qi,

67
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:34,504
even if it's dangerous,

68
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:35,743
I'll have no regrets

69
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:37,344
for you

70
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:39,144
and your father.

71
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:47,823
By the way,

72
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,944
when did you think of this strategy?

73
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,543
What's all this about?

74
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:57,224
Qi,

75
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,103
with me around,

76
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:02,383
I'll find ways to save Grand Commandant Sang.

77
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:04,704
Even if His Majesty has granted me a marriage,

78
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,023
I'll never be apart from you.

79
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:11,784
Are you going to defy His Majesty's order?

80
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:15,903
Unless...

81
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:16,944
Unless what?

82
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,463
Unless we take risks.

83
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,424
You want to...

84
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,543
We've searched the whole of Bianjing,

85
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,624
but there's no trace of Wei Zhan Hong at all.

86
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,584
Do you think

87
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,383
he's inside Zhuo's Residence?

88
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:33,223
Zhuo Wen Yuan showed me around
his mansion before.

89
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,464
I felt strange at the time.

90
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,343
Why would there be so many guards

91
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:39,103
at a civil official's residence?

92
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:40,663
Those guards are obviously

93
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:41,864
martial arts practitioners

94
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:42,904
who are skilled.

95
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:45,184
If they're not guarding against something,

96
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,744
they must

97
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:48,943
be guarding someone important.

98
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:53,503
But what if this is what Zhuo Wen Yuan

99
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,663
wants you to see?

100
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,864
What if Wei Zhan Hong is not there?

101
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:58,144
Won't you be in danger then?

102
00:04:58,144 --> 00:04:59,624
But we have no other way now.

103
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,663
If we don't do this,

104
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:03,984
my father...

105
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,024
No.

106
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:07,543
I can't let you take the risk.

107
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:16,304
I promise.

108
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:18,943
I promise I'll come back safely.

109
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:21,184
As long as our strategy works,

110
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,584
there shouldn't be any problems.

111
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,343
If we really decide to do this,

112
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,663
the plan must be thorough.

113
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:35,904
There must be no mistake at all.

114
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,144
Let's think about it again.

115
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:46,063
All right.

116
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:49,904
(That's how)

117
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:52,464
(Sang Qi and I came up with a plan
to trick everyone.)

118
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,984
(We let Zhuo Wen Yuan thought his plan had worked)

119
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:57,783
(and Sang Qi had no way out.)

120
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,744
(When I entered Zhuo's Residence the second time,)

121
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,223
(I carefully observed the layout
of the courtyard.)

122
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:09,223
(I noticed there were guards at the back entrance)

123
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:11,063
(and a maid delivering food.)

124
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:14,063
(I guess Wei Zhan Hong may be hiding
in the backyard.)

125
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,943
You want me to marry Zhuo Wen Yuan in your place?

126
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:23,823
Why?

127
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:25,263
Isn't this your wish?

128
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:27,783
I'm the daughter of the Grand Tutor.

129
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,223
Why would I marry someone sneakily?

130
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:30,103
Besides,

131
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,024
why should I help you?

132
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:34,984
Do it

133
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,424
for your sincerity towards Zhuo Wen Yuan.

134
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:40,464
Think about it.

135
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,103
This may be the only chance

136
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,624
for you to marry into the Zhuo family
as the legal wife.

137
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,624
It only happens once in a blue moon.

138
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:55,103
Jia Yin,

139
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:58,024
to get close to Deputy Chief Yan back then,

140
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,223
you didn't hesitate to be run over
by a horse carriage.

141
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:02,383
Don't you want to do anything for Zhuo Wen Yuan?

142
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,744
It doesn't matter what method you used

143
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:07,024
to make him yours.

144
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:09,103
The outcome is what matters.

145
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,543
Don't you think so?

146
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,704
I thought Miss Song

147
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:24,063
is bold in love

148
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,184
and decisive.

149
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:26,343
It turns out

150
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:27,744
you're an indecisive person too.

151
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:30,063
Forget it, then.

152
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,024
I'll just marry Zhuo Wen Yuan.

153
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,184
But you must know this.

154
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:34,304
If I married into the Zhuo family,

155
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,464
you could only be a concubine.

156
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:37,103
You...

157
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,304
Wait!

158
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:45,144
Why should I be the concubine?

159
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:46,704
Fine, I'll do what you asked.

160
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:47,783
Tell me.

161
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:48,744
What do you want me to do?

162
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:50,024
Great.

163
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,704
Now, this is the demeanor Miss Song
should possess.

164
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:53,943
Let's sit down and talk.

165
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,704
(After convincing Song Jia Yin,)

166
00:07:56,984 --> 00:07:58,383
(we were one step away)

167
00:07:58,383 --> 00:07:59,663
(from our plan to be successful.)

168
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:04,663
(Sang Qi and I)

169
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:07,144
(were closely monitored by Zhuo Wen Yuan.)

170
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:09,464
(The night before the wedding,)

171
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,904
(we played a farewell drama.)

172
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,304
(While Zhuo Wen Yuan was deluded,)

173
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:17,184
(Sang Qi took the chance to give me
the map of Zhuo's Residence)

174
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,984
(and the evacuation route after the operation.)

175
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,024
(So I could arrange reinforcement)

176
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,184
(to coordinate from outside the mansion.)

177
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,080
(Prison Room)

178
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:01,384
Watch your step.

179
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:04,624
All right.

180
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:09,783
Yan Yan.

181
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:11,944
I have something to entrust you.

182
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:16,064
You sober up pretty quickly.

183
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,944
Is it convenient to talk in your residence?

184
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:18,824
Is it?

185
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:20,663
Let's go.

186
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,023
Come on now!

187
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:25,384
Deputy Chief!

188
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:26,223
Hey...

189
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,023
(I asked Yan Yan to lead people
to feign an attack on Zhuo's Residence)

190
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:31,903
(and ordered Bai Shi to pretend
to take the chance to sneak in)

191
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,583
(to divert the guards' attention in the mansion.)

192
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,343
(Meanwhile, I stopped the wedding procession)

193
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,710
(Happiness)
(to hold them up as long as possible.)

194
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,630
(Candle Shop)

195
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:44,543
(Here comes the best part.)

196
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,770
(Happiness)

197
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:00,944
(On the wedding day,)

198
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,064
(Song Jia Yin got into the palanquin in my place.)

199
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:04,463
(Zhuo Wen Yuan only focused)

200
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:06,143
(on Deputy Chief, Yan Yan, and the rest.)

201
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:07,703
(Just like that,)

202
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:10,543
(I sneaked into Zhuo's Residence
to take Wei Zhan Hong away.)

203
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:27,864
There's someone on the roof!

204
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:31,663
Hurry!

205
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,064
- This way!
- Over here!

206
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,023
- Bring the ladder!
- Where did he go?

207
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:38,504
Coming!

208
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,543
(Wait a minute.)

209
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:41,583
(You brought Wei Zhan Hong out by yourself?)

210
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,184
Hurry!

211
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,264
(Yan San Lang,)

212
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:45,543
(why do you have to get to the bottom of it?)

213
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:46,463
After him!

214
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:47,343
(Fine,)

215
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,583
(I had a helper.)

216
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,103
Go quickly!

217
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:57,463
Time to go.

218
00:10:58,903 --> 00:10:59,864
Hurry!

219
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,103
Qi Lang,

220
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:19,864
Sang Qi,

221
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,264
both of you had put up a great show.

222
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:22,944
Both of you

223
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:25,023
should show your performance on stage.

224
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:27,184
Maybe you two can become famous
actor and actress in Bianjing.

225
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,064
San Lang is usually a serious person.

226
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:32,023
Now, he knows how to make jokes.

227
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,543
The most important thing to do

228
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:37,064
is to find that ledger now.

229
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,223
That way, my father can return home quickly.

230
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,543
Official Yan,

231
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:41,984
let me join in your operation.

232
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:42,744
It's okay.

233
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:44,744
I'll take Wei Zhan Hong back
to the Prefecture Court first.

234
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,064
After everything is prepared,

235
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,103
I'll track down the ledger.

236
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:49,143
You and Qi Lang have been
exerting yourselves all day.

237
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:50,304
Go back and rest early.

238
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:50,783
But...

239
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:51,343
Qi,

240
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:53,463
don't worry.

241
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:54,824
San Lang is reliable in his work.

242
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:55,824
Just leave it to him.

243
00:11:58,304 --> 00:11:59,463
I'll leave it to you then, Official Yan.

244
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,463
It's our job at the Prefecture Court anyway.

245
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,264
I'll take my leave, then.

246
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:07,864
Let's go.

247
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:57,783
Come on.

248
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,744
If this matter is really related to Zhuo Wen Yuan,

249
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:05,504
will he let it slide?

250
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,703
About Wei Zhan Hong falsely accusing
Grand Commandant Sang,

251
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:24,064
I'm at fault.

252
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:25,543
I never expected

253
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,424
Wei Zhan Hong to have such malicious intent

254
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:28,744
to cause a disturbance in the imperial court.

255
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:32,143
I believed his words

256
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:33,903
because we used to be schoolmates.

257
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:36,143
I thought he was treated unjustly.

258
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:38,583
As for the salt smuggling,

259
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:40,343
no matter what,

260
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,184
it was because of me.

261
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:44,864
I ask that Your Majesty punish me for my crime.

262
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,543
Are you

263
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:48,903
willing to be punished?

264
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,624
Yes, I am.

265
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:52,663
This is a grave matter.

266
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:55,064
If Your Majesty doesn't punish me for my crime,

267
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:56,703
be it feelings or reason,

268
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:58,023
it'll be unfair.

269
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,824
Your Majesty!

270
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:04,984
Zhuo Wen Yuan carelessly

271
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,744
committed this crime

272
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:08,143
because the cunning person deluded him.

273
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,864
Please consider the fact that he's young

274
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:12,703
and loyal to the imperial court.

275
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:16,824
I beg Your Majesty not to punish him severely.

276
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:19,824
Oh, my dear.

277
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:20,783
My dear,

278
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:22,543
what are you doing?

279
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:23,583
Get up quickly.

280
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:25,703
Get up.

281
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:26,783
Crying isn't good for you.

282
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:28,384
My dear.

283
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,543
I never said I was going to punish him.

284
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:35,583
Come on, get up.

285
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,343
Zhuo Wen Yuan just set foot
in the official circle.

286
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:42,783
He's still inexperienced

287
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:43,783
and it's understandable.

288
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,064
Besides,

289
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:47,023
nothing serious happened.

290
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,424
So stop crying.

291
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:54,783
Zhuo, rise.

292
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:00,824
Thank you, Your Majesty.

293
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,304
Remember

294
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:03,663
to be more cautious

295
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,703
as an official in the future.

296
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,783
I'll do my best

297
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:08,903
to live up to Your Majesty's expectation.

298
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:13,143
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

299
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:15,543
Enough.

300
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:17,343
If you fall ill from this,

301
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:18,583
I'll be so worried.

302
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:24,223
You caused so much trouble

303
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:26,064
because of the daughter of the Sang family.

304
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,864
Is this what you meant by everything ready?

305
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,984
I'm so disappointed in you.

306
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,103
Aunt,

307
00:16:32,944 --> 00:16:34,264
I was indeed careless this time.

308
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:37,703
Now that Wei Zhan Hong has changed his testimony

309
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:39,824
and told them about the ledger.

310
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:42,703
What are you going to do

311
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:44,463
if it leads Yan San Lang to us?

312
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:46,384
Aunt, rest assured.

313
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:47,984
Official Wei

314
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,864
only plays an insignificant role in Xizhao.

315
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,504
The ledger

316
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:52,583
shouldn't lead directly to us.

317
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:54,703
But to make sure nothing goes wrong,

318
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:55,703
I'll take care

319
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:57,023
of the ledger.

320
00:16:58,824 --> 00:17:00,543
I'll never let them have the chance.

321
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,184
This time,

322
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:03,504
there must be no mistakes.

323
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,703
Fortunately, Wei Zhan Hong
doesn't know your real identity.

324
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,143
Otherwise, we wouldn't know what to do.

325
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,063
His Majesty is an affectionate person.

326
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,583
He didn't punish you for my sake.

327
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:17,583
But if this matter gets out,

328
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:19,943
some ministers in court
will be dissatisfied with you.

329
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:22,544
By the way,

330
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,703
the servant reported

331
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,423
that Song Jia Yin is still at your residence.

332
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:29,544
How are you going to handle this matter?

333
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:33,463
I plan to accept this marriage

334
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,423
and form an alliance with the Song family

335
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:36,943
to tightly hold on to Grand Tutor Song.

336
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:37,984
That way,

337
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:40,823
the Zhuo and the Song families
will fall and rise together.

338
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,264
Grand Tutor Song will certainly do his best
to help us in the future.

339
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:46,703
Sit.

340
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:52,223
You did well

341
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:55,223
in this matter.

342
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:56,984
Originally,

343
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,544
I wanted to persuade you

344
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,943
to put aside your obsession with Miss Sang.

345
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,463
It looks like I worried for nothing.

346
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:07,744
Wen Yuan,

347
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:09,864
you shouldn't keep thinking about Sang Qi.

348
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,183
It's impossible

349
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,024
for both of you.

350
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,463
What do you mean by this?

351
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,384
At this point,

352
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:21,583
I might as well tell you.

353
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:23,223
Aunt!

354
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,457
(Two years ago)

355
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,463
What's wrong?

356
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:29,544
Did you fail your task?

357
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:33,703
No, I didn't.

358
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:35,544
What does that mean?

359
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,984
When I went to take the list from the apothecary,

360
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:42,504
someone took the list by accident.

361
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,504
But I got it back.

362
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,063
Who took it by mistake?

363
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,110
(Touch of Spring)

364
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,784
Mister, here are your medicinal herbs.

365
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:10,343
Thank you.

366
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,320
(Name list: Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of Personnel, Ministry of Revenue)

367
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,103
He happened to get the medicinal herbs

368
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:31,024
and accidentally confused
the prescription with the list.

369
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:32,984
Sang Yu?

370
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:36,343
Did he read the contents?

371
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:40,943
When I asked for the list,

372
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:45,343
Sang Yu said something strange to me.

373
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:49,744
He might have read the contents.

374
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:03,063
Don't worry about it.

375
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,063
I know Sang Yu well.

376
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:07,624
He's a sickly person

377
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,144
who doesn't meddle in other people's affairs.

378
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:10,744
Don't worry.

379
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:12,264
But you must be careful

380
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:14,144
when you carry out your tasks in the future, okay?

381
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:15,303
Go home now.

382
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:16,303
It's already late.

383
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:19,223
I'll take my leave.

384
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,024
Did Sang Yu

385
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:36,183
die because of me?

386
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:38,744
It's his fate.

387
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,384
No one is to be blamed.

388
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:43,664
Wei Zhan Hong's matter has been exposed.

389
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:45,583
It's also impossible to pull the Sang family
to our side now.

390
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:47,864
I'm telling you these,

391
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:49,384
so you'll know

392
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:52,823
that we'll have a fallout
with the Sang family sooner or later.

393
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:54,984
It's better to take precautions.

394
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,144
I understand.

395
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,520

Young Master,

401
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:00,303
are you all right?

402
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:03,103
I'm fine.

403
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,744
Any movement in the Prefecture Court?

404
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:13,223
Our men are on standby now.

405
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:14,784
Miss Qian Jiu

406
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,904
has assembled the city's
most capable subordinates.

407
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:18,703
We can take action anytime.

408
00:22:20,103 --> 00:22:21,063
All right. I got it.

409
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:24,264
Young Master,

410
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:25,904
the servant said

411
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:27,823
Madam has been yelling to see you.

412
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:29,583
What do you...

413
00:22:29,823 --> 00:22:31,183
Tell her that I work all day and night!

414
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:33,144
Tell her not to disturb me.

415
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:34,423
Tell her to leave!

416
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:35,784
I understand.

424
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,619

(Zhuo's Residence)

427
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:43,264
Darling,

428
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,103
you worked all night

429
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:47,664
and even left early for work.

430
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:48,864
We just got married.

431
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:51,024
Why is the Ministry of Personnel
so inconsiderate?

432
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:54,624
Why is she here?

433
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:56,264
Miss Qian Jiu is my guest.

434
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:57,583
She'll stay here temporarily.

435
00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,583
Greetings, Mrs. Zhuo.

436
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:01,504
Zhuo Wen Yuan, what is the meaning of this?

437
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:02,624
We just got married

438
00:24:02,784 --> 00:24:03,823
and you brought your mistress home.

439
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,223
Are you humiliating me on purpose?

440
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,183
Don't you understand what I said?

441
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:09,063
Qian Jiu is a guest.

442
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:10,904
You're the Madam of the Zhuo family.

443
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:12,544
You should mind your words.

444
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:14,343
Mrs. Zhuo,

445
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:16,343
I've known Mr. Zhuo for years.

446
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,144
I'm both his friend and confidant.

447
00:24:19,303 --> 00:24:22,024
It's perfectly reasonable for me
to be a guest here.

448
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,984
There's no need to be angry.

449
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,583
You have no right to speak here.

450
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:27,423
So shut up!

451
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:37,103
I didn't mean to hurt you.

452
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:39,504
Are you all right, Darling?

453
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:40,864
You're in the Zhuo's Residence,

454
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:41,744
not the Grand Tutor's Residence.

455
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,624
I will not tolerate you
for behaving atrociously.

456
00:24:44,423 --> 00:24:46,303
If you still want to be my wife,

457
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:47,864
you'd better go back and think

458
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:49,103
about how you should live your life

459
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:50,103
and get along with others in the future.

460
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:52,624
Are you planning to treat me this way

461
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,144
after marrying me?

462
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:56,583
I never planned to marry you.

463
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,264
You were the one forcing your way to marry me.

464
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,744
If you're not happy,

465
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,423
we can seek annulment at any time.

466
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:02,664
Qian Jiu.

467
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:11,823
If you say a word about today's incident,

468
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:12,703
I'll teach you a lesson!

469
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:14,144
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

470
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:32,664
Sir,

471
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,744
the ledger is in this coffin.

472
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:37,103
Open it!

473
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:37,664
Yes, Sir.

474
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,400
(Ledger)

475
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,343
Sir, found it.

476
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,780
(Ledger)

477
00:25:55,063 --> 00:25:55,624
Who's there?

478
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:01,343
Let's go!

479
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,500
(Ma Chang Xing)

480
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:21,624
How dare you!

481
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:22,984
Surrender yourselves now!

482
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:24,423
You can't escape now!

483
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:25,904
So don't waste time resisting!

484
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:54,264
They were indeed a gang of desperadoes.

485
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:56,544
Luckily, Qi Lang told us to be prepared.

486
00:26:57,943 --> 00:26:59,384
It's a pity there's no survivor.

487
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:02,063
Otherwise, we could have found some clues.

488
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:02,703
It's okay.

489
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:04,024
Qi Lang is an expert coroner.

490
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:05,343
He'll definitely find a way.

491
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:11,024
All you do is wearing that sad face

492
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:12,823
and not even talking to me.

493
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:16,703
I think you brought me back here

494
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,223
not only to upset Song Jia Yin.

495
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:24,544
I know

496
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:26,463
you're upset that Sang Qi set up

497
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:27,784
a plot against you.

498
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:28,823
It doesn't concern you.

499
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:32,144
Doesn't it?

500
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:34,823
I knew you had selfish motives when you said

501
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:36,904
you wanted to set up the Sang family

502
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:38,984
as your scapegoat.

503
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:40,264
But I still escorted

504
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:42,024
Wei Zhan Hong back secretly all the way here.

505
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:43,343
In the end,

506
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,183
you only used him as a bargaining chip.

507
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,463
As long as Sang Qi is willing to marry you,

508
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:49,223
you'll disregard the overall situation

509
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:50,864
and rescue Sang Wei.

510
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,063
Am I right?

511
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:59,024
Not only did you fail to marry Sang Qi as planned,

512
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,984
but you also brought trouble for yourself.

513
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:04,144
To save his life, Wei Zhan Hong
told them about the ledger.

514
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:07,144
The Wei family is closely
acquainted with Xizhao.

515
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:08,864
If things come to light,

516
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,384
everyone we planted in Bianjing,

517
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,024
including me,

518
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:15,703
can never escape.

519
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:18,904
Are you blaming me now?

520
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,303
I was complaining, that's all.

521
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,583
After going through all these things,

522
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:29,583
you must know

523
00:28:30,063 --> 00:28:32,904
that I'm the only one who's sincere towards you.

524
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:35,103
What are childhood friends

525
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:36,864
and growing up together?

526
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,823
Only you remember all these.

527
00:28:39,864 --> 00:28:42,463
Sang Qi never cared about those.

528
00:28:53,784 --> 00:28:54,624
Mr. Zhuo,

529
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:56,823
I hope you know

530
00:28:57,463 --> 00:28:59,264
that I can give you

531
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,624
what Sang Qi can't give.

532
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:11,864
Come in.

533
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:18,823
Didn't you get it?

534
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:20,703
Our men were ambushed.

535
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,664
The ledger is in Yan Yun Zhi's hand now.

536
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:26,864
Any survivors?

537
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:27,784
There shouldn't be any.

538
00:29:29,024 --> 00:29:30,063
You don't have to worry.

539
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:32,024
My men are loyal warriors.

540
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:34,624
Even if they're captured alive,
they'd never confess.

541
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,664
The ledger is now in his possession.

542
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:39,984
Will he be able to find out anything?

543
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:42,703
Do you have any plans?

544
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:45,624
At this point,

545
00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:46,984
we mustn't cause any trouble.

546
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:49,823
We can only act accordingly now.

547
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:11,583
Do you still remember

548
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:12,744
how I taught you

549
00:30:12,984 --> 00:30:14,664
in examining the body in Law class?

550
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:16,103
You can practice it now.

551
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:19,544
I used to be the corpse all the time.

552
00:30:20,183 --> 00:30:23,144
I may not remember some of it now.

553
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:25,264
But you never

554
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,303
experimented with real corpses before.

555
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:28,784
It's not enough to learn from the text.

556
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:31,664
Today, I'll make up this lesson for you.

557
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:41,703
Don't be nervous.

558
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:43,904
Pretend it's a class.

559
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:47,264
You can do it.

560
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:54,864
As long as we can find the mastermind,

561
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,303
we can seek justice for my brother

562
00:30:57,984 --> 00:30:59,864
and stop those villains in Xizhao

563
00:31:00,504 --> 00:31:01,583
from doing evil.

564
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:05,544
I'm ready now.

565
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:06,583
Let's begin.

566
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:23,864
Deputy Chief,

567
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:26,744
things have finally made some progress.

568
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:28,384
What's next?

569
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:30,384
We must not alert the enemies yet.

570
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:33,223
It still needs careful planning.

571
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:34,544
Understood.

572
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,075
(Qingxin Hall)

573
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:36,664
Qi Lang.

574
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:39,103
Qi Lang,

575
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,384
I found something from the ledger.

576
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:44,624
Let's talk inside.

577
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:45,303
All right.

578
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
(Qingxin Hall)

579
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,252
(Transactions)

580
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:55,063
In the ledger,

581
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:56,504
there's a record of a land transaction.

582
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:57,703
This plot of land happens to be

583
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:59,624
the apothecary Sang Yu got his prescription
before the accident.

584
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:01,264
After Sang Yu's accident,

585
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,544
this apothecary had changed a few owners

586
00:32:02,864 --> 00:32:04,703
until it fell under Official Wei's name.

587
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:06,984
I led some men to Official Wei's old residence
the same night

588
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:08,703
and met those involved
in the land's transactions.

589
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:09,864
But we found nothing.

590
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:12,943
Only Zhang Xiu Ping,
who sold the land to Official Wei,

591
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:13,904
does not exist.

592
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:16,624
You mean

593
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:18,864
this "Zhang Xiu Ping" may know something?

594
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:21,063
She came into contact with Official Wei before.

595
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:22,624
So there might be some clues there.

596
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:23,583
Of course,

597
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:24,823
we don't rule out that this person is suspicious.

598
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,343
But there's no such person

599
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:27,624
in the household register.

600
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,583
We couldn't find anything at all.

601
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:32,183
This person must have used a fake name.

602
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:33,384
Deputy Chief,

603
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,223
we can try the archive.

604
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:36,664
The archive?

605
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:38,463
When I was organizing the archive,

606
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:40,303
not only there are about the imperial courts
and official residence,

607
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:43,343
there were also local tabloids and chronicles.

608
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:45,103
These things may have some information.

609
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:46,583
Let's waste no time.

610
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,103
We'll head to the archive now.

611
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:49,144
Why don't you let me go?

612
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:50,784
You haven't slept all night.

613
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,343
This concerns my father's innocence

614
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:53,784
and my brother's case.

615
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:55,744
I feel more assured doing this myself.

616
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:58,103
San Lang,

617
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,063
you have something more important to do.

618
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,830
(Qingxin Hall)
(Remember the day we examined the body?)

619
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:04,303
(We found...)

620
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,070
(Gathering of Scholars)

621
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,010
(Zhang Xiu Ping)

622
00:33:30,463 --> 00:33:31,624
Did I wake you?

623
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,784
How did I fall asleep?

624
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:41,583
I had a dream.

625
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,303
I dreamed you left me.

626
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:45,904
Silly.

627
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:47,664
Why would I leave you?

628
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:49,303
You're too exhausted.

629
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:50,504
That's why you had such a dream.

630
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:52,864
If you're tired, rest for a while

631
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,744
to gather your energy.

632
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:56,103
Investigating is not a day's work.

633
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,664
How can I sleep when the matter regarding Xizhao

634
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:00,943
is not settled yet?

635
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:05,703
Deputy Chief.

636
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:06,984
Manager Sang,

637
00:34:07,864 --> 00:34:08,823
what are you doing here?

638
00:34:09,504 --> 00:34:11,144
We're looking up some ancient classics.

639
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:14,264
So that we can make some plans
for future enrollment.

640
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:16,943
Manager Sang,

641
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:20,143
I heard that Grand Commandant Sang's case
is about to close.

642
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,344
You can just wait at home
for Grand Commandant Sang.

643
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:27,223
As for the new enrollment,

644
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:28,784
there's no need to rush.

645
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:30,584
It's better to make early preparations.

646
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,570
(Zhang Xiu Ping)

647
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:37,223
Is this...

648
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,280
(Zhang Xiu Ping)
Is this the female student you wanted to enroll?

649
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,663
Scholar Feng, do you know her?

650
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:48,943
I don't think so.

651
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,832
(Gathering of Scholars)

652
00:34:49,863 --> 00:34:50,863
This girl

653
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,863
and an old friend of mine

654
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,703
have the same name.

655
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:58,104
Scholar Feng, who is this old friend of yours?

656
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,984
It's all in the past.

657
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,264
I'd rather not talk about it.

658
00:35:03,344 --> 00:35:04,304
Just get back to your work.

659
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:05,663
I'm here to get a book.

660
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:07,863
Scholar Feng,

661
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:10,463
I'd like to know

662
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:11,824
who this old friend of yours is

663
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:13,104
and where she is now.

664
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:17,064
Is this important?

665
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:17,784
- Yes.
- Yes.

666
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,663
Why do you young people

667
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:23,744
have to force me?

668
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:25,824
Who had never done anything ridiculous

669
00:35:25,863 --> 00:35:27,344
when they were young?

670
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:29,903
Fine, I'll tell you.

671
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:33,024
Zhang Xiu Ping

672
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:35,744
is Madam Zhang.

673
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,143
Madam Zhang of Qingfeng Restaurant?

674
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:42,544
Scholar Feng, are you certain?

675
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:45,663
I'm already old

676
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:48,264
and don't remember things clearly.

677
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:50,744
But I'll never forget

678
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:53,784
Zhang Xiu Ping.

679
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,650
(Zhuo's Residence)

680
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,379
(Zhuo's Residence)

681
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,104
I just found out

682
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,383
Qian Jiu has moved into Zhuo's Residence.

683
00:36:20,623 --> 00:36:21,943
Madam Zhang was serving as her attendant

684
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:22,943
and moved in along.

685
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:26,544
What role does Madam Zhang play

686
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:27,544
in Xizhao?

687
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:28,903
Is she Qian Jiu's subordinate?

688
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:30,504
Qi Lang,

689
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:32,183
why don't we capture and interrogate her?

690
00:36:32,784 --> 00:36:33,824
Don't act rashly.

691
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:35,264
We need more evidence.

692
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:36,423
All right,

693
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:37,984
I'll send our men to keep a close watch
on Madam Zhang.

694
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:39,383
I hope we'll find something.

695
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:40,663
If she makes any move,

696
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:41,663
let me know right away.

697
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:42,264
All right.

698
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,544
Zhuo Wen Yuan seems pretty calm, though.

699
00:36:57,943 --> 00:36:59,824
He's ignoring the matter

700
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:01,223
since the ledger doesn't lead to the Zhuo family.

701
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:05,703
Someone was following me
when I went out yesterday.

702
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,703
I think they're from the Prefecture Court.

703
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,863
They may have found something from the ledger.

704
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:11,143
Qian Jiu,

705
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,903
we must make our plans.

706
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:16,703
We can't rely on the Zhuo family anymore.

707
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:20,183
If we're exposed,

708
00:37:20,744 --> 00:37:22,423
how would that benefit Mr. Zhuo?

709
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:24,903
We're on the same boat.

710
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:26,984
Are you worried too much?

711
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:30,824
After working together for so many years,

712
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
the Zhuo family benefits more than us.

713
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:36,223
Now, Zhuo Wen Yuan
is with the Ministry of Personnel

714
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:37,623
and joins forces with the Song family.

715
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:41,463
He may no longer need our help in the future.

716
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,984
In the eyes of the Zhuo family,

717
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:49,504
we're just like chicken ribs.

718
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:52,383
It's tasteless, but it's a pity to throw it away.

719
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:57,903
We might be disposed of
if we no longer serve any purpose.

720
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:00,264
We must defend ourselves.

721
00:38:09,784 --> 00:38:10,544
Qian Jiu,

722
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:12,504
you've always been reliable.

723
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,744
So I've always felt assured.

724
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:16,943
But when it comes to Zhuo Wen Yuan,

725
00:38:16,943 --> 00:38:18,423
you keep getting confused.

726
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:21,223
You're falling deeper now.

727
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,024
If you have

728
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,544
to choose between Zhuo Wen Yuan and me one day,

729
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,863
you won't turn your back on me, right?

730
00:38:31,663 --> 00:38:32,824
I wouldn't dare.

731
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:34,943
I'll never forget

732
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,463
the kindness you've shown me.

733
00:38:36,943 --> 00:38:38,663
I'll never betray Xizhao

734
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:39,744
or you.

735
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:46,784
I'll follow you everywhere you go.

736
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:06,663
You're finally home.

737
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:09,984
What have you been doing all day?

738
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,824
Why don't you care about the marriage bestowal?

739
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:15,903
You even made Lan came to rush personally.

740
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:17,663
That's outrageous.

741
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:19,744
Madam, it's okay.

742
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,584
I'm only visiting under my parents' order.

743
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:24,304
We don't mean to rush the wedding.

744
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,383
Look

745
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:27,264
how sensible Lan is.

746
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:29,064
She's such a great daughter-in-law.

747
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:30,984
What are you still waiting for?

748
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:33,623
All right, then.

749
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:35,943
Both of you should discuss

750
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:37,824
and set the date quickly.

751
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:40,784
If His Majesty asks about the wedding,

752
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:43,304
the Yan family can at least answer.

753
00:39:53,584 --> 00:39:54,304
Yun Zhi,

754
00:39:54,863 --> 00:39:57,784
are you still busy with the Sang family recently?

755
00:39:58,544 --> 00:39:58,863
Yes.

756
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:04,104
If this case isn't solved for one day,

757
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,143
are you planning to delay this matter?

758
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:13,824
Lan, stop forcing me.

759
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:17,584
We've known each other for many years.

760
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:19,463
I'm sure you know what kind of person I am.

761
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:20,863
In this life,

762
00:40:21,703 --> 00:40:22,584
I'll only marry Sang Qi.

763
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:24,264
Stop wasting time on me.

764
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:26,663
Do you want to defy His Majesty's order?

765
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:28,584
Our wedding

766
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:30,463
is His Majesty's grace.

767
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:32,703
His Majesty only bestows the marriage.

768
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:34,703
He didn't set any date.

769
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:35,943
It's not considered as defying His Majesty.

770
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:38,304
Yun Zhi...

771
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:38,863
Bai Shi.

772
00:40:38,984 --> 00:40:39,304
Yes.

773
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,344
It suddenly occurred to me that there
was another doubtful point in the case.

774
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:42,064
Prepare the horse.

775
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:43,264
All right.

776
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,744
Miss Su, I'll take my leave.

777
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:47,183
Lan,

778
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:49,183
I have official duty to settle.

779
00:40:50,423 --> 00:40:50,863
Make yourself at home.

780
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:05,584
Except for the land deal at the apothecary,

781
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,943
there's no other useful information.

782
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:13,104
Did we miss anything?

783
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:15,663
Let me check it again.

784
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:32,863
You must be tired.

785
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:35,943
I'm okay.

786
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:38,064
I don't need you to serve me.

787
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,984
I wasn't serving you.

788
00:41:41,223 --> 00:41:42,264
When I'm tired next time,

789
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:43,544
you'll have to massage me too.

790
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:45,903
All right.

791
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:56,383
You look down when you return.

792
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,423
Did your family rush you about the wedding?

793
00:42:03,183 --> 00:42:04,183
Let's put that aside.

794
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:08,104
What matters now

795
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:10,183
is dealing with Xizhao.

796
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:17,584
But fortunately,

797
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:18,710
(Transaction)
everything on this ledger

798
00:42:19,344 --> 00:42:20,863
doesn't involve Grand Commandant Sang.

799
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:23,223
After this matter is over,

800
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:25,064
Grand Commandant will go home.

801
00:42:26,423 --> 00:42:27,463
Deputy Chief,

802
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:30,264
if we can't find anything

803
00:42:31,304 --> 00:42:32,663
from this ledger,

804
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,383
with this land transaction alone,

805
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:37,544
can we really lure Xizhao out?

806
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:43,264
Target the vital point.

807
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:46,663
We must catch the head of Xizhao first.

808
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:49,504
Do you mean

809
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,824
