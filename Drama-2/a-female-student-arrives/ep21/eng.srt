If there's no one else is challenging,

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,320
I'll let both of them compete, then.

The winner

32
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,560
can marry my daughter, Sang Qi.

33
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,240
Song Luo Tian of the Song family
will challenge too!

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,810
Wait, Sister,

35
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,090
you even sell me out.

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,810
Quiet.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,000
Song Luo Tian, you already have a wife.

38
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,360
Have you forgotten?

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,090
Yes, that's right.

40
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,130
Deputy Chief, let Song Luo Tian
compete with Zhuo Wen Yuan.

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Qi just said

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,130
that Song Luo Tian is already married.

43
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,130
He can't take part.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,880
They're right.

45
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,800
How can I even beat them?

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
Stop waiting. Let's begin.

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,770
I've been waiting for this moment.

48
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,800
I'll announce the rule of this tournament.

49
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,600
Anyone who falls

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,680
or falls outside of the ring

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,880
loses!

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,240
Incredible!

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,010
If I knew, I wouldn't have left it

54
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,370
for Father to decide this kind of thing.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,440
It doesn't matter who wins.

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,320
I will only marry Deputy Chief.

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,010
Nice!

58
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,370
Great skills!

59
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,600
I thought

60
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,050
men would express their love

61
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,880
to the girl they like before fighting.

62
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,770
Instead of saying anything,
they start fighting right away.

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,320
Lian Pian, you read too many storytelling scripts.

64
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,680
A real man doesn't chatter.

65
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,680
This is fine too.

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,160
At least, they're willing to take
the risk for the one they love.

67
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,050
Nice!

68
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,570
Why aren't you making your move?

69
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
- Amazing!
- Nice one!

70
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,520
- Marvelous!
- Awesome!

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,210
I like balance in power.

72
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,440
If I make my move, will you be able to take it?

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
- Great move!
- Remarkable!

74
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,650
Deputy Chief!

75
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,250
- Splendid!
- Nice!

76
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,120
Deputy Chief!

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
- That was awesome!
- Magnificent!

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Young Master.

79
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,280
Deputy Chief, are you all right?

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,930
Yan Yun Zhi wins.

81
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,840
- Good!
- Awesome!

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,930
- Nice fight!
- Incredible!

83
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,210
- Great skills!
- Awesome!

84
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,810
Great!

85
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,090
Let's go.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,370
Wait a minute.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,210
You indeed defeated Zhuo Wen Yuan.

88
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,370
But you haven't gone up against

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,280
the strongest.

90
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,490
Father, he has defeated Zhuo Wen Yuan.

91
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,160
This tournament is already over.

92
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,970
What else do you want?

93
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,650
Qi,

94
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,720
it's okay.

95
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,720
But...

96
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,690
Grand Commandant Sang, please.

97
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,690
Father!

98
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,160
The tournament is over!

99
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,560
I... I...

100
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,000
If you want to hit him, you can hit me.

101
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,810
I didn't even use any strength.

102
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,490
Hit me!

103
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,810
Hit me!

104
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,840
Qi.

105
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,770
Qi, I'm fine.

106
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm really okay.

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,160
Look.

108
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,690
I'm fine.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,370
Sure enough, Grand Commandant Sang,

110
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,770
you are the strongest one.

111
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,650
You're pretty tactful.

112
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,560
The final winner

113
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
is Yan Yun Zhi.

114
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:40,120
- That's great!
- Wonderful!

115
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,210
- Splendid!
- Marvelous!

116
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,280
- Great fight!
- Beautiful fight!

117
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,120
- Well done!
- Good!

118
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,780
(Sang)

119
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,120
It was wonderful.

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,530
Careful.

121
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,050
Congratulations, Master Sang!

122
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,530
Did you escape again?

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,250
I've been watching from the audience.

124
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,770
There's something I want to ask Deputy Chief.

125
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,600
What is it?

126
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,370
Deputy Chief,

127
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,090
have you ever considered

128
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,650
what you'd do if you fail?

129
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,280
Are you going to give up on Sang Qi?

130
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,810
I won't fail

131
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,440
because I've always believed

132
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,880
that only I can take care of Qi.

133
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,210
Do you understand what I mean?

134
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,650
Thank you for enlightening me, Deputy Chief.

135
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,810
I never expect to be able to hear your advice

136
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,650
after graduating from Imperial College.

137
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,720
Yan Xiao Lang, what brings you here?

138
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,160
To pick you.

139
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,560
Aren't you scared that Madam Yan
will capture you again?

140
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,490
I'm not scared.

141
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,530
I don't want a wife chosen by her status.

142
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,930
I only want you.

143
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,280
So my mother...

144
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,490
Madam Yan has denied me as her son.

145
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,280
Then you...

146
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,840
Then, I'll just be the son of the Sang family!

147
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,000
Father,

148
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,050
I'll be marrying into the Sang family.

149
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,600
Master.

150
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,400
Master.

151
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Father?

152
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,810
Let's go.

153
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,720
Father, what's wrong?

154
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,400
Father.

155
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,160
Quick.

156
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,840
Father, are you all right?

157
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,650
Good things come together today.

158
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,930
I'm going to eat and drink to my
heart's content when I go back.

159
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,250
That way,

160
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,970
we can drink until we can no longer drink.

161
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,440
Okay.

162
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,490
By the way,

163
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,650
I noticed an important clue

164
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,930
on Song Jia Yin just now.

165
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,640
Song Jia Yin?

166
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,160
What kind of clue?

167
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,250
The smell from her.

168
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,810
It smelled exactly the same

169
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,160
as the smell in the house that day.

170
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,010
She said her father, Grand Tutor Song,

171
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,450
bought the aromatic for her.

172
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,280
There's only one in all Bianjing.

173
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,420
(Morning Dew Pavilion)

174
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,810
Have you had enough?

175
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,490
In any case, you're still the nephew
of the Noble Consort.

176
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,810
You took part in the duel to decide the marriage

177
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,370
and you even lost.

178
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,960
You're a disgrace!

179
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,080
I was too hasty.

180
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,600
I wanted to use this opportunity

181
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,490
to snatch Sang Qi back.

182
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,760
I don't object you to ask of her hand in marriage.

183
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,280
It's all right if you fail.

184
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,080
But reputation must be protected.

185
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,200
I understand,

186
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,840
but I won't give up on Sang Qi.

187
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,280
Stop it.

188
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
We don't have much time

189
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
to focus on the Sang family.

190
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,930
Moreover, the influence in the court

191
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,960
is not dominated by Sang Wei alone.

192
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,810
If we want him to submit to us,

193
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,010
we must spend a lot of effort.

194
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Why don't you marry Song Jia Yin?

195
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,720
That way, our relationship with Grand Tutor Song

196
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,330
would be even closer,

197
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,370
and it'll be safer to take care of things.

198
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,570
Aunt, give me more time

199
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,720
to think of other ways.

200
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,050
Remember not
to let your emotions cloud your judgment.

201
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,810
Yes.

202
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,250
So this is the top scholar
of the imperial examination.

203
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,570
He was granted as the Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Personnel.

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,760
He sure is handsome, young, and promising.

205
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,200
He looks dashing.

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,400
- That's right.
- He's handsome.

207
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,080
He is.

208
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,450
The top scholar riding a horse looks handsome.

209
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,400
That's right. What a sight.

210
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,280
He's young.

211
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,520
Is everyone out on official duty?

212
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,810
Official,

213
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,050
I'm here reporting for duty.

214
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,400
Well,

215
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,690
what did you call me just now?

216
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,010
Just my luck.

217
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,520
What are you doing here?

218
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,400
Did you commit a crime?

219
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,690
You never have anything nice to say.

220
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,200
I am here

221
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,490
to fulfill my ambition.

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,720
So

223
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,930
the Song family is related

224
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,010
to the goods in the warehouse located
in the city's outskirts.

225
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,720
Sang Qi especially told me

226
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,490
that Song Jia Yin said the aromatic she uses

227
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,330
is the only one in Bianjing.

228
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,840
When I smelled that fragrance,

229
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,080
I had the same uncomfortable reaction

230
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,330
as that day.

231
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
That's not right.

232
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,250
I remember the appointment book

233
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,050
stated that I'd be the only one here.

234
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,840
Did you use any tricks?

235
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,640
My father is the Grand Tutor.

236
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,450
It's not hard to arrange for me to work

237
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,490
in this small Prefecture Court like this.

238
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,010
If you came around from the beginning,

239
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,490
you didn't have to work so hard
for the examination.

240
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,010
You have no real capabilities.

241
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,130
But you're good at boasting.

242
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,080
You...

243
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,490
You're a matrilocal husband.

244
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,160
Why?

245
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,720
Do you think you're great
to have the Sang family behind your back?

246
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,930
When Yan San Lang announces the position later,

247
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,080
just you wait to be my lackey.

248
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,690
You're the lackey

249
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,010
and a lame one.

250
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,640
- You're the one who's lame.
- No, you're the one!

251
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,160
- No, you're the one!
- You're the one!

252
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,960
Did you just push me?

253
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,690
So what if I did?

254
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,330
Do you want to get some beatings from me?

255
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,200
I've never seen your Prefecture Court this lively.

256
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:43,890
Bring it on!

257
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,400
Qi Lang, I didn't have the time to tell you

258
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,810
that this Song Luo Tian

259
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,720
was assigned to work here.

260
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Based on what you told me,

261
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,400
is this inviting trouble?

262
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,010
I have an idea.

263
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,960
You pushed me.

264
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,160
Are you looking for a fight?

265
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,490
Who do you think you're pushing?

266
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,010
You!

267
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,930
You scratched me!

268
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,490
So what if I push you?

269
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,280
Outrageous!

270
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,200
Is the Prefecture Court your playground?

271
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,570
Director Chief, please be the judge of this matter.

272
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Song Luo Tian pulled tricks again.

273
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,570
I...

274
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,160
Yan San...

275
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,400
Official Yan, tell us

276
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,130
who holds the higher position
between Song Luo Tian and me.

277
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,050
You're the Patrol of the Left Army.

278
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,130
You're the Patrol of the Right Army.

279
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,130
If both of you fight,

280
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,600
won't you be a laughingstock if this gets out?

281
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,760
Did you hear that? The left has
always been regarded as higher.

282
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,570
So who's the lackey now?

283
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,810
Don't think everything is fine
after your appointment.

284
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,570
You'll need my acknowledgment

285
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,760
to get a foothold here.

286
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,570
(Using a test as pretext,)

287
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,450
This is yours.

288
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,490
(show those plants to Song Luo Tian)

289
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,400
(to see if he can recognize it.)

290
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,520
This is yours.

291
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,130
Recently, we have seized a batch

292
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,520
of illegal plants for medicine.

293
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,640
I'll give you four hours

294
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,010
to complete the record of the case.

295
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,890
Our Prefecture Court is small.

296
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,840
So do it here.

297
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,050
They look like wild vegetables.

298
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,570
It smells like one too.

299
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,330
What's this smell?

300
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,640
Hey, Young Master Song,

301
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,760
are you here to enjoy life?

302
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,010
Qi Lang, will this work?

303
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,720
What if he's putting up an act?

304
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,370
Song Luo Tian may be a profligate son of the rich.

305
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,490
But he has a simple mind.

306
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,760
If he's hiding something,

307
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,280
it'll be shown on his face right away.

308
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,370
It looks like he doesn't know
about his family's dirty work.

309
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,520
Now, the warehouse is investigated.

310
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,400
I'm sure the Song family has received the news.

311
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,570
Qi Lang,

312
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,160
why won't we use Song Luo Tian

313
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,280
to inquire about this family?

314
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,760
If we remove him
from the position out of a sudden,

315
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,520
I fear it'll alert the enemy.

316
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,370
All right.

317
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,050
You're very thorough, San Lang.

318
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,890
Later, I'm going to the outskirts again

319
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,690
to see if we missed anything.

320
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,640
It's decided, then.

370
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,690
This official robe would naturally match you.

371
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,970
But are you here to brag

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,240
about your clothes?

373
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,120
Don't you welcome me?

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,160
It's my first day at my job.

375
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,000
I should be cautious.

376
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,690
About the ring...

377
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
I only lost a martial arts tournament.

378
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,730
Are you going to sever ties

379
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,850
and stop being friends with me?

380
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,480
All right, I'll stop teasing you.

381
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,610
I'm here on official duty.

382
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,120
I'm here looking for a register.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,760
It's over here.

384
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,640
They are all here.

385
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,330
Find it yourself.

386
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,760
I still have work to do.

387
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,730
Manager Sang, do a good job.

388
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,970
My work is done.

389
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,760
Thank you for keeping me company.

390
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,120
It's my job, no need to mention it.

391
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,090
It's already late.

392
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,610
I'll send you home.

393
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,570
It's okay.

394
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,050
Go home first.

395
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,880
I need to lock up the door.

396
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,400
The door is locked.

397
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,360
What?

398
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
The door is locked.

399
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,050
The door must have been locked from the outside.

400
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,610
Is someone trying to make fun of me?

401
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,930
Enough, we're trapped in here.

402
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,690
We'll wait.

403
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,850
Yan San Lang isn't human at all.

404
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,610
He's the King of Hell.

405
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,640
I copied the case for more than five hours.

406
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,970
I've never written that many words
in the Imperial College.

407
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,450
Youngsters like you

408
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,400
are just too naive.

409
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
You need to be taught a lesson.

410
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,850
Master.

411
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,240
If you're whipped a few times by your superior,

412
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,850
your skin will be thick.

413
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,880
Grand Commandant Sang, you are indeed experienced.

414
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,000
In the Prefecture Court,

415
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,360
they do collect all kinds of whips.

416
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,450
I think it won't be long

417
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,360
for me to get severe beatings.

418
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,090
Deputy Chief.

419
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:35,970
Grand Commandant Sang.

420
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,090
I didn't see Sang Qi around.

421
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,480
I was about to ask you.

422
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,050
Since she took office,

423
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
is she so busy that she couldn't come home?

424
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,330
The school term for the Imperial College
hasn't started yet.

425
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,570
Logically speaking, the Archive
shouldn't have much work.

426
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,090
I'll search for her.

427
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,880
Young Master, the door is locked.

428
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
This lock doesn't belong to the Imperial College.

429
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,050
Could it be those people from Xizhao?

430
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:09,850
Qi is still inside.

431
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,210
We must unlock this quickly.

432
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,480
Young Master, this lock is not simple.

433
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,970
Those locks with ordinary mechanism
are difficult to open.

434
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,730
Let alone

435
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,160
this complex serial lock.

436
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,210
Out of the way and stop talking.

437
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,450
Qi!

438
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,810
Deputy Chief.

439
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,520
Deputy Chief.

440
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,760
Is this necessary?

441
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,520
Yes, it is.

442
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,850
Zhuo Wen Yuan, I'll be frank with you.

443
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,850
I won the tournament.

444
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,690
Qi is already betrothed to me.

445
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
If you overstep the boundary again,

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,160
I will never show mercy to you

447
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,400

Anyone can enter.

What is Deputy Chief thinking this time?

489
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,850
Deputy Chief has always been unconventional.

490
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,400
How can we guess at all?

491
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,090
Let me divine.

492
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,090
It's auspicious!

493
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
I can't believe it's auspicious.

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,240
I knew

495
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,120
everything was within my grasp.

496
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,000
What did you hear?

497
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,120
The notice stated the Archive
would be opened to the public.

498
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,330
The Archive?

499
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,160
Even women can enter.

500
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,880
Women can go too?

501
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,090
That means I can meet Deputy Chief Yan.

502
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,930
Go back to the residence.

503
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,090
So many people.

504
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,850
How did you think of this plan?

505
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,330
Guess.

506
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,570
I wanted to praise you,

507
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,640
but you're testing me.

508
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,450

510
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,090
If I'm not mistaken,

511
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,160
(Archive)
you have a hidden purpose.

512
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,000
Hidden purpose?

513
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,810
Care to explain?

514
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,280
You continuously propose
the recruitment of female students,

515
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,000
but His Majesty didn't give an answer.

516
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,690
So you thought of this plan.

517
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,610
On the outside,

518
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,210
open up the Archive to the public

519
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,450
was originally part
of the new year recruitment plan

520
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,000
of the Imperial College.

521
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Thus, the illusion.

522
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,480
On the inside,

523
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,400
you used my identity as a woman

524
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,760
to allow women from the city

525
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,570
to enter and leave the Imperial College freely

526
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,930
so that everyone at the Imperial College
would be accustomed to it

527
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,810
and their mindset will be slowly changed.

528
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,210
Thus, your true intention.

529
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,640
You open up the Archive first,

530
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,930
and the recruitment will follow.

531
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,640
Am I right?

532
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,520
Yes.

533
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,970
You indeed know me best.

534
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,810
But it's your good plan.

535
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,690
If we can make it come true,

536
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,050
my brother's wish will be fulfilled soon.

537
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,760
Miss Sang, but...

538
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,360
Bai Shi, what's wrong?

539
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,400
Nothing.

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,970
What's wrong?

541
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,640
Nothing?

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,880

554
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,930
was different from your true intention, right?

555
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,050
That's what I think.

556
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,450
Can't you keep quiet?

557
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,280
Young Master.

558
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,360
Young Master,

559
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,520
are you still thinking
about what happened at the Archive?

560
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
In my opinion,

561
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,970
today's matter was a coincidence.

562
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,400
Next time, you can tell Miss Sang

563
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,970
not to close the door

564
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,050
of the Archive.

565
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,210
That won't solve the problem.

566
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,520
The door has nothing to do with it.

567
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,210
It's him.

568
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,640
It doesn't matter if the door is closed or open.

569
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,400
He will keep pestering Qi.

570
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,090
Then, just close down the Archive.

571
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,050
That'll solve everything.

572
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,450
Stop giving ideas recklessly.

573
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,520
Do you know how much effort Sang Qi took

574
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,810
from the moment she entered the Imperial College

575
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,970
until she assumed her current post?

576
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,240
It may only be a nine-ranked official.

577
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,120
But to Qi and I

578
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,970
as well as Yu,

579
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,520
it brings great significance.

580
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,520
A journey of a thousand miles...

581
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,610
She only took a step.

582
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,120
How can it be delayed
because of some love affairs?

583
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,690
So you knew it's about love affairs.

584
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
But I can see

585
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,850
that Miss Sang is not interested in Mr. Zhuo.

586
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,850
You don't have to worry about this all the time.

587
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,240
I would naturally trust Qi.

588
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,880
But that Zhuo Wen Yuan

589
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,160
flies around Qi all day

590
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,520
like a fly.

591
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,930
It's annoying to see.

592
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,160
What should we do, then?

593
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,330
Are you going to keep the Archive open

594
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,400
and let Mr. Zhuo hang around Miss Sang?

595
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,690
Yes,

596
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,730
I'll keep it open.

597
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,970
Not only I'll open it,
but I'm also going to open it up more.

598
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,610
Not only to Imperial College,

599
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,240
but to the whole of Bianjing.

600
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,060
(Gathering of Scholars)

601
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:18,930
Here you go.

602
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,570
Thank you.

603
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,090
Here you go.

604
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,120
It's mine, thank you.

605
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,400
Here you are.

606
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,240
Thank you.

607
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,730
Here it is.

608
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,640
Thank you.

609
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,730
One by one, be patient.

610
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,450
Here you go.

611
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,970
Let me find it for you.

612
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,160
Be patient.

613
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,850
One by one.

614
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,280
Here you go.

615
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,210
Yes, that's the one.

616
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:55,880
The higher one.

617
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,850
Here your go.

618
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,400
Thank you.

619
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,050
I want that one.

620
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,930
Give that one to me.

621
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,160
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

622
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,970
Here you go.

623
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,210
I get it now, Young Master.

624
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,210
Your idea to open it to everyone

625
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
is to prevent Zhuo Wen Yuan

626
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,210
from spending too much time alone with Miss Sang.

627
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,400
Am I right, Young Master?

628
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,370
Don't try to be smart.

629
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,760
When Miss Sang is busy,

630
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,170
she will naturally ignore Zhuo Wen Yuan.

631
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,240
Zhuo Wen Yuan wouldn't dare
to pester Miss Sang

632
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,810
with many eyes watching him.

633
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,810
Young Master, this strategy is clever.

634
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
It's nothing.

635
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,440
I just want to restructure the Imperial College.

636
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,680
Sang Qi's matter just happens to be part of it.

637
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,440
It kind of happened.

638
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,280
Is it that simple, Young Master?

639
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Do you have anything to say?

640
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,050
Quickly!

641
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,720
I dare not.

642
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,760
Hurry up!

643
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,170
Be patient.

644
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,130
There are so many people there. Just wait.

645
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,440
If we wait, the Archive will close,

646
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,520
and I won't see Miss Sang.

647
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,960
Come on, let's go.

648
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,280
Young Master, Zhuo Wen Yuan
can't get close to her.

649
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,410
But the flies around Miss Sang...

650
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,200
Here you go.

651
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,960
seem to have increased.

652
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,520
Thank you.

653
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,330
Look.

654
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,570
Let's go.

655
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,720
- Thanks.
- I want one too.

656
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,480
Here you go.

657
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,410
I want this one.

658
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,200
Thank you.

659
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,330
Don't rush. One by one.

660
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,330
I want this one too.

661
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,330
Here you go.

662
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,410
- Me too.
- Me too.

663
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,330
Thank you.

664
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,440
Thank you very much.

665
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,370
I want this book.

666
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,130
Thank you.

667
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,520
Deputy Chief, have you seen today's situation?

668
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,720
There were so many people.

669
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,410
They are full of expectation and curiosity

670
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,330
of the Imperial College.

671
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,000
Deputy Chief, what's wrong?

672
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,960
You seemed distracted.

673
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,090
I'm not.

674
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:33,920
It's true.

675
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,370
I see.

676
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,570
Is it

677
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,330
because many men surrounded me today?

678
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,480
Are you jealous?

679
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,920
Deputy Chief, you can rest assured.

680
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,370
None of the men today

681
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,920
is even one-thousandth of you.

682
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,330
Even if there's someone equal to you,

683
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,610
that person will not attract me

684
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,890
nor enter my heart,

685
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,000
because I only have you in my heart.

686
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,920
You overthink all this nonsense.

687
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,410
I was wondering

688
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,720
if opening the Archive to the public

689
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,760
will give you more work.

690
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,200
I was worried you'd get tired.

691
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,960
That's all.

692
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,890
You don't have to worry, then.

693
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,240
A place like the Archive

694
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,520
is easy for me to manage.

695
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,760
I don't believe

696
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,850
there's anything that I can't handle.

697
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,810
Then, eat more.

698
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,610
All right.

699
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Here, the bitter gourd.

700
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,900
(Grand Tutor's Residence)

701
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,090
Yin,

702
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,240
are you serious about going to Imperial College?

703
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Of course.

704
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
It looks like

705
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,570
Deputy Chief Yan is serious

706
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,280
about marrying Sang Qi.

707
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,280
He finds himself a concubine like her.

708
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,850
It's going to be hard for me
to manage his household in the future.

709
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,850
It's already hard to meet Yan Yun Zhi.

710
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,200
This is a rare opportunity.

711
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,050
I have to tell him early,

712
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,090
so he can be more considerate of himself.

713
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,090
But Yin,

714
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,680
don't you think dressing up like this
to the Archive

715
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,130
is too flashy?

716
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,130
This is something you don't know.

717
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,410
Imperial College

718
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,650
is my future husband's workplace.

719
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,520
If I

720
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,570
wear too plain and embarrass Deputy Chief Yan,

721
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,850
that would be inappropriate.

722
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,680
Moreover,

723
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,680
Sang Qi is in charge of the Archive.

724
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,760
I must look better than she.

725
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,090
Sang Qi!

726
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,330
Sang Qi!

727
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,330
Sang Qi!

728
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,890
(I was hoping there wouldn't be any trouble.)

729
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,520
(Here comes a problematic person.)

730
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,480
Sang Qi!

731
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,370
Song Jia Yin,

732
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,440
stop raising your voice

733
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,610
in the Archive.

734
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,240
Qi, where's Deputy Chief?

735
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,480
He just left.

736
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,200
It's not proper for you to wear this
to the Archive.

737
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,280
You should go back and change.

738
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,610
What's wrong with this dress?

739
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,810
Why must I change it?

740
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,200
Could it be that you can't stand

741
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,520
that someone looks more beautiful than you?

742
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,680
But Deputy Chief has said

743
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,000
anyone,

744
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,280
regardless of their gender and status, can come.

745
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,330
Who are you to chase me out?

746
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,050
I...

747
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,480
I wasn't chasing you out.

748
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,050
I'm more than happy to have you here.

749
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
The accessories on your head

750
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,130
jingling sounds

751
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,680
are disturbing the rest reading.

752
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,760
An Archive is a place for reading.

753
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,810
It's not proper for you to behave this way.

754
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
What's not proper about this?

755
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,760
You

756
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,760
can't bear to see someone
more attractive than you.

757
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,330
Miss Song, you should leave.

758
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,570
Stop making it difficult for Qi.

759
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,680
All of you are always on Qi's side.

760
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,890
I can't stand it.

761
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,330
I'm not leaving in any case.

762
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,130
You can drive me out if you can.

763
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,650
Zhuo... Zhuo Wen Yuan!

764
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,810
Put me down, Zhuo Wen Yuan!

765
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,570
Put me down!

766
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,760
