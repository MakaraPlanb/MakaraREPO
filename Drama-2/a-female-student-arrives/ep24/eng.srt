(Morning Dew Pavilion)

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,540
Why came to see me

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,860
so late at night?

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,180
Aunt, I came bearing good news.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,820
Good news?

33
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,670
I can control the Sang family soon.

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,140
Control them?

35
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,950
Sang Wei is now incarcerated.

36
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,390
Why not seize this opportunity

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,260
to eliminate the entire Sang family?

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,630
Are you still

39
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,350
worried about your Sang Qi?

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,500
Sang Wei is a revered veteran in the armies.

41
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,110
Even if we get rid of him,

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,220
someone else will take over the military.

43
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,670
That will do us no good.

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,270
What do you propose?

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,910
Sang Qi is Grand Commandant Sang's daughter

46
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,700
as well as his Achilles' heel.

47
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,500
If I can use this opportunity to marry Sang Qi,

48
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,910
then

49
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,420
the Sang family and I will be on the same boat.

50
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,060
Fearing for the safety

51
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,500
of her daughter, Grand Commandant Sang

52
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,500
will

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,910
have to do our bidding.

54
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,670
How sure are you of this plan?

55
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,110
Don't worry, Aunt.

56
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,620
Everything is ready. We just need a trigger.

57
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,670
I need your help, Aunt.

58
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,220
How?

59
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:05,950
(Notice)

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,180
(Sang Wei was found guilty of salt smuggling)
Who is that?

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,670
-Blackmarket salt.
-Salt smuggling.

62
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,140
Sang Wei was found guilty of smuggling salt.

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,670
He is a great sinner to the nation and its people

64
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,500
and shall be executed soon.

65
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,830
Grand Commandant Sang is the hero
who defends our border.

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,910
How can he let money cloud his judgment?

67
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,190
It's not fair.

68
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,620
Did they investigate properly?

69
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,780
They must be mistaken.

Qi.

72
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,030
What happened?

73
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,190
The imperial court dismissed

74
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,470
all our servants and workers.

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,110
They want us to leave within three days.

76
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,910
Deputy Chief, Master is...

77
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,860
Don't worry, Qi.

78
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,950
I'll find a way to enter the palace

79
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,950
and talk to His Majesty.

80
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,470
(Agarwood)
Young Master!

81
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,300
(Muyan Pavilion)

82
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,340
We received a royal decree.

83
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,270
His Majesty wants you...

84
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,750
to marry Miss Su.

85
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,140
Master wants you to go back
to accept the royal decree.

86
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,150
It's okay, Qi.

87
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,950
Lian Pian, take care of your Young Lady.

88
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,740
I'll be back soon.

89
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,020
Yan Yan, guard the entrance.

90
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,780
Defend Grand Commandant's Residence.

91
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,390
Noted.

92
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,340

(Royal Decree)

94
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,340
The eunuch delivering the decree has left.

95
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,150
Why are you this late?

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,300
Master.

97
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,710
Qi Lang, it's a marriage arranged by His Majesty.

98
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,340
You should feel honored.

99
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,020
Why are you frowning?

100
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,270
We should prepare everything as soon as possible.

101
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,710
I will get some expensive gifts

102
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,430
and we'll visit the Su Residence together.

103
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,060
No.

104
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,430
I have another priority.

105
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,830
I cannot marry Su Jie Yu.

106
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,220
You!

107
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,220
Are you going to defy the royal decree?

108
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,180
Qi Lang,

109
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,990
this is not a trivial matter.

110
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,670
Grand Commandant Sang is in great danger.

111
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,460
I can't just turn a blind eye to it.

112
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,060
Once I clear his name,

113
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,020
I will deal with the marriage.

114
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,870
Can't you see?

115
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,500
His Majesty pronounced
Grand Commandant Sang's sentence himself.

116
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,220
He won't retract his statement easily.

117
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,390
I worked with Grand Commandant Sang
in the imperial court for many years.

118
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,740
Do you think I haven't petitioned

119
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,830
for a lighter sentence?

120
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
When there's a will, there's a way.

121
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,150
I will try again.

122
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,460
You!

123
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:56,870
Qi Lang!

124
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,220
The conviction of Grand Commandant

125
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,060
and the sudden marriage arrangement

126
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,020
came overnight.

127
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,340
This is not a coincidence.

128
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,590
Someone wants to push us to a corner.

129
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,870
It seems like we can do nothing about it.

130
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,740
Qi.

131
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,390
I'm here.

132
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,620
I will find a way to save Grand Commandant Sang.

133
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,340
Even if it's a marriage arranged by His Majesty,

134
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,340
I will not leave you.

135
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,740
You want to defy the royal decree?

136
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,550
Qi.

137
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,110
You're finally here.

138
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,780
Everything is of your doing, isn't it?

139
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,830
You overestimated me.

140
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,340
I'm just one of Noble Consort's kin.

141
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,110
I can't influence His Majesty's decision.

142
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,430
Judging from your crestfallen look,

143
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,340
Yan Yun Zhi must be too scared
to defy the royal decree.

144
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,060
So much for loving you.

145
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,220
Now,

146
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,670
he's busy saving himself.

147
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,110
I won't let him

148
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,780
go against His Majesty anyway.

149
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,670
My heart belongs to Yan Yun Zhi

150
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,870
only.

151
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,990
Despite knowing this,

152
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,870
do you still want to marry me?

153
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,300
It used to bother me.

154
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,340
But now, I don't care anymore.

155
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,270
I just want you by my side.

156
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,870
If I marry you,

157
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,950
will my father be freed?

158
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,870
Will Yan Yun Zhi be safe too?

159
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,900
Of course.

160
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,780
All right.

161
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,710
I'll marry you.

162
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,990
Qi.

163
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,390
You have finally made the right decision.

164
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,430
I promise

165
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,110
to never ever let you down.

166
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,620
I already gave you my word.

167
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Can you save my father?

168
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,470
Be patient.

169
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,420
Once we're married,

170
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,470
I'll clear Grand Commandant's name.

171
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,860
He will be sent back to the residence

172
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,660
safe and sound.

173
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,860
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

174
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,620
If you dare lie to me,

175
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,470
I'll never let you off.

176
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,230
Qi,

177
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,980
you broke my heart.

178
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,150
We've known each other for years.

179
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,350
Have I ever reneged

180
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,350
on any promise?

181
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,740
Okay.

182
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,660
I'll believe you this time.

183
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,590
Why are you still sulking?

184
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,390
We're about to get married.

185
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,270
You should cheer up.

186
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,860
I heard Grand Commandant's Residence
had been confiscated.

187
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,150
I will use my connections

188
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,350
to keep your residence.

189
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,470
And then,

190
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,230
I'll send someone over to help you get ready

191
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,540
so that you can marry into Zhuo family properly.

192
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,180
I regret meeting you.

193
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:13,910
Young Master.

194
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,830
Prepare the bridewealth now.

195
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,830
Keep your eyes on Sang Qi before the ceremony.

196
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,980
Report to me

197
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,030
if there's anything unusual.

198
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,660
Noted.

199
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,390
Zhuo Wen Yuan is a romantic.

200
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,100
The Sang family has fallen from grace.

201
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,180
Grand Commandant Sang is sentenced to death.

202
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,150
Everyone avoids them like a plague

203
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,830
but he still went to marry Sang Qi.

204
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,830
There's one thing I don't understand.

205
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,790
Why isn't Deputy Chief intervening?

206
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,620
I thought he and Sang Qi

207
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,590
were supposed to get married.

208
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,740
I heard His Majesty arranged
Miss Su for Deputy Chief.

209
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,500
Even if he loves Sang Qi deeply,

210
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,030
he can't defy the royal decree, can he?

211
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,420
That said,

212
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,620
Miss Su and Deputy Chief look good together.

213
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,830
You're right.

214
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,980
Let's go.

215
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,950
Please calm down.

216
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,230
Don't stoop to their level.

217
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,740
Who cares about what they said?

218
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,390
I'm mad at Sang Qi.

219
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,540
She's just here to piss me off.

220
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,420
She took away my husband again.

221
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,030
Now,

222
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,740
Yan Yun Zhi and Su Jie Yu
are about to get married.

223
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,350
Everyone has a partner

224
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,060
while I'm still single.

225
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,390
It's just like the old saying,

226
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,740
great beauty always suffers from misfortune.

227
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,620
I don't get Sang Qi's charm.

228
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,420
Young Master Zhuo is so smitten by her,

229
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,740
almost enchanted.

230
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,710
Besides,

231
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,540
she's the daughter of a criminal.

232
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,420
Why would the Zhuo family
make a grand event out of it?

233
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,060
Sang Qi is my nemesis.

234
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,860
I'm the way I am now

235
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,910
all thanks to her.

236
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,790
If I see her again,

237
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,660
I'll dice her into a million pieces.

238
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,980
Yin.

239
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,860
It's Sang Qi.

240
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,390
Speak of the devil!

241
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,830
What do you want?

242
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,420
Stop playing dumb.

243
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,270
First, you took my Yan Yun Zhi.

244
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,980
Now, you snatched my Zhuo Wen Yuan.

245
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,180
Why do you always take the suitors away from me?

246
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,420
You just don't want me to be happy, do you?

247
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,180
What happened?

248
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,060
What's going on?

249
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,100
Song Jia Yin.

250
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,030
We're in the public. I don't want to argue with you.

251
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,660
I have enough problems.

252
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,180
Don't want to ruin your image?

253
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,300
Let's find another spot then.

254
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,390
Let's go.

255
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,390
Song Jia Yin, let go of her.

256
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,470
Are they fighting?

257
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,030
Lian Pian.

258
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,390
Fine, we'll talk.

259
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,420
Just wait for me here.

260
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,300
Don't worry.

261
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,740
My Young Lady won't do anything to Song Jia Yin.

262
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,180
Just wait here patiently.

263
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,830
You...

264
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,390
Sang Qi.

265
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,540
Why do you keep taking
my future husband away from me?

266
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,470
You think I wanted to?

267
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,710
Sang Qi.

268
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,350
Don't play the victim.

269
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,540
What are you doing?

270
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,100
Want to hit me because you can't argue back?

271
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,350
Don't be afraid.

272
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,980
I'm here to discuss something.

273
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,980
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

274
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,860
What makes you think

275
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,660
that you can stop me?

276
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,270
Official Yan.

277
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,540
My Young Master

278
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,350
said no outsider is allowed to enter

279
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,790
Grand Commandant's Residence
until the ceremony tomorrow.

280
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,470
Your Young Master is nosy.

281
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,270
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
I do not see "Zhuo" written anywhere here.

282
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,740
Besides, I'm not an outsider.

283
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,180
I'm almost half a Sang.

284
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,420
I will go in no matter what.

285
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,390
Who dares to stop me?

286
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,420
If this is your wish, Mr. Yan,

287
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,590
then pardon my aggression.

288
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:35,980
Yan Yan!

289
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,150
Don't cause a scene.

290
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,710
Me?

291
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,590
They are the main instigator here.

292
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,910
Young Lady is already in a bad mood.

293
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,470
Please don't bring more trouble to her.

294
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,790
I just want to know

295
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,300
what happened to Sang Qi.

296
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,540
Is she marrying Zhuo Wen Yuan for real?

297
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,860
One has to be obedient
when trapped in an inferior situation.

298
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,150
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
She has no choice.

299
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,100
It's the Yan family's fault that Sang Qi is involved.

300
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,270
Or else, she wouldn't be where she is now.

301
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,860
Enough talking.

302
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,420
Just head back.

303
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,180
Young Lady doesn't have much appetite these days.

304
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,060
I need to look after her.

305
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,660
Okay.

306
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,740
Please take good care of Sang Qi.

307
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,740
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

308
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,830
Just go.

309
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,700
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

310
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,260
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

311
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,270
Miss Sang, you're heading out?

312
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,500
Just to get some air.

313
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,470
But it's late now.

314
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,830
It might be dangerous.

315
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,660
So I already have rules to follow

316
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,830
before I marry him?

317
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,910
Don't get me wrong, Miss Sang.

318
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,500
This is not what I mean.

319
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,540
(Imperial College)

320
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,380
(Imperial College)

321
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,740
Lian Pian.

322
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,660
Just wait for me here.

323
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,300
I'll get in alone.

324
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,980
Okay.

325
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,780
(Imperial College)

326
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,750
Deputy Chief.

327
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,110
I'm getting married tomorrow.

328
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,140
We need to behave appropriately.

329
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,140
In that case,

330
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,780
why did you come here?

331
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,990
You can't let go of our love,

332
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,350
but why won't you admit it?

333
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,710
I'm just taking a walk.

334
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,300
Well,

335
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,060
I'll leave then.

336
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,180
Qi.

337
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,300
I swore in front of Yu's tomb

338
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,540
that I would spend my life protecting you.

339
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,590
But now, Grand Commandant Sang is framed.

340
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,510
Zhuo Wen Yuan forced you to marry him.

341
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,420
I can't just do nothing.

342
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,350
Qi.

343
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,710
Our path in front might be rocky,

344
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,750
but we can face it together.

345
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,260
I won't let go of you.

346
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,260
Rest early, Deputy Chief.

347
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,630
If you're not going to say it,

348
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,710
then let's settle this with swords.

349
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,630
You still remember the sword techniques
I taught you, don't you?

350
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,870
Let's compete tonight.

351
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,540
The winner

352
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,870
can make the loser do one thing.

353
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
If you win,

354
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,990
you can leave.

355
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,750
I won't keep you.

356
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,540
If you lose,

357
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,710
you have to follow my order.

358
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,060
I will give my all today.

359
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,230
I won't go easy on you this time.

don't force me anymore.

No other options?

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,780
I will give up everything for you.

374
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,470
But I can't.

375
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,870
I want my father.

376
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,990
I want him to be alive.

377
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm at a dead end now.

378
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,260
This is the only option.

Yan Yan!

393
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,630
Open the door!

394
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,140
Who's calling? It's late.

395
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,260
Deputy Chief?

396
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,300
You are so drunk.

397
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,020
Let me carry you.

398
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,510
You are so heavy.

399
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,780
Lift your leg.

400
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,870
Your leg.

401
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,180
(Zhuo Residence)

402
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,820
(Double Happiness)

403
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,750
That's the situation.

404
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,710
Miss Sang seems to have made up her mind

405
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,420
and Yan Yun Zhi proceeded to get wasted.

406
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,510
I don't think he'll sober up tomorrow.

407
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,060
Don't let your guard down.

408
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,780
Be extra cautious

409
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,750
during the ceremony tomorrow.

410
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,020
Get ready for any situation.

411
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,060
Send someone

412
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,660
to keep a lookout for Yan Yan and Yan Yun Zhi.

413
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,900
Don't forget Yan San Lang either.

414
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,260
I don't want them to set up a trap

415
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,470
and ruin my day.

416
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,110
Noted.

417
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,300
(Double Happiness)

418
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:34,340
(Double Happiness)

419
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,180
Young Lady, it's time

420
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,350
to get on the carriage now.

421
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:51,380
(Double Happiness)

422
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,260
Now!

423
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,380
Who are you?

424
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,260
How dare you attempt

425
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,660
to infiltrate an official's residence
in broad daylight?

426
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Bring him in!

427
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,020
Retreat.

428
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,230
Don't escape, you evildoer!

429
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,470
Draw your arms.

430
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,140
Fine.

431
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,870
It's me.

432
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,110
Yan Yan?

433
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,990
The Zhuos signaled to us

434
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,260
that someone was about to commit a crime.

435
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,660
It's you?

436
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,020
Your attire

437
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,380
suits you quite well.

438
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,750
Why?

439
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,260
You can't earn enough

440
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,260
so you become a thief?

441
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,470
I am just working with my subordinates
in civil clothing

442
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,830
to check the security measures of all households.

443
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,900
I'm not dumb, Yan Yan.

444
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,630
You're not on duty today.

445
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,710
Stop lying.

446
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,300
As the Patrol of the Left Army of Prefecture Court,

447
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,750
you violated the laws knowingly.

448
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,350
It's even worse.

449
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,260
Save your words for the court.

450
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,870
Arrest all of them.

451
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,420
What are you afraid of?

452
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,060
I will bear

453
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
the responsibility alone.

454
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,540
Should you disobey my order,

455
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,630
you'll have to answer to the law.

456
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,470
Move now!

457
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,260
Forgive me, everyone.

458
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,590
That's insidious, Yan Xiao Lang!

459
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,710
Deputy Chief Yan, to congratulate me,

460
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,110
you can come to the wedding ceremony.

461
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,780
Today is an important day for Qi and me.

462
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,900
I don't want to witness

463
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,780
any discord.

464
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,870
Deputy Chief Yan, behave yourself.

465
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,830
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

466
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,470
you forced Sang Qi to marry you with dirty tricks.

467
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,180
I won't let you have your way.

468
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,900
Deputy Chief Yan.

469
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,350
Qi said yes to my proposal.

470
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,990
I didn't force her to marry me.

471
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,540
You must still be inebriated
from the wine yesterday.

472
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,230
Someone,

473
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,260
help Deputy Chief Yan move aside
so that he can rest.

474
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,630
Yes!

475
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,180
I knew this would happen.

476
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,750
Come with me, Sang Qi!

477
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Come with me, Sang Qi!

478
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,110
Sang Qi!

479
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,470
Did you forget what you said?

480
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,300
Are you truly willing to marry Zhuo Wen Yuan?

481
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,420
Don't worry, Young Lady.

482
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,420
I'll deal with it for you.

483
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,900
Deputy Chief, Young Lady wants you to go back.

484
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,380
Don't force the impossible.

485
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,230
Come with me, Sang Qi!

486
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,060
Come with me, Sang Qi!

487
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,630
Halt.

488
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,060
Yan Yun Zhi, it's futile.

489
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,110
Young Master.

490
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,830
A band of thugs tried to infiltrate your residence.

491
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,630
They have been deterred by our guards.

492
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,300
Deputy Chief, no wonder you are stalling here.

493
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,660
You planned

494
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,230
to distract me when I let my guard down.

495
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,510
Ingenious your plan may be,

496
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,950
you'll still end up like this.

497
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,230
Qi,

498
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,660
Yan Yun Zhi's plan has been foiled.

499
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,900
You can now be my wife in peace.

500
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,870
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

501
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,300
Yan Yun Zhi.

502
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,990
You keep getting in my way.

503
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,020
Now that you have been captured,

504
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,350
what should I do with you?

505
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,830
Young Master Zhuo.

506
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,260
It's a festive day. No need to get riled up.

507
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,180
Time doesn't wait for anyone.

508
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,020
All right.

509
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,540
Since you used to be my teacher,

510
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,230
I shall spare you this time.

511
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,950
Don't worry, Yan Yun Zhi.

512
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,510
I will take good care of my wife.

513
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,830
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

514
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,830
Lift the carriage.

515
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,180
- Play the music!
- Zhuo Wen Yuan!

516
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:11,990
Sang Qi!

517
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,870
Sang Qi!

518
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,510
Sang Qi!

519
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,630
(Zhuo Residence)
Come in. Come in.

520
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,990
Congratulations.

521
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,710
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

522
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,950
(Zhuo Residence)
Come in, please.

523
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,590
Thank you.

524
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,020
Come in.

525
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:57,940
(Double Happiness)

526
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,780
Qi.

527
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,420
I have waited for long for this day.

528
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,470
I know you resent me,

529
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,780
but it's okay.

530
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,590
You'll understand why I did this one day.

531
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,510
I won't blame you for today.

532
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,230
I just want

533
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,380
the both of us to spend our life

534
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,420
loving each other unconditionally.

535
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,470
Having you by my side for the rest of my life

536
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,020
is more than I could ever ask for.

537
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,510
You finally understood?

538
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,590
I know we haven't gone through the ritual yet,

539
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,750
but I can't wait to see you already.

540
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,660
We...

541
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,340
Can we disregard

542
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,230
the formality for a moment?

543
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,580
Just let me look at you.

544
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,620
You?

545
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,510
Surprise, my dear husband.

546
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,140
I am destined to be your wife.

547
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,710
We are finally together now.

548
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,820
Where's my Sang Qi?

549
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,950
Where's my Sang Qi?

550
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,070
Don't be mad.

551
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,900
Now that we're married,

552
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
I'll open up to you.

553
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,820
I can tell you the truth,

554
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,100
but you can't be angry at me.

555
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,470
Speak!

556
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,470
When Yan Yun Zhi tried to stop the carriage,

557
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,660
it was the happiest moment

558
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,790
of my life.

559
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,340
I didn't even know

560
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,180
that one day, Yan Yun Zhi and you

561
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,950
would vie for my attention.

562
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,990
Honestly,

563
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,550
I was touched at that moment.

564
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,270
You promised not to get angry.

565
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,100
When did you two swap?

566
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,820
In front of Grand Commandant's Residence.

567
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,750
Where's Sang Qi?

568
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,790
How would I know?

569
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,030
She didn't tell me.

570
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,270
My husband.

571
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,340
You said you wanted us

572
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,580
to love each other unconditionally.

573
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,310
Is that true?

574
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,140
Young Master, Wei Zhan Hong is gone.

575
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,550
So it's you guys.

576
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,180
Sang Qi, did you bring me here

577
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,510
to kill me

578
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,100
and avenge your father?

579
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,340
Wei Zhan Hong, we used to be classmates.

580
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,180
We never crossed each other.

581
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,750
Why did you frame my father?

582
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,100
Sang Qi. Stop that innocent act.

583
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,340
If Yan Yun Zhi and you didn't chase after us

584
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,550
till Jingzhou,

585
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,470
my father wouldn't have been killed by the guards.

586
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,820
You killed my father.

587
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,620
You are my sworn enemy.

588
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,660
I laid low for a long time,

589
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,270
waiting for a good opportunity.

590
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,270
And God is by my side!

591
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,030
My time for retribution is here.

592
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,990
So you took it out on my father?

593
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,950
Yes.

594
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,820
I want you to feel the pain

595
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,030
of a broken family.

596
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,270
You are very honest.

597
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,420
You have me captured.

598
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,620
Kill me if you want.

599
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,310
I had my vengeance. I can die without regret.

600
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,990
Wei Zhan Hong.

601
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,750
You wanted to avenge your father

602
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,900
but you ended up being someone's pawn.

603
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,070
Do you know that your father

604
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,550
was killed by Xizhao?

605
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,100
Impossible.

606
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,820
Impossible!

607
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,750
Think.

608
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,510
Who

609
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,310
is the biggest benefactor
of your father's demise?

610
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,070
Did you really assume

611
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,510
that Official Wei and you can get out scot-free?

612
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,550
Wei Zhan Hong, if you can tell us the truth,

613
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,820
you will be spared from the death penalty.

614
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,660
We will request a lighter sentence
from His Majesty.

615
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,950
Official Zhuo.

616
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,420
Official Zhuo.

617
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,510
Grand Tutor.

618
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,950
Pardon my daughter's

619
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,180
mischief today.

620
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,340
I have spoiled her too much.

621
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,420
Miss Song is just a victim of deception.

622
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,950
But now...

623
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,820
But now,

624
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,070
we can only carry on.

625
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:23,710
Grand Tutor,

626
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,790
it's inappropriate to let Miss Song
become the sacrificial lamb.

627
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,270
Not at all!

628
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,070
I'm happy to marry into the Zhuo family.

629
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,100
Don't worry. My father is...

630
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,100
I know

631
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,140
this mess is out of line,

632
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,140
but

633
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,230
since you have

634
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,790
already taken my daughter here
in such a pompous manner,

635
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
you can't just ask her to go back like that.

636
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,950
If not,

637
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,380
how would others view me

638
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,900
in the imperial court?

639
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,990
Also,

640
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,820
the Empress Dowager

641
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,790
has been meaning to pair you and my daughter.

642
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,710
Why don't we make the best out of this occasion

643
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,820
and please everyone?

644
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,470
But Grand Tutor, I think...

645
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,340
I'll leave

646
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,230
Jia Yin to your care.

647
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,660
I will prepare the dowry later

648
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,750
and have it sent here.

649
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,660
Now that we're a family,

650
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,990
we have to exercise

651
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,420
our duty too.

652
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,510
Wen Yuan.

653
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,510
Look.

654
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,580
Come.

655
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,900
Many people are waiting for us in front.

656
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,750
Let's greet them.

657
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,420
- Grand Tutor!
- Come.

658
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,860
But Grand Tutor...

659
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
- Grand Tutor...
- Young Master.

660
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,820
Grand Tutor.

661
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,790
Young Master, I got news from the palace.

662
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,580
His Majesty interrogated Wei Zhan Hong.

663
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,950
Noble Consort asks for your presence now.

664
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,540
(Imperial Study)

665
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,750
That's the truth

666
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,950
of this matter.

667
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,820
So you don't know

668
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,550
who's behind everything?

669
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,820
Not an inkling.

670
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,510
When my father was still alive,

671
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,180
he never said he was in contact with anyone.

672
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,180
After I was rescued,

673
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,710
I was kept in a house.

674
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,620
I wasn't allowed to go out.

675
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,950
And when someone brought me food,

676
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,470
I couldn't see the face either.

677
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,750
After they sent you back to Bianjing,

678
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,710
why did they ask you to find Zhuo Wen Yuan?

679
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,420
They asked me to find my classmate for help.

680
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,470
I couldn't trust Song Luo Tian

681
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,180
so I didn't go to him.

682
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,140
Zhuo Wen Yuan is the highest-ranking official
among my classmates,

683
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,660
so I paid him a visit.

684
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,030
He was apprised of the urgent nature

685
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,340
of this matter,

686
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,230
so he took my testimony.

687
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,660
You know that

688
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,900
Zhuo Wen Yuan and I
are good friends for many years.

689
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,310
Weren't you worried that
he might refuse to report this case?

690
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,550
I knew it.

691
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,420
That's why

692
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,510
I didn't Zhuo Wen Yuan everything.

693
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,140
He knew

694
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,420
I was to denounce the culprit
behind the salt smuggling,

695
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,510
but he didn't know
I'd frame Grand Commandant Sang.

696
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,510
Are you saying

697
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,510
that Zhuo Wen Yuan has nothing
to do with the culprit?

698
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,310
Yes.

699
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,070
Zhuo Wen Yuan just started working.

700
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,230
He was eager

701
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,790
to prove himself and so he made a mistake.

702
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,580
Wei Zhan Hong.

703
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,230
Is this everything you know?

704
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,030
Lying will only make your guilt worse.

705
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,580
This is your last chance.

706
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,100
Think it through.

707
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,550
At this point,

708
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,620
I have no reason to lie.

709
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,100
Also, before the exile,

710
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,620
my father kept a secret ledger.

711
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,580
You might be able to find something from it.

712
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,230
Where is it?

713
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,660
My father told me its location

714
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,550
before the exile.

715
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,990
I will bring you there.

716
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,100
I have already confessed everything.

717
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,030
Have mercy, Your Majesty.

718
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,580
Keep Wei Zhan Hong in the cell

719
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,470
and wait for my sentence.

720
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,580
Your Majesty!

721
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,270
Your Majesty!

722
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:14,990
Yan,

723
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,230
you'll be in charge of the investigation.

724
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,820
Wei Zhan Hong

725
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,340
will be kept in the Prefecture Court.

726
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,750
Corroborate the facts once you get the ledger.

727
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,620
If Grand Commandant Sang is innocent,

728
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,950
then we should release him immediately.

729
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

730
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,510
Your Majesty.

731
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,140
I would like to ask for a favor.

732
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,550
