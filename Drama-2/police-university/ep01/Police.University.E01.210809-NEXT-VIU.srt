367
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:55,823
I'm giving up on my lease,

368
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,918

369
00:26:57,962 --> 00:27:01,163
If I lose the 100,000 dollars, I'll become homeless.

Don't go over 30km per hour in residential areas!

374
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,508

375
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,547

and do whatever you want to do?

391
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,148

Anyway, I'm really sorry about this.

No, it's okay.

432
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:28,002
Should I take this off too?

It's a relief though. Your son didn't get hurt.

00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:03,438
Oh, right. He's your only son, right?

445

No, I have two sons. The other one must be on his way here.

Gosh, your son is here.

448
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,817
Of course I'm reassured.

449
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:21,948
It's cancer.

450
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:25,117
It's hard to spot stage one cancer.

451
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:27,557
I must say, it's all thanks to the accident.

452
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,627
You're saying he'll be okay after getting surgery, right?

453
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,468
So that he'll be okay,

454
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:37,498
I'm suggesting Robot David surgery.

455
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,107
How much will that be?

456
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:43,438
It's non-benefit surgery, so it'll be around 7,000 dollars.

457
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,153
Or he could take the old treatment.

458
00:31:47,153 --> 00:31:49,123
He could remove...

459
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,347
Remove?

460
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:52,722
No, that's not what I meant.

461
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:55,623
We'll take Robot David surgery. We'll take that no matter what.

462
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:56,787
Oh, gosh.

463
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,958
How did get that cancer?

464
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:02,093
He's so kind and diligent.

465
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:04,833
- My gosh. - Where is his hospital?

466
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,232
I'm going to see him right now.

467
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:08,432
You won't be able to see him anyway.

468
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:09,597

Can you lend us some money for my dad?

473
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:20,813
Let us borrow 7,000 dollars for his surgery.

474
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:24,377
I'll make sure to pay back after I become successful.

475
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:26,117
It's 7,000 dollars?

476
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:29,718

Stop it! We don't have any money!

He's been hurting his teeth, and he couldn't see a dentist.

489
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:02,133

00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:56,367
We should go for it even if we don't win.

541
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:07,277
Yes!

542
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:11,188
We got it. We got their account.

543
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:16,257
Dong Man.

544
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:19,232
I think they're being hacked by someone else.

545
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,327
What?

546
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:22,827
(Deposit completed, 7,000 dollars)

547
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:25,268
We did it!

548
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:26,772
Yes, we did!

549
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:28,197
What are you talking about?

550
00:37:29,142 --> 00:37:30,943
What's going on?

551
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:33,042
What's going on? Wait.

552
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,113
Corporal Joo!

553
00:37:34,113 --> 00:37:36,038
I'm working on it!

554
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:37,878
(This webpage cannot be found.)

555
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:43,987
Hey.

556
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:46,562
All their websites and accounts are gone.

557
00:37:46,562 --> 00:37:48,292
There's no way we can catch them now.

558
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:50,958
The year we spent working on their case was all for nothing!

559
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:53,228
Since I take pity on you,

560
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:55,827
I won't let you resign.

561
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,168
I'll transfer you to another department.

562
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:01,743
You're suspended. Get out of here!

563
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:05,042
How can we catch the criminals if we follow all the regulations?

564
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,912
Also, this wasn't even my fault.

565
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,513
Some lunatic messed up with our work.

566
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:10,177
You'd better shut your mouth!

567
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:13,717
I don't need a cop like you...

568
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:16,347
who rides the high horse on our team. Get out.

569
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:19,447
Get out, you punk!

570
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:36,808
Please let my dad take that robot surgery.

571
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:38,912
Make sure to kill all the cancer cells...

572
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:41,478
right then and there.

573
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:45,447
It seems like your dad is really upset.

574
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:48,248
His younger son will take care of that.

575
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:51,588
How old are you, by the way?

576
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:53,018
I'm so sorry.

577
00:38:56,562 --> 00:39:00,027
I'd be more at ease if you just scold me or give me a beating.

578
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:03,527
Just like how you treat Seung Bum.

579
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,838
Get some rest. You have surgery tomorrow morning.

580
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:25,792
Gosh, your sons paid for your surgery...

581
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:28,788
with the money they earned from their part-time jobs.

582
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,257
Goodness.

583
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:33,297
(Lobby, Counter)

584
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:50,947
(Lobby, Counter)

585
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:04,577
(You have passed the written exam. See below for information...)

586
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:08,071
(on the physical ability test and in-person interview.)

587
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:15,281
(Oh Kang Hee, You have passed the written exam.)

588
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:25,821
Run! Keep going.

589
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:33,431
Okay, you passed.

590
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:41,241
(Korean National Police University)

591
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:51,281
My goodness.

592
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:54,321
You need to get some sleep.

593
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:56,721
- You see... - Goodness.

594
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:00,336
I'll make sure I catch those jerks no matter what...

595
00:41:00,336 --> 00:41:01,836
before I sleep or drop dead.

596
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:05,266
You're suspended right now.

597
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:07,931
Right, that's why I need you to do something.

598
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:09,131
What? Me?

599
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:12,376
Today is my first day back at work!

600
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:13,471
Hey.

601
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:15,577
Those hackers...

602
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:19,011
cashed out the coins, and I'm sure a bank account was involved.

603
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,617
Contact the bank for cooperation and find out the transaction time.

604
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:23,927
If they withdrew the money right away,

605
00:41:23,927 --> 00:41:25,927
get the CCTV footage too. I'll give you an hour.

606
00:41:25,927 --> 00:41:29,396
But why... Why do you need to catch them?

607
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:30,566
I must ask them...

608
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:33,361
how they managed to hack into the account in one blow.

609
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,096
But we'll lock them up first.

610
00:41:36,097 --> 00:41:38,201
These criminals.

611
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,007
- Here. - Can we get more lettuce?

612
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:43,502
- Sure. - My special giant wrap. Here, Dad.

613
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:45,241
It's okay. You eat it.

614
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:48,047
- I've already eaten a lot. - I'll eat myself. You eat it.

615
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,516
Come on. You were discharged today, so you must eat well.

616
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:53,312
- Here. - Okay, I'll eat. You go ahead.

617
00:41:55,757 --> 00:41:56,922
It's so good.

618
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:02,122
I digest everything so quickly. I have to use the restroom.

619
00:42:11,836 --> 00:42:14,976
- Can we get a bottle of soju? - Sure.

620
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:16,442
You were discharged today.

621
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:18,777
Your doctor said you shouldn't drink.

622
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:21,272
It's for you, not me. Looks like you could use a drink.

623
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:23,011
- Here you go. - Thank you.

624
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:28,852
(Water and Coffee, Self-service)

625
00:42:44,237 --> 00:42:46,401
My head hurts when I think about Seung Bum.

626
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:49,372
But when I think about you, my heart hurts.

627
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:52,241
How could I treat you guys the same...

628
00:42:52,347 --> 00:42:54,471
when you two are so different?

629
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:59,412
And you don't act in the same way Seung Bum does to me.

630
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:04,051
You never whine or talk about things you want to do or have.

631
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:07,051
And you never told me about the admission consultations.

632
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:10,221
I spoke to your teacher on the phone.

633
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,491
I heard you've decided to go to the Police University.

634
00:43:13,836 --> 00:43:15,761
You finally have something that you want to do...

635
00:43:16,237 --> 00:43:18,131
and are eager to make it happen.

636
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:20,201
I'm...

637
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:22,832
so happy to see that.

638
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:28,212
Maybe...

639
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:31,341
the cancer cells died off because I'm so happy.

640
00:43:40,456 --> 00:43:42,296
What? What about me?

641
00:43:42,297 --> 00:43:45,067
Am I not getting any soju? Come on, Dad!

642
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:46,361
I'll just have one glass.

643
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:49,036
- Give me some soju, please. - You punk, who do you take after?

644
00:43:49,036 --> 00:43:51,401
My gosh, thank you.

645
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:54,401
Is it good?

646
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,431
Oh, is it your first glass?

647
00:43:56,907 --> 00:43:58,002
My gosh.

648
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:00,312
What brings you here, Detective?

649
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:03,982
Well, the thing is...

650
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:21,232
So you did this because of your father's hospital bill?

651
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:27,131
This happened because that man caused the accident.

652
00:44:27,277 --> 00:44:28,836
Can't you just let it go?

653
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,277
We let the accident go.

654
00:44:30,277 --> 00:44:32,407
Hey, this is different.

655
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:34,317
Then what do you want us to do?

656
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:35,746
What would you have done?

657
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:38,286
Let's be honest. How else could we have made 7,000 dollars overnight?

658
00:44:38,286 --> 00:44:40,217
Even if there was no other way,

659
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:41,852
it doesn't mean you can steal.

660
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:47,022
Is it wrong to steal from bad people?

661
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:50,792
We're not the ones you should be after.

662
00:44:50,996 --> 00:44:53,991
Shouldn't you catch those jerks that ran the illegal gambling site?

663
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:02,077
We'll lock you guys up first,

664
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:05,447
then we'll also catch them and lock them up in the same cell,

665
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:07,442
so don't you worry about that. Hey, move.

666
00:45:11,286 --> 00:45:12,412
Your name.

667
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:15,651
What is your name?

668
00:45:16,887 --> 00:45:19,352
Kang Sun Ho, Yoon Seung Bum.

669
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:22,752
What? Hey, how come you have different surnames?

670
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:25,797
That's personal. Is that important now?

671
00:45:25,797 --> 00:45:26,991
Age.

672
00:45:27,597 --> 00:45:28,636
We're 19.

673
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:31,605
Profession, high school student. Address?

674
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:34,732
Namyang-dong 37-1, Jongno-gu, Seoul.

675
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:37,741
- And you? - Can't you tell we live together?

676
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:39,401
You little...

677
00:45:40,016 --> 00:45:42,812
You violated the Information and Communications Act.

678
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:46,011
Detective Park, they can go to jail for three years for this, right?

679
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:47,651
Yes.

680
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,887
When all your friends are enjoying their fun college life,

681
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:53,792
you guys will be stuck in your depressing jail cells.

682
00:45:54,257 --> 00:45:57,662
Thanks to your criminal record gained from stealing from bad guys,

683
00:45:57,867 --> 00:46:01,637
you won't be able to get the job you want,

684
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:03,567
and you'll have to give up on all your dreams.

685
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:06,801
Your life will be hopeless.

686
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:09,672
Oh, did you hear that?

687
00:46:09,777 --> 00:46:12,142
The sound of your lives being doomed.

688
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:17,281
Goodness, you gutsy idiots.

689
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:20,451
Hand them over to the prosecution.

690
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:35,091
Mr. Yoon.

691
00:46:52,016 --> 00:46:53,852
Please forgive them just this once.

692
00:46:55,556 --> 00:46:59,721
They're so young, and they have a bright future ahead.

693
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:04,491
I plead you, Detectives.

694
00:47:05,297 --> 00:47:07,792
Please give these boys another chance.

695
00:47:18,577 --> 00:47:20,372
Get up, Dad.

696
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:22,942
I said, get up!

697
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:27,285
Please. I beg you, Detectives.

698
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:28,412
Please.

699
00:47:35,597 --> 00:47:36,821
Get up.

700
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:47,401
Open your eyes wide and see...

701
00:47:47,507 --> 00:47:49,931
the outcome of your reckless action.

702
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,542
- Stop. - And never forget...

703
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:55,916
that you must always be responsible for your own decisions.

704
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,611
I said, stop!

705
00:48:00,686 --> 00:48:02,011
Darn it!

706
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:09,297
It's unfair, isn't it?

707
00:48:09,297 --> 00:48:13,062
But it's not like the law will go easy on you...

708
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:15,591
just because you're poor and had no choice.

709
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:18,832
How dare you do this when you should be repaying him for raising you?

710
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:20,701
You pathetic fools.

711
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,927
Don't get down on your knees...

712
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:43,422
to protect your sons' future.

713
00:48:43,726 --> 00:48:45,522
It is up to them to protect their own future.

714
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:50,201
Let them handle things like this on their own from now on.

715
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:07,712
Thank you.

716
00:49:08,617 --> 00:49:09,752
Thank you so much.

717
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:11,125
No problem.
