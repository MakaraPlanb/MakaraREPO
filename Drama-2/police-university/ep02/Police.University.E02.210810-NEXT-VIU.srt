1
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,577
(Korean National Police University)

2
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:13,201
You want to get into the Police University?

3
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,342
Not a chance.

4
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:17,511
Get out.

5
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:20,011
Did you not hear me?

6
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:22,682
You're not getting in.

7
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:29,552
Just a moment.

8
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:32,592
Well, I'm not sure what's going on.

9
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,167
But why don't we interview him first and...

10
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,936
If you don't know what's going on, please stay out of it.

11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,501
Professor Yu, watch what you say.

12
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,472
We're conducting interviews here.

13
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,342
That's exactly right.

14
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,372
We don't know what's going on here.

15
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:49,241
What did he do?

16
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:52,942
It's not like he committed a crime.

17
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:57,281
Well, is he your sworn enemy or something?

18
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:01,821
If it's something we need to know, please tell us now.

19
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:04,991
Or, you tell us.

20
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,202
It's something personal.

21
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,662
Is that so?

22
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,931
If it's something personal,

23
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:18,442
you shouldn't bring it into this.

24
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,142
Right?

25
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:23,371
Can we begin the interview now?

26
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:34,321
Please help him get in.

27
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:35,957
Gosh, look at this.

28
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:39,562
He did so poorly on the practical test.

29
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:42,362
But he did pretty well on the written exam.

30
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:43,937
If I get in,

31
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,261
I'll work hard to build up my physical strength.

32
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,972
Really? Then you should join the judo club.

33
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,871
- Pardon me? - The judo club.

34
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,802
Make sure you join us.

35
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:57,582
Judo? Not everyone can do judo.

36
00:01:57,586 --> 00:02:00,347
He's so unfit. Goodness.

37
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:02,782
You'll have to take a number of English classes here.

38
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,526
You should study English more.

39
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:07,696
He can't even speak Korean properly.

40
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:09,591
English? Come on.

41
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,632
Professor Yu, why don't you ask him a proper question?

42
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:30,411
Do you think dirtbags like criminals can be rehabilitated?

43
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:37,552
Yes.

44
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,896
I believe the absence of crimes doesn't make a healthy society,

45
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:43,392
but chances of rehabilitation do.

46
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,697
Despite getting punished, reflecting on their wrongdoings,

47
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,227
and making amends,

48
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:49,531
being labeled as criminals...

49
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,366
leads them to face prejudices and biases...

50
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,371
and back to repeating the same offenses.

51
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,906
- That truly breaks my heart. - That little punk.

52
00:02:56,906 --> 00:02:59,376
On the other hand, for criminals that show no sign of rehabilitation,

53
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:02,471
I also agree that they must be severely punished.

54
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:07,882
I see. Is there anything you'd like to say before we wrap up?

55
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:15,991
To tell you the truth, being a police officer isn't my dream.

56
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,262
No.

57
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:22,061
I never had anything to call it my dream.

58
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,632
To me, a dream job...

59
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,632
was always a blank.

60
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,441
But I saw someone...

61
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:35,012
whose dream job was getting into the Police University.

62
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:40,542
Perhaps, I applied here because I was copying that person.

63
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,052
But...

64
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:46,852
the fact that I now had a dream...

65
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,922
My father was over the moon when he found out about it.

66
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:57,762
I had never seen him so happy like that.

67
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:03,272
If I can call this desire a dream,

68
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,102
now, I cannot give up on this dream.

69
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:11,241
I might not be qualified yet or have a long ahead of me.

70
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,012
But if you give a chance to this belated dream of mine,

71
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:19,452
I will study hard and give it my all.

72
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:21,591
I really...

73
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:23,752
want to attend the Police University.

74
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,432
(Interviewer)

75
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:38,971
Let me borrow that.

76
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:54,851
(Application Form)

77
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:59,221
You can't get in here, you punk.

78
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:03,731
All right. Thank you for coming in.

79
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,502
Thank you.

80
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,642
That little...

81
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,642
He'll pass.

82
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,082
Hey, you.

83
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,227
"Hey, you"?

84
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:27,522
Well, what was it?

85
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,696
What's your name?

86
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,851
Don't you know who I am?

87
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:36,667
Right. Didn't we meet at Secho Police Station?

88
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,832
No.

89
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:41,636
Right. I know where I saw you. It's Jongno Police Station.

90
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:42,932
No.

91
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,301
Was it in the North Gyeonggi Province?

92
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:45,942
Or was it in Mapo?

93
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,246
Come on. You changed a lot.

94
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:49,872
It was Gwangjin Police Station.

95
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,341
Or was it in Incheon?

96
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:57,411
Who are you?

97
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,992
All right. Why don't we take a break?

98
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,122
Gosh. That punk.

99
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,531
Is there Inspector Yu Dong Man?

100
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:12,866
(4 years ago)

101
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,407
The next model police officer is...

102
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:18,442
Superintendent Kwon Hyuk Pil of the Administration Division.

103
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:25,547
I believe that's Inspector Yu Dong Man.

104
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:26,882
Hey, get a grip.

105
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,452
You can't go up there, covered in blood.

106
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:29,911
Hey!

107
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:32,082
Let me borrow that.

108
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,822
Congratulations, Inspector Yu.

109
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:43,692
I don't need this.

110
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,361
Let me say one thing.

111
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,272
Do you think this stupid photo op...

112
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,872
can hide the fact that it's a mess out there?

113
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,716
If we had everyone in here as our backup,

114
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,886
the rookie at my station wouldn't have been stabbed today.

115
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,185
Hey! Come down.

116
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,682
- You know? - Come here.

117
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,151
- Come on, man. - Let go of me.

118
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:06,682
Model police officer, my foot!

119
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,326
Real model police officers...

120
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:12,266
aren't here to receive awards.

121
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,297
Those cops who put their lives on the line to fight the crimes...

122
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:16,361
are the real model police officers. Got that?

123
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,407
Don't just stand there. Get him out of here.

124
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,461
- Hurry. - Get him out of here now.

125
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:24,202
Everyone, please calm down.

126
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,002
- Let go of me! - Hey.

127
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:28,772
Let go!

128
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,142
Hey.

129
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,711
("Two Different Classes of Police Officers")

130
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:40,752
Unbelievable.

131
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:42,452
Gosh.

132
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,262
Isn't he the detective from before?

133
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,531
I can't believe you ran into him here.

134
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,502
Do you know who Albert Camus?

135
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,841
I don't.

136
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,872
Do you know what he said?

137
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,442
"Failing to punish yesterday's crime..."

138
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:09,657
"is equivalent to encouraging tomorrow's crime."

139
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,382
"It is indeed a foolish thing."

140
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,051
Right.

141
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,056
It was foolish of me to cut you loose.

142
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:17,996
And our encounter here today...

143
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,161
shows how foolish you are to have such a pipe dream.

144
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,461
Do you know who Jonas Salk is?

145
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:28,531
“Life is an error-making and an error-correcting process.”

146
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,432
We're done here, right?

147
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:35,171
That little...

148
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:59,232
- My goodness. - Look.

149
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:01,571
So what?

150
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:04,941
Are you here to say goodbye? Looking like that?

151
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:06,346
Look at you scowling at me.

152
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,012
Are you trying to kill me with your glare?

153
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:09,816
I'll probably get out by the time you graduate...

154
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,742
once I go to the slammer this time.

155
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,887
I should have one last look at my wench.

156
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,086
Don't call me that. You sound so ignorant.

157
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:19,382
Fine. Good for you. You must be happy to be so smart.

158
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,956
I went through all that trouble, so you wouldn't end up like me.

159
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,762
What? I sound ignorant?

160
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,331
Stop it. Or I'm going to kill myself!

161
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:33,066
What a nasty girl you are.

162
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,537
Everyone.

163
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:38,171
My daughter tells me she wants to die before me.

164
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:39,801
You little witch.

165
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,882
You wench.

166
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:53,821
That's enough. Let's go.

167
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,651
I gave you enough time.

168
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:58,291
You. Aren't you a constable, right?

169
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,196
When my daughter graduates from this school,

170
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:02,161
she'll be an inspector. Did you know that?

171
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:04,762
Hey. Take a good look at this jerk.

172
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:07,502
And don't forget his face. Got it?

173
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,186
Don't sell it now.

174
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,612
Sell it when the gold price goes up. Okay?

175
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,551
Let's go. Fine. I'll go.

176
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,262
Come on. This is enough.

177
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,962
I don't want you in my life!

178
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:04,522
Just three seconds.

179
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,331
It will pass if you just endure those three seconds.

180
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:19,277
(Korean National Police University)

181
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:23,342
(Korean National Police University)

182
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,951
Why do you always show up when I'm crying?

183
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,181
Why do you always show up when I'm humiliated?

184
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,122
Sorry.

185
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,791
Leave me alone. I don't want to see you.

186
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:48,331
That's right.

187
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:51,232
Only a fool would leave because a girl told him to leave.

188
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:55,612
My son isn't a fool. He can never be.

189
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:00,041
Gosh. That fool.

190
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:18,161
My gosh.

191
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,642
(Bestie)

192
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:28,612
I think Seung Bum hasn’t had dinner yet.

193
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:30,712
He never skips a meal, you know.

194
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:34,882
By the way, who is she?

195
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:37,551
- Sorry? - She's pretty, and she seemed nice.

196
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:41,321
Do you have feelings for her?

197
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,892
Is she the reason why you want to enter the Police University?

198
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,637
I can tell from your look, you see.

199
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,106
It's not like that.

200
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,031
Don't deny. I can tell.

201
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,512
My gosh.

202
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,242
Isn't that?

203
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:15,522
Are you upset?

204
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,992
Lunatic. What's there to be upset?

205
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:21,431
You look sullen.

206
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,691
Mr. Yoon...

207
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:27,531
Because Dad and I ate out without you.

208
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:31,177
Hey. Can't I do that?

209
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,901
You're being absurd, you punk.

210
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,041
Why didn't you tell me?

211
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,512
Did you think I would stop you from going to college?

212
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,022
Seung Bum...

213
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:47,722
It baffles me when I think about it.

214
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:50,191
Why did you say yes when I asked you to enlist in the army together?

215
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,222
- Get lost if you're done. - Hey.

216
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,397
If you want to have a conversation, just talk. Don't get angry.

217
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:57,592
Conversation?

218
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,936
Have we ever done such a thing?

219
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:02,602
You don't discuss anything with me. You always tell me later.

220
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:03,931
Darn it.

221
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,142
You're the mature one, and I'm only a ten-year-old kid.

222
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:12,112
Don't come after me. I'm not just upset. I'm furious.

223
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,352
- Here. - Thank you.

224
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,066
I feel excited at the thought of...

225
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,661
beginning a new semester.

226
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:30,336
I see.

227
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,602
If you stay at the school,

228
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,772
you'll know how I feel, Professor Yu.

229
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,472
I have no intention of knowing that.

230
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,071
My gosh.

231
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:46,486
Hello, professors.

232
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,482
We'll start the orientation for the new semester now.

233
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:51,482
I'm Guidance Director, Baek Hee.

234
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:53,586
For the science of public administration,

235
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:55,157
Professor Seo Sang Hak...

236
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:57,622
will be the head professor for freshmen as always.

237
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,962
Thank you.

238
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,092
Professor Choi Hee Soo will be in charge of Judo.

239
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,161
I'm Choi Hee Soo.

240
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,706
And for law, Professor Kwon Hyuk Pil.

241
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:09,872
Thank you.

242
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:17,216
- Why? - What are you doing?

243
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,047
What I'm doing now is none of your business.

244
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,356
- Well, I guess it is. - What's up with this punk?

245
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,757
And for investigation studies,

246
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,056
Professor Yu Dong Man who’s newly appointed is in charge.

247
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:27,451
Gosh.

248
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,722
Professor Yu Dong Man.

249
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,161
Yes.

250
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,431
Oh, right. I'm Yu Dong Man.

251
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:38,201
I got an important call.

252
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,232
He got a call.

253
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:44,531
- For policy analysis... - Are you at the school now?

254
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,547
Goodness, you adapt so quickly.

255
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,147
Gosh, I guess I've gone easy on you these days.

256
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,242
They will recruit more officers in two weeks.

257
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,852
If you lose this chance, you can't come back even if you want to.

258
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,451
Darn it.

259
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:03,492
Hello.

260
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,122
Here are your drinks.

261
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,596
My goodness. This is really...

262
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:08,732
Hold on.

263
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,936
This is the signature of Go Beer. You have to taste it as it is.

264
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,661
No, I'm mixing it with soju today.

265
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:16,531
Me too.

266
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,071
You should have ordered a stout.

267
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:25,411
What's wrong with him?

268
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,142
So what?

269
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,451
What do you mean, so what?

270
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:33,856
We're tracking many cryptocurrency exchanges now.

271
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:37,252
We expect it'll take three months to track them down.

272
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:40,427
Did you say 3 months? Not 3 days or 3 weeks?

273
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,596
Do you even know how many cryptocurrency exchanges there are?

274
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:45,306
We don't have enough budget to start with,

275
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:47,167
and I'm doing all the job. It's killing me.

276
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:50,232
Don't you see how haggard I look?

277
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,777
You've always looked like that.

278
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,281
Just...

279
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:00,816
Get down on your knee and apologize to Captain.

280
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,012
Are you insane?

281
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,486
This is about my pride now.

282
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:07,121
Your pride, my foot. You just don't want to lose face.

283
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,827
And even if we find them,

284
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,196
we can't track their accounts since they've changed the exchange.

285
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,621
We have to ask Yoon now.

286
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,162
We must catch that jerks.

287
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,131
Dong Man.

288
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:25,046
Is this because of the 100,000 dollars you lost?

289
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:26,706
Well, even if that's the case,

290
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:28,976
I honestly can't understand.

291
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,546
You didn't even care about the case.

292
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:33,041
The case belonged to Cybercrime Unit in the first place.

293
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:34,212
My gosh.

294
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:37,051
Or...

295
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,581
Is it because of the person who died in the accident?

296
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,652
Can't you shut your mouth, you punk?

297
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:47,962
Seriously.

298
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:53,005
My gut feeling tells me that this case is dangerous.

299
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,476
Who are you to talk about the gut feeling?

300
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:56,601
Gosh.

301
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:00,506
I was going to tell you this when I have clear evidence.

302
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,716
- What? - They shut down the casino.

303
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,742
They keep slipping away. There's something fishy about it.

304
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,581
I think this is out of our league.

305
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:17,057
You're writing a scenario instead of working.

306
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:18,522
My gosh, seriously.

307
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:21,296
This is my gut feeling as a police officer.

308
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:24,235
Your gut feeling, my foot. Stop that nonsense.

309
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,137
What? "This is out of our league?"

310
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:29,036
How could you talk like that as a police officer in Korea?

311
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:30,407
Gosh, seriously.

312
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,077
There's one more, you punk.

313
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:34,442
My gosh.

314
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,311
You're not going to talk to me?

315
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,811
Do you want me to apologize this time too?

316
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,351
What did you say?

317
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,861
Enough. Let's stop this.

318
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,462
It's not over.

319
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,361
- You little... - I told you to stop.

320
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:04,831
- I told you to stop. - Bring it on, you punk.

321
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,541
Gosh.

322
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,522
Do you still think I'm a loser?

323
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,696
Answer me.

324
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:23,422
Do you still think I'm a loser?

325
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,762
If you can't give me that punch, you're really a loser.

326
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,091
Hit me. I said hit me.

327
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,702
You don't even care whether I get into college or not.

328
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,407
"Did you do well in your interview?"

329
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:39,071
"I hope you get in." Shouldn't you say that first?

330
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:41,877
"Can you call yourself my friend?"

331
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,246
"Can you call yourself my brother?"

332
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:46,087
You're a loser who can't even say that stuff.

333
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,186
Go ahead. Hit me, jerk.

334
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,886
What about you?

335
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,387
You've done judo for ten years.

336
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,982
You can beat me and put me down.

337
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,827
But you let me give a beating and fall on purpose.

338
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,225
Even now, you're deliberately going easy on me.

339
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,462
You're a loser, you punk.

340
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,692
Would you stop losing?

341
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:07,662
I won't lose anymore.

342
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,531
I'll never lose.

343
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,581
Are you hurt?

344
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,722
It must hurt. Let me see.

345
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,291
Gosh, you lunatic.

346
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,902
How about your interview?

347
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,366
I did well, you punk.

348
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,772
Congratulations, you punk.

349
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:46,841
That crazy punk.

350
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:52,682
Hold on a second.

351
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:57,482
(Wish for admission)

352
00:20:58,117 --> 00:20:59,982
It's here.

353
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,791
Gosh.

354
00:21:05,796 --> 00:21:09,091
"You have passed the 2021 Freshman Admission Examination,"

355
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:11,236
"and you're admitted to..."

356
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,137
"Korean National Police University."

357
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,607
- "Admitted!" - Goodness. Hey.

358
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,301
Oh, my gosh.

359
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:19,476
Goodness. Hallelujah.

360
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:21,505
I'm admitted.

361
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:24,242
Yes! I'm admitted.

362
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:28,811
Why do you check it over and over again?

363

Dad, really?

367
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,101
Are you going to open it?

00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,811

I was going to anyway, you twerp.

Hang on.

Hey, I got it.

427
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,555
No, I can do it.

Yes, that's right.

and make it to the final admission stage. Okay?

491

- Sounds good. - Yes!

492

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,006
All right. For the caption of the third unit...

543
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,865
You.

544
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,436
Pardon?

545
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,766
- Me? - Yes.

546
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,641
It looks like you could use some courage.

547
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,645
So you will be the captain of the third unit.

548
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,545
Let's see if you can last here.

549
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:09,186
Are you for real? How petty. I thought you were a grown-up.

550
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,485
Why is he scowling at me?

551
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,755
Stop glaring at me, punk.

552
00:33:14,531 --> 00:33:16,171
Is he asking for a beating?

553
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:17,965
Stop glaring.

554
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,365
I knew it. Connections always matter.

555
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:27,075
I should work harder. Get a grip, Noh Bum Tae.

556
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,985
Were you able to get in touch with the hacker, Yoon?

557
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,221
Are you sure you guys are close?

558
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,821
I'm busy right now.

559
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,830
And there's a kid I need to kick out of the program too.

560
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,856
- Who? - Kang Sun Ho.

561
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,729
What?

562
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,166
The kid who made you get demoted?

563
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:51,425
Bye.

564
00:33:58,341 --> 00:33:59,436
What?

565
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,135
Gosh. That airhead.

566
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,850
(Chul Jin)

567
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,750
I really have a bad feeling about this.

568
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,091
Can you just get on the team leader's good side...

569
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:14,421
and come back to the force?

570
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:18,930
Gosh. Why does he keep telling me he has a bad feeling about this?

571
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,025
(I really have a bad feeling about this.)

572
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,005
A bad feeling? Not possible.

573
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,646
Seriously. What's up with Yoon?

574
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,876
Track Yoon's IP address.

575
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,930
(Yu Dong Man was coming after us. How can you send him here?)

576
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,296
(Are you trying to get all of us caught?)

577
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:00,036
Charge forward!

578
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:03,140
Left foot!

579
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,566
Focus!

580
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:08,241
Left foot!

581
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:13,020
Left foot!

582
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,750
Hey. You'd better focus!

583
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,991
- Left foot. - What's up with them?

584
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:19,091
Left foot!

585
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:21,555
- Left foot! - They are driving me crazy.

586
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,825
Tell the 1st and 2nd units to take the knee.

587
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,626
First and second units. Halt.

588
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:30,095
Take the knee.

589
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:34,770
The third unit seems to have no concept of rows and columns.

590
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,606
Only the third unit will shout for three seconds.

591
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,080
I told you to elongate the commands, so you have time to prepare.

592
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,215
And I told you so many times to move swiftly... Goodness.

593
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:48,120
Only the third unit will try again.

594
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,491
Turn left and go back!

595
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:50,591
One, two.

596
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:52,786
- One, two. - One, two.

597
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,055
What a mess. Tell them to stop.

598
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,055
Halt.

599
00:35:58,861 --> 00:35:59,996
Goodness.

600
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,870
The mistakes of the unit members...

601
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,925
reflect on the competence of the captain.

602
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,635
Captain of the third unit.

603
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:09,805
Assume a push-up position.

604
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,710
Go down when I say, "one." Come up when I say, "two."

605
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,805
One.

606
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:22,675
Two.

607
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,316
One.

608
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,615
One.

609
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,525
One.

610
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:35,825
One.

611
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:38,930
If the captain's stomach touches the ground,

612
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,266
everyone in the unit will go through a drill.

613
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,086
See?

614
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,586
I told you. You're not fit for this.

615
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:14,870
Everyone in the third unit, assume a push-up position.

616
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,166
- Assume a push-up position. - Come on.

617
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,341
- Assume a push-up position. - Assume a push-up position.

618
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:23,281
Go down when I say, "one." Come up when I say, "two."

619
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:25,451
- One. - One.

620
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,976
- Two. - Two.

621
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,215
One.

622
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,016
- How odd. - Two.

623
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,186
He was so upset like a dog getting dragged to a pound.

624
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,626
Why did he volunteer to train them?

625
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,660
Do you really want to know the reason behind it?

626
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,555
Or do you just want to get to know him?

627
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,166
- Both? - Two.

628
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:47,896
- One. - One.

629
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,215
Hey.

630
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:11,091
Are you all right?

631
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:12,525
The third unit is out.

632
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:14,655
(The Kendo Shodan Exam at the Police University)

633
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,336
Hey, try again.

634
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,051
Come on. Why are we watching this? Get out.

635
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:34,445
The third unit is out.

636
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,850
- Just do it. - Do it.

637
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,956
Sorry. I can't go easy on you.

638
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,516
I need my unit to eat.

639
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,856
I'll do my best too.

640
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:54,496
It's over.

641
00:38:57,741 --> 00:38:58,941
Everyone in the third unit...

642
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:00,781
including the captain seems incompetent.

643
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:01,976
Come on.

644
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:10,985
I wanted to be in Min Kyu's unit.

645
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,985
Gosh. I should have been the unit captain.

646
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:15,615
Darn it.

647
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:17,631
I can't get disqualified here.

648
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:19,356
I can't.

649
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:22,925
They are serving sausages today.

650
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,896
Sausages.

651
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:26,595
How can they serve sausages today?

652
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,166
Let's be honest here.

653
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,536
Shouldn't Kang Sun Ho withdraw from the program?

654
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,445
Gosh. How can he lose to a girl?

655
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,881
How can a guy like him be a unit captain...

656
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:40,546
or a cop, no less?

657
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,345
Goodness.

658
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,336
Hey.

659
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,754
(Research and Lecture Building)

660
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:52,802
What do we have next? The uphill training?

661
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:54,172
Oh, nice.

662
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:57,448
We won't have to roll or fall down at least.

663
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:58,643
- Nice. - Who knows?

664
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:01,243
They might make us roll down the hill.

665
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:02,913
- What? - What?

666
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,782
You, over there! What are you wearing?

667
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,083
Are you seriously wearing slippers right now?

668
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:16,462
I apologize.

669
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,167
I'll go put on proper shoes right away.

670
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,092
Do you think you're the only one whose feet hurt?

671
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:23,063
Everyone here has blisters on their feet from the training.

672
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:24,762
Can't you be more considerate?

673
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,207
Hello, ma'am.

674
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:29,302
I'm Oh Kang Hee, the captain of the second unit.

675
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,778
I apologize.

676
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:33,913
I spilled water on her shoes.

677
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:36,942
It's my fault that she's not wearing proper shoes now.

678
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:38,512
I'm sorry.

679
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:41,212
The second unit, you've been warned.

680
00:41:44,758 --> 00:41:45,922
Are you all right?

681
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:51,362
Hey, their unit captain is so cool.

682
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:53,063
She's really cool.

683
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:54,362
Are you okay?

684
00:41:56,198 --> 00:42:00,238
Left foot.

685
00:42:00,238 --> 00:42:02,508
One, two, three, four.

686
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:05,273
One, two.

687
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,048
- Three. - Halt.

688
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:09,172
Halt!

689
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:11,448
Halt!

690
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,712
- One, two. - One, two.

691
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:17,787
This is the Chungram Hill...

692
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:20,793
as known as "Panting Pass", which the University is proud of.

693
00:42:21,428 --> 00:42:23,962
If you can't even go over this hill,

694
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:26,262
how will you manage to catch suspects out in the field?

695
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,692
All of you, proceed with the duckwalk.

696
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,166
- The duckwalk? - Gosh.

697
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,632
I'll give you 15 minutes.

698
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:36,103
The units that fail to return within 15 minutes...

699
00:42:36,707 --> 00:42:39,873
will have a tough night ahead.

700
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:52,322
(Panting Pass)

701
00:43:07,707 --> 00:43:09,703
Keep going. Don't stop.

702
00:43:14,577 --> 00:43:15,743
Are you all right?

703
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:17,512
Hey.

704
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:18,842
We must keep going.

705
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:19,957
We have no choice.

706
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:21,787
Hey, are you all right?

707
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:22,913
Yes, I'm okay.

708
00:43:22,957 --> 00:43:23,957
Do you want to go home?

709
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,496
- No! I can do it! - We can do this!

710
00:43:26,497 --> 00:43:28,453
Then move it!

711
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:33,023
Come on. Pick up the speed!

712
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:34,592
Hands behind your head.

713
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:36,032
Keep them clasped.

714
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:38,407
Guys, we're almost there!

715
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,973
Icy cold water is waiting for you to cool you down.

716
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:45,273
Gosh.

717
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:48,072
- Keep going. - Go on.

718
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:54,683
We're almost there.

719
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:56,453
We're almost there.

720
00:43:58,488 --> 00:43:59,623
Hang in there.

721
00:44:04,028 --> 00:44:05,692
Everyone in the first unit made it.

722
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:07,362
Keep going.

723
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:12,933
You don't have much time left.

724
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:16,942
What's with the third unit?

725
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:25,243
Bum Tae.

726
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:34,822
I'll stay behind you and help you.

727
00:44:35,057 --> 00:44:36,057
No, it's okay.

728
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:37,422
Just ditch me and go.

729
00:44:38,198 --> 00:44:40,063
Hey, time's almost up.

730
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:43,362
I'm doomed.

731
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:47,802
We live and die together.

732
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:49,302
Get up.

733
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,243
Captain.

734
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:55,342
You can do this. Let's go.

735
00:45:03,428 --> 00:45:05,128
- You got this. - Bum Tae, keep going.

736
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:06,623
- Bum Tae. - Bum Tae.

737
00:45:06,628 --> 00:45:07,658
- You're almost there. - You can do it!

738
00:45:07,658 --> 00:45:09,028
- You got this! - Keep it up.

739
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:10,267
- You can do it. - Keep going!

740
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:11,667
- That's it! - You got this!

741
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,867
- Keep it up! - You can do it!

742
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:13,937
- You can do it. - Just a little more.

743
00:45:13,937 --> 00:45:15,032
You got this!

744
00:45:15,068 --> 00:45:16,167
- Come on. - You can do this.

745
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:17,632
- You're almost there. - Yes!

746
00:45:17,738 --> 00:45:18,933
Just a little more.

747
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:22,878
- You can do it. - You got this.

748
00:45:22,878 --> 00:45:24,273
- You're almost there. - You got this.

749
00:45:28,378 --> 00:45:30,243
- You can do it. - You're really almost there.

750
00:45:55,807 --> 00:45:58,143
- Gosh. - Darn it.

751
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:02,417
Everyone except for the captain...

752
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:04,942
of the third unit may go to the cafeteria.

753
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:09,583
Captain of the third unit, duckwalk up this hill again.

754
00:46:12,628 --> 00:46:14,097
- Get up. - Get moving!

755
00:46:14,097 --> 00:46:16,192
- Get up. - Move it.

756
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,223
Excuse me, Professor.

757
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:21,597
He got in late because of me.

758
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:23,462
Who are you trying to help...

759
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:25,333
when you can't even sort out your own life?

760
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:30,072
What did I do so wrong?

761
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:32,342
I'm asking because I really don't know.

762
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:36,313
You're at fault for not excelling.

763
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:38,917
And for trying to hold out when you're not qualified to be here.

764
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:41,583
You don't even know your place, and that is clearly wrong.

765
00:46:42,588 --> 00:46:43,753
Got nothing to say, right?

766
00:46:44,227 --> 00:46:45,953
Then go back down, you brat.

767
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:05,572
Captain.

768
00:47:07,747 --> 00:47:10,382
No one's watching. Let's just head back, okay?

769
00:47:10,988 --> 00:47:12,112
Captain.

770
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,493
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay.

771
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,993
- There's a bench here. - Great.

772
00:47:25,698 --> 00:47:27,232
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

773
00:47:28,937 --> 00:47:30,608
I'll go get some pain relief patches.

774
00:47:30,608 --> 00:47:31,907
I'll go get some cold water for you.

775
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:33,678
- Wait here. - We'll be right back, Sun Ho.

776
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:34,802
Thanks, guys.

777
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,583
Here, have some water. You look parched.

778
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,382
I was supposed to do this for you.

779
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:52,023
Forget it.

780
00:47:56,928 --> 00:47:58,192
You did such a great job.

781
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:01,433
I don't think I'm cut out to lead a unit.

782
00:48:01,937 --> 00:48:03,063
You're not cut out for it?

783
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:06,103
Captain.

784
00:48:07,537 --> 00:48:09,532
I never asked you for help.

785
00:48:10,678 --> 00:48:12,643
- What? - By doing that,

786
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:15,313
you're robbing me of the opportunity to solve the problem...

787
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,313
on my own.

788
00:48:25,758 --> 00:48:27,152
There's no such thing.

789
00:48:28,227 --> 00:48:30,497
Whether it's for you, Min Kyu, or me...

790
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:32,422
We've never done this before.

791
00:48:36,468 --> 00:48:37,663
I really...

792
00:48:38,738 --> 00:48:40,003
I really don't know...

793
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:42,572
what to do.

794
00:48:48,878 --> 00:48:49,973
Why don't you...

795
00:48:50,988 --> 00:48:52,782
just be yourself?

796
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,382
It's not really about doing a great job.

797
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,382
We're all just doing our best, you know.

798
00:49:01,128 --> 00:49:04,523
Stop worrying so much about what others might think...

799
00:49:04,628 --> 00:49:05,862
and just do things your way.

800
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:09,163
- My way? - Yes.

801
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:12,762
You let me hide behind you and helped Bum Tae today.

802
00:49:13,738 --> 00:49:14,973
That's you.

803
00:49:30,457 --> 00:49:32,282
Hey, Captain.

804
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:42,933
How did you even think to sneak this in?

805
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:46,433
I've done a lot of research because I failed to get in twice.

806
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:50,302
And everyone says hunger is the biggest hurdle in this training.

807
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:51,902
Plus,

808
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:55,442
I wanted to thank you, Sun Ho. I felt so bad earlier.

809
00:49:58,747 --> 00:49:59,942
I understand,

810
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:03,382
but I really don't think we can do this.

811
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:05,887
If we get caught, we'll be expelled.

812
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:08,327
Oh, right. Okay.

813
00:50:08,327 --> 00:50:10,253
If that's what you want...

814
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:14,592
Are you telling me that you want to throw away ramyeon?

815
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:18,063
Smell this.

816
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:22,373
Look at these noodles.

817
00:50:26,778 --> 00:50:28,873
No. Sun Ho is right.

818
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:30,743
Sun Ho.

819
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:34,083
Among everyone I met at the Police University,

820
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:37,623
I think you would make the best cop.

821
00:50:39,187 --> 00:50:41,198
You protected our unit...

822
00:50:41,198 --> 00:50:42,993
and guided us on the right path.

823
00:50:43,158 --> 00:50:46,822
I'm sure you will become a really cool cop.

824
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:58,577
I thought I didn't qualify to become a cop.

825
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:00,413
Hey. What are you talking about?

826
00:51:00,778 --> 00:51:03,246
I felt it when I saw you.

827
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:05,917
We would've been in big trouble if I was the captain.

828
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:09,212
I would have already been dead...

829
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:11,723
or committed suicide by now.

830
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:14,793
Like he said, we shouldn't have this.

831
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:18,922
Throwing away food is a sin.

832
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,962
We'll finish it in 30 seconds. Okay?

833
00:51:42,218 --> 00:51:43,413
Who's that there?

834
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:47,152
Who's there?

835
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:50,767
- No. - What's going on?

836
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:51,962
Oh, no.

837
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:58,003
- Sun Ho. - Come on.

838
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:04,172
Sun Ho?

839
00:52:04,878 --> 00:52:06,172
What are you doing here?

840
00:52:06,678 --> 00:52:07,873
What are you hiding in the back?

841
00:52:08,678 --> 00:52:09,813
What is it?

842
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:12,512
Did you just get in my way?

843
00:52:16,387 --> 00:52:17,723
You're eating ramyeon?

844
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,253
Come with me.

845
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:21,993
Come out!

846
00:52:28,698 --> 00:52:31,068
(Our country has faith in those of you who pass here.)

847
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:33,902
(Professor Yu Dong Man)

848
00:52:34,537 --> 00:52:35,778
Let's meet.

849
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,302
I need to talk to you about something in person.

850
00:52:40,247 --> 00:52:42,143
(I need to talk to you about something in person.)

851
00:52:59,628 --> 00:53:01,893
Answer me right now. Who were the others?

852
00:53:05,568 --> 00:53:08,132
I see. So you'll take the fall for everyone?

853
00:53:09,537 --> 00:53:12,373
Fine. Let's see when you'll give up on that idea.

854
00:53:12,678 --> 00:53:14,442
Run 30 laps around the field.

855
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,862
Let's just go and tell him the truth.

856
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:34,793
At this rate, Sun Ho really might die.

857
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:38,262
Right. We should just go through the drills with him at least.

858
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:41,402
Stop.

859
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:42,802
Goodness.

860
00:53:43,908 --> 00:53:45,172
Darn it.

861
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:01,753
Why don't you just be yourself?

862
00:54:02,028 --> 00:54:03,658
You let me hide behind you...

863
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,362
and helped Bum Tae today.

864
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:07,692
That's what you do.

865
00:54:08,867 --> 00:54:10,032
Look at that.

866
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:12,962
Keep running until you give me their names.

867
00:54:25,747 --> 00:54:27,382
I was alone!

868
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,052
Hey, do you think I'm a joke?

869
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:33,897
Should I check the security cameras?

870
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:37,623
Be it 100 or 200 laps.

871
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:39,762
I will face all the drills by myself!

872
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:41,767
I should have stopped them as their captain.

873
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:43,537
But I couldn't say no.

874
00:54:43,537 --> 00:54:45,503
It was my mistake to have eaten it with them.

875
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:48,572
As the captain of the unit,

876
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:50,473
I have embarrassed my unit.

877
00:54:50,847 --> 00:54:54,012
I don't want my fellow unit members to see me mess up again.

878
00:54:54,278 --> 00:54:57,413
Please let me face the drills by myself!

879
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:00,683
You're nothing but all talk.

880
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:04,822
Han Min Guk.

881
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:07,453
Go inside and do the roll call.

882
00:55:07,758 --> 00:55:08,993
Yes, sir.

883
00:55:13,698 --> 00:55:16,192
You're still not going to leave voluntarily?

884
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:19,833
- Answer me. - Why?

885
00:55:21,508 --> 00:55:23,273
Why can't I stay?

886
00:55:27,747 --> 00:55:30,847
All you ever did was have some ramyeon with your friends.

887
00:55:30,847 --> 00:55:32,648
So do you think this treatment is unfair to you?

888
00:55:32,648 --> 00:55:33,942
Is it?

889
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:37,583
Wake up, punk.

890
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:39,658
To you, this is all too easy.

891
00:55:39,658 --> 00:55:42,128
Breaking the rules comes easy to you.

892
00:55:42,128 --> 00:55:43,997
Doing things that you're not supposed to.

893
00:55:43,997 --> 00:55:45,667
I don't think that's true.

894
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:48,468
That's not true? How is it not true?

895
00:55:48,468 --> 00:55:50,367
Can't you just think of it...

896
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:52,402
as a mistake and let it go?

897
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:55,703
It wasn't your first time.

898
00:55:57,577 --> 00:56:01,012
You've done it more than once, you punk.

899
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:06,442
Dad won't have cancer now. No more cancer.

900
00:56:09,057 --> 00:56:10,183
What should I do?

901
00:56:16,428 --> 00:56:18,192
(Go to college!)

902
00:56:21,398 --> 00:56:22,937
(New remittance, 5,000 dollars)

903
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:25,933
Gosh. That crazy jerk. Where did he get this much money?

904
00:56:32,278 --> 00:56:35,012
You took out 7,000 dollars at 7:15pm.

905
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:37,643
And you took out 5,000 dollars at 7:18pm.

906
00:56:39,948 --> 00:56:43,212
The first time is hard. It's easy the next time around.

907
00:56:43,887 --> 00:56:46,353
And by the third time, you won't even feel guilty.

908
00:56:46,727 --> 00:56:49,523
But you want to be a police officer?

909
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,732
Do you get why you can't be a cop now?

910
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:58,333
And why you don't deserve to attend the Police University?

911
00:57:01,037 --> 00:57:03,632
What? A belated dream?

912
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:06,103
Goodness. You're all talk.

913
00:57:08,617 --> 00:57:10,143
No excuses?

914
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:15,382
I have nothing to say. I'm sorry.

915
00:57:15,488 --> 00:57:17,183
Okay.

916
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:20,422
I was going to rip that mouth of yours if you gave me excuses.

917
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:25,493
I told you it's wrong to stay here when you don't deserve it.

918
00:57:25,698 --> 00:57:27,028
And I also said not learning your place...

919
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:29,092
and acting cheeky was also wrong. Didn't I?

920
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:33,063
You should leave on your own.

921
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:38,203
- I'm sorry. - Leave, you punk.

922
00:57:40,548 --> 00:57:43,672
I'm sorry. Please give me a chance.

923
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,387
I will never break the rule again.

924
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:48,982
I will follow the rules.

925
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:51,453
I will change myself to become someone...

926
00:57:51,557 --> 00:57:52,683
that belongs to the Police University.

927
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:55,123
Just one chance.

928
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:58,762
Please give me one last chance. Please?

929
00:58:02,468 --> 00:58:06,232
You also need to be worthy of a second chance.

930
00:58:06,637 --> 00:58:08,503
And you're not worthy of it.

931
00:58:20,117 --> 00:58:22,712
The captain kept saying that we shouldn't eat it.

932
00:58:23,017 --> 00:58:24,928
But we were the ones who wanted to eat it.

933
00:58:24,928 --> 00:58:26,753
It's not Sun Ho's fault.

934
00:58:27,698 --> 00:58:29,457
Sun Ho wouldn't be going through the drills...

935
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:31,322
if he gave away our names.

936
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:34,993
He wanted to protect us. Please don't scold him.

937
00:58:45,307 --> 00:58:47,747
- What is it? - Don't be shocked.

938
00:58:47,747 --> 00:58:51,043
It's about your little hacker friend, Yoon.

939
00:58:51,117 --> 00:58:53,143
Yes. Did you find him?

940
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:56,953
It's Kang Sun Ho.

941
00:58:57,887 --> 00:59:00,028
What are you talking about?

942
00:59:00,028 --> 00:59:01,858
Don't you remember the kid we rounded up a while ago?

943
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:03,493
That's him. Kang Sun Ho.

944
00:59:03,497 --> 00:59:06,293
He was your hacker friend, Yoon.

945
00:59:06,698 --> 00:59:08,497
Gosh. I can't believe...

946
00:59:08,497 --> 00:59:10,462
your online friend turned out to be your enemy in real life.

947
00:59:11,238 --> 00:59:15,232
This must put you in a tight spot. You know?

948
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:28,853
How can that jerk be...

949
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,063
If I need to be worthy of a second chance,

950
00:59:48,537 --> 00:59:52,203
I will prove it by leading my unit to a victory at the last training.

951
00:59:53,707 --> 00:59:55,572
And if I can't still prove it to you then,

952
00:59:56,077 --> 00:59:57,712
I will withdraw...

953
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,442
without making any excuses.

954
01:00:01,957 --> 01:00:03,353
So can you please...

955
01:00:04,457 --> 01:00:06,982
make up your mind after the training?

956
01:00:07,658 --> 01:00:09,422
Whether I deserve to stay in this school...

957
01:00:10,658 --> 01:00:11,822
or not.

958
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:52,267
(Police University)

959
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:53,338
A miracle? A surprise?

960
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:55,178
If that's what you're hoping for, wake up.

961
01:00:55,178 --> 01:00:56,537
I can't even dream?

962
01:00:56,537 --> 01:00:58,178
Just get to the point and say you want me out.

963
01:00:58,178 --> 01:01:00,247
Hey, I got into the Police University.

964
01:01:00,247 --> 01:01:02,747
This brat, he keeps talking as if we're buddies.

965
01:01:02,747 --> 01:01:03,917
What will you do about Kang Sun Ho?

966
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,117
"Follow my heart"? What's her deal?

967
01:01:06,117 --> 01:01:07,287
- Who? - What?

968
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:09,187
Who's the girl you have a crush on?

969
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:11,023
I'll tell you once we're admitted officially.

970
01:01:11,028 --> 01:01:13,128
Then I should be rooting for your unit too.

971
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,257
I refuse to leave.

972
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:15,497
I will get in, no matter what.

973
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:16,497
You won't give up, right?

974
01:01:16,497 --> 01:01:18,262
Chul Jin. Hey, Chul Jin!

975
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:20,163
I will...

976
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,493
drop out.
