(Episode 5)

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,619
Stop!

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,486
That little...

6
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:19,030
Hey, you punk!

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,186
Professor Yu!

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,395
I said, stop!

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,825
The jerks running the illegal site you're after...

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,566
They are the Police University's...

11
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,605
Hey, Chul Jin.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,580
It rained a lot that night,

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,640
so I'm not sure what got caught...

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,741
- on my dashcam. - Thank you.

15
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,650
It's a gray sedan.

16
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,945
- What's the number? - Isn't that 41?

17
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,646
- It's 4178. - The truck gets messy.

18
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,021
This is my last piece of advice...

19
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,525
to a loser like you in a polite manner.

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,726
Leave without causing any trouble.

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,430
Wait!

22

(Korean National Police University)

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,665
Hey, wait!

24
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,035
Hey! Darn it...

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,345
What?

26
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,315
What are you doing here?

27
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,076
You asked for my help.

28
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,585
Do you still need my help?

29
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:21,615
What did you say, you punk?

30
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:24,725
You asked me to help you to catch those jerks.

31
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,755
Do you still need my help?

32
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:34,535
I feel like I can...

33
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,496
protect the hurt...

34
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,106
and catch the bad guys when I'm with you.

35
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,835
A way to protect...

36
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:46,076
my people.

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,145
The right way to protect them.

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,716
Not as Hacker Yoon...

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,916
but as a student of this school,

40
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,856
can I find the right way...

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,425
as I work with you?

42
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:08,065
You won't regret this?

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,365
You don't know what will happen,

44
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,566
who you'll meet,

45
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,036
and what kinds of dangerous things await you.

46
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:20,645
I may not be able to protect you.

47
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:22,976
Will you really be okay?

48
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,550
Yes.

49
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,615
Look at this punk saying yes without any hesitation.

50
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:30,955
It's because I trust him.

51
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,226
Bird, not you.

52
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,395
He can be a little obnoxious,

53
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:40,995
but he'd never embarrass me.

54
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,036
You always have something to say, don't you?

55
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:48,606
So what's your answer? Are we in this together?

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,916
Well, sure.

57
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,245
Let's do it together!

58
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,360
Then what can I do first?

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,161
First off...

60
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,326
Yes.

61
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,226
Go back inside and sleep.

62
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,631
- Sorry? - You punk.

63
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:13,270
You shouldn't be out and about this late.

64
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,636
If you've got things to say, talk to me during the day.

65
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,006
Don't you know you can be reprimanded for this?

66
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:21,735
Right, I'm sorry. Good night, then.

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,205
Hey, Kang Sun Ho!

68
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,245
Thanks.

69
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,546
One, two!

70
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:06,890
All right. Everyone, halt.

71
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,921
- Halt. - One, two.

72
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,425
- All dismissed! - Dismissed!

73
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,126
- Hey, did you see that? - Why is he running again?

74
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,200
Hey, where are you going?

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,401
- He's running again. - Let's go eat.

76
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:20,626
Come on. Let's go.

77
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,236
Are you sure you won't regret it?

78
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,070
- Where? - You won't find it.

79
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,310
- What was that? - I'm starving.

80
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,275
You look like you saw a puppy.

81
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,436
Who? Me?

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,246
- When? - Just now.

83
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,446
When you were looking at Kang Sun Ho.

84
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,021
What are you talking about?

85
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,016
Gosh, looks like someone's in trouble.

86
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,085
If he looks cute to you, then you're already into him.

87
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,630
Hey, you got the wrong idea. What is she saying?

88
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,725
What?

89
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,461
You heard I've been going on blind dates every weekend?

90
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:51,626
It's not true, right?

91
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,395
That's crazy.

92
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:57,295
When I close my eyes, I can still hear him breathe.

93
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,266
What are you talking about? He's dead.

94
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,376
Breathe with people who are alive.

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,345
Professor Yu.

96
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,056
Oh, no! You're not hurt, right?

97
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,826
Gosh, what did I tell you?

98
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:23,531
I told you to come to the judo gym.

99
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,601
At our age,

100
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,401
it's natural for the legs to become weak and give out.

101
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:27,601
I swear, I tripped on something.

102
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:31,306
Goodness. A real man must have strong thighs.

103
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,370
Oh, dear.

104
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,905
Gosh, you.

105
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,705
Darn it.

106
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,610
The college is next week, right?

107
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,876
Yes, the PR club is preparing for it this year as well.

108
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:46,450
The student council will assist us with the schedule and documents.

109
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,661
The judo club will demonstrate...

110
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,260
a judo performance this year.

111
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,426
Is that so?

112
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,556
That's great.

113
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,930
Oh, right. Professor Kwon, you have a seminar regarding...

114
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,271
public order this afternoon, right?

115
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,795
Yes. I need to leave by 1pm.

116
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,041
You should get going now since you're leaving for Seoul.

117
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,781
- Why don't we wrap up our meeting? - Shall we?

118
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:09,905
Good work.

119
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,879
Professor Yu looks like a student when he does things like that.

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,946
That's what you call someone who can't act their age.

121
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,116
What's wrong with it? It's cute.

122
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,165
Oh, Kang Hee!

123
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:40,136
Why did she have to spew such nonsense?

124
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,025
Kang Hee.

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,405
What was that?

126
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,436
Kang Hee.

127
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:16,475
Kang Hee.

128
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,076
Kang Hee.

129

("Criminal Investigation")

130
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,886
I must've gone crazy. What's wrong with me?

131
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,516
I must be out of my mind.

132
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,961
Kang Hee.

133
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:31,455
Kang Hee.

134
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,655
You!

135
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,455
Hey, don't smile with teeth.

136
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,496
My teeth?

137
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,810
Oh, you're here.

138
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,541
I'm glad I ran into you.

139
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,405
- Follow me. - Sorry?

140
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,545
What's going on?

141
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,816
Why do you need to check the dashcam of Professor Kwon?

142
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,260
We don't have much time. I'll explain later.

143
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,955
Just stall him for ten minutes.

144
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,461
You're not going to rob his car, are you?

145
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:07,626
That's illegal...

146
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:10,760
Hey, I'm not robbing his car.

147
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm just going to check the dashcam in his car, that's all.

148
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,636
But you didn't get his permission.

149
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,171
I'll tell him later.

150
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,105
I'll check the dashcam first.

151
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:22,306
But still...

152
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,851
What's your problem?

153
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,750
Let's say the door to someone's house is open.

154
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,415
I went into that house.

155
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:30,016
Can you call that a crime?

156
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,415
That's housebreaking.

157
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:33,350
Since I was in the house already,

158
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,815
I watched their TV. Can you call that a crime?

159
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:40,891
I guess you can't call that a crime.

160
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,226
You see? It's the same thing!

161
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,795
But I'm sure his car is locked.

162
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,996
Professor Yu.

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,541
I may not be familiar with investigation studies,

164
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,210
but I don't think it's right to break the law...

165
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,675
while investigating.

166
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,050
It's most important to follow the rules...

167
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,876
and investigate according to the law.

168
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,991
If that's difficult, then you should ask them for cooperation.

169
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:06,516
You're wrong, you punk.

170
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,055
The most important part of an investigation...

171
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,685
is catching the culprit.

172
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,555
You're only half right.

173
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,531
You need to follow the law while investigating.

174
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:19,425
But there's only one rule I'll follow this time.

175
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,300
It's to arrest the jerks who act up...

176
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,470
and break all the rules they can...

177
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,840
as soon as I can.

178
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,366
But still...

179
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:36,415
If you want to question my method of investigating,

180
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,716
then come to me after gaining some experience.

181
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,785
There's not much time. Are you in or not?

182
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:51,596
I'm not sure what the answer is,

183
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:56,366
but I hope your rules are right.

00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,185
- This is driving me crazy. - Yes, this is Kwon Hyuk Phil.

186
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,726
If you want to question my method of investigating,

187
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,925
then come to me after gaining some experience.

188
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,726
Yes, I'm on my way now.

189
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,435
Okay. It'll take only ten minutes.

190
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,275
Professor Kwon!

191
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,256
I wanted to ask you something.

192
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:53,785
Now is a bad time. Let's talk later.

193
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,766
There's something I'm really curious about...

194
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,496
that I couldn't even sleep a wink last night.

195
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,695
Could you spare me a minute?

196
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,866
- What's it about? - Sorry?

197
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,976
Oh, the thing is...

198
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,346
Oh, right. I was studying the law,

199
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,850
and I was wondering what the polygraph test was.

200
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,891
That's more related to...

201
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,460
the criminal investigation than the law.

202
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,856
Oh, right. It's related to the criminal investigation.

203
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:30,356
So what I really wanted to ask you...

204
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:34,165
Article 329 of the Criminal Act.

205
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,001
It states that theft is conducted...

206
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,070
when the offender takes the other's belongings...

207
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,506
against their wills.

208
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:43,836
So how is that different from embezzlement?

209
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,346
Lies.

210
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:48,616
- Sorry? - Even if your face doesn't show,

211
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,016
your body gestures can't lie.

212
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,145
The cognitive dissonance that occurs when you speak.

213
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,391
- What's it about? - Sorry?

214
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,285
And the movements of your pupils.

215
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,226
Touching your nose as if you're anxious.

216
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,525
And you clenched your fists as if you want to protect yourself.

217
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:09,236
Sun Ho,

218
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,305
is it your specialty to waste my time?

219
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,636
I... I'm sorry.

220
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,300
You must be open. No.

221
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,366
You need to be open.

222
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,075
It's most important to follow the rules...

223
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,045
and investigate according to the law.

224
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,415
Gosh, why did he have to make me feel guilty?

225
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,386
Whatever.

226
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,795
Just go in.

227
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:14,395
Just go in before I change my mind.

228
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,435
Gosh, just go in when I'm breaking the rules.

229
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:24,976
I can feel the stare.

230
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,445
It feels like someone caught me.

231
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,155
But don't worry.

232
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,285
Hands are faster than eyes.

233
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:53,111
Goodness, I didn't know this car was yours.

234
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,405
I was just looking because it looked so nice.

235
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,236
I saw everything.

236
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,580
From where?

237
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,106
The moment you inserted that wire in the window.

238
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,175
I see.

239
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,655
What do you think you're doing?

240
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,025
How could a professor conspire with a student?

241
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,300
I know, right?

242
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,466
How could a professor...

243
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,836
Anyway, where were you at 9pm on March 2?

244
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,575
- What? - What were you doing...

245
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:34,075
last Tuesday night?

246
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,346
You drove past 39-gil, Ginseon-ro.

247
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:44,491
There was no path other than for truck drivers.

248
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,756
Why were you there?

249
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:49,555
It's not that difficult a question, is it?

250
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,430
It sounds like you're investigating me.

251
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,200
It'd be so nice if you could just answer my question.

252
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,935
Why should I answer such an absurd question?

253
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,766
Are you pleading the Fifth?

254
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,636
Okay.

255
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,136
Kang Sun Ho.

256
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,476
Why are you standing there watching us?

257
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,145
- Go back inside. - Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

258
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,886
I'll talk with you after my seminar.

259
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:22,496
Why? Are you running away again like you did yesterday?

260
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,165
What did you say?

261
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,795
I called you, but you ran away.

262
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:33,435
Don't cross the line. This is my last warning.

263
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,945
I've already crossed it, you punk.

264
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,651
You're going too far.

265
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:46,785
Hey!

266
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,525
What are you guys doing? You're professors.

267
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,271
You're yelling and screaming when a student is watching.

268
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,741
Are you crazy? Did you lose your mind?

269
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,366
- He... - This punk...

270
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:05,506
Gosh.

271
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,376
I have a temper too.

272
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,376
But I hold it in since we're at school.

273
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:16,545
Or should I show my temper too?

274
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,690
Goodness.

275
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,685
Where are you going? We're not done talking.

276
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,055
You can finish that talk with him out of school later.

277
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,525
You should be a good example to the student, not fighting.

278
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,325
Well...

279
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,165
Gosh, that punk...

280
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,440
That little... Gosh.

281
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,281
- Hey! Does he have a death wish? - Gosh, seriously.

282
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,476
You punk!

283
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,246
Gosh, you can't even do one thing you're told to do!

284
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:52,450
You should have clung to his pants,

285
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,521
or you should have knocked him down or something.

286
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,516
That's the basics of investigation.

287
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,126
Right. I don't know that.

288
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:01,560
I got in last week.

289
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,226
Investigation Studies was canceled all week.

290
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,266
I didn't have the time to learn the basics of investigation.

291
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,266
You punk, stop talking nonsense.

292
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:14,210
What? You didn't have the time?

293
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,075
Is that what a student of this school should be saying?

294
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,280
Before you say something smart to me,

295
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,315
study investigation first.

296
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:24,416
Gosh.

297
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,891
What?

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

299
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,585
Hey, you punk. Are you serious?

300
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,396
You made Detective Joo ask for a warrant from the prosecutor?

301
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:40,196
You punk, are you out of your mind?

302
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:46,770
What am I supposed to do then?

303
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,040
We should at least get a warrant to get Chul Jin's phone records.

304
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,605
I know, but why are you doing that?

305
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:58,146
I know how you feel.

306
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:01,121
But you're not on this team, and you don't have the authority.

307
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,321
How many times do I need to tell you that?

308
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:03,821
That's what I mean.

309
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:06,690
If you know how I feel, then let's get them.

310
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,825
Let's catch those scumbags.

311
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,301
I see. You're going to be arbitrary like that,

312
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,095
and you'll stop when Detective Joo gets hurt, right?

313
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:21,365
Gosh.

314
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:24,976
You're not the only supervisor of Chul Jin and Eun Ju.

315
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:29,946
I get why you're being so arbitrary and making a fuss like this.

316
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,916
But if you keep getting my team into trouble,

317
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,115
I won't let you get by.

318
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,196
I'm sorry...

319
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,125
for handling it like that.

320
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,385

322
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:20,565
Hey, where are you going?

323
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,801
We've got the IP address of the illegal gambling gang,

324
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,035
so we're going out to investigate.

325
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,466
But why are you going out, Sergeant Kim?

326
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:30,206
Well, they were on my radar in the first place.

327
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,206
Gosh, it could be dangerous.

328
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,345
Don't worry. I won't die before my wedding.

329
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,916
Right, did you give the invitation to Captain Choi?

330
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,091
Not yet.

331
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,460
We're having a gathering tomorrow, so I'll give it to him then.

332
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,585
I see.

333
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:49,230
Captain Choi will be shocked.

334
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,456
He will be shocked indeed.

335
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:58,496

336
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,801

355
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:50,432
Well, he left his phone at the dorm,

356
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,998
so I couldn't tell him.

357
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:54,168
I will go find him.

00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:39,178
I got you.

364
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:45,692
Shouldn't you go to the gym right now?

365
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,488
No, it's okay.

366
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:49,363
It's for the school information session,

367
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:50,728
and I'll be practicing tomorrow as well.

368
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,932
By the way, are you going to read all these?

369
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:55,797
Is this the spirit of the freshman?

370
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:58,133
- I'm going to study. - I see.

371
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,367
By the way, Na Rae.

372
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:02,272
How can I acquire dashcam footage...

373
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:04,712
as legal evidence?

374
00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:07,178
Well, you need to get a warrant.

375
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:10,077
A faster way, other than that.

376
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,047
Request assistance in the investigation?

377
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:16,117
But do freshmen learn about evidence acquisition?

378
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:19,863
Well, I wanted to study in advance.

379
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:21,958
Good for you.

380
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:25,292
Since I'm a straight-A student in Investigation Studies,

381
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,603
should I teach you about it?

382
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:28,258
- You're a straight-A student? - Of course.

383
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:30,827
That's amazing. Really?

384
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,837
How did you study for it?

385
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:35,143
- Well... - I'm really bad at it.

386
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:36,607
Gosh. I knew it.

387
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,107
If you teach me, I'll treat you.

388
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:44,012
I told him not to smile with teeth.

389
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:45,948
I'll teach you if you ask.

390
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:49,317
If you teach me, I'll learn with all my heart.

391
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:52,522
Okay. Then drop the honorifics.

392
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:55,057
Excuse me. Hello.

393
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,063
Can I take Sun Ho with me?

394
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:59,728
I need to talk to him about the information session.

395
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:01,398
Well...

396
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:06,267
You should have called me.

397
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,438
I would have come right away.

398
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:12,307
No worries. Then again, it's not that important.

399
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,908
And about that investigation studies...

400
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:20,347
Why don't you try image training before you read all those books?

401
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:22,688
You should become both the assailant and the victim.

402
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:27,363
Think before you learn from someone else.

403
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:29,458
When are you going to think on your own?

404
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:45,908
What? You didn't have the time?

405
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:49,877
Is that what a student of this school should be saying?

406
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:56,952
Think before you learn from someone else.

407
00:24:56,952 --> 00:24:59,057
When are you going to think on your own?

408
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:05,758
Hold on. What's the deal with Professor Kwon Hyuk Phil?

409
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:08,863
(Professor Yu Dong Man)

410
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:10,728
If you're still awake, come here at once.

411
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,267
He can come here if he needs me.

412
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:15,738
Why should I go?

413
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:18,968
(Barbecue Pork)

414
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,178
Why didn't you go to bed?

415
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:27,948
Why didn't you have dinner?

416
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:30,918
I asked you first, you brat.

417
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:36,893
You know, the dashcam.

418
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:39,998
I was looking up ways we can get our hands on it lawfully.

419
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:41,633
And?

420
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,833
First, try requesting a warrant...

421
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,998
And if they declined the request?

422
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:46,867
Then...

423
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,413
Ask to view the evidence...

424
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:52,638
What if the suspect might destroy it?

425
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:55,307
- "Suspect"? - The day of Chul Jin's accident,

426
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:57,648
there was a vehicle tailing him...

427
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,617
on the same road, at the same time.

428
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,648
The vehicle belongs to Professor Kwon Hyuk Phil.

429
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:07,258
That's why I wanted to check the dashcam footage.

430
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:10,492
Maybe he just happened to be driving by...

431
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:11,492
because it's near the school.

432
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:12,962
How do we know if it was a coincidence...

433
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:14,758
or if it was staged as such?

434
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:16,932
When you're investigating,

435
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:19,267
you must leave open all possibilities.

436
00:26:19,272 --> 00:26:21,643
You never know when and where something will turn up...

437
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,738
and blindside you.

438
00:26:33,252 --> 00:26:35,353
This is all the materials I collected...

439
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:36,787
while chasing the illegal gambling gang.

440
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:40,388
Every single page is the outcome of the detectives' hard work...

441
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:42,658
and countless sleepless nights.

442
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:44,462
I'll come back in a month.

443
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:45,928
Sit back down.

444
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:49,797
I'll give you a brief rundown, so listen up.

445
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:52,472
The Cybercrime Unit found out...

446
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:55,438
about a new illegal gambling site that accepts cryptocurrency.

447
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:58,168
In our joint investigation with them,

448
00:26:58,212 --> 00:27:01,242
my team found out that this site was actually...

449
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:04,008
a huge enterprise operating on and off-line.

450
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:06,918
Which is why Chul Jin and I...

451
00:27:07,222 --> 00:27:09,418
started doing the legwork.

452
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:11,353
(Legwork)

453
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:12,691
In law enforcement, "legwork"...

454
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:16,087
refers to the process of collecting info necessary to solve a case.

455
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:19,163
We also use various other techniques to figure out the motive...

456
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,998
and confirm the location of the crime scene.

457
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:24,532
An existing modus operandi can also be used to uncover...

458
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:25,701
additional crimes.

459
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:28,272
We can also trace stolen goods and refer to things...

460
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,668
like forensic analyses, phone records, and alibis.

461
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:33,107
Here's an example.

462
00:27:33,543 --> 00:27:37,478
If the police receive a tip that there is...

463
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:41,777
an illegal gambling site that accepts cryptocurrency...

464
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,688
The police will launch an investigation.

465
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:46,688
Correct.

466
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:49,133
During the investigation, the police find out...

467
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:53,127
that the gambling site also runs an off-line casino,

468
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:57,532
so they make a move to catch the person who actually manages it.

469
00:27:57,532 --> 00:27:58,698
What would that be?

470
00:27:58,873 --> 00:28:00,097
"Legwork."

471
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:01,998
Okay.

472
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:04,113
Then the police find out...

473
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:07,212
that they use a unique game terminal...

474
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:08,577
that they created.

475
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:11,682
So the police plant a tracker in the terminal,

476
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:14,948
so they can track it and raid the operational headquarters.

477
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:25,803
They're using the modus operandi, I guess?

478
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:28,201
"I guess"?

479
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:29,827
They're using the modus operandi!

480
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,867
Lower your voice, you punk.

481
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:34,468
Yes, sir.

482
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:38,212
But they can no longer track it due to an unexpected accident.

483
00:28:38,212 --> 00:28:41,182
However, they've obtained a program...

484
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:43,377
that lets you trace major cryptocurrency accounts.

485
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:46,222
So the police could've caught those jerks by tracing...

486
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:48,383
the transactions when they were turning their coins into cash.

487
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:50,222
But I stepped in and hacked the site.

488
00:28:50,222 --> 00:28:51,488
Exactly!

489
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:58,228
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:01,127
Well, anyway,

491
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,432
so they moved all their major accounts,

492
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:06,267
the site's now gone, Chul Jin got hurt,

493
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:09,767
and the investigation is back to square one.

494
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:12,643
But why do you think that the person who attacked Mr. Park...

495
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:14,807
was someone involved in the gambling site?

496
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:18,908
The jerks running the illegal site you're after...

497
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:21,448
They are the Police University's...

498
00:29:22,522 --> 00:29:24,117
Hey, Chul Jin.

499
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:28,188
It's just my hunch as a detective.

500
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:32,258
But...

501
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,627
do you really think we can catch them?

502
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:38,928
Listen carefully.

503
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:41,998
No matter how competent you are as a detective,

504
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:46,277
you can't control everything or predict unexpected situations.

505
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:50,512
That's why some cases are solved in a few months,

506
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:53,648
whereas some take decades to be solved.

507
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,777
And in that process,

508
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:03,087
you may lose your colleagues on the job, which is unfortunate.

509
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:08,228
And in some cases, the offenders end up committing additional crimes.

510
00:30:09,303 --> 00:30:11,032
Each metropolitan precinct's investigation budget...

511
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,772
is 300 dollars a month.

512
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:14,638
The case investigation budget is only 180 dollars,

513
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:18,607
which means there are times when we end up losing suspects...

514
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:23,577
due to our low budget, which is ridiculous.

515
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:29,218
However,

516
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:32,688
if we do not give up...

517
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,888
If the police persevere and do not give up,

518
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:39,728
justice will prevail.

519
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,998
So no matter what the case is,

520
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:48,797
let's never give up.

521
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:52,037
Do you understand?

522
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:53,408
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

523
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,921
(Lecture Hall)

524
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:02,017
Let's go. I'm hungry.

525
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:05,852
- What? What is it? - Where's Sun Ho?

526
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:08,293
Gosh, you scared me. He told me we can go ahead.

527
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:09,488
Really?

528
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:12,557
Professor, I thought about what we could do.

529
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,428
How about we cause a minor collision...

530
00:31:15,762 --> 00:31:17,998
and ask him to show us his dashcam footage?

531
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,668
That's not against the law.

532
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:24,738
- I'm sorry. - No.

533
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:27,413
You're right.

534
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:30,813
That's like a sting operation.

535
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:33,248
- Right? - As long as we get what we need.

536
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:34,577
Let's go.

537
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:41,117
What's up?

538
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,833
The thing you wanted to get your hands on...

539
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,557
by causing a scene at the parking lot that day.

542
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,357
It looks like you were mistaken.

543
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:20,527
Isn't there a program that tells you whether videos were manipulated?

544
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:21,857
Go check.

545
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:24,998
Where are you going?

546
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,797
Oh, Captain.

547
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:35,908
Right, the book.

548
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:37,782

(Professor Yu Dong Man)

550
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:42,248
Don't tell me people here look down on you...

551
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,488
because you're not a Police University graduate.

552
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:48,022
What's with you? Don't you know what I'm like?

553
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:50,658
It's not like your heart is made of steel.

554
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:56,133
I know you also get hurt by people's words,

555
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:57,367
just like I do.

556
00:32:57,502 --> 00:33:00,797
Gosh, what's with you today? Are you not feeling well?

557
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:02,968
You see,

558
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:07,307
I knew you and Eun Ju were planning on getting married.

559
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,848
I thought feigning ignorance would help you move on.

560
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:16,018
That's why I pretended not to know about it until now.

561
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:22,388
If that's what you're here to say, just go. I don't want to hear it.

562
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,032
While trying to track down the gambling ring...

563
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:27,127
Yes, we lost Eun Ju.

564
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,368
But that was an accident, you fool.

565
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:34,468
Dong Man, let's not turn Eun Ju's death...

566
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:36,707
into one of those pathetic, soppy movies.

567
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:39,167
Yes.

568
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:41,937
Eun Ju's death two years ago was an accident.

569
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:45,247
But Chul Jin's case is different. It was not an accident.

570
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:49,547
So please, Captain.

571
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:54,658
Just like you pretended not to know about me and Eun Ju all this time,

572
00:33:55,423 --> 00:33:57,328
turn a blind eye to this just a bit longer.

573
00:33:58,492 --> 00:34:00,727
I must catch those jerks no matter what.

574
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:04,227
I want to finish what Eun Ju was working on,

575
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:06,198
so help me out here.

576
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:12,667
Gosh, you crazy punk.

577
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:19,078
I brought you Chul Jin's phone records.

578
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:23,147
There isn't much, but you'll see a suspicious number.

579
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,587
It's a burner phone.

580
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:29,663
If you just start digging and end up getting hurt like Chul Jin,

581
00:34:29,663 --> 00:34:31,357
you're dead meat.

582
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:35,198
Gosh, he never listens to me.

583
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:39,497
You're not even giving me a cup of coffee?

00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:14,702
- How are you? - I'm totally fine.

588
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:17,768
Gosh, I can't wait to get out of here.

589
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:19,612
It sounds like you're back to your old self.

590
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:22,842
How come you sound so down?

591
00:35:22,842 --> 00:35:24,107
Just hang up.

592
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:31,317
Gosh, I wish it'd rain.

593
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:33,417
Why is the weather so nice?

Professor Yu.

595
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:39,802
Hey.

596
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:41,897
The dashcam footage wasn't fabricated.

597
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:43,667
And the hours aren't fabricated as well.

598
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,167
- Are you sure? - Yes.

599
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:51,868
- Okay. - Professor Yu.

600
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,977
Let me come along.

601
00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:56,983
To where?

602
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:58,578
Aren't you going to the fishing place?

603
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:02,178

604
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:05,087
- We need to check the scene too. - What about the roll call?

605
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:07,288
- I can go alone. - No.

607
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:13,797

609

It's him. Professor Kwon.

He comes 2 to 3 times a week.

616
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:52,302
Why is he so obsessed with fishing?

617
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:54,067
That's not why he comes.

618
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:56,512
People who come here often have problems of their own...

619
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:59,937
because they're distressed about the money they lost.

620
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:02,837
Professor Kwon gives them legal advice.

621
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:06,348
Is that working?

622
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:08,848
Of course it is.

626
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:30,567
We've confirmed Professor Kwon's alibi.

627
00:37:32,472 --> 00:37:35,242
The time Chul Jin hung up the phone...

628
00:37:35,242 --> 00:37:37,377
was 9:14pm.

629
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:43,018
Sir, is there a sidewalk...

630
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:45,687
that leads to this fishing place?

631
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:51,388
It's exactly 1,300m away from here to the scene.

632
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,233
If you can get there within eight minutes,

633
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,198
then Professor Kwon's alibi won't be valid.

634
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:58,968
By the way,

635
00:37:59,273 --> 00:38:01,837
may I ask why you are so desperate...

636
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,538
to find out whether he's the culprit or not?

637
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:07,877
I mean, I don't think it's reasonable to doubt him...

638
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:10,808
just because he was on the same road at the same time that day.

639
00:38:18,393 --> 00:38:20,393
These are the footprints of the culprit...

640
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,817
left at the scene where Chul Jin was attacked.

641
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:23,563
Because it rained that night,

642
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:25,527
we couldn't preserve them as evidence.

643
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:28,702
But I could presume his size. It was 285mm.

644
00:38:28,702 --> 00:38:30,067
His feet are quite big.

645
00:38:31,472 --> 00:38:34,098
Then could Professor Kwon's size...

646
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:07,297
That's right. His shoe size was 285mm.

647
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,538
Do you need any more reasonable doubts?

648
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:16,607
Let's go.

649
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:19,753
He didn't even follow the procedure.

650
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:22,047
How could he take a student with him?

651
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:24,988
You're right.

652
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:30,658
It looks like Professor Yu likes to put us in a pickle.

653
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:33,627
Gosh, Professor Seo!

654
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,227
Gosh, you scared me.

655
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:40,297
Let's see.

656
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:43,813
Where could a professor and a student have gone...

657
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,437
so late at night?

658
00:39:47,742 --> 00:39:51,078
I think it's somewhat romantic.

659
00:40:18,242 --> 00:40:19,437
How long did we take?

660
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:21,413
Eight minutes and five seconds.

661
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:24,908
You see? If we walked a little faster, it'd have worked.

662
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:27,123
Yes, I was right.

663
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:30,091
It's highly likely that he got himself caught...

664
00:40:30,092 --> 00:40:32,551
on the surveillance camera and walked to the scene.

665
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:36,187
That sly punk. I'm going to get him no matter what.

666
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:38,928
Professor Yu.

667
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,833
If it's proven that the suspect couldn't have reached the scene...

668
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:43,932
within the given time,

669
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:45,727
then he will be cleared of a charge...

670
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,868
because his alibi could be interpreted differently, right?

671
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:49,797
That's true,

672
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:53,067
but in this case, he lied about his alibi.

673
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:57,578
What is it?

674
00:40:58,152 --> 00:41:00,523
- The rain. - What?

675
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:02,477
You said it rained on the day of the incident.

676
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:07,357
That day, it says there was 15mm of rain per hour.

677
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:11,288
The stone bridge we came across sinks when it rains here.

678
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:21,802
Even if he made it out of the bridge,

679
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:24,638
he wouldn't have gotten here within eight minutes.

680
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:29,512
You taught us that we need to exclude the suspect...

681
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:31,413
from the list of suspects if his alibi is valid...

682
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:33,777
so that we can specify another suspect.

683
00:41:35,052 --> 00:41:36,317
Gosh.

684
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:38,718
So...

685
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:41,417
Professor Kwon...

686
00:41:41,923 --> 00:41:43,957
should be excluded from the list of suspects.

687
00:41:45,193 --> 00:41:46,558
My gosh.

688
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:51,698
I'm rather glad though.

689
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:55,067
I'm glad that a professor from our school isn't a suspect.

690
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:19,869
Do you think I'm pathetic?

691
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,975
Because I missed the things...

692
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:24,909
that you caught when you're my student?

693
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:26,710
Not at all.

694
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:29,079
I didn't realize before,

695
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:31,279
but it's really difficult...

696
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,320
to chase someone...

697
00:42:34,894 --> 00:42:36,619
and to catch someone.

698
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:39,119
My emotions get in the way of my reasoning.

699
00:42:39,294 --> 00:42:41,889
So how could a professor be better at that than a student?

700
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:46,630
Then what do you think is important?

701
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:49,070
You know.

702
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:51,540
People matter the most.

703
00:43:03,785 --> 00:43:05,650
I don't even know how investigations work,

704
00:43:05,854 --> 00:43:07,549
so I'm sorry for mentioning...

705
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,659
rules and the law.

706
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:15,489
You can keep doing that.

707
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:16,960
Sorry?

708
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:20,570
When I do whatever I want for my investigation,

709
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:23,429
you should put a stop to that.

710
00:43:25,025 --> 00:43:26,724
I can't always be right.

711
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:29,625
I am wrong sometimes, and I also make mistakes.

712
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,890
Just like you said, I'm a human too.

713
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:37,200
That's why every cop needs a partner...

714
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:41,069
and why 2 are better than 1.

715
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:50,154
Anyway, about today...

716
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:54,080
You just got lucky,

717
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:58,149
so don't get all arrogant. Behave yourself, okay?

718
00:43:58,755 --> 00:43:59,919
Yes, sir.

719
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:03,534
So we can put Professor Kwon in the clear now, right?

720
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:05,859
In the clear, my foot.

721
00:44:06,264 --> 00:44:08,600
Now, there's just less chance of him being the culprit.

722
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:11,169
- Professor. - Which is why...

723
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:14,439
we should go and ask him directly.

724
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:16,669
If he really isn't the culprit,

725
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,209
we will apologize to him properly.

726
00:44:23,145 --> 00:44:24,779
Hey, this reminds me...

727
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:29,319
I need you to look into this now.

728
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:32,649
It's Chul Jin's call log.

729
00:44:33,395 --> 00:44:34,620
(Call Log)

730
00:44:34,724 --> 00:44:38,529
I shall tell you more when I'm back from the restroom.

731
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:44,404
My gosh!

732
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:46,499
Professor Yu seems quite drunk.

733
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:49,675
Oh, no! My goodness.

734
00:44:49,675 --> 00:44:50,770
Let me see.

735
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,243
- My goodness! - Gosh.

736
00:44:53,244 --> 00:44:54,439
Give it back.

737
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:58,779
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

738
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,950
Right, I'm sure it wasn't intentional.

739
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,720
Don't tell me...

740
00:45:09,764 --> 00:45:11,660
you did that on purpose. Did you?

741
00:45:12,795 --> 00:45:14,959
No, they just slipped out of my hands.

742
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:17,770
I guess it's an important document. Gosh, I'm really sorry.

743
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:20,005
Right, let's try using a hairdryer.

744
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:22,540
I'll go get it quickly. Give me a second.

745
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:26,740
Goodness. We can just print another copy!

(Korean National Police University)

747
00:45:43,895 --> 00:45:46,764
Then the student council will manage the attendees...

748
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:48,634
of the admission info session.

749
00:45:48,634 --> 00:45:49,799
Sure.

750
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:55,069
Right, the Chungram Sports Festival is around the corner.

751
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:56,640
Yes.

752
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:00,410
I heard the team that wins will be granted special leave.

753
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:02,779
Really? That is awesome.

754
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,609
With that said, Kang Hee...

755
00:46:06,284 --> 00:46:09,180
If you're okay with it, on your first day off...

756
00:46:09,255 --> 00:46:10,520
Kang Hee.

757
00:46:11,425 --> 00:46:12,689
I'm sorry I'm late.

758
00:46:12,824 --> 00:46:15,060
The books were due today, so I had to stop by the library.

759
00:46:15,395 --> 00:46:18,129
Why did you run when you knew you'd be late anyway?

760
00:46:18,364 --> 00:46:20,359
- Have some water. - Thanks.

761
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:30,740
Thanks, I went through it.

762
00:46:32,215 --> 00:46:34,010
Let me ask you one last question.

763
00:46:34,284 --> 00:46:37,879
Are you sure you only went to the fishery that night?

764
00:46:38,014 --> 00:46:39,810
Were you really there the whole time?

765
00:46:42,324 --> 00:46:43,355
Look, Professor Yu.

766
00:46:43,355 --> 00:46:47,120
I'm doing this to confirm that I can stop suspecting you,

767
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:49,160
so please answer my question.

768
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:52,959
I was there the whole time.

769
00:46:53,904 --> 00:46:55,060
Are we good now?

770
00:46:55,965 --> 00:46:59,704
Then did you see anyone on the road...

771
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:00,839
I did.

772
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:04,339
On my way to the fishery,

773
00:47:04,775 --> 00:47:07,379
I saw someone throwing up on the side of the road.

774
00:47:12,184 --> 00:47:14,220
He wobbled a bit. I guess he was drunk.

775
00:47:14,654 --> 00:47:16,324
Why didn't you tell me sooner...

776
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:19,649
Right, shouldn't you have asked about that first?

777
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,520
Before you tried to break into my car?

778
00:47:26,965 --> 00:47:29,605
A junior colleague of mine got attacked...

779
00:47:29,605 --> 00:47:31,399
by an unidentified man near the school.

780
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:35,100
I thought anyone here could be a suspect,

781
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:37,770
so I made the mistake of suspecting you.

782
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:42,879
I apologize for my rudeness. I admit that it was out of line.

783
00:47:43,384 --> 00:47:46,410
This will not happen again.

784
00:47:51,425 --> 00:47:52,720
That's all?

(Korean National Police University Judo Club)

786
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:04,770
I accept your apology,

787
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:06,799
but it won't really cut it.

788
00:48:07,574 --> 00:48:09,904
Let's have a match and let it all go.

789
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:11,974
Sure, I'm totally fine with that.

790
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:14,479
But your legs are awfully weak.

791
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:17,450
Are you going to fight with your mouth?

792
00:48:18,384 --> 00:48:20,680
- Let's begin. - The first one to get a point wins.

793
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:22,585
Ready, start!

794
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:23,950
- Come on! - Bring it on!

795
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:36,499
- My nails... - What happened?

796
00:48:36,904 --> 00:48:38,069
Are you okay?

797
00:48:51,154 --> 00:48:53,109
Gosh, let go.

798
00:48:54,855 --> 00:48:56,850
Hey! Darn it!

799
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:01,859
- He's really cute. - Goodness gracious.

800
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:04,990
- Hey, move your feet. - Okay.

801
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:07,200
Are you done cleaning?

802
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:10,129
We're almost done!

803
00:49:10,165 --> 00:49:13,569
I heard some students sneak out after the evening roll call.

804
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,700
You know you'll get 30 penalty points for that, right?

805
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:20,910
If you get caught sneaking into the girls' dorm,

806
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:23,415
you'll be severely reprimanded...

regardless of what your reason may be,

808
00:49:24,954 --> 00:49:26,249
so you'd better keep that in mind.

809

It's nice to meet you all.

818
00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:13,594
You do need good grades to get into...

819
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,065
the Korean National Police University,

820
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:16,864
but a strong sense of duty is equally important.

821
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:18,600
The police emblem you see here...

822
00:50:18,675 --> 00:50:21,404
shows a sea eagle soaring with the rose of Sharon.

823
00:50:21,404 --> 00:50:23,744
Only then can you become a police officer.

824
00:50:23,744 --> 00:50:25,415
I suggest you all give it a shot.

825
00:50:25,415 --> 00:50:28,979

Here comes the food!

832
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:10,819
Here.

00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:15,220
Thank you.

- Attention! - Okay.

838

Professor Kwon wants to say something.

Everyone in the student council, the judo club, and the PR club.

840
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:28,669
You all did a great job today.

841
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:32,510
By the way, where's the professor in charge of the PR club?

842
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:34,580
Oh, there he is!

843
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:43,279
No, I don't want to.

844
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,925
Why did you step out when we were deciding...

845
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:48,520
who'd be in charge of each club?

846
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:52,629
I trust that you'll do your best to promote our school.

- Bunny! - It's you!

- Busted! - I saw it too!

854
00:52:06,675 --> 00:52:09,514
- Park Min Kyu and Kang Sun Ho lost! - You lost!

855
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:11,384

- What's wrong? - I have to use the restroom.

861
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:25,760
Clearly, the student council can't beat the judo club.

862
00:52:26,764 --> 00:52:30,704
Exactly. Even the professor in charge is...

863
00:52:30,704 --> 00:52:32,634
Sober up, will you?

864
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:34,045
Let's not forget that we're professors.

865
00:52:34,045 --> 00:52:35,704
- Here. - What are you doing? Drink up.

866
00:52:35,704 --> 00:52:37,910
- Thank you. - Wait! I'll come to your rescue.

867
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,270
- What? - She'll drink that for him?

868
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:41,680
- What is going on? - My goodness.

869
00:52:42,614 --> 00:52:43,939
She saved me.

870
00:52:44,184 --> 00:52:45,850
Hey, try to sober up.

871
00:52:48,384 --> 00:52:50,450
Tell me your wish

872
00:52:50,824 --> 00:52:53,419
I drank that for you, so I get to tell you my wish.

873
00:52:53,425 --> 00:52:55,724
Yes, go ahead. I'll grant your wish, whatever it may be.

874
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:58,790
Then have a judo match with me every night.

875
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:03,200
- My gosh! - Every night?

876
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:06,129
You little...

877
00:53:10,445 --> 00:53:12,244
Why do you keep stepping on my shoe?

878
00:53:12,244 --> 00:53:13,470
My foot hurts.

879
00:53:13,744 --> 00:53:14,910
Follow me.

880
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:21,779
What is wrong with you?

881
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,395
Can you sober up or not?

882
00:53:24,395 --> 00:53:28,319
Gosh, I'm sorry. Your foot... I hurt your foot.

883
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:30,260
I'm so dizzy.

884
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,229
Hey. You only had three glasses.

885
00:53:33,264 --> 00:53:34,835
Will you pull yourself together?

886
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:37,470
I'm so sorry!

887
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:42,770
Oh, my. Kang Sun Ho!

888
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:48,479
How old are you?

889
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:51,680
I was born in 1980.

890
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:54,779
- Why are you asking that? - I'm the same age as you!

891
00:53:54,855 --> 00:53:56,755
What? All three of us are the same age.

892
00:53:56,755 --> 00:53:58,189
Let's be friends.

893
00:53:58,454 --> 00:54:01,165
- Hyuk Phil. - I already have many friends.

894
00:54:01,165 --> 00:54:04,689
Then why don't just the two of us become friends?

895
00:54:05,434 --> 00:54:06,965
This is an official event.

896
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:08,629
Why don't we wrap this up and go home?

897
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:12,605
My gosh, have this before you go. It's on the house.

898
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:14,204
It's a stir-fried gizzard!

899
00:54:14,204 --> 00:54:16,899
You're so kind, Professor Go.

900
00:54:17,574 --> 00:54:18,709
Professor?

901
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,275
You were a professor?

902
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:22,715
I taught the kids...

903
00:54:22,715 --> 00:54:26,085
how to use their knives in real-life situations.

904
00:54:26,085 --> 00:54:29,520
That's when they started to call me Professor Go.

905
00:54:29,954 --> 00:54:31,454
"In real-life situations"?

906
00:54:31,454 --> 00:54:34,959
Oh, I was convicted twice.

907
00:54:35,795 --> 00:54:38,990
Don't worry. I haven't caused any trouble for ten years.

908
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:40,295
I'm running a pub near the Police University...

909
00:54:40,295 --> 00:54:42,700
so that I can lead a good life.

910
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:49,799
My gosh, you're so funny.

911
00:54:51,275 --> 00:54:54,744
Is there another pub near here...

912
00:54:54,744 --> 00:54:56,184
other than this place?

913
00:54:56,184 --> 00:54:58,410
There are some.

914
00:54:58,454 --> 00:55:00,680
But Professor Go's pub is the best one.

915
00:55:01,324 --> 00:55:03,520
It's like a hideout for people of our school.

916
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:07,255
Sir, do you remember the guy whom I came with...

917
00:55:07,255 --> 00:55:10,295
who has a big build and a deep voice?

918
00:55:10,295 --> 00:55:12,965
He'd go, "Hey, Dong Man."

919
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:15,399
You know that detective, right?

920
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:16,904
Of course I do.

921
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:19,600
You're talking about that detective with broad shoulders, right?

922
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:23,069
Did he drink here last Tuesday?

923
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:25,939
Last Tuesday?

924
00:55:26,645 --> 00:55:27,910
Did he?

925
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,654
Gosh, I can't even remember what happened yesterday.

926
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:34,085
Of course.

927
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:36,779
That's only natural. I can't even remember what happened yesterday.

928
00:55:37,324 --> 00:55:39,654
By the way, do you have surveillance cameras?

929
00:55:39,654 --> 00:55:41,419
You must have one since it's a pub.

930
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:48,033
- Kang Hee, it's so cold. - Be quiet.

931
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:50,335
- Why isn't he picking up? - It's so cold.

932
00:55:50,335 --> 00:55:52,100
- Just hold still. - It's so cold.

933
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:55,270
He's so heavy. What do I do?

934
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:58,145
(Kang Hee)

935
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:01,214
Hey, do you think it's really okay to ignore her call?

936
00:56:01,215 --> 00:56:02,310
You punk!

937
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:06,255
If you're a loyal friend, you shouldn't pick up.

938
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:08,419
I know this best.

939
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:10,120
Wait, what time is it now?

940
00:56:10,855 --> 00:56:13,020
- It's 1am. - What?

941
00:56:13,324 --> 00:56:14,824
If they get caught outside...

942
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:15,895
They'll get disciplinary action!

943
00:56:15,895 --> 00:56:17,160
- No! - Oh, gosh!

944
00:56:17,735 --> 00:56:20,264
- Goodness. - I can't walk.

945
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:22,235
- Hey. - Gosh, this is crazy.

946
00:56:22,235 --> 00:56:23,934
Hey, get up.

947
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:25,999
(Korean National Police University)

948
00:56:27,574 --> 00:56:30,044
Hey, you need to walk quietly.

949
00:56:30,045 --> 00:56:32,310
If we get caught, they'll give us a severe punishment.

950
00:56:33,315 --> 00:56:34,910
I got this.

951
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:38,549
Oh, here it is.

952
00:56:44,994 --> 00:56:47,390
- Darn it. - Gosh.

953
00:56:51,195 --> 00:56:53,189
Got you, you rats.

954
00:56:54,735 --> 00:56:55,999
Oh, gosh.

955
00:57:20,255 --> 00:57:23,490
These rats. They're having fun, aren't they?

956
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:34,270
Oh, gosh.

957
00:57:40,114 --> 00:57:41,310
Wait a minute.

958
00:57:41,985 --> 00:57:45,609
This will get you in serious trouble. Do you hear me?

959
00:57:46,485 --> 00:57:48,720
- What was that? - This is fun.

960
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,220
I got you, you rats.

961
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:57,565
Where are they?

962
00:57:57,565 --> 00:57:59,859
I'm going to remove all these stairs.

963
00:58:08,974 --> 00:58:10,600
Gosh, Kang Hee.

964
00:58:10,974 --> 00:58:12,169
Be quiet.

965
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:15,310
This is driving me crazy.

966
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:17,640
Let me see.

967
00:58:26,654 --> 00:58:28,459
(Storage)

968
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:34,799
The codes of behavior within the residence hall.

969
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:36,605
Article One.

970
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:38,204
Students cannot enter the residence hall...

971
00:58:38,204 --> 00:58:40,669
of the opposite sex for private reasons.

972
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:42,474
Article Two.

973
00:58:42,474 --> 00:58:45,014
Students must have a healthy relationship,

974
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:48,645
and they cannot go beyond moral limits.

975
00:58:48,645 --> 00:58:50,684
I can't breathe!

976
00:58:50,684 --> 00:58:52,209
Please keep quiet.

977
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:54,284
Article Three.

978
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:57,425
If a student here makes physical contact...

979
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:58,895
to show a sexual appeal...

980
00:58:58,895 --> 00:59:02,195
and does something to disgrace Korean National Police University,

981
00:59:02,195 --> 00:59:07,689
they will be expelled instantly.

982
00:59:08,005 --> 00:59:09,100
Expelled?

983
00:59:10,304 --> 00:59:11,605
I can't be expelled.

984
00:59:11,605 --> 00:59:13,735
Come on, Kang Hee.

985
00:59:13,735 --> 00:59:14,875
Will you be quiet?

986
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:18,040
Oh Kang Hee!

987
00:59:18,045 --> 00:59:21,485
Oh Kang Hee!

988
00:59:21,485 --> 00:59:23,384
Oh Kang Hee!

989
00:59:23,384 --> 00:59:25,614
- They will be expelled instantly. - Oh Kang Hee!

990
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:27,514
- They will be expelled instantly. - Oh...

991
00:59:27,514 --> 00:59:29,485
- They will be expelled instantly. - Oh...

992
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:31,290
You will be expelled!

993
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:36,859
Oh Kang Hee, you'll be expelled!

994
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,770
(We'd like to thank Hwang Seung Un for her special appearance.)

995
01:00:57,204 --> 01:00:59,945
(Police University)

996
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:02,715
Since it's her mother's trial, Kang Hee must want to go.

997
01:01:02,715 --> 01:01:03,784
If we win at Chungram Sports Festival,

998
01:01:03,784 --> 01:01:04,815
we'll get special leave, right?

999
01:01:04,815 --> 01:01:07,415
Who on earth are you?

1000
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:08,485
I'll do anything to help you.

1001
01:01:08,485 --> 01:01:10,454
But why don't we participate in Chungram Sports Festival first?

1002
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:11,695
What did you do to Kang Hee?

1003
01:01:11,695 --> 01:01:13,755
What else can happen between a man and a woman in a storage room?

1004
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:15,295
What are you imagining?

1005
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:17,835
- You crazy punk. - I should take responsibility.

1006
01:01:17,835 --> 01:01:20,235
I'm going to win this to give my special leave to Kang Hee.

1007
01:01:20,235 --> 01:01:22,665
If he's the culprit, he will show up...

1008
01:01:22,665 --> 01:01:24,505
on the day of Chungram Sports Festival.

1009
01:01:24,505 --> 01:01:26,799
I got you, punk!
