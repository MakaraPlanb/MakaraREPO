(My One and Only Supervisor)

6
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:46,485
- What? - You rude punk.

7
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,525
Hey, do you want to have pork belly since it's raining?

8
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,900
- Supervisor? - What is it?

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,065
Why do you sound so down? What is it?

10
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,934
You will never give up, will you?

11
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,309
Give up what? What are you talking about?

12
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,975
You'll never give up on going after those jerks, will you?

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,044
Gosh, don't you know me?

14
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,190
Where are you?

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,785
Did you drink? Do you want me to pick you up?

16
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:20,725
The jerks running the illegal site you're after...

17
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,564
They are the Police University's...

18
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:35,434
Hey, Chul Jin.

19
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,805
Chul Jin. Park Chul Jin!

20
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,174
Chul Jin!

(Emergency Center)

22
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,264
Chul Jin.

23
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,225
Chul Jin!

24
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,338
Mr. Park. Mr. Park Chul Jin!

25
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,064
- Call Anesthesiology. - Yes, sir!

26
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,750
My gut feeling tells me that this case is dangerous.

27
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,005
That day,

28
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,975
you told me that you'd always be right behind me.

29
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:18,315
It still hurts on rainy days.

30
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,850
And I still turn around in panic mode,

31
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,584
thinking someone might attack me from behind. So please...

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,255
don't leave me alone.

33
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,259
I can't seem to stop the bleeding.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,494
We'll move him now.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,364
Chul Jin. Hey...

36
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,935
My gosh.

37
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,918
(Operating Center)

38
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,815
You were the last one he spoke to on the phone.

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,954
Is there anything you heard?

40
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,885
Hey, tell me.

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,894
The illegal gambling site.

42
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,665
Those darn jerks.

43
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,734
I'll catch them.

44
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,939
I will catch them no matter what.

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Hey, calm down.

46
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,605
Because of those scumbags, Eun Ju died,

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,079
and even Chul Jin is hurt now. So how can I calm down?

48
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,544
How?

49
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,885
I must catch those jerks.

50
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,855
I'll catch them...

51
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,625
and make them pay for this!

52
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,695
Hey, Dong Man!

53
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,494
(I must...)

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,334
(I must protect everyone.)

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,750
(I believe that you'll do well.)

56
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,044
He's not here.

57
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,584
Why don't we meet up?

58
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,855
Yes. Will do.

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,744

61
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,124
Professor Yu.

00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,754
Kang Sun Ho.

63
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,294
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:19,265
You said you'll do anything for me...

65
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,634
if I help you out, right?

66
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,405
Help me.

67
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,434
- Pardon? - Help me...

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,275
so that I can catch those jerks.

69
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,645
- What are you talking... - With your hacking skills,

70
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,874
we can catch those jerks.

71
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,145
Yoon.

72
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,484
"Yoon"?

73
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,254
- Are you... - That's right.

74
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,254
I'm...

75
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,965
Bird.

76
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,194
What?

77
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,075
Wait, hold on.

78
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,634
You said you were in college.

79
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,449
A computer science major.

80
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,349
That's because hackers run away...

81
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,145
the moment I tell them I'm a cop.

82
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,044
At first,

83
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:17,585
I signed on to the Black Net to get some information.

84
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,659
But I met you, and we ended up chatting...

85
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,529
So you deceived me for a year?

86
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,630
Hey, I didn't deceive you.

87
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,329
I just couldn't find the right time to tell you.

88
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,535
When did you find out that I was Yoon?

89
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,539
That day at the police station? Or here?

90
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,570
You don't have to believe me if you don't want to,

91
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,579
but I only found out recently.

92
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,544
And when I found out, I was as surprised as you are now.

93
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,875
So I was going to pretend I didn't know it was you.

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,784
I was going to, but...

95
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,454
Chul Jin got hurt.

96
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,660
I think it's the jerks...

97
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,985
of the illegal gambling site that you hacked.

98
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,030
If you could help me out by hacking them,

99
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,530
I think I'll be able to get them.

100
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,725
Is that why...

101
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,599
you let me get admitted to this school?

102
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,735
You punk!

103
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:12,944
If I help you,

104
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,815
does that make hacking legal?

105
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,349
The first time is hard. It's easy the next time around.

106
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,884
And by the third time, you won't even feel guilty.

107
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,084
That's what you said to me.

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,859
That's why I promised you that I will never...

109
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:27,889
break any rules.

110
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,225
I made that promise to you.

111
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,995
I'll pretend you didn't ask me that tonight.

112
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,175
(Chungram Lounge)

113
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,315
One.

114
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,815
Two.

115
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,344
One.

116
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,784
Two.

117
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,855
Hey, if you're not going to have that yogurt drink,

118
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,694
I can help get rid of it.

119
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,034
But then again, he should take some probiotics too.

120
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:11,805
Of course.

121
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,505
Probiotics are essential.

122
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,774
I'll get going first.

123
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,214
Our sweet friend...

124
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,644
looks edgy today.

125
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,584
You know how Professor Kwon...

126
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,784
put Sun Ho to shame in his class.

127
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,959
He didn't get any sleep last night...

128
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,355
and rummaged through books all night.

129
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:48,835
I feel lousy.

130
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,304
That's what your face says.

131
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,585
Honestly speaking, Professor Kwon was too harsh yesterday.

132
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,514
Who can answer him properly if he corners them?

133
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,625
I bet most of them would've gone speechless just like you did.

134
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,924
So don't be discouraged.

135
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,764
Thanks.

136
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:17,634
But I've actually never given it a thought.

137
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,304
What it means to become an officer and to protect the citizens.

138
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,375
What my stance is.

139
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,674
Then you can find your answer starting now.

140
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,985
We just got into this school. We just started this journey.

141
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,144
You're right.

142
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,054
We just started.

143
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,184
By the way,

144
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,495
about that thing you told me on the last day of the training...

145
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,825
I actually came to this school because of you.

146
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,835
It's you.

147
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,005
Sorry?

148
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,134
Which one?

149
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,475
Attention.

150
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,390
Professor Yu had an urgent matter to take care of,

151
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,384
so today's class is canceled.

152
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,219
Mr. Hyun over here...

153
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,490
will give you detailed information...

154
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,400
on the curriculum and the material you'll need for the semester.

155
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,424
We'll announce the date for the make-up class once it's decided.

156
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,934
We won't answer any questions.

157
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,664
How could he cancel his first class?

158
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,010
It must've been an urgent matter.

159
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,709
He notified us through a phone call.

160
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,644
He said he'll submit the report and the syllabus later.

161
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,075
Is he not feeling well?

162
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,085
He must teach his class even if he's not feeling well.

163
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,585
His students come to his class even when they're sick.

164
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,355
It looks like he doesn't qualify as a professor.

165
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,424
Why don't we start our meeting?

166
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,339
It's a cerebral hemorrhage.

167
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,335
His surgery went well,

168
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,975
but we'll have to wait and see whether he will wake up or not.

169
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,575
He will wake up eventually, right?

170
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,644
We can't guarantee it for now.

171
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,585
Hey, Dong Man. You haven't eaten, right?

172
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,198
Let me return to the force.

173
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,564
You punk, it's already over.

174
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,235
The paperwork has been processed already.

175
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,735
- Captain. - What is it?

176
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,605
Do you trust me?

177
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,880
Why are you asking me that? You're scaring me.

178
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,705
I trust you, Captain.

179
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,314
What are you trying to say?

180
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,750
I think Chul Jin found...

181
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,419
a lead to the gang running the illegal gambling site.

182
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,585
What?

183
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,255
So? Go on.

184
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,164
I think I should return to the force and investigate it myself.

185
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,434
I think Chul Jin found conclusive evidence.

186
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,205
How? What did he do?

187
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,335
I think it has something to do...

188
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,005
with the Police University.

189
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,449

190
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:17,445
I think they're at our university!

191
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,554
Was it you who hurt his head, not Chul Jin?

192
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,990
Come on, Captain.

193
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,230
If you talk nonsense with a serious face on,

194
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,855
it can be quite convincing. Thanks for teaching me that!

195
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,799
I'm serious! Chul Jin told me that over the phone.

196
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,740
Gosh, you pathetic punk.

197
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,495

200
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,679
You're insane.

202
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,445
Gosh.

203
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,219
I'm telling you the truth!

204
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,289
Chul Jin said it!

205
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,845
- Don't follow me! - Chul Jin said it!

206
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,414
- Go away. - My goodness.

This one.

214
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,674
It's also known as SIRC.

215
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,110
Others think SIRC doesn't have many activities...

216
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,020
because a public administration professor is leading it,

217
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,020
but if you think about it, it's the only club...

218

You can see me if you join the judo club.

228
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,514
Right.

367
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:35,635
How can you say that, Jun Wook?

368
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:36,771
Hey.

369
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:52,081
Oh, my goodness.

370
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:54,450
Kang Hee must have heard everything.

371
00:23:54,696 --> 00:23:56,420
My gosh.

372
00:23:58,525 --> 00:23:59,831
No way.

373
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:03,835
Just for this week. This is an emergency.

374
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,001
What about the report and make-up plan from last week?

375
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:07,900
Did you bring it, Professor Yu?

376
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:10,971
Guidance Director?

377
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:14,471
I'll come back later.

378
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:15,815
As for the report,

379
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:18,680
I'll submit them together at once.

380
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:20,051
Professor Yu.

381
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:23,321
Are you canceling your class again?

382
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:25,555
Well, I got an urgent matter.

383
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:28,251
What's more urgent for a professor than teaching his students?

384
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:34,660
Gosh, I have nothing to say and all,

385
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,360
but I really have an urgent matter.

386
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,900
Then just leave.

387
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:42,170
You seem to lack ethics as a professor.

388
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:44,271
Don't disgrace other professors.

389
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,610
Just submit your resignation and leave.

390
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:50,640
I get what you mean.

391
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,950
But who are you to tell me...

392
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:55,386
to submit a resignation or not?

393
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:56,726
This is my last piece of advice...

394
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:59,321
to a loser like you in a polite manner.

395
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:01,920
Leave without causing any trouble.

396
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:06,360
Did you just talk down to me?

397
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:09,700
What are you doing in front of all the students, professors?

398
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:20,841
- Here, have some. - Thank you.

399
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:27,180
I thought you've made up your mind, Professor Yu.

400
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:31,081
The school and students...

401
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:34,450
I thought you've got some different plans now.

402
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:39,196
When field officers come to the school,

403
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:42,291
they often have a hard time adjusting.

404
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:45,561
But even so, you can't do this, Professor Yu.

405
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,741
My colleague is injured badly.

406
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:52,741
He's still unconscious.

407
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,686
After this week, I may not even be able to track them down.

408
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:58,110
This week is like the golden hour.

409
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,850
I know that I shouldn't be doing this,

410
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:04,081
but please understand just this once.

411
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:09,721
I get why you have to do this,

412
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:16,200
but it's time you made up your mind.

413
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:21,100
Whether you'll stay a professor or go back to being a detective.

414
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:40,321
Darn it.

415
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,471
Hey, you've been asleep for way too long.

416
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:03,210
Actually, never mind. Just sleep.

417
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:06,416
I'll work round the clock...

418
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,180
and make sure I catch the jerk who did this to you,

419
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:11,251
so just sleep and rest up.

420
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:16,620
To tell you the truth,

421
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:18,860
I was starting to be attached to the school.

422
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:22,860
It's fun to watch those clueless youngsters.

423
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:25,831
"I used to be like that too."

424
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:28,400
It makes me a little emotional at times.

425
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:33,241
But I promised that I'd always protect you.

426
00:27:34,775 --> 00:27:37,041
That's why I'm here again.

427
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,850
What I'm saying is...

428
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:43,721
Don't sleep for too long.

429
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,690
What am I doing now? He's asleep and can't hear me.

430
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:52,620
Gosh.

431
00:27:58,105 --> 00:27:59,535
(Get lost, Oh Kang Hee! Criminal's daughter!)

432
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:01,231
(Drop out!)

433
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,870
This is insane.

434
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:11,041
This crazy little piece of...

435
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:21,991
Who did this?

436
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:25,061
What?

437
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:26,930
Gosh, what was that?

438
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,535
(Get lost, Oh Kang Hee!)

439
00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:37,045
(Criminal's daughter! Drop out!)

440
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:39,140
(Criminal's blood is flowing in you!)

441
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:49,821
Gosh, this still looks so messy.

442
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:08,130
(Bookstore, Convenience Store, Stationery Store)

443
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,041
Hey.

444
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:28,021
Chul Jin got injured a few days ago,

445
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:31,420
so I wasn't in my right mind.

446
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:34,731
I'm the one who needs to catch them.

447
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,061
What I'm trying to say is...

448
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:41,831
Just forget what I said that day.

449
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:43,640
Bye, I'm off.

450
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:53,551
Unbelievable, right?

451
00:29:53,656 --> 00:29:55,886
She always acted like she was better than everyone else.

452
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:57,321
Is she seriously not going to drop out?

453
00:29:58,126 --> 00:29:59,855
She wants to hold out because she has no shame.

454
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:01,251
Like mother, like daughter.

455
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:04,765
If she becomes a cop and her mother gets arrested,

456
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:06,531
will she just let her off?

457
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:08,630
No, I won't.

458
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,831
Even if she's my mom, she needs to pay for what she did.

459
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:16,246
And if you've got things to say to me, say it to my face...

460
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:17,940
instead of doing it behind my back like a bunch of rats.

461
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:19,946
Hey, watch what you say.

462
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:21,741
You're one to talk.

463
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:23,981
Your mom is a gambling addict.

464
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:25,781
No wonder you turned out like this.

465
00:30:26,386 --> 00:30:27,511
Let's go, girls.

466
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:40,630
- Hello. - Hi.

467
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:44,731
(Leadership Room)

468
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:46,301
Oh, Ms. Baek.

469
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:48,501
You need to see this on our website.

470
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:50,741
Why? What is it?

471
00:30:55,176 --> 00:30:57,281
Hey, look. Oh Kang Hee is really something.

472
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:58,811
- What? - What's going on?

473
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:00,551
She must really be out of her mind.

474
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:02,284
- Hey, look. - What?

475
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:03,450
Check this out.

476
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:09,860
Kang Hee must be so upset.

477
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:11,696
What do we do, Sun Ho?

478
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:12,890
What's going on?

479
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:17,231
My daughter tells me she wants to die before me.

480
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,761
You little witch.

481
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:22,335
(Did you know? Oh Kang Hee's mother...)

482
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:23,876
(was convicted four times for illegal gambling.)

483
00:31:23,876 --> 00:31:25,376
(They say children are a reflection of their parents.)

484
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:26,876
(If Oh Kang Hee becomes a police officer,)

485
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,676
(it'll only tarnish the public's trust in the police.)

486
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:30,410
(Did you know? Oh Kang Hee's mother...)

487
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,410
I don't want you in my life!

488
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,650
When was this posted?

489
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,291
Where is Kang Hee?

00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,430
I hope it helps you cool down.

492
00:32:31,545 --> 00:32:34,640
(Get lost! Drop out!)

493
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:02,700
Do I make you uncomfortable?

494
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:05,940
No.

495
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:08,541
Yes.

496
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:10,841
Because of my mistake during the Chungram Training.

497
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:12,086
By doing that,

498
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:14,851
you're robbing me of the opportunity to solve the problem...

499
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:16,920
on my own.

500
00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:22,790
It's not easy to befriend someone who humiliated you in the past.

501
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:27,960
I said that because of my mom.

502
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:32,635
Whenever I had an exam, she somehow got the correct answers...

503
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,170
and made me memorize all of them.

504
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:38,201
She told me to memorize the answers instead of learning to solve them.

505
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:43,310
So later on, I got to a point where I knew the answers right away...

506
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:47,380
without understanding why they were the correct answers.

507
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:54,721
Another family where the mom's the problem.

508
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,451
What?

509
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:04,400
Hey, isn't this our first time...

510
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:06,706
having such a long conversation since becoming roomies?

511
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:11,071
Well, people make friends even during wartime.

512
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:18,080
Oh, they get things done fast.

513
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:20,011
Did you see this?

00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:22,985

518

(Korean National Police University, Oh Kang Hee)

519
00:34:57,425 --> 00:34:58,621
Hey, Kang Sun Ho.

520
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:12,630
By the way, how did you know?

521
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:15,575
Who else would do that, if not you?

522
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:17,945
Why? Do you hate it?

523
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:19,040
A little.

524
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:22,310
It's so childish,

525
00:35:23,385 --> 00:35:24,980
but kind of sweet at the same time.

526
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:32,150
Oh, have you thought about Professor Kwon Hyuk Pil's question?

527
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,851
Do you know your answer?

528
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:35,491
Not yet.

529
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,531
During the class that day,

530
00:35:40,735 --> 00:35:43,805
you said that we should protect everyone when we can...

531
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:45,701
since we're police officers.

532
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:48,730
I felt a little guilty when I heard that.

533
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:52,701
When I was a junior in high school,

534
00:35:56,885 --> 00:35:58,741
my mom's trial was held.

535
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:03,380
The prosecutor asked me to stand in court as a witness.

536
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:05,951
So I testified...

537
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:08,790
that it was my mom who did all that.

538
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:13,491
The people she was involved in the crime with...

539
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:16,290
hired lawyers.

540
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:20,071
But my mom was poor,

541
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,230
so I was afraid she was going to take all the blame.

542
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:27,110
That's why I testified.

543
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:28,940
I told the judge that they were all in it together.

544
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:32,440
That my mom was involved in it too.

545
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:37,781
I only said that to protect my mom,

546
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:42,091
but I think I only protected my mom,

547
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:44,821
not others.

548
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:53,206
Hey. Please do this for us.

549
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:55,801
A guy like me will never be able to make that kind of money.

550
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:57,305
But you can.

551
00:36:57,305 --> 00:36:59,201
Please forgive them just this once.

552
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,770
I plead you, Detectives.

553
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:03,141
Help me.

554
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:06,210
Chul Jin got injured a few days ago,

555
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:09,380
so I wasn't in my right mind.

556
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:14,790
That must have been...

557
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:17,960
the best option you had back then.

558
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:20,690
And I don't think...

559
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:24,130
that's wrong.

560
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,911
Let's go. We need to get ready for the evening-roll-call.

561
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:45,621
Why don't you go ahead first? I need to stop by somewhere.

562
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:47,150
Where?

563
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:52,721
Yes.

564
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:57,661
It'll take me about ten minutes, so please wait for me.

(Kim Dong Woon, South Chungcheong 90J 1398)

567
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:09,945
All right.

568
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:11,816
(Professor's Office)

569
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:13,385
Professor Yu, I have something to...

570
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:14,951
Later.

571
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:25,020
What are you doing?

572
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:27,365
I need to ask you now, not later.

573
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:29,535
Get out! Get off now!

574
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,201
I said, I have something to ask you!

575
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:34,071
Darn it. I'm not responsible for this.

576
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:36,971
Professor Yu.

577
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:41,710
I heard you met all the truck drivers within a week.

578
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:42,911
Yes.

579
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,215
This is where they park their trucks,

580
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:51,250
so you must've met a lot of them.

581
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:54,051
I can't believe you actually met all of them.

582
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:55,391
Here you go.

583
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:56,765
Thank you.

584
00:38:56,765 --> 00:38:59,290
I'll check as soon as I can and return it to you.

585
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:01,296
It rained a lot that night,

586
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:03,460
so I'm not sure what got caught on my dashcam.

587
00:39:04,405 --> 00:39:07,701
Goodness. The road there isn't paved,

588
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:10,246
so it was all muddy.

589
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:13,170
When it rains, the truck gets messy.

590
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:26,321
What are you doing?

591
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:37,101
It's 8:57pm, 14 seconds.

592
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:50,380
It's 8:57pm, 34 seconds.

593
00:39:50,715 --> 00:39:52,681
It's a gray sedan.

594
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:55,750
What's the number? Four seven...

595
00:39:56,956 --> 00:39:58,256
What's the last one?

596
00:39:58,256 --> 00:40:00,951
Isn't that 41?

597
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,121
What?

598
00:40:07,996 --> 00:40:09,135
Hey, it's me.

599
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:12,135
I'll send you a file, so can you analyze the video...

600
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:14,500
and get me the car model and its plate number?

601
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:15,971
Okay.

602
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,071
Where are we going again?

603
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:23,371
Aren't we going back to school?

604
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:32,181
Where did he go?

605
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:36,190
It's almost time for the evening-roll-call.

606
00:40:39,465 --> 00:40:41,060

Don't you know that I'll get a penalty for AWOL?

612
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:57,580
So why did you have to follow me? I'm so busy.

(Provincial Police Agency)

614
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:03,285
Are we going to a police station right now?

615
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:04,451
Yes.

616
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:05,920
Why?

617
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:08,591
I smell something fishy.

618
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,960
I smell something fishy.

619
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,535
If you want to go up, just go. Why are you waiting here?

620
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:24,971
Be quiet.

621
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:28,540
Hey, Detective Lee. You gained some weight.

622
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:31,011
I guess you're only working from the desk.

623
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:33,110
- Gosh. - My goodness.

624
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:35,110
Hey, Detective Kim.

625
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:37,325
I saw that you changed your car.

626
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:39,485
Don't get any bribes.

627
00:41:39,485 --> 00:41:40,726
I'm watching you.

628
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,891
I bought it on a five-year installment plan.

629

630
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,060
I was just kidding. See you.

631
00:41:51,265 --> 00:41:52,531
Hello, sir.

632
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:56,500
Hey, Senior Inspector Yu.

633
00:41:57,476 --> 00:42:01,146
I heard you were going to appoint me somewhere else again.

634
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,411
Thank you.

635
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:07,181
But Captain Choi isn't the type to do that.

636
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:08,781
Right.

637
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:13,520
It's not Captain Choi who asked me.

638
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:15,591
I thought it'd be a waste to let you go.

639
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:18,721
I didn't want a competent officer like you to be stuck at school.

640
00:42:19,595 --> 00:42:21,261
Oh, I see.

641
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:23,235
Anyway, what are you doing here?

642
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:25,635
Oh, my colleague got hurt,

643
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:27,371
so I came to pick up his stuff.

644
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:30,601
Oh, you mean Inspector Park Chul Jin?

645
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:33,641
- Yes. - I see.

646
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:35,440
They got the real culprit.

647
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:39,580
They're investigating him now.

648
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:41,610
They caught him?

649
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:47,126
Oh, right.

650
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:50,860
I mixed it up with the Seongsu-dong theft case.

651
00:42:51,496 --> 00:42:52,591
Oh...

652
00:42:53,465 --> 00:42:56,365
Gosh, how could you mix that up?

653
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,765
I know, right? Good night, then.

654
00:42:58,765 --> 00:43:00,360
- Okay. See you. - Bye.

655
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:05,701
- Hey, let's get going. - Sorry?

656
00:43:10,115 --> 00:43:11,741
Chief Han.

657
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:16,980
What's this about? Why are we here?

658
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:19,181
Didn't you see him earlier?

659
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:22,054
His face when I told him that the real culprit was caught.

660
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:23,695
I can tell who's guilty.

661
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:26,690
They can't hide their feelings in that instant.

662
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:31,701
But I only got circumstantial proof. I have no evidence.

663
00:43:32,106 --> 00:43:34,531
- Gosh. - What are you going to do?

664
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:37,741
Well, we'll have to wait until Chul Jin wakes up.

665
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:39,400
Darn it.

666
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:42,841
What did you want to ask me?

667
00:43:42,945 --> 00:43:46,540
Oh, I'll ask you later.

668
00:43:47,756 --> 00:43:50,750
Is Chul Jin okay though?

669
00:44:00,635 --> 00:44:02,161
I was really desperate when I had to get the money...

670
00:44:02,566 --> 00:44:04,161
for my dad's hospital fees.

671
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:13,641
It looks like Professor Yu is desperate too.

672
00:44:14,746 --> 00:44:16,540
So please wake up soon.

673
00:44:32,825 --> 00:44:33,960
Oh, right.

674
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:36,690
You said you wanted to ask me something.

675
00:44:36,796 --> 00:44:37,931
Are you not going to ask me?

676
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,836
I think I heard my answer.

677
00:44:40,836 --> 00:44:42,000
What?

678
00:44:56,086 --> 00:44:59,281
Why did you help the drunk in the emergency center?

679
00:44:59,526 --> 00:45:00,790
What do you mean?

680
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:03,864
"We need to protect criminals too. They have rights too."

681
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:05,790
Is that what you believe in?

682
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:10,031
Beliefs aren't important. I just follow my instincts.

683
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:12,761
Why make it so complicated and question everything?

684
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:14,675
I don't have such beliefs.

685
00:45:14,675 --> 00:45:17,670
It's simple. Protect them and catch them. Got it?

686
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:20,376
If you want to do that, you'll need to work out.

687
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:23,841
How can a weak man like you protect or catch anyone?

688
00:45:41,828 --> 00:45:42,923
- Go away. - Hey!

689
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:46,662
Guys, do you want to win that girl's heart?

690
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:48,803
- Of course! - Of course!

691
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,903
- Here I go! - Bring it on!

692
00:45:59,378 --> 00:46:00,518
(Leave your judo club application here.)

693
00:46:00,518 --> 00:46:01,982
You have time to take care of your skin?

694
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:03,518
We haven't received a single application!

695
00:46:03,518 --> 00:46:05,113
(New members wanted)

696
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:06,783
Just wait until you get to my age.

697
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:09,383
Sunspots scare me more than getting zero applications.

698
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:12,392
You can't see them now, but they'll become visible later on.

699
00:46:13,598 --> 00:46:15,628
You pulled a bait-and-switch on me when I was a freshman,

700
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:16,923
so I still have to put up with this.

701
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:19,693
What? "Bait-and-switch"? What do you mean?

702
00:46:21,007 --> 00:46:22,938
You said this would be the highlight of my campus life.

703
00:46:22,938 --> 00:46:24,533
Where are the boys?

704
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:26,208
I hate you!

705
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:28,403
What if they decide to get rid of the club?

706
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:30,073
Gosh, this is crazy.

707
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:39,553
We'd like to join the judo club.

708
00:46:42,288 --> 00:46:43,423
Here come the boys.

709
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:49,228
Welcome.

710
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:51,237
I'll teach you the breakfall technique...

711
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:52,467
to see if you're qualified.

712
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:53,932
Wait, there's a test?

713
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:57,232
Here I come!

714
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:05,542
Now that you've joined the judo club...

715
00:47:05,717 --> 00:47:07,547
and will be learning from me,

716
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:10,883
you'll become the toughest cookies in the entire school!

717
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,982
Maybe it'd be easier to just drop dead.

718
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:18,053
Then she's mine.

719
00:47:18,757 --> 00:47:19,852
Professor.

720
00:47:20,398 --> 00:47:22,493
I want to try one more time. Here I come!

721
00:47:26,998 --> 00:47:28,768
- I'm sorry. - He doesn't know it yet,

722
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:30,533
but I joined the PR club too.

723
00:47:30,837 --> 00:47:33,772
- All right! - Eon Ju is a member.

724
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:37,248
I can handle two clubs.

725
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:38,578
No! I will try one more time.

726
00:47:38,578 --> 00:47:40,018
- I won. - I'm okay!

727
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:42,343
Bum Tae can't beat me.

728
00:47:43,518 --> 00:47:44,613

729
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:49,328
- My goodness. - I'm okay.

730
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:50,857
- Oh, right. - It hurts.

731
00:47:50,857 --> 00:47:53,497
- I sent you those photos. - No, I want to try again.

732
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,662
I'm okay!

Everyone would agree.

736
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:03,637
- Right, sure. - That's right.

737
00:48:03,637 --> 00:48:05,078
Can you send me the photos of everyone...

738
00:48:05,078 --> 00:48:07,478
who tagged "Korean National Police University"...

739
00:48:07,478 --> 00:48:08,803
on Monday night?

740
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:11,617
- Okay. - Thanks.

741
00:48:11,618 --> 00:48:12,677
No problem.

(Kim Ba Da, Korean National Police University)

743
00:48:14,118 --> 00:48:16,843
It was posted on Monday at 9:30pm.

744
00:48:17,587 --> 00:48:19,452
And the person who posted it used the Wi-Fi...

745
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:21,223
in the lobby at the dorm.

746
00:48:23,998 --> 00:48:25,093
What?

747
00:48:43,648 --> 00:48:46,013
Hey, did you hear?

748
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:51,188
They caught the person who posted the video...

749
00:48:51,188 --> 00:48:52,412
of Kang Hee's mother.

750
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:53,553
What?

751
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:02,892
So it was you.

752
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:13,473
What a nasty girl you are.

753
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:15,872
Everyone.

754
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:19,213
My daughter tells me she wants to die before me.

755
00:49:24,688 --> 00:49:25,812
Why did you do that?

756
00:49:26,157 --> 00:49:28,153
Darn it.

757
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:31,752
Then I'll go show this to Ms. Baek.

758
00:49:32,998 --> 00:49:35,093
I did it to join the student council.

759
00:49:36,728 --> 00:49:38,432
Darn it.

760
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,267
There are only two seats available on the council.

761
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:44,506
But they look at your grades, so I can only join if she gives up.

762
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:46,208
You did that because of something so petty?

763
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,677
"Petty"? Don't you know that the former council members...

764
00:49:48,677 --> 00:49:50,407
have it easy even after joining the force?

765
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:52,642
If you want to "have it easy" as a police officer,

766
00:49:52,918 --> 00:49:55,582
you should just quit now, you idiot.

767
00:49:56,348 --> 00:49:58,518
You're not going to tell anyone, right?

768
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:01,682
Go to the student council's office and withdraw your application,

769
00:50:02,027 --> 00:50:03,288
- Darn it. - or you'll be...

770
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:05,022
too embarrassed to stay in school.

771
00:50:06,697 --> 00:50:07,792
Hold on.

772
00:50:08,868 --> 00:50:10,593
How did you know it was me?

773
00:50:13,237 --> 00:50:14,502
That look on your face.

774
00:50:15,668 --> 00:50:17,363
I can tell who's guilty.

775
00:50:17,378 --> 00:50:19,732
They can't hide their feelings in that instant.

776
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:32,513
Oh Kang Hee's grades are much better,

777
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:34,628
but with all those talks about her, we shouldn't let her in.

778
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:35,752
Totally.

779
00:50:35,857 --> 00:50:37,823
She'll destroy the council's reputation.

780
00:50:38,027 --> 00:50:41,022
We absolutely cannot accept her. There's no way...

781
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:42,522
Oh, she's here.

782
00:50:43,328 --> 00:50:44,533
I'd like my application back.

783
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:46,067
Okay, here.

784
00:50:46,067 --> 00:50:47,162
Wait.

785
00:50:47,607 --> 00:50:48,702
Why?

786
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:51,073
I've decided to withdraw my application,

787
00:50:51,607 --> 00:50:53,332
so you can't disqualify me...

788
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:55,372
for such unfair, ridiculous reasons.

789
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:57,642
Can I have my application back?

790
00:50:59,277 --> 00:51:00,443

I heard you joined the judo club.

800
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:53,932
Yes, I want to build strength.

801
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,772
Did you get into the student council?

802
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:00,332
No, I applied to join the PR club.

803
00:52:00,737 --> 00:52:02,208
I'm a total newsmaker.

804
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:03,903
Who else would join the PR club if I don't?

805
00:52:05,317 --> 00:52:06,812

806
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:08,243

807

It's Professor Kwon's class.

809
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:22,693
That's it for today's class.

810
00:52:27,237 --> 00:52:28,463
May I...

811
00:52:30,107 --> 00:52:33,732
answer the question you asked me last time?

812
00:52:36,547 --> 00:52:39,642
The answer had better be worthy of my time.

813
00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:51,493
I stumbled upon a book in the library.

814
00:52:51,757 --> 00:52:54,993
It was a book about Miranda...

815
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,093
of the Miranda Rule.

816
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:02,332
Ernesto Miranda was a serial rapist.

817
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:05,837
He confessed to his rape charges during a police interrogation,

818
00:53:05,837 --> 00:53:07,907
but the court ruled his confession inadmissible...

819
00:53:07,907 --> 00:53:09,777
because he had not been informed...

820
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:12,148
of his rights to remain silent and to consult with an attorney,

821
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:15,213
so he ended up being released on parole.

822
00:53:16,887 --> 00:53:18,558
Ultimately, this verdict...

823
00:53:18,558 --> 00:53:21,087
set an example that justice can only be truly realized...

824
00:53:21,087 --> 00:53:22,728
through lawful means.

825
00:53:22,728 --> 00:53:24,852
However, there are still many controversies...

826
00:53:25,058 --> 00:53:26,252
surrounding this decision.

827
00:53:28,728 --> 00:53:32,392
Personally, I don't agree with the verdict.

828
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:35,667
The rights of someone who kidnapped and raped an 18-year-old girl...

829
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:36,963
are not important.

830
00:53:39,677 --> 00:53:42,502
But perhaps by following the rules...

831
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:44,272
and accepting everyone's rights,

832
00:53:45,878 --> 00:53:47,883
we can protect...

833
00:53:49,387 --> 00:53:51,952
those who truly need to be protected from such criminals.

834
00:53:53,657 --> 00:53:56,053
So my answer to your question...

835
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,952
remains the same.

836
00:53:58,998 --> 00:54:00,122
Be it an innocent civilian...

837
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:02,122
or a criminal.

838
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,323
I believe that everyone should be protected,

839
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:07,363
within the frame of laws...

840
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:08,963
and rules we must follow.

841
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:11,573
Because we're members of the police...

842
00:54:13,107 --> 00:54:14,973
and a law enforcement agency.

843
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:48,642
The verdict wasn't made to protect Miranda.

844
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:51,443
The officer who caused an accident and led the criminal to die...

845
00:54:51,478 --> 00:54:55,113
didn't get dismissed and punished because the criminal was innocent.

846
00:54:55,947 --> 00:54:57,487
We shouldn't let our emotions do the judging.

847
00:54:57,487 --> 00:54:59,713
We should leave it to the law.

848
00:55:01,387 --> 00:55:04,182
Understanding the world through the law...

849
00:55:04,628 --> 00:55:07,693
is the legal mind you must learn...

850
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:11,162

What?

867
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,257
- Dong Man. - Oh, it must've been a big shock.

868
00:56:39,257 --> 00:56:42,053
Then do you remember the phone call we had?

869
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,493

- What? - What?

872
00:56:53,337 --> 00:56:54,562
What's wrong with him?

873
00:56:57,467 --> 00:56:59,602
It's dissociative amnesia.

874
00:56:59,907 --> 00:57:02,047
He's mentally shocked.

875
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:05,113
It looks like a whole part of his memory has been erased.

876
00:57:05,317 --> 00:57:07,982

00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:16,383

880
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,392

00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:58,252
It's a gray sedan.

907
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,593
When it rains, the truck gets messy.

908
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:06,337
This is my last piece of advice...

909
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:08,562
to a loser like you in a polite manner.

910
00:59:09,038 --> 00:59:10,803
Leave without causing any trouble.

911
00:59:12,107 --> 00:59:13,578
Wait!

913
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:24,312
Hey! Darn it...

914
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:30,252
What? What are you doing here?

915
00:59:30,887 --> 00:59:33,193
You asked for my help.

916
00:59:34,098 --> 00:59:35,622
Do you still need my help?

917
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:37,693
What did you say, you punk?

918
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:42,403
You asked me to help you to catch those jerks.

919
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,232
Do you still need my help?

920
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,042
I feel like I can...

921
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:52,713
protect the hurt...

922
00:59:53,217 --> 00:59:56,343
and catch the bad guys when I'm with you.

923
00:59:57,788 --> 01:00:01,522
A way to protect my people.

924
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:04,452
The right way to protect them.

925
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:08,292
Not as Hacker Yoon but as a student of this school,

926
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,323
can I find the right way...

927
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:13,863
as I work with you?

929
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:51,267
(Police University)

930
01:00:51,268 --> 01:00:52,708
This is all the material I collected...

931
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:54,337
while chasing the illegal gambling gang.

932
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:55,702
I'll come back in a month.

933
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:58,018
These are the culprit's footprints. They're 285mm.

934
01:00:58,018 --> 01:00:59,648
Could it be Professor Kwon Hyuk Pil?

935
01:00:59,648 --> 01:01:02,387
I can feel the stare. But hands are faster than eyes.

936
01:01:02,387 --> 01:01:03,887
- I saw everything. - From where?

937
01:01:03,887 --> 01:01:05,856
The moment you inserted that wire in the window.

938
01:01:05,857 --> 01:01:07,118
That sly punk.

939
01:01:07,118 --> 01:01:09,228
Let's go. I'm going to catch him no matter what.

940
01:01:09,228 --> 01:01:11,926
What was that? You look like you saw a puppy.

941
01:01:11,927 --> 01:01:13,797
If he looks cute to you, then you're already into him.

942
01:01:13,797 --> 01:01:16,223
Hey, don't smile with teeth.

943
01:01:16,598 --> 01:01:18,768
If a student here makes physical contact...

944
01:01:18,768 --> 01:01:19,898
to show a sexual appeal,

945
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:22,602
they will be expelled instantly.

946
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,662
Oh Kang Hee, you're expelled!
