00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,999
(All characters, places, institutions, incidents,)

2
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:10,065
(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,565
(Episode 3)

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,104
If I need to be worthy of a second chance,

5
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:23,214
I will prove it by leading my unit to a victory at the last training.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,115
And if I can't still prove it to you then,

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,455
I will withdraw...

8
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,225
without making any excuses.

9
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:33,755
So can you please...

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,755
make up your mind after the training?

11
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,124
Whether I deserve to stay in this school...

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,064
or not.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,405
Gosh, I must've been out of my mind.

14
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:54,045
What on earth did I just say to him?

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,475
Darn it.

16
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:59,120
Captain! Are you okay?

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,115
Gosh, you're sweating.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,060
It's all my fault.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,554
If only I hadn't suggested eating ramyeon...

20
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,929
I'm sorry, brother.

21
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:10,130
We should've listened to you when you said we shouldn't eat it.

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,399
Why did you stay up and wait? You should've just gone to bed.

23
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:15,434
How could we, after what we heard?

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,869
What? What did you hear?

25
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,434
We didn't hear everything,

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,634
but we heard how you said you'll lead our unit to victory.

27
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:27,145
Sun Ho.

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,250
You applied to other universities in addition to this school, right?

29
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,414
Hey!

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,714
Why would he need to go to a different university?

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,425
Does it even make sense to you?

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,485
Us, suddenly beating the other teams.

33
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:44,024
- Darn it. - Darn it.

34
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,934
(Student Name: Kang Sun Ho)

35
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,839
(Student Name: Kang Sun Ho)

36
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:54,505
(Parents Deceased, Guardian Yoon Taek Il)

37
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,479
I wondered why his ID was Yoon.

38
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,975
(Guardian Yoon Taek Il)

39
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:03,274
How dare you do this when you should be repaying him for raising you?

40
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:05,214
You pathetic fools.

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,054
(Student Name: Kang Sun Ho)

42
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,770
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,629
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

44
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,140
- One. - Three.

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,770
- Two. - Four.

46
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,170
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,904
So far, four people have dropped out.

48
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,240
And three were expelled.

49
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,705
So there are 60 of you at the moment.

50
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,244
We have a week left in this training.

51
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:38,350
Based on all your performances,

52
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,985
the second unit is beating all the other units.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,015
Applause.

54
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,494
The second unit led by Captain Oh Kang Hee...

55
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,365
will be excluded from the last training session.

56
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,395
In this training session,

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,140
the first unit led by Captain Park Min Kyu...

58
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,504
will go up against the third unit led by Captain Kang Sun Ho.

59
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,714
Now, I'll tell you what you'll be trained on in this session.

60
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:09,474
From all the way over there...

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,420
to here.

62
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,645
- From all the way over there... - Move.

63
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,054
Extremely advanced scientific training.

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,955
Just think of it as a survival paintball match.

65
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,554
From here, bang! Here goes another one!

66
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,600
What's with him?

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,105
Don't tell our enemies about my death.

68
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,235
Each unit will be split into two teams.

69
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,075
- One will attack... - Charge!

70
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,545
while the other team practices defense.

71
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,015
It's one of the ROK Army's actual drill sessions.

72
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
The Chungram Training is...

73
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,314
a condensed version of the ROK Army's training.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,754
That's why we have to do this.

75
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,219
So we'll do it over there?

76
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,459
Most of the trainees who don't get in...

77
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,825
are pushed out in this stage.

78
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:55,154
Gosh, but I'm sure...

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,665
at least some of us will make it.

80
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,124
If we don't want the entire team to be disqualified,

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,235
we need our captain to come up with effective strategies and plans.

82
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,874
- Sun Ho. - Yes.

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,145
- We'll be okay, right? - Yes.

84
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,844
Is it okay with you?

85
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,724
So? What will you do about Kang Sun Ho?

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,300
Not sure. What should I do?

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,929
What are you hesitant about?

88
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,300
Do you not want to return to the precinct?

89
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,265
Darn it. I know.

90
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,505
What should I do about that?

91
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,179
Just disqualify him...

92
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:44,375
and continue to get help from Yoon.

93
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:46,844
Then what about Kang Sun Ho?

94
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,019
I know who Kang Sun Ho is because I saw it with my own eyes.

95
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:54,389
Gosh, why are you being like this? This is so unlike you.

96
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,259
You do all sorts of reckless things when you need to catch criminals.

97
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,085
Go home. Get lost.

98
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,960
Well, why don't you...

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,699
just give up on the illegal gambling site...

100
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,929
and just beg Captain on your knees?

101
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:09,340
I can beg him with you if you want me to.

102
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,639
Get out! Go home!

103
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,534
Get lost, will you?

104
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:17,679
I'll leave after I finish this. Why are you so angry?

105
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:18,904
Darn it.

106
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,145
You're already having a strategy meeting?

107
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:26,945
Yes.

108
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,614
As you said, this isn't really about winning.

109
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,924
I just want to do my very best...

110
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,024
because this is my last chance.

111
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,470
I'm glad to hear this.

112
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,995
Yes, just do everything you want, so you won't have any regrets.

113
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,939
This moment will never come again.

114
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,305
And I'm going to do what I want at this moment without any regrets.

115
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,344
Hey! Oh Kang Hee!

116
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,984
Hey, what's with that smirk?

117
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:05,125
That sounds just like what my crush once said.

118
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,895
Who?

119
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,294
What?

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,995
Who's the girl you have a crush on?

121
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,765
Oh, it's...

122
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,005
What was her name?

123
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,575
Forget it. It's none of my business anyway.

124
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,974
I need to stop jumping to conclusions.

125
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,189
Well... I was wondering, just in case,

126
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,385
if the spiel about your dream of becoming a cop was all a lie.

127
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,724
But you've proved that I was wrong.

128
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,325
No one here is more serious about this than you are.

129
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,464
So about me jumping to conclusions,

130
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,104
I'll apologize to you properly once we're officially admitted.

131
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,474
I'll tell you...

132
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,185
who it is once we're admitted officially.

133
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:11,224
Hey, you'd better keep your word.

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,724
Then I should be rooting for your unit too.

135
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,395
Then I should be rooting for your unit too.

136
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,635
I refuse to leave.

137
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,135
I will get in, no matter what.

138
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,844
Guys.

139
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,185
Hey, guys.

140
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,555
Guys! Attention.

141
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,114
Throw some ideas around.

142
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,129
Brainstorming together always works, you know.

143
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,224
Ideas?

144
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,854
- That's random. - Ideas?

145
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,364
I mean, you know. Just anything.

146
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,234
It could be anything.

147
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,464
Isn't that your job, Captain?

148
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,765
Otherwise, why do we even need a captain?

149
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,375
Hey, come on.

150
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,709
Sun Ho is saying we should use our teamwork.

151
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,009
The team spirit.

152
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,078
Teamwork! Yes!

153
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,484
We'll obviously lose.

154
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,945
What's the point of having a strategy meeting?

155
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,920
Hey, Sung Soo.

156
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,625
- Don't be like this. - Let go.

157
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,524
Let's be honest. Do you really think we can beat Min Kyu's team?

158
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,664
That team has some of the strongest guys.

159
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,935
You tell me. Am I wrong?

160
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:44,815
I wish someone could give me some pointers.

161
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,415
Why don't you...

162
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,754
go talk to Professor Yu Dong Man?

163
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,655
He's our training advisor, you know.

164
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,055
And you personally know him.

165
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,695
He'll probably give you some pointers.

166
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,669
(Let's meet.)

167
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,435
(I need to talk to you about something in person.)

168
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,104
Forget it.

169
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:15,474
He's of no use anymore.

170
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,590
(Captain)

171
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,484
Should I just swallow my pride...

172
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,285
and get down on my knee?

173
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,168
Gosh, seriously.

174
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,730
Even if I get down on my knee,

175
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,440
I should get a lead, at least.

176
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,935
Goodness, this will make me lose face.

177
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,464
(Professor Yu Dong Man)

178
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,545
What are you doing here?

179
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,085
I came to ask you something, sir.

180
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,185
I told you that I'll lead my unit to a victory,

181
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,325
but could you help me out a little?

182
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:03,425
What?

183
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,325
I really want to continue studying here.

184
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:07,565
I'd rather die than withdraw.

185
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,594
So I'm desperate to win,

186
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,935
but could you help me out just a little?

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,874
Don't come closer!

188
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,805
Sorry?

189
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,545
Stand there and talk. Right there.

190
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,254
Just as you told me,

191
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,325
I want to repay my dad for the rest of my life.

192
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:38,425
I want to stand on my own.

193
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,134
So could you please help me?

194
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:47,165
Please, I beg you.

195
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,045
- Professor Yu. - Fine! Don't come any closer.

196
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:01,884
Did you just agree to help me?

197
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,094
Gosh, that airhead.

198
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,930
This is giving me a headache.

199
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,264
If you help me, I'll do anything for you.

200
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,394
You name it. I'll do anything you tell me to do.

201
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:20,705
What's the problem?

202
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,175
Sorry?

203
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,705
I have no clue how I should prepare...

204
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,675
for the last training.

205
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,384
What did you say, you punk?

206
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,960
Gosh, what's so hard about it?

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,190
The location is decided, so it's obvious how your unit should move.

208
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,195
How can you not come up with a strategy for such an easy mission?

209
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,360
Once you graduate from Police University,

210
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,864
you'll become a squad captain. How can you ask me for help?

211
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,200
- Gosh. - Does that mean...

212
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,340
you'll help me for real?

213
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,869
No, that's not what I meant.

214
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,709
Then I'll come back at noon tomorrow.

215
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,680
- What? - I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you!

216
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,149
Hey! That brat...

217
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,415
Thank you so much.

218
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,315
That crazy...

219
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:05,915
My gosh.

220
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:14,585
Darn it!

221
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,029
He can't even come up with a strategy,

222
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,764
so how does he think he'll manage in here?

223
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:23,594
Combat strategy.

224
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,065
I have no idea also.

225
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,374
Why are there so many?

226
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:39,545
Hey, ace.

227
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,254
How is the preparation going?

228
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,854
I'm not preparing anything special.

229
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,724
That means you think you can beat us easily, right?

230
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,025
No, I meant that we'll do our best as we always have.

231
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:54,394
That's only courteous for the opponent team.

232
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,594
That's kind of cool.

233
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,379
- I can do it myself. - Where should I put it?

234
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,119
Over there. I'll do it.

235
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,415
It's okay. I'm done with my lunch.

236
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,354
Same to you.

237
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,494
Did you stay up all night?

238
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,335
- No. - Oh, okay.

239
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,634
The only advice I can give to your unit...

240
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:43,415
But...

241
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,815
why should I help your unit?

242
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,955
It's not just me...

243
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,325
who needs to win at the last training.

244
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,594
All of my unit members need to pass this.

245
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:02,599
You punk, how could you sell your own unit members?

246
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,695
Of course I should sell them, if I must.

247
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,935
This is my last chance.

248
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,405
Even if you do that, it'll never work.

249
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,915
Do you think you can sell the unit made of airheads?

250
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:20,590
What do you mean?

251
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,960
Before coming up with a strategy,

252
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,714
you should get to know more about your unit members.

253
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,560
You're not even capable of winning,

254
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,854
but you're only seeking a way to win. That's why this won't work.

255
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,869
What is it? Are you disappointed...

256
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,435
because you didn't get to hear the answer you waited for?

257
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,305
No, sir. Thank you.

258
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,379
A miracle? A surprise?

259
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:45,144
If that's what you're hoping for, wake up.

260
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,744
Don't you think you should know your place?

261
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,974
Since this is your last chance?

262
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,984
A miracle, a surprise, a dream. Can't I even hope for them?

263
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,484
Just get to the point and say you want me out.

264
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,565
Whatever!

265
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,734
I'm sure he understood me. Gosh, he's such a headache.

266
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,149
Oh, you still haven't understood me? Okay, then.

267
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,244
What are you talking about?

268
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,014
Goodness, I couldn't have done this all by myself. Thank you.

269
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,685
Didn't you get any sleep last night?

270
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,788
- I did. - Come on.

271
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,525
The lights were on all night in your office.

272
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,724
My gosh.

273
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,224
Why did she check on my office all night?

274
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,394
She's one dangerous woman.

275
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,705
There are...

276
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,874
only two reasons why you can't sleep at night.

277
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,644
Either you have too many thoughts or you're lonely.

278
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,085
The answer for both is the same.

279
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,785
Just follow your heart.

280
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,695
Seriously, what's her deal?

281
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,224
Excuse me.

282
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,295
Gosh, she's so weird.

283
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:19,604
"Follow my heart"?

284
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,634
Whatever.

285
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,445
Gosh, I should just get some sleep.

286
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:34,955
Darn it.

287
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,025
Will you please let me get some sleep?

288
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,124
Bird, did something happen?

289
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,295
I couldn't get online for a while because I was busy.

290
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:53,364
I wanted to meet you too.

291
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,035
Bird.

292
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:58,675
(I wanted to meet you too. Bird.)

293
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,644
No, it was nothing. I dealt with it already.

294
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,954
You scared me. I'm glad to hear that.

295
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,585
Oh, right. I got into the Police University.

296
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,099
This brat, he keeps talking as if we're buddies.

297
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,755
But I don't think I can continue studying here.

298
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,694
It's too much to take.

299
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,700
(But I don't think I can continue studying here.)

300
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,335
You're giving up already when I just congratulated you?

301
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,864
(You're giving up already when I just congratulated you?)

302
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,235
It's not that I'm giving up.

303
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,134
Someone told me to.

304
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,104
He said I'm only looking for a way to win when I'm not capable of it.

305
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,944
Gosh, this brat.

306
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:36,914
Who?

307
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,785
Are you sure he really said that?

308
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,015
Did he really say that only?

309
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,529
(Did he really say that only?)

310
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:46,859
Before coming up with a strategy,

311
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,259
you should get to know more about your unit members.

312
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:50,630
You're not even capable of winning,

313
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,924
but you're only seeking a way to win. That's why this won't work.

314
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,904
You're one talented guy when it comes to hacking.

315
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,874
Why do you sound intimidated? It's not like you.

316
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,075
(Why do you sound intimidated? It's not like you.)

317
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:23,430
(Bird has logged out.)

318
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,795
I believe that you'll do well.

319
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:43,349
Guys, we'll have a strategy meeting later,

320
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:44,674
so please tell everyone to gather.

321
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,344
Captain! Did you come up with a plan?

322
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,515
Kang Sun Ho.

323
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,795
Let's play tomorrow's game fair and square...

324
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:58,354
so that no one gets hurt.

325
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,134
Of course.

326
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:08,505
But Park Min Kyu,

327
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,035
you won't be able to defeat us tomorrow...

328
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,844
if you can't make any changes.

329
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:22,354
Are you guys shooting a commercial?

330
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,755
Come out, everyone. We'll begin our last drill.

331
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,225
- What? - What's this?

332
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:31,755
- Wasn't it tomorrow? - Are we going to do it today?

333
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,069
- What do we do? - Hey, what should we do?

334
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:34,694
- What's this? - Sun Ho.

335
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,579
The drill was supposed to be on tomorrow night.

336
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:46,704
Gosh. Why so suddenly?

337
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,844
All right. First and third unit captains, come out.

338
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,995
The team that pulls out the other team's flag first will win.

339
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:12,704
You've got an hour.

340
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,839
What's more important than winning...

341
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,204
is not having any injured members.

342
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,505
Keep that in mind.

343
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:20,549
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

344
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,579
All right, you fools. Let's begin.

345
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:23,844
- Let's begin! - Let's begin!

346
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,215
The first unit, get moving.

347
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,088
The third unit, follow me.

348
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,215
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

349
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:33,285
Move forward.

350
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,565
Forward.

351
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,235
I've set up the smoke shell.

352
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,789
- The flagman, go up. - Yes.

353
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:02,914
Let's assemble.

354
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,485
Yes, sir.

355
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,664
Sun Ho, what's our strategy? Just tell me.

356
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,295
Are we striking first?

357
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,508
Or surprise attack?

358
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:21,164
No, we're...

359
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:26,902
Assemble, everyone.

360
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,742
- Assemble. - All right.

361
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:30,843
Okay, let's cheer up.

362
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,138
- Charge at them no matter what. - Let's get it done quickly.

363
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:36,138
The first unit, let's go!

364
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:37,703
- Let's go! - Let's go!

365
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:38,902
We are...

366
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:41,203
going to give up.

367
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,307
What did you say? We give up?

368
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,847
- Hey, we can't give up. - Darn it.

369
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,872
What are you talking about?

370
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:50,813
We won't pull out the flag. That's our strategy.

371
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:52,057
- My gosh. - Was that the strategy?

372
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:53,858
We won't make it by taking the bull by the horns.

373
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:56,958
So we will block the first unit that'll come for our flag.

374
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,756
No one will pull out the flag at the end.

375
00:21:58,757 --> 00:21:59,757
And then?

376
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:02,468
If only one of us can make it through the end...

377
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:05,537
That means we could get a chance to pull out the flag.

378
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:06,566
- That's right. - Right.

379
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,132
I understand your point,

380
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:12,233
but there must be someone who guards the flag at Min Kyu's base camp.

381
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:15,902
I don't think so. I bet most of them will come down.

382
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:20,513
They won't feel the need to do so because they think we're weak.

383
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,283
But we're not, you know.

384
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:28,852
We've also come this far.

385
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:32,392
So, guys. Don't be intimidated.

386
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:34,453
I trust you guys.

387
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,122
Sure thing.

388
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:39,067
It's not over until it's over. Don't be intimidated.

389
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,668
- Sure thing. - Of course.

390
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:41,938
- We can do this! - Sure.

391
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:44,168
- Third unit, we can make it! - Yes!

392
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:46,138
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

393
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:47,233
- We can do it! - That little...

394
00:22:47,237 --> 00:22:48,307
All right. Let's do this.

395
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:50,703
Guys, stay in your position and be on guard.

396
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:54,073
We'll take them down when they come close enough.

397
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,523
The first unit, ready.

398
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:13,233
The third unit, ready.

399
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:20,332
So can you please make up your mind after the training?

400
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:23,043
Whether I deserve to stay in this school...

401
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:25,142
or not.

402
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,082
We're all ready.

403
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:33,313
Okay.

404
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,033
How could that jerk be the unit captain?

405
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:50,932
"We're going to give up?"

406
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,672
He must be crazy.

407
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,507
Hey, what are you going to do?

408
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,948
I'll go there first and pull out the flag.

409
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:00,047
No way. They will raid us all...

410
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,418
if we leave our position.

411
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:02,513
Darn it.

412
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:06,582
You're not coming?

413
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:09,823
Sung Soo.

414
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:12,527
I don't think this is right. Don't go.

415
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:15,223
Make sure you don't regret it after we fail.

416
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:17,523
You guys are such cowards.

417
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:30,547
Halt.

418
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:33,247
Isn't it too quiet? It's odd.

419
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,073
They must be scared to death.

420
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:37,517
Hey, let's get it done.

421
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,682
- Let's go! - Darn.

422
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:40,753
My gosh.

423
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:12,213
Five died in the first unit.

424
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:13,787
Eight died in the first unit.

425
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:15,882
Five died in the third unit.

426
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:19,192
What's gotten into that foolish captain?

427
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:31,503
Sun Ho, I think our strategy is working, just like you said.

428
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,033
- Hey, we're going to win. - Right.

429
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:38,773
Hey! Goodness.

430
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:41,878
- My gosh. - Gosh, he's our member.

431
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:43,442
He approached us so suddenly.

432
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,718
Hey, why are you here anyway?

433
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:48,017
Sung Soo went in alone to pull out the flag.

434
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:50,827
I tried to stop him, but I couldn't. Sorry.

435
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:52,087
- What? - What?

436
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,122
My gosh. Just now?

437
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,398
You should've stayed there at least.

438
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:00,692
Are you telling me that no one's guarding that point?

439
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:04,438
What do we do, Captain? Hey, Captain.

440
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,273
Sun Ho. What do we do?

441
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:14,073
- What should we do? - My gosh.

442
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:17,612
We need to guard our flag, so let's go back to the base camp.

443
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:19,487
- I'll stay and cover from here. - Retreat.

444
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:21,087
- Everyone, retreat. - Retreat.

445
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:22,922
- Everyone, charge. - Charge.

446
00:26:48,178 --> 00:26:49,543
What do we do now, Sun Ho?

447
00:26:49,718 --> 00:26:52,582
Sun Ho. Captain!

448
00:27:00,428 --> 00:27:03,723
I will prove it by leading my unit to a victory at the last training.

449
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:05,493
And if I can't still prove it to you then,

450
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:09,332
I will withdraw without making any excuses.

451
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:11,763
What's more important than winning...

452
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:14,073
is not having any injured members.

453
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:15,703
Keep that in mind.

454
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:16,803
Sun Ho!

455
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:26,483
Kyung Hoon, to ten. Two.

456
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:30,453
Guys.

457
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:33,723
For now, we have to make sure none of us gets hurt.

458
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:36,368
- Let's guard here right now. - Got it.

459
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:38,797
- Jun Wook, to eleven. - Eleven.

460
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:40,362
- You go to three. - Okay.

461
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,573
Bum Tae, magazine!

462
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:00,682
Bum Tae!

463
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,662
Hey! Are you okay?

464
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:12,932
- Are you all right? - Sun Ho.

465
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:14,993
It hurts.

466
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,463
You both did great. Let me handle the rest.

467
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:20,273
- We're counting on you. - Guys! Charge!

468
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,533
Charge!

469
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:35,983
- The 3rd unit, 4 out. - The 1st unit, 6 out.

470
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,342
The 1st unit, 1 out.

473
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:23,566
Everyone's dead in the first unit.

474
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:24,993
The third unit is the winner.

475
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:27,097
- We won? - Did she say "third unit"?

- We won! - Hold on, guys.

00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:42,688
Who was it that shot the paintball at the end?

481
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,213
- What? - Who cares? We won, Sun Ho!

482
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,422
- We won! - We won!

483
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,152

(Staff Only)

488
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,983
- Don't worry. - Please take good care of him.

489
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:13,233
How's Sung Soo?

490
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:16,273
We'll have to see how he recovers after the surgery.

491
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,112
- Hey. - I will...

492
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:23,642
drop out.

493
00:32:26,658 --> 00:32:28,453
You were right, Professor.

494
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:32,852
I'm clearly underqualified, but I tried to hold out.

495
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:37,823
And I was arrogant because I didn't know my place.

496
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:40,993
I was clueless.

497
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:45,432
I'm sorry.

498
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,342
Sit down.

499
00:32:51,547 --> 00:32:53,513
Come on, sit down. Let me have a look at your leg.

500
00:32:58,317 --> 00:33:01,882
I asked the nurse...

501
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:04,152
to get me these supplies.

502
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:07,398
I can dress your wound.

503
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:08,553
Hold on.

504
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:15,292
Goodness.

505
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:21,603
Gosh, are you okay?

506
00:33:21,637 --> 00:33:22,743
Yes.

507
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:28,672
My goodness.

508
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,513
Was it about five years ago?

509
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:37,827
When I had to arrest a dirtbag in Incheon,

510
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,652
I got so carried away...

511
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:43,192
that I ignored my colleague's injury and chased him by myself.

512
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:47,263
Gosh, I still regret it every day.

513
00:33:47,697 --> 00:33:50,062
Had I managed to keep my cool,

514
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:53,473
my colleague would have never been stabbed.

515
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:59,172
Hey, the lesson here is that...

516
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:02,643
Don't think that you always have to look straight ahead.

517
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:05,542
It's okay to turn around once in a while, all right?

518
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,623
It's okay to make mistakes when you're still in school.

519
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:13,123
Learn from them and don't repeat the same mistakes out in the field.

520
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:19,592
And no one won or lost in today's training.

521
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:32,203
(Emergency, Ambulance Entrance)

522
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:47,493
That brat. At least he understood what I said earlier.

523
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:52,422
What's he doing?

524
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:55,092
That's cheating!

525
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,422
Yes, Yu Dong Man speaking.

526
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:33,636
- You jerks! - Hey, what are you doing?

527
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:35,477
- Come on out, jerks! - Sir.

528
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:36,803
- My gosh! - I'll kill you all.

529
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:40,677
- Sir! - Hey!

530
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:41,946
- Stop. - Please calm down.

531
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:45,488
What did I do so wrong? Why must I put up with this?

532
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:47,117
I'm warning you. Put that down.

533
00:35:47,117 --> 00:35:49,886
You wish. No! I don't want to!

534
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,028
- Hey. - Calm down.

535
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:54,092
- Calm down, please. - I'm going to slit my wrist!

536
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:00,192
Don't come near me! Hey!

537
00:36:01,997 --> 00:36:04,008
Stay away, you jerks!

538
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,103
- Get lost! - Please calm down!

539
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:09,303
- Go! - Hey!

540
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,406
Hey, do you want to die?

541
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:14,378
Sir, please. Don't do this.

542
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:16,148
Don't tell me what I can or can't do.

543
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:17,217
Who do you think you are?

544
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,553
Clearly, we're the police who are here to serve and protect.

545
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:24,553
Goodness, that's dangerous.

546
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:30,263
Let the kid go. Come here.

547
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:35,493
Hold on a second.

548
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:39,132
Looks like we need to get him treated before arresting him.

549
00:36:40,338 --> 00:36:42,502
- Hand him over. - Yes, sir.

550
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:44,203
What's your deal?

551
00:36:44,878 --> 00:36:46,373
- Sir. - Yes.

552
00:36:46,648 --> 00:36:49,787
Behave yourself and get it treated. When you sober up a little,

553
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:51,413
we'll get your statement.

554
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:54,487
You're bad.

555
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:57,922
Don't blame alcohol. This is all you.

556
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:00,398
But even if you're the biggest scumbag on the planet,

557
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:02,767
we need to get you treated first because you're hurt.

558
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,922
As police officers, we must make sure you get treated first.

559
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:08,967
So be quiet and just get that treated, okay?

560
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:11,433
- Okay! - Good.

561
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:15,473
Wait.

562
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:18,478
Who are you?

563
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,073
- Me? - Yes.

564
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:26,042
I'm a professor at the Police University.

565
00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:28,982
And you?

566
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:31,022
He's...

567
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:35,323
a freshman at the Police University.

568
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:45,208
(Emergency Center)

569
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,573
- Well done. - How did he calm him down?

570
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:54,342
I wonder what's going on.

571
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:07,926
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

572
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:11,962
Goodness, look at your faces.

573
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:13,792
You all look scared white.

574
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:16,537
The goal of our last training...

575
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,232
was not to get more flags...

576
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:22,132
but to see how well you listen and follow your unit members.

577
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:25,172
Although it was a complete mess.

578
00:38:27,077 --> 00:38:29,913
You should never forget what you experienced today.

579
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:32,382
That way, you'll become a police officer...

580
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:35,812
who can protect your fellow officer at the scene.

581
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:38,723
From now,

582
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:42,953
I'll watch how you'll change from the mess you are.

583
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:45,597
- What happened? - What is he saying?

584
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,562
- Didn't we fail? - What?

585
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,993
What is he saying?

586
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:52,333
That means you all passed, you airheads.

587
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:08,812
Be quiet!

588
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:12,652
Hey!

589
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,263
Good work, everyone.

590
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:18,922
Tonight,

591
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:21,433
- you can have late-night snacks. - Yes! Snacks!

593
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,672
- Yes! - We made it.

594

Sun Ho, I'm so relieved.

595
00:39:31,048 --> 00:39:33,318
- Good work, Jun Wook. - Goodness.

596
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,312
- Let me join you guys! - Sure.

597
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:38,947
Sun Ho, how did it go with Sung Soo? Is he okay?

598
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:40,382
They said the surgery went well.

599
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:42,057
He'll get discharged soon and return.

600
00:39:42,057 --> 00:39:45,382
- I'm so relieved. - We made it!

601
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:47,893
I'm so happy!

602
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:05,172
I'll tell you...

603
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,342
once we're admitted officially.

604
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,442
Then I should be rooting for your unit too.

605
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:27,092
Did you always like baseball?

606
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:34,873
Congratulations. I hope we'll get along.

607
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:38,442
Okay.

608
00:40:39,077 --> 00:40:40,513
Congratulations to you too.

609
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:43,643
Oh, about that misunderstanding I had...

610
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:46,183
Let me apologize. I'm sorry.

611
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:49,353
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

612
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:52,053
I actually came to this school...

613
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:55,053
because of you.

614
00:40:58,597 --> 00:40:59,763
It's you.

615
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:18,212
Captain! Come join us.

616
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:20,683
- I'll get going. - Okay.

617
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,163
Hold on, Kang Sun Ho.

618
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,562
As you said, I think I should do my best from now.

619
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:38,663
Congratulations on your victory.

620
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:43,272
There's no winner or loser today.

621
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:47,743

622

- Are you Bum Tae's father? - Yes.

Hello, sir. I'm Bum Tae's closest friend, Cho Jun Wook.

- Oh, hello. - Bum Tae!

- Yes? - Your father is here.

He's my dad.

Congratulations.

- You're here. - Hey.

Hold on, Dad.

Well done, Sun Ho.

Thank you for everything, Dad.

640
00:43:03,112 --> 00:43:05,306
The ceremony will start soon.

641
00:43:05,411 --> 00:43:07,851
Everyone, please take your seat.

642
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:11,417
Freshmen, please stand by in your seat.

643
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:14,021
I'll sit over there, so hurry up and go to your seat.

No, not exactly.

648
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:43,291

You must've gone through a lot.

652
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:58,267
He's still young, so he can make mistakes.

653
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:02,096
I know that he's doing really well, so everything is fine.

654

Also, I'll make sure to guide him...

655
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:09,377
to become a good police officer, so don't worry.

Thank you, Detective.

695
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:42,601
I heard you got a lead on the jerks who run the illegal gambling site.

What about it?

00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:45,632
Did you track down the cryptocurrency exchange?

Why are you being like this, seriously?

707

There are countless gambling rings in this country.

Just return to the precinct, and none of that is necessary.

716
00:47:41,262 --> 00:47:43,831
Hey, seriously! They won't take me back.

717
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:45,661
Then what? Are you going to stay at the university?

718
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:47,997
- Yes. - To get Yoon's help?

719
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,497
- No. - Why not?

720
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:52,632
You fool. I taught him...

721
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:54,942
that he must always follow the rules.

722
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:57,172
So how can I make him illegally hack the site again...

723
00:47:57,172 --> 00:47:59,342
just so I can catch those scumbags?

724
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:01,906
That will make me a hypocrite. Am I wrong?

725
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,576
Hey, don't you worry about a thing.

726
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:06,251
The only difference is that I won't be at the precinct.

727
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,647
Nothing else changes. I'll continue to track them down.

728
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:12,787
I'll catch them with my own hands and return to the precinct,

729
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:15,291
so just make sure you keep me updated...

730
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,287
on what's going on with the investigation, okay?

731
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,386
It's easier said than done.

732
00:48:19,431 --> 00:48:21,256
Gosh, you little...

733
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:25,466
I'm cutting you some slack because I still feel so bad...

734
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,437
for chasing that dirtbag when you were hurt.

735
00:48:35,782 --> 00:48:38,406
Right, I'm well aware. That day,

736
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:42,417
you told me that you'd always be right behind me.

737
00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:45,547
Hey, a year will fly by in no time.

738
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:48,616
Goodness.

739
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:51,326
It still hurts on rainy days.

740
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,291
And I still turn around in panic mode,

741
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:56,056
thinking someone might attack me from behind. So please...

742
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:58,567
don't leave me alone.

743
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:01,972
Hey, what's with you today?

744
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,736
Are you already drunk?

745
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:06,837
Forget it. The worst thing that could happen is me dying on the job.

746
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:09,776
Gosh, don't make such ominous remarks.

747
00:49:09,942 --> 00:49:11,306
Oh, right.

748
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:14,020
Your hunch was right.

749
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,851
Yesterday, I got a call from...

750
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:18,446
- Where are you going? - The restroom.

751
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:20,587
That little...

752
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,132
(Yu Dong Man was coming after us. How can you send him here?)

753
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,727
(Take care of him before the end of the day.)

754
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:47,917
You're acting strange these days.

755
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:49,446
Is something up?

756
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:51,486
Hey, hold on.

757
00:49:55,862 --> 00:49:58,532
This guy is a police detective, so make sure you don't speed.

758
00:49:58,532 --> 00:49:59,787
- Okay. - Great.

759
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:01,756
Get going.

760

(No Caller ID)

761
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:20,747
Yes.

762
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,247
Right.

763
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:29,817
If we rush this, things might go south.

764
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:32,326
Let's give it some more time.

765
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:42,902
(Korean National Police University)

766
00:50:42,902 --> 00:50:45,072
The orientation will end this week,

767
00:50:45,072 --> 00:50:47,837
so please thoroughly prepare for everything.

768
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,647
Yes, sure thing.

769
00:50:52,411 --> 00:50:55,851
- You're teaching the first class. - Yes.

770
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:58,946
Go easy on them. Don't scare them off right away.

771
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,161
Well, then let's wrap up the meeting here.

772
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:04,361
- Just a moment. - Yes, Professor Yu.

773
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:06,986
What do I need to prepare for the orientation?

774
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:12,767
Just nail down the direction of your course for the whole year.

775
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:14,101
I see.

776
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:16,497
- One more question. - Sure.

777
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:17,966
When's my turn?

778
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:23,977
I'm sure the schedule has been emailed to you already.

779
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,276
I see. I haven't checked my email yet.

780
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,576
Well, I'll be off then.

781
00:51:35,362 --> 00:51:39,926
Detective Yu is finally becoming a real professor.

782
00:51:42,702 --> 00:51:44,096
- Hello. - Hello.

783
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:45,866
- Hello. - Hi.

784
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:53,406
- Do a good job. - Pardon me?

785
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,676
I said, do a good job.

786
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:57,547
I'll be watching you the whole year.

787
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,317
- Yes, sir. - What's with that smirk? You punk.

788
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:13,362
I'll be teaching the Constitutional Law course.

789
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:14,627
I'm Professor Kwon Hyuk Pil.

790
00:52:14,702 --> 00:52:17,230
You'll get an F if you're late twice or miss even just one class.

791
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:19,271
The same goes for when you fail to hand in any of the assignments.

792
00:52:19,271 --> 00:52:22,297
You cannot request a grade change. There will be no exceptions.

793
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:27,676
You get an F twice, and you'll be expelled.

794
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,512
Since this is our first orientation,

795
00:52:31,512 --> 00:52:34,047
let's talk about the relationship between the police and civilians.

796
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:38,891
(Labor Union Protest Case, 2018)

797
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:42,187
This is the labor union protest case from 2018.

798
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:43,787
Does anyone know about this case?

799
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,326
Yes.

800
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:52,871
After a long-standing confrontation between the police and protesters,

801
00:52:52,871 --> 00:52:54,672
four of the protesters got injured,

802
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,541
and all of them were arrested.

803
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58,311
Many criticized...

804
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:00,681
the police's abuse of power against innocent civilians.

805
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,207
The way the police handled the case was heavily criticized.

806
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:05,006
It's a very famous case.

807
00:53:06,211 --> 00:53:07,676
Can anyone tell us more about this case?

808
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:10,587
Yes.

809
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:15,857
This specific protest was done in an ambush style.

810
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:17,532
The police ordered them to disperse three times,

811
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:19,227
but the protesters refused.

812
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,526
The protesters' actions threatened public order.

813
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:24,472
The police were simply following the law,

814
00:53:24,472 --> 00:53:26,431
and I think the way they handled it was appropriate.

815
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:28,201
My gosh, he's good.

816
00:53:28,202 --> 00:53:30,636
All right. Does anyone think differently?

817
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:38,707
Kang Sun Ho, why don't you tell us what you think?

818
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:50,561
Hold on a second.

819
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,957
Looks like we need to get him treated before arresting him.

820
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:56,926
Before taking them down...

821
00:53:57,771 --> 00:53:58,771
I mean, protecting them should've been...

822
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:00,937
the police's priority, not arresting them.

823
00:54:01,442 --> 00:54:05,136
Protesters are also civilians whom the police must protect.

824
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:11,877
All right. Then here's another example.

825
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:14,922
A police car transporting an apprehended murder suspect...

826
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:16,417
got into an accident.

827
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:18,992
The murder suspect was critically injured...

828
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:21,517
and eventually died.

829
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:25,032
His family demanded compensation from the government,

830
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:27,092
insisting that the accident occurred while on official duty.

831
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:31,127
And the court ordered that the bereaved be compensated.

832
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:36,667
The prosecution no longer has the right to indict the case,

833
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:39,041
and the officer who caused the accident...

834
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:41,107
was dismissed and punished.

835
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:46,147
Kang Sun Ho, who do you think was "protected" in this case?

836
00:54:47,222 --> 00:54:49,716
The murder suspect? The police?

837
00:54:49,751 --> 00:54:52,386
The bereaved now that the case can't be indicted?

838
00:55:00,262 --> 00:55:01,561
- That's... - No.

839
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:03,196
I want Kang Sun Ho to answer this question.

840
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:05,466
It's...

841
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,842
Didn't you say just now...

842
00:55:08,842 --> 00:55:11,537
that the police must protect everyone?

843
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:15,537
Did you come to this school without even considering these things?

844
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:18,707
Or, do you not care at all?

845
00:55:19,351 --> 00:55:20,477
Answer me.

846
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:28,986
I apologize.

847
00:55:29,922 --> 00:55:31,230
I'm not sure.

848
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:32,656
Just so you know,

849
00:55:33,391 --> 00:55:35,227
these two things are never allowed in my classes.

850
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:38,267
Not answering...

851
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:41,466
and giving an answer that you can't back up.

852
00:55:43,442 --> 00:55:44,636
That's it for today.

853
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:52,306
Are you all right, Sun Ho?

854
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,087
That was so scary.

Hey, it's me. Chief Han Jung Sik.

Why don't you cancel your transfer to the Police University...

861
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:30,216
and just go to Seocho Police Station?

00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:33,946

Well, Captain Choi asked me to send you there.

865
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:43,127
We don't need you back here, so stop calling me.

866
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,127
There's something.

867
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,437
There's definitely something, but...

868
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:55,276

They are the Police University's...

893
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:37,877
Hey, Chul Jin.

894
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,006
Chul Jin. Park Chul Jin!

895
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:41,377
Chul Jin!

896
00:58:45,552 --> 00:58:48,017
(I must...)

897
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:52,886
(protect everyone.)

898
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,211
(I believe that you'll do well.)

899
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:06,537
He's not here.

900
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:12,006
Why don't we meet up?

901
00:59:12,012 --> 00:59:13,176
Yes.

902
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:32,501
Professor Yu.

903
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:34,271
- Kang Sun Ho. - Yes, sir.

904
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,707
You said you'll do anything for me if I help you out, right?

905
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:40,981
- Help me. - Pardon?

906
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,837
Help me...

907
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:45,607
so that I can catch those jerks.

908
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:50,346
- What are you talking... - With your hacking skills,

909
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:52,616
we can catch those jerks.

910
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,517
Yoon.

911
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,187
"Yoon"?

912
01:00:04,202 --> 01:00:05,397
Are you...

913
01:00:05,632 --> 01:00:08,497
That's right. I'm...

914
01:00:11,972 --> 01:00:13,236
Bird.

915
01:00:13,972 --> 01:00:15,107
What?

916
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:52,750
(Police University)

917
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:54,722
There seems to be something going on with Kang Hee and Sun Ho.

918
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:56,521
I knew it. Like attracts like.

919
01:00:56,521 --> 01:00:59,052
Kang Hee's mother was convicted four times.

920
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:00,992
How could the daughter of a criminal become a police officer?

921
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:03,291
Those jerks involved in the illegal gambling site.

922
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,331
I think they're at our university!

923
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:08,297
This is my last piece of advice for you. Leave this school quietly.

924
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:10,001
He will wake up, won't he?

925
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:11,431
I can't guarantee that.

926
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:13,997
If I help you, does that make hacking legal?

927
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:15,842
Those darn jerks.

928
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:19,567
I'll catch them and make them pay for this!
