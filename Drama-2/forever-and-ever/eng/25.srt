00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,580
Hello?

5
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,980
Hello, Xiaoyu.

6
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,240
Do you have Du Feng's phone number?

7
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,720
What happened?

8
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,720
Zhousheng Chen went out this morning

9
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,560
to look for Du Feng.

10
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,840
But he's not home yet.

11
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,920
Did you call him?

12
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,000
He didn't take his phone with him.

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,880
Can you ask Du Feng

14
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,480
when did he leave

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,760
the police station?

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
I have blacklisted him.

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,079
Oh, okay.

18
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,520
Never mind.

19
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
I'll go ask the lab then.

20
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,480
All right, bye.

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,680
Bye.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Darn you Du Feng.

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,920
Just because I've blacklisted you, you won't contact me?

24
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,040
Chen, I have a question for you.

25
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,920
Please don't get mad.

26
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,000
What is it?

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,640
Uncle Lin said

28
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
you have no intention of taking over the family business.

29
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,079
What about your marriage afterwards?

30
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,360
Is your salary as a professor good enough?

31
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,520
My salary as a professor is pretty good.

32
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,840
This is what I saved up for you,

33
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,480
in case you had fallen out with mother

34
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,600
completely in the future.

35
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
I can still buy you a wedding house.

36
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,440
I have my own house.

37
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,920
These are two different matters.

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
This is what I saved up for you.

39
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,920
Also,

40
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,440
I'll be spending my entire life at home,

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,080
I won't be using this money anyways.

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,120
You are staying at home for the rest of your life?

43
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,519
What about getting married?

44
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,279
Getting married?

45
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,680
You can buy me a house when I get married then.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,640
Chen,

47
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,320
I know you just got married,

48
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,920
so you won't come home often.

49
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,040
And I know mother's attitude towards my sister-in-law

50
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,220
will make you feel uncomfortable.

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,900
But if you are really busy

52
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,300
and has no time to come home,

53
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,490
remember to make some calls.

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

55
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,640
I will come back to see you guys

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,120

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,520

My dear husband,

60
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,300
why did you buy so much stuff?

61
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,580
Our fridge doesn't have enough space.

62
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,659
I bought all the ingredients of the dishes

63
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,260

64
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,380

65
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,820

66
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,820
Can you cook for me?

Let's go home,

68
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,500
I will cook them for you.

69
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,490
Allow me.

70
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,300
I'll do all the cooking today,

71
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,260

72
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,740

Do you know what time it is?

76
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,820
What time is it?

77
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,260
It's 8 pm.

78
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,300
No wonder.

79
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,730
What?

80
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,800
I didn't have a good sleep.

81
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,140
You woke up early in the morning

82
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,300
and you didn't take lunch.

83
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,570
It would be strange if you slept well.

84
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,440
I have prepared some food.

85
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,120
Get up and let's go eat.

86
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,840
Hold on you.

87
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,040
Don't drink the soup first. Try some of the dishes.

88
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,120
I made so much.

89
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,200
You'll feel full if you drink the soup first.

90
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,760
Try the dishes.

91
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,960
You are not eating?

92
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,160
I would have fainted from hunger if I waited for you.

93
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,480
I already had some soup.

94
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,520
You eat first. I'll watch you eat.

97
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,280
That's some good news.

98
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,040
When did I

99
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,560
not eat on my own?

100
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
I thought you would get sick

101
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,480
because of sadness.

102
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,760
You got sick

103
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,240
and couldn't get out of bed,

104
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,000
then I would serve you food

105
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,480
and fed you.

106
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,880
I had it all figured out.

107
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,920
But you failed to cooperate.

108
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,560
Then from now on,

109
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,240
you should give me some hints beforehand

110
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
and I will try to get sick

111
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,840
to cooperate with you.

112
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,480
Are you done?

113
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
I'll serve you a bowl of soup.

114
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,400
Didn't I say I had some already?

115
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
Your bowl is too clean.

116
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,640
How could you have had it?

117
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
What if I washed the bowl

118
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
after drinking it?

119
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
You dislike washing.

120
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,640
So that's impossible.

121
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,560
I like to eat with you.

122
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
That's my motivation

123
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,680
for buying the food.

124
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Do you like

125
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,040
to sleep with me then?

126
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,040
No?

127
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,920
Do you not like the pillow?

128
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,480
Or is the mattress not soft enough?

129
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,120
Or do I hog the sheets when I'm asleep?

130
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,440
I am used to it.

131
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,040
Used to it?

132
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,720
Used to me hogging the sheets?

133
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,960
Really?

134
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,960
No.

135
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,440
You never hog the sheets.

136
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,920
Seriously.

137
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
I swear.

138
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,560
Since I hog the sheets when sleeping,

139
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
let's have separate sheets then.

140
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,440
When I was sleeping this afternoon,

141
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,280
I woke up many times.

142
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,240
I kept waking up with a fright.

143
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,320
Noticing you weren't there

144
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,200
after waking up,

145
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,120
I would wonder where you were.

146
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,640
But then I would realize

147
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,240
that you were outside.

148
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,480
You were living

149
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,800
with me.

150
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,680
Then I would feel at ease

151
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,080
and soon fall asleep again.

152
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,280
Every night when I wake up

153
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,840
in the middle of night,

154
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,360
whether you are holding me,

155
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
hogging the sheets,

156
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,080
or when you take my pillow away,

157
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,880
as long as I can see you next to me,

158
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,040
I would feel especially secure.

159
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
Your wife is here. Don't worry.

160
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,600
Actually, Du Feng

161
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,800
didn't mean to hide it from...

162
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,600
Hold it.

163
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,560
I am the one to comfort you today,

164
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,120
not for you to ease my anxiety.

165
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,960
Why would you buy some pets all of a sudden?

166
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,240
He likes them.

167
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,000
So I want to cheer him up with them.

168
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,560
This chemistry professor

169
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,040
enjoys the strangest things.

170
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
This is not bad.

171
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,520
Get one of these.

172
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,200
No. It'll scare him.

173
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,280
He's a grown man. How could he be scared of this?

174
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,720
Zhousheng Chen is adorable,

175
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
he would want something cute.

176
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,560
Then get a piglet.

177
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,000
Nothing is cuter than a piglet.

178
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,400
It'll become big when it grows up.

179
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,720
We won't even be able to hold it.

180
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,120
Stop touching it.

181
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,640
I'm just taking a look.

182
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,359
Hello.

183
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,280
Hi.

184
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,200
Would you want this?

185
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,839
There are not a lot of people who keep this.

186
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,599
We have a few, my husband keeps them.

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Your husband has a good taste.

188
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,720
What type do you guys have at home?

189
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:13,960
This one.

190
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,839
This is not bad.

191
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,319
This is the most popular type right now.

192
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,839
Our star, devil crab.

193
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,720
What's the color of the crab you guys have?

194
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,440
Almost the same as this one.

195
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,640
I have a question.

196
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,920
What is this species of crab?

197
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,440
This one?

198
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,640
This is an entry-level type.

199
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,480
Sesarma crabs.

200
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,000
They are shy but easy to keep.

201
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Sesarma?

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
All right, I'll take two of them.

203
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,880
You have already kept the devil crab.

204
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,000
Why would you want Sesarma crabs?

205
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,640
How about you selecting some devil crabs?

206
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,680
We have a variety of colors here.

207
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,360
It's okay, I prefer these.

208
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,680
Okay.

209
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,920
Do you know what they are called?

210
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,200
Sesarma.

211
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,360
Do you like it?

212
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,600
Yeah.

213
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,040
I just don't know if

214
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
there's a difference raising them.

215
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,160
I'll go to the study room.

216
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,440
A name of the crab

217
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,920
can make you so happy.

218
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,560
Your sense of happiness is really high.

219
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm not giving you guys a red envelope

220
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,840
at your wedding.

221
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,760
I'll ask someone to make

222
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,240
a giant crab doll for you.

223
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
How does that sound to you?

224
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,880
Deal.

225
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,560
I won't break my promise.

226
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,000
Coming.

227
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,080
I came to visit you guys.

228
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,360
Come in and take a seat.

229
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,080
Xiaoyu.

230
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,480
Xiaoyu.

231
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,600
Did you buy them recently?

232
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,120
I know how to keep them.

233
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
Have you had them before?

234
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,080
Yeah.

235
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,800
I only gave them away

236
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,600
because of work.

237
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,720
I didn't have time to look after it

238
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,520
since I always worked overtime.

239
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,800
Teach me.

240
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,760
I will take down notes.

241
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,960
Sure, no problem.

242
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,040
Xiaoyu, I need to go to the bedroom.

243
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,400
Help me entertain my guest.

244
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,160
Do you like it?

245
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I can buy you one if you like them.

246
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,240
Why are you here?

247
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,000
Doing police work?

248
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
I couldn't reveal my identity

249
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
because I was working on a case.

250
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

251
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,760
Nor was I using you to get close to

252
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
the Zhou family.

253
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
I really had no choice.

254
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,480
Do you know what's the most important thing

255
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,760
when two people get together?

256
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,440
Sincerity.

257
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,840
We've been together

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,440
for so long,

259
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,120
but I don't even know

260
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,960
your real identity.

261
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,750
How could I trust you?

262
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm sorry Xiaoyu.

263
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,680
It's all my fault.

264
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
I have been constantly calling you

265
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,200
and sending you WeChat messages recently.

266
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
But you never answered them.

267
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
I'm really concerned about you.

268
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,920
Will you forgive me, please?

269
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,280
You really had crabs as pets?

270
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,000
Of course not.

271
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,800
I was just making conversation.

272
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,360
What are you doing?

273
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,600
I am searching about how to raise them.

274
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,280
When she ask me later,

275
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,520
I don't want her to think I lied to her.

276
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,240
Seriously?

277
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,720
All right. Forgive me, okay?

278
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,240
Come in.

279
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,360
Are you busy?

280
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,200
You want to talk about what happened at the hospital?

281
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,720
Yeah.

282
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,680
Although we haven't found the person

283
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,080
that killed your sister,

284
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,800
I still suspect

285
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,680
that the mastermind

286
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,800
is Zhou Wenchuan.

287
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,800
Also the capital he has raised...

288
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
I don't want to talk about this

289
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
at home.

290
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,480
All right.

291
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,980
What are you guys talking about?

292
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,600
We were talking about your crabs.

293
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,680
He said Sesarma crabs are very timid

294
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,320
so we need to make a shelter for it.

295
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,760
Yes, exactly.

296
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
They need shelter.

297
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,920
What are you printing?

I'm printing it out to read later at night.

302
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840

Don't always lose your temper.

If he continues to

309

keep secrets from me,

310

I would just dump him.

Lesson time.

If crabs fight,

342
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,760
the male crab

343
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,040
would say to the female crab:

344
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,120
"Guduk, guduk, guduk..."

so we should head back to my family one day ahead

just to celebrate it.

00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,120
Okay.

but I fancy him.

375
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Yeah. Go and get to know each other better.

376
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,800
Go and get to know each other better...

377
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,160
Grandmother.

378
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,800
Can I give you a massage?

379
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
Sure.

380
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,240
It seems like I am destined to be your wife.

381
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,800
Every time grandmother sees me,

382
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,480
she wants to introduce me to you.

383
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,760
But her mind

384
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,040
never gets confused.

385
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,040
Weren't you going to buy food?

386
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,960
Why are you back already?

387
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,840
I saw these

388
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,240
on my way there

389
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,400
and I think they were pretty cute.

390
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,080
So I bought some

391
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
for you guys.

392
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,840
That many?

393
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,360
You guys can take your time to peel and enjoy them.

394
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,440
By the time you finish them,

395
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,440
I should be back with food.

396
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
If we ate all these,

397
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,320
we would be too full for dinner.

398
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
How much should we leave for you?

399
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,080
I am okay

400
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,360
no matter how much you leave for me.

401
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm going now.

402
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
Watch the steps.

403
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,640
You guys keep talking.

404
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,620
Just keep talking.

405
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,360
Don't mind us.

406
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,340
You guys, haven't

407
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,440
formerly introduced yourself to each other, right?

408
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,380
You need to know each other, huh?

409
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,920
What do we do?

410
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,230
Chen, you take the lead.

411
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,490
You go ahead.

412
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,890
I have a PhD

413
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,080
and I work in a research institute.

414
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,760
What did you study?

415
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
Chemistry.

416
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,080
I am a dubber.

417
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,380
A dubber, huh?

418
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,520
That's a good job.

419
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,440
How about giving me your WeChat number

420
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,360
or phone number.

421
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,360
I'll send you an invite.

422
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,760
We can become friends.

423
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,400
Ordinary friends.

424
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,560
I am sorry,

425
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,880
I just returned to China

426
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,320
and I haven't bought a local phone number.

427
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,440
How about this?

428
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
I will give you

429
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,720
my home number,

430
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,480
my cellphone number, my WeChat, my Email address

431
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,160
and my home address.

432
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,280
So that

433
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,840
you can find me

434
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,040
any time

435
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
you want.

436
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,480
That's right.

437
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,090
Your brother has wisened up overnight.

438
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,880
He has.

439
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,520
You should eat, old madam.

440
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,920
If you don't eat first,

441
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,280
the others will keep waiting.

442
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
Right, dig in, please.

443
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,710
Let's eat.

444
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,870
My dear, help yourself.

445
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,730
Let's eat.

446
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,440
You too.

447
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,050
Grandmother, dig in.

448
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,570
Okay.

449
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,400
Here, grandmother.

450
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

451
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,130
Here, grandmother.

452
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,860
Okay, okay, okay.

453
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,190
Help yourself, help yourself, help yourself.

454
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,080
Are they all asleep?

455
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,680
Yes.

456
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,320
Why would you remember everything we said in the airport?

457
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,480
I have a good memory.

458
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,000
Can't you lie to me a little?

459
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,200
Why would I?

460
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,440
Well, you can say,

461
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,520
you felt something special when you met me.

462
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,280
That's a fact.

463
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,640
Why would I lie to you about that?

464
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,160
Why didn't you knock before getting in?

465
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,800
Can I sleep with you guys?

466
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,560
I heard some weird noises outside.

467
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,200
No.

468
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,800
I am scared of the dark.

469
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,880
Still a no.

470
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,920
Go sleep on your own.

471
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,040
I'm not faking this.

472
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,520
All right.

473
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,720
You two sleep here.

474
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,680
I'll go out to sleep.

475
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,630
Thank you, Shi Yi.

476
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,640
Go to bed.

477
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,400
From now on, you can only visit us during summer vacation and winter vacation

478
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,080
for one week each.

479
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,120
Winter vacation is short,

480
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,560
so no problem.

481
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,920
But summer vacation is too long,

482
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,760
one week is too short.

483
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,280
You are also not allowed to visit us during normal holidays.

484
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,520
What about weekends?

485
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,840
No.

486
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,480
What about when I'm sick?

487
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,800
Chen.

488
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,920
I feel terrible.

489
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,720
And I have no one to talk to.

490
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
Cry out if you need to.

491
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,800
Grandmother.

492
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,080
It's late at night and it's chilly outside.

493
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,320
Why did you open the window?

494
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,500
You brat.

495
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,000
You have a weak body.

496
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,469
Why did you come out?

497
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,880
Look.

498
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,380
The moon tonight

499
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,220
reminds me of

500
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,760
the day when you and Wenchuan were born.

501
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,810
It's not easy giving birth to twins.

502
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,320
Your mother was in the delivery room

503
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,080
for a whole night,

504
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,800
while I waited outside

505
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,200
for a whole night.

506
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,550
Grandmother,

507
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,360
it's cold. Let me take you to your bed.

508
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,960
Okay, okay.

509
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,080
Grandmother,

510
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,080
I will stay here

511
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,760
until you fall asleep.

512
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,800
Zhousheng Wen

513
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,040
was a good man.

514
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,420
Even when he was dying,

515
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,760
he didn't say that

516
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,600
you weren't her daughter.

517
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,680
Your father,

518
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,340
although he's not your own father,

519
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,320
he is better than...

520
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,800
better than

521
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,960
your real father.

522
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,320
You knew that already?

523
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
Yeah.

524
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,320
You should have told me this earlier.

525
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,680
Some people like to

526
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,600
give the people they care about

527
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,520
the best impression

528
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,960
by their good side, their knowledge

529
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
or the good family atmosphere.

530
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,200
After getting remarried, my father

531
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,680
and I stayed

532
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,320
in this place

533
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,600
until he passed away.

534
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,880
That's why his marriage

535
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,120
with Qin Wan

536
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,640
exists only in name.

537
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,360
I can now better understand

538
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,640
why you are distant

539
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,080
from your family.

540
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,600
I am not affected by any of these.

541
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,520
My only concern is that

542
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,680
you would think that this family

543
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,400
is too complicated.

544
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,520
You fool.

545
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,360
You are the only one

546
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,880
I care about.

547
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
No need to walk me out.

548
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,600
About that family matter,

549
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,600
try to talk to them.

550
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
Your mother is a sensible woman.

551
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,200
Shi Yi, see you.

552
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:11,960
See you.

553
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,280
Let's go.

554
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,280
Go on.

555
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:14,920
Bye.

556
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,000
Your technology is inferior!

557
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,960
And it did not increase my production!

558
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,440
Yet you still want me to pay in full.

559
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,520
No way!

560
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,440
I have asked someone about this.

561
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,400
You already have a production line

562
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,600
using our technology.

563
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,840
Why aren't you paying us when you are using it?

564
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,040
What makes you say that

565
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,560
I am using your technology?

566
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,680
-Professor.
-Are you the only one in China

567
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,480
that have this technology?

568
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,800
What's going on?

569
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,400
Not our business.

570
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,640
The guys from the other lab

571
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,280
is having a dispute

572
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
with their partner.

573
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,200
They don't know how to argue.

574
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:51,960
Me and Du Yu,

575
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,280
we were arguing for them.

576
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Arguing on their behalf?

577
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,440
They are walking all over them.

578
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,920
Even though they use our technology,

579
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,920
he doesn't want to pay us.

580
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,200
He even used all sorts of excuses.

581
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,800
What? You guys have nothing more to say, right?

582
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,720
You want me to pay?

583
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,160
Not so easy.

584
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,560
Hello.

585
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,160
Who are you?

586
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,920
He is our Professor, Mr. Zhousheng.

587
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,320
Are you their superior?

588
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,440
I am their colleague.

589
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,560
You might get cocky

590
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,560
being called professor

591
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,560
at such a young age.

592
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,880
People in here

593
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
are all ill-tempered.

594
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,520
If your technology doesn't meet our requirements,

595
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,160
just admit it. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

596
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,800
What is shameful is asking for money

597
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,080
when you can't deliver.

598
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,480
I am here today

599
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,720
because I respect you

600
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,960
scientists.

601
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,520
When we terminate our contract,

602
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,120
talk to my lawyer.

603
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,040
Give me their information.

604
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,960
Professor, don't bother.

605
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,520
I asked my dad to look into this.

606
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,200
They are a thuggish company.

607
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,760
They are totally shameless.

608
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
They want to terminate the contract now,

609
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,160
yet they have already used our technology

610
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,120
in their production line.

611
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,880
I will talk to the head of

612
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
the renewable energy department tomorrow.

613
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,240
I will come back to you later.

614
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,240
It's rare to see you talk about

615
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,280
what happened there at home.

616
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,160
It's not that.

617
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,800
It's about the institute.

618
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,160
The guys from the other lab.

619
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,560
They worked as

620
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,880
technical consultants

621
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,000
for a company specializing in lithium.

622
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,480
Now the company

623
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,800
wants to unilaterally terminate the contract

624
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,040
without paying.

625
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,680
That's why you asked Mei Xing

626
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,280
to help them litigate?

627
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,880
It's very hard to obtain evidence for this case.

628
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,320
It's also very time-consuming.

629
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,640
We also need to find a third-party agency

630
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,680
for certification.

631
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,160
It's both too energy

632
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,800
and time consuming.

633
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Mei Xing advises against a lawsuit.

634
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,280
So, that's itï¼Ÿ

635
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,280
That's why we found

636
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,520
a compromise.

637
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,800
What is that?

638
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,680
We own a couple of

639
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,400
renewable energy industrial parks.

640
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,960
Our department of renewable energy is currently

641
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,120
planning on

642
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,760
acquiring some manufacturing companies

643
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,600
of raw materials.

644
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,200
His assistant will

645
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,640
do an on-site inspection tomorrow

646
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,960
with people from the department of new energy.

647
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
If there's no problem,

648
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,320
they would be included

649
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,320
in the acquisition.

650
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,880
That way, we not only

651
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,480
satisfy our own procurement plan,

652
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,040
but make it possible for the whole thing

653
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,040
to be properly investigated.

654
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,000
Although we will buy them out,

655
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,440
we won't be standing on their sides.

656
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,520
I know you won't.

657
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,000
Try this.

658
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,960
It's sweet.

659
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,520
Right?

660
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,120
Why are you here again?

661
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,760
Is Professor Zhousheng in?

662
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,400
Our teacher is in the middle of something,

663
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,240
he's not available.

664
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,200
I only have a few things to say.

665
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,160
Hello.

666
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,120
Professor,

667
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,840
I couldn't see the forest for the trees.

668
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,840
Professor Zhousheng,

669
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,120
we have been trying to get into contact

670
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,680
with the renewable energy industrial parks

671
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,960
and have been pulling a lot of strings

672
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,240
to see their person in charge.

673
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,160
But we never could.

674
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,400
Yesterday,

675
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,240
their legal department's chief assistant

676
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,240
actually came to visit me.

677
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,840
Professor Zhousheng,

678
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,360
you are truly my lucky star.

679
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
I had no idea that

680
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,000
you and the head of their legal department

681
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,800
were friends.

682
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,320
I really didn't expect that.

683
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,760
If they didn't mention it yesterday,

684
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,600
I don't even know that

685
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,120
this was all thanks to you.

686
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,960
I have told my accountant

687
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,200
to pay the money today.

688
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,280
We won't terminate the contract.

689
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,560
Why would we?

690
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,560
It's impossible.

691
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,960
The whole thing was a misunderstanding.

692
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
When will you be available

693
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,200
to do me the honor

694
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,920
and let me invite you to dinner?

695
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,220
[Chen Sihan]

696
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
No, thanks, I don't like business dinners.

697
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,040
Here, here.

698
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,880
I admire those who dedicate themselves into science

699
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,200
instead of socializing the most.

700
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,800
Would you please,

701
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,200
maybe when you are not busy,

702
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,520
give my regards to Mr. Mei?

703
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,400
Okay.

704
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,120
Okay, okay, okay.

705
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,000
I won't trouble you anymore.

706
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,600
See you.

707
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,640
It's okay, I will see myself out.

708
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,680
Professor,

709
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,760
is he talking about the legal friend of yours

710
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,960
you mentioned just the other day?

711
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, a famous lawyer.

712
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,960
Powerful people are friends with other powerful people.

713
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,800
That's a hard fact.

714
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,200
He didn't even check who you are?

715
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,960
But it's pointless

716
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,000
because he can't understand.

717
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,240
Let's get to work.

718
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,120
I just heard in the elevator that

719
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,280
your wife is some kind of celebrity.

720
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,040
I mean, this is really

721
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,560
good lenses, bad frames.

722
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,000
I apologize for my lack of respect.

723
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,520
Our laboratory building

724
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,800
has a visitor

725
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,680
registry policy, don't we?

726
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,560
Yeah, we do.

727
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,400
We are a key laboratory.

728
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,560
You think you can come and go as you please?

729
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,120
Who will be responsible if confidential documents are lost?

730
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,480
I am sorry, I am sorry.

731
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,360
I'll be on my way.

732
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,160
I won't take up your time anymore.

733
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,600
I am seriously leaving.

734
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,400
Bye, bye.
