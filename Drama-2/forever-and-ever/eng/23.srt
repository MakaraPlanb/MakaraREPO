[Episode 23]

4
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,120
It's almost time.

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,360
We should go back.

6
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,320
Give me some more time.

7
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
There's no hurry.

8
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,480
I don't know if I'll get to see

9
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,079
this beautiful scenery in the future.

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,240
Don't be silly.

11
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
You're going to Shanghai for treatment.

12
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
When you recover,

13
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
you'll come back.

14
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,560
You should stay in your room.

15
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,120
What are you doing out here?

16
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,480
I wanted to enjoy the sun.

17
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,680
Have you packed her things?

18
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Yes.

19
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,480
I've put them in the car.

20
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,560
It's a long walk from here to the car.

21
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,280
Being in a wheelchair looks sad,

22
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,480
let me carry you.

23
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,040
All right.

24
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,280
Here.

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,600
Hold me tight.

26
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,760
Hold tight now.

27
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,320
Are you not going with me?

28
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,840
No.

29
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,240
Silly, of course I'll go with you.

30
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,159
I've asked them to make a stew,

31
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,920
so you can have it on the way.

32
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,040
I'll go get it. Wait for me.

33
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,280
What's wrong?

34
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,120
Wenxing's illness has suddenly deteriorated.

35
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,640
She transferred to a hospital in Shanghai today.

36
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Which hospital is she in?

37
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,200
The one you were admitted to last time.

38
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,800
Will she undergo surgery?

39
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
She still have to wait for a compatible donor

40
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,680
for a heart transplant.

41
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,320
The earliest time would be next month.

42
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,240
Should we

43
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,480
postpone our wedding?

44
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
She has been asking me

45
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,159
and my mother every day

46
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
if she can see us getting married

47
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,560
before her surgery.

48
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,120
Actually I think

49
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,200
our wedding is just at the right time.

50
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
You don't have to

51
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,440
give yourself too much pressure.

52
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,840
Let's go visit her tomorrow.

53
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,480
Long time no see, bride-to-be.

54
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,080
Please sit down, Mrs. Wang.

55
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,720
Okay.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I heard you became ill.

57
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,520
How are you now?

58
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm fine.

59
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,880
Young Master Zhou

60
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,360
is a bit impatient.

61
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,840
Your wedding is too soon,

62
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
which doesn't leave me

63
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
enough time to work.

64
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,440
That's why

65
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,360
I only have six gowns here,

66
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,720
and they are still initial samples.

67
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,640
I think

68
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
I will have to come back another 3 to 4 times.

69
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,280
Have a look, maybe you'll like one of them.

70
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,360
Next time when you finish the dress,

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,240
just tell us in advance,

72
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
we'll go over to your place.

73
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,000
No need for that.

74
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,040
You just recovered and should take care.

75
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,400
And since Wenxing

76
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,720
is in a hospital in Shanghai,

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,080
I get to see you both

78
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,000
when I come here.

79
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
Did Wang Man come today?

80
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
She's in Shanghai,

81
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,840
but

82
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,080
she's pregnant and needs to rest.

83
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,840
Mrs. Wang, have a cup of water.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,920
Thank you.

85
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,120
You two newly-weds must have a lot to talk about

86
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,040
when she tries out the gowns.

87
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,840
I'll give you guys some space then.

88
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Let me help you.

89
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
All right.

90
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,000
Have a look at them.

91
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,760
Wang Man is pregnant.

92
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Who's the father?

93
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Zhou Wenchuan.

94
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,640
I don't know much about

95
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,200
what happened

96
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,320
between Tong Jiaren and Zhou Wenchuan.

97
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
Try on the dresses first.

98
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,920
Grandmother.

99
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,960
Have some water.

100
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,120
Thank you.

101
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,520
Mr. Wang.

102
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,160
Thank you.

103
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,000
You'll feel sad

104
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,080
staying in the room all day.

105
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,159
You should go out more often.

106
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,960
OK, Grandmother.

107
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,800
I'll go downstairs and take a walk after meal.

108
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,160
Good.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,800
Wenxing,

110
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
I brought something for you.

111
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,440
Sweet green rice balls.

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,200
I've been craving for them these days.

113
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,600
Have a taste.

114
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,400
How is it?

115
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,960
It's good!

116
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,320
That person you spoke about,

117
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,080
when is his birthday?

118
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Are you almost done?

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,800
I've kept my regular customers waiting

120
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,320
to make yours first.

121
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,760
He was born in November, a Scorpio.

122
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,720
November.

123
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,760
Doctor Lin said we still have to wait.

124
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
I didn't see you just now,

125
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,720
I thought you didn't come today.

126
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,880
I went to meet the doctor.

127
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,520
Wenxing said she wanted to walk Mrs. Wang out

128
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,320
and catch some sunshine.

129
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,120
That should be fine, right?

130
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,280
That's fine.

131
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,080
You guys don't come often,

132
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
go spend time with her.

133
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
There are still a few reports not out yet.

134
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,800
I'll go ask.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,400
All right.

136
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,280
Let's go.

137
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah.

138
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,000
My birthday is in lunar September.

139
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,480
That's soon.

140
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,840
I hope I can have my surgery done

141
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,920
before that.

142
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,920
Even better if I can make it home before that.

143
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,720
You will.

144
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,120
Lunar September

145
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,120
is the month of chrysanthemum, right?

146
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
The alternative names of September and December

147
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,240
are the easiest to remember.

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,120
One is when chrysanthemums bloom,

149
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,360
called the month of chrysanthemum.

150
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,360
The other is when everything is covered in ice and snow,

151
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,680
called the month of ice.

152
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,600
When I was little,

153
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,080
I was forced to remember these.

154
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,880
But now I've forgot all of them.

155
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
You don't have to use them,

156
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,040
it doesn't matter.

157
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,480
But Mei Xing likes these things.

158
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,240
The sentence you wrote about his secondary name,

159
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,920
he remembers it even until now.

160
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,240
When willow drops its leaves and the lotus fades, the plum is still blossoming.

161
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
He's in his thirties already,

162
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,040
but still single,

163
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,040
would he be single

164
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,280
for the rest of his life?

165
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,000
Chen,

166
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,400
how many girlfriends do you think he's had?

167
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
I've never asked him about that,

168
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,520
how should I know?

169
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,400
Liar.

170
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,960
Your wedding

171
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
has to be big.

172
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,720
I will definitely attend it.

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,120
Definitely.

174
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,000
Take care of yourself first.

175
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,240
When your test report is good,

176
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,640
take the surgery immediately.

177
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,320
It's all right to take the surgery later.

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
What if my favorite guy

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,680
is not you any more

180
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
after I get a

181
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,440
new heart?

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
I don't care about that.

183
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
All I care about is your health.

184
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,440
Shi Yi,

185
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,240
how do you stand him?

186
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,120
He's abnormally rational.

187
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,200
What can I do? I have to accept that.

188
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,120
Wenxing likes Mei Xing?

189
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,480
I can tell.

190
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,880
You can tell?

191
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,160
It's actually the most difficult

192
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,600
to hide your feelings for someone.

193
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,720
You can easily tell

194
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,160
who a girl has feelings for.

195
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,240
Through her

196
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,840
gaze, behavior,

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,760
and the way she speaks.

198
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,040
So in the past, when a girl likes you,

199
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,240
you just ignored them?

200
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,600
I rejected all of them.

201
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,560
Every single one.

202
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,360
Does Mei Xing like Wenxing?

203
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,960
I don't know.

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,720
You don't know?

205
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,160
We've

206
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
never talked about this.

207
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,040
Wenxing is your sister,

208
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,280
you should care for her at least.

209
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,160
The most difficult thing in life

210
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,480
is when both party have feelings for each other.

211
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,440
That wasn't like something

212
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,040
you would say.

213
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,800
Mei Xing said that.

214
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
All right. Try it again.

215
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,360
Is it still crooked?

216
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,160
No.

217
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,160
Then

218
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,400
what shall we do next?

219
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,200
What do you want to do?

220
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,040
I want...

221
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
I'm hungry.

222
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,720
Then let's go out and eat.

223
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,120
Go out?

224
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,320
The weather report said

225
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,800
it would rain this evening.

226
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,120
The rain and us having food does not oppose each other.

227
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,440
Yes, my hubby is always right.

228
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,240
Let's tidy this up.

229
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,800
You scared me.

230
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Why aren't you asleep?

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,880
I couldn't sleep, so I'm watching a movie.

232
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
Horror movies are not for you.

233
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,080
Have you taken your medicine?

234
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,320
Try to sleep then.

235
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,720
You stink of alcohol.

236
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,120
Wait.

237
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,480
It's cold outside.

238
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,800
Don't you feel cold wearing that?

239
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,280
No.

240
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
It's be around ten degrees these couple of days.

241
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,240
This will be just right.

242
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,400
I don't wear suits to the institute.

243
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,520
Why?

244
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,880
It's too formal.

245
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,040
But I think

246
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,760
you look good in suits.

247
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:57,620
[Stay Simple and Humble]

248
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,880
Oh yes, my mother asked me

249
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,400
the exact date of our wedding.

250
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
She wanted to inform our relatives.

251
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
I told her we hadn't decided yet.

252
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,680
But we have.

253
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,040
I thought about it all night,

254
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,920
and I still think that

255
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,440
we should postpone our wedding until Wenxing's surgery has been done.

256
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,680
Before that

257
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,359
you will be

258
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
worried about Wenxing,

259
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,400
and so will I.

260
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,960
It just doesn't feel right.

261
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm also not in the mood

262
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,240
to decide on the wedding dishes

263
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,720
or send out invitations.

264
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,119
Come on, listen to your wife.

265
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,440
Okay.

266
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,359
Uncle Lin is picking you up?

267
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,440
He's already downstairs.

268
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,319
Off you go.

269
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,720
Bye.

270
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,440
See you.

271
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,280
I really want to get married to him.

272
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,280
With Du Feng?

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,880
Who else?

274
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,080
How far have you two gone?

275
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,680
Isn't it too early to talk about marriage?

276
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,640
Well, someone here got engaged

277
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,920
before she kissed him.

278
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm different.

279
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,560
At least we've chated via email for half a year.

280
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
What made you

281
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,760
want to marry him?

282
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,280
What is it...?

283
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,560
He has good personality.

284
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,880
I'm sure it's not superficial.

285
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,720
I can feel that.

286
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
Unlike your scientist.

287
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Your scientist

288
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,240
seems rather unworldly.

289
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,240
He feels too distant.

290
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,200
Really?

291
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Using the term "unworldly"

292
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
to describe a man,

293
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
seems kind of weird.

294
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,720
Anyway, it's like

295
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,960
he doesn't really care about

296
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
anything.

297
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,600
Are you guys

298
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,200
a good fit for each other?

299
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,480
Very good?

300
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,240
Or not at all?

301
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Let's talk about something else.

302
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,720
Why avoid this?

303
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,840
A few days apart

304
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,280
and you aren't telling me anything.

305
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,480
You don't understand.

306
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,600
To me,

307
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,440
even he's just there at home

308
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,040
or in the study,

309
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,400
I'm happy

310
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,920
just looking at him

311
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,120
by his side.

312
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,840
No, I don't even have to look at him,

313
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,960
just thinking that he's mine

314
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,920
makes me happy.

315
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,400
Fine.

316
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,400
Is it good?

317
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,920
Enjoy your meal.

318
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,000
I need to head out.

319
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,920
Where are you going?

320
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,440
A business meal.

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,960
You said you were here in Shanghai to accompany me,

322
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,840
actually you are here for my brother,

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,360
to help him with his great manufacturing industry dream.

324
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
I'll come back as early as I can,

325
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,280
okay?

326
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,600
How early will that be?

327
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,680
Eleven.

328
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,360
Before eleven.

329
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,680
Wait,

330
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,400
this is for you.

331
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,240
What is it?

332
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,120
Poison.

333
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
Poison? You want to poison me?

334
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,640
Hangover medicine.

335
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,240
So you won't feel that bad

336
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,520
after drinking.

337
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,160
Half past ten.

338
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,880
Give me a second.

339
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,480
I'll give you something else.

340
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,000
All right, all right.

341
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,640
I'll be back by ten.

342
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,280
I'll be back ten sharp.

343
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,160
I'm heading off.

344
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,360
Hurry up and finish your meal.

345
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,640
Mr. Mei.

346
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,280
Mr. Mei treats you

347
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,960
differently now.

348
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,920
He treats me as his own sister.

349
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,040
Of course it'll be different.

350
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,280
Actually family relationship is better.

351
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,160
You can never give up on your family.

352
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,880
But love is way weaker.

353
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,840
I've always been eating alone

354
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,280
since I got admitted.

355
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,160
Will you eat with me today?

356
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,320
The food was prepared for you,

357
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,760
I shouldn't eat it.

358
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,400
You dislike me.

359
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,680
You little heartless brat,

360
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm doing what's best for you.

361
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,080
Fine, I'll eat with you.

362
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,120
Wait for me,

363
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,600
I'll go get a pair of chopsticks from the nurses.

364
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,600
You guys came.

365
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,320
What's Wenxing doing?

366
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,680
She's having dinner.

367
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,120
I want to talk to her alone.

368
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,800
Go find somewhere to sit with Song.

369
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,680
She's pregnant, so she can't stand for a long time.

370
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,440
All right.

371
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,160
She hasn't eat much.

372
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,960
Try to get her to eat

373
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,120
when you talk to her.

374
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,040
These are ice cream moon cakes.

375
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,280
Remember to put them in a fridge.

376
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,080
Thanks.

377
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,280
How are you? Any better today?

378
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,680
Yes, I feel better.

379
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,800
I brought your favorite

380
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,400
claypot rice.

381
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,360
I was just saying

382
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,640
that I had been eating alone.

383
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,040
Now you're here.

384
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,680
Here.

385
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,320
Here you go.

386
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,520
Has Shi Yi moved out?

387
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,200
She's watching TV.

388
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,480
Yanyan.

389
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
You had the strings changed?

390
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,560
Let me take a look.

391
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,800
Thank you.

392
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,840
The strings are a bit too loose.

393
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,920
I'll change them tomorrow.

394
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,480
You spoiled brat.

395
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,280
Remember the brand

396
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,440
you're used to

397
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
and keep using that.

398
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,240
Leave the Guzheng here.

399
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,680
I'll find some time to tune it for you tonight.

400
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,440
Great.

401
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,600
What's his name?

402
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,920
Zhousheng Chen.

403
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,200
Are you guys

404
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,280
in a relationship?

405
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,880
Yes.

406
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,040
I'll give you some wedding candies when we get married.

407
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,240
Thank you, honey.

408
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
I didn't expect

409
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,880
you could play so well.

410
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,280
Was it good?

411
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,880
Very.

412
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,000
Very good?

413
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,000
Very good.

414
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
Next time I'll bring my Guzheng from home

415
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,920
and play something for you.

416
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,320
Okay.

417
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,360
Hello?

418
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,680
Chen.

419
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,480
Wenchuan.

420
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,200
We're at a hospital,

421
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,240
calm down.

422
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,160
You better pray

423
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,160
nothing bad happens to Wenxing!

424
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,920
Why did you hit him?

425
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,680
You should ask him that question!

426
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,960
Let's go.

427
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
Here are the true results.

428
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,360
Data which have not been altered.

429
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,120
If not for this,

430
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,200
she could have had her surgery the night before.

431
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,960
Also,

432
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,000
your younger brother came in the evening

433
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,200
and had a big fight with Wenxing

434
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,400
in her room!

435
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,280
He must have lost his mind!

436
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,120
How can he disregard

437
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,880
the patient's welfare!

438
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,840
Doctor Lin.

439
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,640
How's Wenxing?

440
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,600
Not good.

441
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,000
Something happened just now.

442
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,280
I've already called the police.

443
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,440
The police?

444
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,400
What happened?

445
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,040
You should ask Wenchuan that.

446
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,400
Madam, the police are here

447
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,360
to take Wenchuan's statement.

448
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,080
Chen, you should go check.

449
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,160
He's ill-tempered,

450
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,560
he can't handle it.

451
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,720
He should handle this himself.

452
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,000
He's your younger brother.

453
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,880
I only have one sister.

454
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,400
And she's in there

455
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,680
fighting for her life!

456
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Let's go.

457
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,640
What had happened?

458
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,640
Wenxing's pre-op tests were not good enough

459
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
because Zhou Wenchuan altered the data.

460
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,520
Who told you that?

461
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
Doctor Lin.

462
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,160
He's Wenxing's

463
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
primary doctor,

464
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,640
so he knows Wenxing's condition

465
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
better than anyone else.

466
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,040
He had a feeling that there was something wrong.

467
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,760
So he redid the tests,

468
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,880
and found out

469
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,720
that the data was altered.

470
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,680
Why?

471
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,400
Doesn't Wenchuan know that

472
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,800
she needs the surgery as soon as possible?

473
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,280
He wanted everyone

474
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,760
to focus on

475
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,520
Wenxing's surgery,

476
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,360
so that he could cover up

477
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,680
the problems in his accounts.

478
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,080
Regarding the mismatch

479
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
in these company accounts,

480
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,760
go back and check again.

481
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
You can go now.

482
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,640
Okay.

483
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:35,500
[Zhousheng Chen]

484
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,720
Coming.

485
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,680
Come in.

486
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,040
You guys talk.

487
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,520
I'll leave you guys alone.

488
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,560
What happened?

489
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,000
I got a little bit emotional.

491
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,880
It's late.

492
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,280
You two should rest.

493
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,600
I need a bath.

494
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,120
I'll put your clothes here.

495
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,720
Let me wash your hair, okay?

496
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,320
I know you are sad.

497
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,960
I just don't know

498
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,080
how to comfort you.

499
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,320
Shi Yi,

500
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,600
will you give me a hug?

501
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,040
Sure.

502
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,000
Wenxing will be fine.

503
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,360
She'll be all right.

504
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,640
Don't be too worried.

505
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,040
It breaks my heart

506
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,440
to see you like this.

507
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,160
Zhousheng Chen,

508
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,200
I love you.

509
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,000
I love you, too.

510
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,080
You're here.

511
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,520
You didn't sleep last night?

512
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,440
Wenxing

513
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,440
is not doing well.

514
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,520
You should see her.

515
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,440
Sorry for what happened last night.

516
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,000
I broke your tea cup.

517
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,880
It's okay. It's just a tea cup.

518
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,440
Mei Xing,

519
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,880
I don't know

520
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
if I should say this

521
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,920
now.

522
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,440
Wenxing...

523
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,480
Don't worry.

524
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,400
After her surgery,

525
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,440
I'll take her away

526
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,640
from the Zhou family

527
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,760
and take good care of her.

528
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,560
She will get well quicker

529
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,960
if she knows you said that.

530
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,200
But I have to help Zhousheng Chen

531
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,440
accomplish what he wants to do.

532
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,040
Maybe I had

533
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,400
owed him something in the previous life.

534
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,160
That's why I need to follow him

535
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,240
no matter what.

536
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,320
The previous life...

537
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,320
There were a lot who owed him in the previous life.

538
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,320
Everyone around him

539
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,720
would give their hearts to him.

540
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,600
Shi Yi,

541
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,760
about the tune names before...

542
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,000
I know.

543
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,200
Don't get me wrong,

544
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,960
I just want to say that

545
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,240
I've already

546
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,280
let it go.
