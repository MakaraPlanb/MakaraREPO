00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,330
Shi Yi.

5
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,820
About the tune name before...

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,100
I know.

7
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,460
Don't take me wrong.

8
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,990
I just want to say that

9
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,200
I've already

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,300
let it go.

11
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,840
Wenxing

12
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,710
wants to talk to you guys.

13
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,720
Go ahead.

14
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,270
Shi Yi.

15
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,630
Mei Xing has my phone.

16
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,800
There's a recording in it.

17
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,460
Go out and listen to it.

18
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,230
I want to talk to Mei Xing

19
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,020
alone.

20
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,060
Okay.

21
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,740
Shi Yi,

22
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,950
I'm sorry.

23
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm a selfish person.

24
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,980
If I'm going to die,

25
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,340
I will definitely

26
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,659
give my remaining time

27
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,860
to Mei Xing.

28
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,250
I have to remember him

29
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,600
so that I can find him in my next life.

30
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,620
That's why I've prepared this recording

31
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,659
a long time ago

32
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,690
for you.

33
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,680
About this recording,

34
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,970
I don't know where to start.

35
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,659
I grew up in Mei Xing's house

36
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,020
and the hospital.

37
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,170
I didn't know my family very well.

38
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,460
The only people who treated me well

39
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,850
were the two of my elder brothers.

40
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,740
Of course,

41
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,300
the one who treated me the best is Chen.

42
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,180
But since I was young, I've had a feeling that

43
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,140
Mom didn't like Chen.

44
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,420
When I grew older,

45
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,220
I learned a secret.

46
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,580
But I won't tell you

47
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,180
this secret.

48
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,820
I feel that

49
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,340
everyone who knows about this secret

50
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,940
would have bad luck.

51
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,260
Me, for example.

52
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,500
My second brother, too.

53
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,340
I seem to be

54
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,300
talking nonsense again.

55
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,460
Shi Yi.

56
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,300
I actually want to

57
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
apologize to you.

58
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,980
I'm very, very sorry.

59
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,659
Don't be afraid.

60
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,100
I'm here. It's okay.

61
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,300
I will always be with you.

62
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,860
After I'm gone,

63
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,980
you have to take care of yourself.

64
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,420
Don't drink that much anymore.

65
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,700
No one will be there to nag you anymore.

66
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,380
If you have to drink because of business,

67
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,460
then fill this with hangover medicine.

68
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,780
Don't cry.

69
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
I'll feel even worse

70
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,180
seeing you cry.

71
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,100
Okay.

72
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,420
I won't cry. Why should I cry?

73
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,060
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

74
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,020
Then get some sleep.

75
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,860
I'll stay here with you.

76
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,620
Okay?

77
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,260
Good girl.

78
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,390
We all know about Bremen.

79
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,430
But we all chose to keep quiet.

80
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,540
Only Ren and my second uncle had an argument.

81
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,660
Later on,

82
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,610
Ren went to Wuzhen for you.

83
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,940
You know Ren is very special

84
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,020
in our family.

85
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,110
As long as he is by your side,

86
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,700
no one would dare to

87
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,460
do something bad to you.

88
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,170
I know

89
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,060
I can't compare myself to Ren.

90
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,820
Later, you came to live with us.

91
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,150
I came back to see the doctor.

92
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,630
And then you fell into the water.

93
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,290
These were not accidents.

94
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,820
I don't know how much you can figure out,

95
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,020
or what intentions

96
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,060
the person who set this up had in mind.

97
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,060
Shi Yi.

98
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,860
I wish you could figure it out.

99
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,140
So that

100
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
I can feel less guilty.

101
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,140
Only me and Mei Xing

102
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,620
can get Chen's

103
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,340
unconditional trust, right?

104
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,860
You're so smart.

105
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,380
You should be able

106
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,220
to guess who it is,

107
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,780
right?

108
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,340
I didn't mean to hurt you.

109
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,620
But I did hurt you.

110
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,300
I caused you to fall into the water.

111
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,860
I tried to save you

112
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,940
and put myself in danger too.

113
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,980
I wanted to use this method

114
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,060
to hurt the two people my eldest brother

115
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,970
cared most.

116
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,860
So that he would be scared of losing you.

117
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,980
And be scared of involving me.

118
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,980
So he would give up on this family

119
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,460
and bring you away.

120
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Shi Yi.

121
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,620
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,060
I'm a selfish person.

123
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,900
At the most critical moment,

124
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,860
I could only take care of my own family.

125
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,180
I didn't want to see a bitter fight

126
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,620
between my two brothers.

127
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,340
That's why

128
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,120
I am the person

129
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,520
that caused all this.

130
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,480
If there is another life,

132
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
I will definitely make it up to you.

133
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,560
When you were little,

134
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,720
you sat on my lap.

135
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,720
Just like this.

136
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,140
You liked to put your face close to mine.

137
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,000
If I wanted to put you down,

138
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,840
you would immediately cross your arms and say

139
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,200
"Don't let go! Don't let go!"

140
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,320
If I let you go, you would be unhappy.

141
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,200
If you were unhappy, I would feel sad.

142
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,880
I...

143
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,720
I don't blame you.

144
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I don't blame you.

145
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,720
I don't blame you.

146
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,080
Chen!

147
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,040
Chen, stop it!

148
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,920
Stop fighting! Chen, stop it!

149
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Wenchuan! Wenchuan!

150
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,120
Please, stop fighting!

151
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
Stop it!

152
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,280
He didn't want this to happen either!

153
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,520
He's Wenxing's biological brother.

154
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,480
Are you okay?

155
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,080
If you kill him,

156
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,480
how am I going to live?

157
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,920
I just lost a daughter.

158
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,880
Man!

159
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,200
Man, what happened to you?

160
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,880
Quick, call a doctor!

161
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,160
Call a doctor! Call a doctor!

162
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,480
Doctor!

163
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,520
Doctor!

164
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,910
Doctor! Doctor!

165
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,750
Ever since she was born,

166
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,120
I've always wanted to trade my life

167
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,600
for her health.

168
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,640
Why?

169
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,360
Why did she

170
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,080
have to suffer so much?

171
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
His sister just passed away.

172
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,720
For now, he'll probably

173
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
have a hard time accepting this.

174
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,640
Don't get upset.

175
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,440
He needs your support.

176
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,920
Cheer up.

177
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,880
Be strong.

178
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,880
His family is hiding a lot of things

179
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,640
from him.

180
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,780
I can't say anything even if I know about it.

181
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,160
What is it?

182
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,600
It's okay. It's in the past now.

183
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,040
Oh, right.

184
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,920
What exactly does

185
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,080
Du Feng do?

186
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,420
I remember you told me

187
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,220
he's a civil servant.

188
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,240
Yes, that's right.

189
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,920
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

190
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Mr. Zhousheng,

191
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,360
there's something

192
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,720
I'd like to talk to you about in private.

00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,560
she had suffered these couple of days?

378
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,930
This is my fault.

379
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,920
If you beat me to death,

380
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,280
I will accept it.

381
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,490
I know.

382
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,280
Wenxing is gone.

383
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,240
You're just as sad as Mom.

384
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,840
Right?

385
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,560
Dad.

386
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,910
Even on her deathbed,

387
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,640
Wenxing did not call you Dad.

388
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
Do you feel sorry?

389
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,520
You taught me to read, write

390
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,440
and walk when I was little.

391
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,520
You taught me how to use chopsticks.

392
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,360
Ren

393
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,480
is not your only son.

394
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,680
Would you please defend me?

395
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
I don't want to stay in this ancestral temple.

396
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,560
No helmsman

397
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,160
can do whatever he wants

398
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,920
on a big boat.

399
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,840
The Zhou family is not mine.

400
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,840
It's also not your mother's.

401
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,320
The Zhou family belongs to everyone.

402
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,240
Now that you've made a mistake,

403
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,120
you deserve the punishment!

404
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,870
No one can protect you!

405
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,860
I don't want to be like my fourth great-uncle

406
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,510
and live here forever!

407
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,140
What about your sister?

408
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,440
Did she want to die at such a tender age?

409
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,420
[Spirit Tablet of Deceased Daughter Zhou Wenxing]

410
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,380
[Honesty and Tolerance Shall Be Passed On]

411
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,670
This is your only way out of this mess.
