00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:07,700
♫There's no way it'd end♫

192
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,040
♫May there be a right time and a right place♫

193
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,520
♫For the ones in love to hug each other♫

194
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,480
♫How can I let go♫

195
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,920
♫When all my expectations are lost♫

196
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,940
♫If the fate had been kind to me♫

197
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,080
♫If I'd had enough time♫

198
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,800
♫Would I have been able♫

199
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:59,440
♫To hold on to my love♫

200
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,250
♫How am I supposed to live without you♫

201
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,580
♫How can I fall in love again after the farewell♫

202
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,360
Wenchuan,

203
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,520
what are you doing staying up this late?

204
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:20,080
♫The impulse and courage we once had have gone with wind♫

205
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,360
I'm not sleepy.

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,280
Fourth Great-uncle, please go to sleep first.

207
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,560
I'll go to bed soon.

208
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,850
♫The smile I remember♫

209
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,700
♫Has become a pain that never goes away♫

210
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,240
These are all the keys

211
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,760
to the Zhou's mansion.

212
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,280
Give them to Shi Yi.

213
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
I have only one request.

214
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,640
Treat your younger brother well.

215
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
I want

216
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,760
to have a talk with you tonight.

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
Grandma is asleep?

218
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,320
I want to ask for an official

219
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,040
wedding gift from you.

220
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,840
What gift?

221
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,120
The library.

222
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,560
To be specific,

223
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,400
it's a wall in the library.

224
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,240
Could you ask them

225
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,400
to prepare an ink brush and some ink for me?

226
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,360
I don't need Xuan Paper.

227
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,440
Great-uncle...

228
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,440
Liansui.

229
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,130
Please ask Lin Fei to prepare ink brush and ink

230
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,560
and take them to the library.

231
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,280
The library?

232
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,680
Are you going there to admire the moon?

233
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,820
I'll prepare some snacks for you!

234
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,870
It's not necessary.

235
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,980
Then what's the point of making that many?

236
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,340
I'll prepare some for you guys, anyway!

237
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,040
Lin,

238
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,280
I've had them

239
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,680
mow the lawn.

240
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,080
It looks much nicer, doesn't it?

241
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
You've been of great help

242
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,160
to the Zhous since you came.

243
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm flattered.

244
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,040
Are you two taking a walk after your meal?

245
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,319
We are.

246
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
Where are you going?

247
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,520
What's this for?

248
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,720
Take a guess.

249
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,520
What's that?

250
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,000
Ink.

251
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,040
Ink?

252
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,280
What do you need that for?

253
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
It will be hard to clean

254
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,000
if it stains the floor.

255
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,520
Someone asked us

256
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
to prepare it

257
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,120
so that he could please his wife.

258
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,960
Just leave it be.

259
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,920
The entire residence will be theirs in the future.

260
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,440
It's not our business even if they want

261
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
to tear the house down.

262
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,120
See you!

263
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,400
Be careful.

264
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,780
Okay.

265
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
Careful. Don't spill it.

266
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,320
Young people

267
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
don't listen to us, anyway.

268
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah.

269
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
Cook a few more dishes

270
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,080
for dinner tonight.

271
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,360
Let's have a drink.

272
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Why do I

273
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,040
have to cook?

274
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,800
I don't know how to cook.

275
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
I would do it if I knew.

276
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,520
So, all you can do is eat, huh?

277
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Fine. Let's go.

278
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,120
You've had an idea about what to write?

279
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,680
The library is over 100 years old.

280
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,800
You are the first person who's ever

281
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,360
wanted to write something on the wall.

282
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,000
Will you sit there and keep me company?

283
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,120
Sure.

284
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,580
[Fu]

285
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:15,300
[Fu]

286
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,460
[Fu on the]

287
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,180
[Fu on the Imperial Park]

288
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,240
Are you tired?

289
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,760
Do you want some water?

290
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,200
No. I'm good.

291
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,260
[Fu on the Imperial Park]

292
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,200
You don't remember the next line?

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,120
The next line is "Beauty and soul are given,"

294
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
"the heart is overturned."

295
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,000
Seriously. That is the next line.

296
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,800
I know.

297
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,960
Then why don't you write it?

298
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,120
My hand is sore.

299
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,040
Is this the reason why you once asked me

300
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,480
at the Azure Dragon Temple

301
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,120
if I've seen an old-fashioned library?

302
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,040
Of course not.

303
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,600
Back then,

304
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,400
I thought you were just a researcher.

305
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,800
You were right.

306
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,200
I am just a researcher.

307
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,240
Writing on the wall

308
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,480
is so different

309
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,760
from writing on the paper.

310
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,200
I can't afford to make any mistakes.

311
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,320
With paper, at least I can change it and rewrite it.

312
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,680
With a piece of wall, though,

313
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,000
I can't just rebuild a wall.

314
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,280
I was even sweating.

315
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,560
So, you are going to stop for today?

316
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,280
I'll finish it some other time.

317
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,880
Would you like me

318
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,080
to walk you back?

319
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,800
I still have something

320
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,640
to discuss with my mother.

321
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,520
Let's go.

322
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:24,300
[Fu on the Imperial Park]

323
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,200
Uncle Mei, I'll go in first.

324
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,740
We've got many important guests.

325
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,800
It'll be improper if you and Shi Yi

326
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,820
don't go and greet them.

327
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,870
You can take care of it all by yourself.

328
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,270
I've faced them for over 20 years.

329
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,610
Of course I can handle it well.

330
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,200
But are you going

331
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,520
to hide Shi Yi forever?

332
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,920
Sure, I can still do it for a few more years.

333
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,160
But one day I'll be too old to do it.

334
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,920
What are you

335
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,360
gonna do then?

336
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,600
You must

337
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,000
have something important

338
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,990
to talk to me.

339
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,400
The police

340
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,720
went to Mei Xing today and asked him

341
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,260
to assist with investigating Zhou Wenchuan.

342
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,970
About what happened to Wenxing?

343
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,740
It's not about the hospital.

344
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,540
It's about Zhou Wenchuan's

345
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
illegal fundraising and smuggling.

346
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,240
Uncle Mei is outside right now.

347
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,480
He wants to see you.

348
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,440
He said he had been

349
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,860
a close friend to you and my father

350
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,800
for years.

351
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,960
Considering this friendship,

352
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,560
he's willing to represent

353
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,400
Zhou Wenchuan.

354
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,080
However,

355
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,600
on one condition.

356
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,680
Mother,

357
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,630
you need to convince Zhou Wenchuan to turn himself in.

358
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,640
Let me think about this.

359
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,120
Well?

360
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,800
She needs time to think about it.

361
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,640
From the suspicion of Wenchuan and Wenxing's births,

362
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,360
to your father's death

363
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,200
and the death of Ren's mother,

364
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,120
she managed to go

365
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,040
through every major incident.

366
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,040
This isn't something an ordinary person can do.

367
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,400
You go back.

368
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,160
You shouldn't get involved

369
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,840
in something like this.

370
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,400
I'll stay here.

371
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,880
I will talk to her

372
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,360
after she calms down.

373
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,840
Thank you, Uncle Mei.

374
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,290
Second uncle.

375
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,140
Song, what did she say?

376
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,870
She said

377
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,160

Mark my territory? You think I'm a bandit?

566
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:09,220
♫I wake up from my dreams and I'm even colder♫

567
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,960
If I were a bandit,

568
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,680
I'd make you my wife!

569
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,340
♫My heart that can't stand being away from love♫

570
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,360
I don't mind.

571
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,200
As long as you build

572
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,680
♫Hides nothing from you♫

573
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,920
a lab on the mountain for me.

574
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,790
♫The scene I look down for♫

575
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,830
♫Gets clear after saying goodbye♫

576
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,450
♫Every glimpse means missing you♫

577
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:33,600
♫Even if to be a stranger to you♫

578
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,000
What are you doing?

579
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,680
I'm taking advantage of you.

580
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,760
Today you really...

581
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Love you even more!
