it's going to rain tonight.

380
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,200
The rain and us having food don't oppose each other.

381
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,170
♫Drives away the weariness of the past♫

382
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,400
Yes, my hubby is always right.

383
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,980
♫Love spreads♫

384
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,130
I don't wear suits in the institute.

385
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,880
♫I'm glad you're here♫

386
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,300
Why not?

387
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,570
It's too formal.

388
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,270
♫One more day with you♫

389
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,960
But I think

390
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,590
you look the best in a suit!

391
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,450
♫Love gets deeper♫

392
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,550

♫The day we met♫

403
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,970

Surprise! Welcome to our new home!

406
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,830
♫That made the hustle and bustle of the world gone♫

407

♫Drives away the weariness of the past♫

410
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,800
I usually come home later than you do.

411
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,520
When you are alone,

412
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,400
if you are afraid of the dark,

413
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,660
♫Love spreads♫

414
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,480
you can turn this on.

415
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,960
It's a night light I specially bought for you.

416
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,660
♫I'm glad you're here♫

417
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,960
Have I ever said I was afraid of the dark?

00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,100
♫One more day with you♫

419
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,720

I need you to be strong.

438
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,680
I'll make it up to you in the next life.

439

440
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,770

451

Mrs. Shi left them to me.

452
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,800
She told me they were your pets.

453
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,080
But I don't know how to take care of them.

454
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,460
I'm sorry two of them are dead.

455
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,390
The other two are still alive.

456
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,000
Give it here.

457
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,480
Let me help you.

458
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,030
How did you get hurt?

459
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,640
I accidentally fell

460
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,220
when I took a walk.

461
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,760
Where's Shi Yi?

462
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,000
She's not home?

463
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,560
Shi Yi has some work to do.

464
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,040
She'll be back

465
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,680
in a couple of days.

466
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,120
You are hurt.

467
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,680
Take a good rest.

468
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm leaving.
