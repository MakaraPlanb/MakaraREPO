Professor Zhousheng.

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,039
Thank goodness for your attorney friend,

or else

7
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
our efforts would have been in vain.

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Yeah.

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
These are some dishes we ordered for you.

10
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,320
Thank you.

11
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,160
We should be the ones to say that.

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

13
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,560
We have ordered afternoon tea as well.

14
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,360
It's our treat.

15
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,360
There's no need for that.

16
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,480
It's okay, we have already placed the order.

17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
We will leave you to it.

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,600
Take your time. See you.
-We have to go now.

19
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,560
Bye, Professor.

20
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,320
Bye.

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,960
The lab in Xi'an

22
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,320
is almost done.

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,000
You two have no problem

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,200
going there first, right?

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,480
No problem at all.

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,800
Same here.

27
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,040
I'll be fine as long as I visit my parents

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
on Mid-Autumn Festival and have dinner with them.

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,720
Okay.

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
By the way, Professor.

31

while you'll work in Xi'an.

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
How are you going to maintain your relationship?

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,960
Our relationship

35
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,360
does not require deliberate maintenance.

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,560
That may be the now.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,520
What about in the future?

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
Living apart for long periods

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,640
would definitely cause problems.

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,520
What if...

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm just saying, what if

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
a very attractive admirer shows up?

43
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,200
What would you do?

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
Yeah, what would you do?

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,680
Her admirers

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
seem to have never stopped appearing.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,120
Are you not jealous?

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,720
It's doesn't feel good,

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,720
but it's not a big problem.

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,800
You should at least

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,800
try to solve the problem.

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,000
She never gave

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
any of them a chance.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,240
To be honest, Professor.

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
This is my very first time

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040

57
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,120

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Respect.

59

My wife

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,600
is flawless in every aspect.

61
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
So it's natural

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480
she has numerous admirers.

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,520
For something that's natural,

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,960
it is best

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,280
to cope with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,040

Especially someone who studies Venus.

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,960

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,279

He is an astrophysicist.

124

that you are an astrochemist.

126

He doesn't want to let his students down.

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,440
So he asked me to ask you

128

if you can fill the role.

No need to get ready.

151
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
I can still remember the

152
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,800
content of my lecture.

153
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,440

in my computer as well.

Wait for me then.

156
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
I will go get ready.

157
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,840
I'll head up then.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
You go park the car.

159
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,220
Okay.

160
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,740
Wait.

161
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,060
You can lecture,

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,700
but don't smile too many times.

163
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,820
Why?

164
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
You smile is

165
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
too lovable.

166
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,720
No smiling.

167
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
I usually don't smile

168
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
when I'm with strangers.

169
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,480
Go on then.

See you.

172
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
I don't know, what do you want to eat?

to follow you.

188

That was a rare occasion. I was doing my friend a favor.

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,840
Can I write the name of the drama?

194
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,200
Absolutely.

195
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,720
There is no notice about a big shot coming.

196
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Is it over already?

197
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,720
It shouldn't be.

198
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
At least let us hear the end.

199
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
Miss Shi, you are so talented.

200
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Miss Shi, please sign your name here.

201
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,160
Okay.

202
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,320
Miss Shi, you are amazing.

203
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,960
-Miss Shi, please give me your autograph.
-Thank you.

204
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,720
Miss Shi, me too.

205
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,120
Okay.

206
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,760
Miss Shi, me as well.

207
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,840
Miss Shi, can I have your autograph?

208
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
That's it, everybody.

209
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,080
That's the end of today's lecture.

210
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,120
Thank you.

211
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,600
Professor.

212
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,800
Is there no Q&A session

213
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,120
for today?

214
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
I am sorry.

215
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
Because this is a last-minute lecture.

216
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
So there is

217
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,760
no time reserved for questions.

218
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,640
Besides,

219
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,300
my wife has been waiting for me downstairs

220
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,270
for a long time.

221
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,000
Your wife?

222
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,330
You're a married man, sir?

223
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,520
Getting married at such a young age.

224
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,640
What if you regret it one day?

225
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,280
Yeah.

226
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,960
You should ask

227
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,520
my wife that question

228
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
instead of me.

229
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,520
Because she is way more talented than I am.

230
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,200
I am only an ordinary guy

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,280
that happens to meet a woman

232
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,320
exceeding my expectation

233
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,960
at the right age.

234
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
If I didn't marry her,

235
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
That's so admirable.

237
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Yeah.

238
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Professor, there's no need to answer questions.

239
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Why don't you talk about your love story?

240
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
Exactly, exactly.

241
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,880
Let's talk about that.

242
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,440
All right, from now on,

243
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,400
everyone

244
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
may ask one question

245
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
relevant to today's lecture.

246
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
You may start now.

247
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
Professor, I have a question.

248
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,560
Professor, you said

249
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Venus was rather unpopular

250
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,840
in terms of planetary research.

251
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,640
Then why

252
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,760
did you choose it?

253
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,720
Venus to me,

254
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,990
is the future of earth.

255
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,650
I want to see the future.

256
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,520
What turned a planet

257
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,520
that was once livable,

258
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
with all kinds of species,

259
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,640
into this planet

260
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,000
that has an uncontrolled greenhouse effect.

261
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,120
In fact, by studying Venus,

262
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,320
we better understand

263
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,840
how to protect our own planet.

264
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,280
Of course.

265
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,760
I also wish that human beings, in the future,

266
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,600
could transform Venus

267
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
into our second home.

268
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,240
Professor,

269
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,380
the surface temperature of Venus

270
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,680
can reach up to 500 degrees.

271
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Wouldn't it be too difficult to live there?

272
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,240
Yeah.

273
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,370
Yeah, it is indeed very hard.

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
High levels of radiation and corrosive acid rain

275
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,440
are no doubt

276
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
great challenges.

277
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,960
But our scientists

278
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,440
have never given up.

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
Since last century,

280
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,080
they have proposed

281
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,280
all kinds of solutions.

282
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,360
Such as building a sun shield

283
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,440
above its atmosphere

284
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,480
to improve its environment.

285
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,120
Or, to build a city above the clouds.

286
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,160
It's just that

287
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
implementing these ideas

288
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,640
would be really hard.

289
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,000
But anything is possible.

290
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
As long as we persist

291
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,480
long enough,

292
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
every impossibility

293
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,920
will become something possible.

294
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,760
Like what our ancestors

295
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,920
believed in.

296
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,440
They held the belief

297
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,240
that the sun would never rise from the west

298
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,320
and set in the east.

299
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,120
But if in the future,

300
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,560
our offspring

301
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,120
make it to Venus,

302
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
then they will see,

303
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,280
with their own eyes,

304
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,280
that the sun can come up from the west

305
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,960
and set in the east.

306
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,200
You know what?

307
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,600
You looked pretty cool

308
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,200
just now on the podium.

309
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,120
What?

310
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,960
Am I usually not?

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Today you are exceptionally cool.

312
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,120
So,

313
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
I want to give you something as a reward.

314
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,800
What is it?

315
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,680
Pro...

316
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,960
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello, Professor.

317
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,560
Goodbye, Professor.

318
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,360
Goodbye, Professor.

319
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,880
Let's go to the bigger house

320
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,040
to get two boxes of stuff first.

321
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,160
Let's go.

322
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,390
Go.

323
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,360
How long are we staying at home during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

324
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,660
Three days, I guess.

325
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,200
Then I will pack for four days.

326
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,200
In case you want to live at Grandma's place,

327
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,240
you can have extra clothes for change.

328
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,720
What are you writing?

329
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,080
Our wedding invitation.

330
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,280
I want to practice a little

331
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,400
before

332
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
writing the formal invitations.

333
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,200
Why do you write it yourself?

334
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,080
Do you have enough time?

335
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,960
100 pieces a day.

336
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,560
3000 pieces a month.

337
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,360
I should be able to complete it.

338
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
This is something that happens once in a lifetime.

339
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,640
I want to do everything myself.

340
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Then go ahead.

341
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,940
I will go pack.

342
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,680
Last night,

343
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,240
I think I heard you coughing.

344
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
I will make a

345
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,530
stewed pear for you later.

346
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,320
Okay.

347
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,480
After we come back,

348
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,400
how about going to that house

349
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
and staying there for a couple of days?

350
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,520
Sure.

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,240
How about you wearing this tomorrow?

352
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,120
Sure.

353
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,280
I will iron it for you.

354
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,800
Have some juice. I will iron it myself.

355
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,560
Thank you, Professor Zhousheng.

356
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Let me give you a massage.

357
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
Dear customer,

358
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,320
how does it feel?

359
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,160
Pretty good.

360
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
Just the right amount of strength.

361
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,020
Please give me a five-star review if you like it.

362
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,880
Oh, right.

363
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,000
My mother asked me when will we arrive tomorrow?

364
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,680
Five o'clock sharp.

365
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,440
Okay.

366
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,720
My wife is beautiful, huh?

367
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,240
She used to be the beauty queen of her school.

368
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,000
I still think

369
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,600
my wife is more beautiful.

370
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,920
But no matter how beautiful your wife is,

371
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,520
my wife gave birth to her.

372
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,000
She can't beat my wife.

373
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Isn't there a saying that goes like this,

374
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
the student surpasses the master?

375
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,760
You two college professors

376
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,560
are talking about

377
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
such pointless things.

378
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
Aren't you afraid that your students might laugh at you?

379
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,200
You see.

380
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
When a man compliments his partner,

381
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,080
there is nothing wrong about it.

382
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,040
It's usually the opposite that's bad.

383
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Isn't it?

384
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,920
Yes.

385
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,680
The crabs in the two tanks

386
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,120
love to eat the same food,

387
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,640
but like different fruits.

388
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,680
I'll leave a note here.

389
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,040
All right, I got it.

390
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,690
You have been fiddling with these crabs

391
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,700
the whole night tonight.

392
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,300
[Longevity]

393
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,960
This is a birthday gift we prepared

394
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,920
for Chen's grandmother.

395
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,920
Thank you, Mom.

396
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,880
I'll go to bed.

397
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,770
By the way,

398
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,100
what do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

399
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,120
I will have rice balls and soy bean milk.

400
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,760
He wakes up at 5 am

401
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,800
and eats by himself.

402
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,710
You don't have to prepare anything for him.

403
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,570
Is that appropriate?

404
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,880
It's his first time staying here

405
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,160
and we don't make him breakfast?

406
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,240
It's okay, he won't mind.

407
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,110
Good night.

408
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,120
Look at the current me.

409
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,520
I'm prettier now.

410
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,820
[Eleven]

411
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,400
Why did you

412
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,960
use Eleven

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,040
as a pet name?

414
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,240
My grandmother gave me the name.

415
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,320
She thought the name my father gave me

416
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,320
was too literary.

417
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,600
Aren't all seniors like this?

418
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,960
They all believe that it's

419
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,600
easier to raise a child with a simple name.

420
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,880
Seeing you here

421
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,600
in the room where I grew up in,

422
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,800
feels kind of surreal.

423
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
Why?

424
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,520
I don't know.

425
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
Last time at your grandmother's place,

426
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
I slept with you in the bedroom where you used to live when you were a student.

427
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,240
How did you like it?

428
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,600
That night...

429
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,670
I believe that night,

430
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,960
you were more nervous than me.

431
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,260
As if you weren't nervous.

432
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,360
I was pretty calm.

433
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,840
It's just that...

434
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,400
What?

435
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,040
It's just on that night,

436
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,080
I couldn't sleep.

437
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,320
Because you smelled amazing.

438
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,680
I have never had

439
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,880
perfume

440
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,800
in the room where I sleep.

441
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,600
That's why I couldn't sleep.

442
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,640
Is it?

443
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,440
Yeah.

444
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
Your hair smells great,

445
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,680
also your pajamas.

446
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,520
You rascal.

447
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,000
How about smelling the perfume

448
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,320
once again tonight?

449
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,600
We are at your parent's place.

450
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
It's okay,

451
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,840
as long as I get back before daybreak.

452
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,560
Sure.

453
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,270
Mother, is he not home yet?

454
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,120
I think he went out for breakfast

455
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,200
and hadn't come home yet.

456
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,680
Why don't you go check on him?

457
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,960
Okay, I will check on him.

458
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,520
Checkmate.

459
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,680
Qin.

460
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,720
You lost again?

461
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,680
What a young man!

462
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,640
Mr. Qin

463
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
used to be the best player

464
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,320
in our community.

465
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
How about playing another round?

466
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,160
Okay.

467
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,240
Here.

468
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,680
You are pretty talented,

469
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,240
young man.

470
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,120
To make such a special visit to our staff community,

471
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,360
did you fancy some professor

472
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,520
and hope to learn from him?

473
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,320
Mr. Shi, it must be Mr. Shi.

474
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,560
This kid's been talking about economies

475
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,640
since he sat down.

476
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,440
Mrs. Liu.

477
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,800
Mr. Qin and Mr. Li.

478
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,380
Here you are, Shi Yi.

479
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
You are back, Shi Yi.

480
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,870
My mother thought you had lost your way,

481
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
so she sent me downstairs to look for you.

482
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,760
This is?

483
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,840
Zhousheng Chen, my fiance.

484
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,240
We are about to hold our wedding ceremony.

485
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Where do you work?

486
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
Judging from your age,

487
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,080
you must have just graduated with a PhD.

488
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,800
I graduated very early on.

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,840
I work in a research institute now.

490
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,200
Sounds good.

491
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,440
We're leaving.

492
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,040
Go ahead.

493
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,600
Go, go.

494
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm leaving.

495
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,040
Okay.

496
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,800
Bye.

497
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,040
Okay, here.

498
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,120
Here, here, here, let me challenge you.

499
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,680
Have you had your breakfast?

500
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,200
Yeah.

501
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,240
What did you eat?

502
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,200
McDonalds.

503
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,480
Be specific.

504
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,640
I ate two burgers.

505
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,120
Did you drink milk?

506
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah.

507
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,680
Good.

508
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,080
So, you have been sitting there

509
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,640
since you finished your breakfast?

510
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,480
On my way back,

511
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,880
I heard them talking about economies.

512
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,640
So I sat down and had a chat with them.

513
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,160
They were having fun

514
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,960
and said, how about playing Chinese chess?

515
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,560
So I joined them.

516
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,680
You should go to my father if it's about economies.

517
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,880
That's his profession.

518
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,960
Isn't that so?

519
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,920
You're right.

520
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,640
I thought

521
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,520
if I intentionally guide the conversation,

522
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
they should switch the topic

523
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
to your family

524
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,440
or your father.

525
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,680
They watched you grew up

526
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
and told me a lot of

527
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,400
interesting stories about you.

528
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,720
Seriously, you and your witty tricks.

529
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,240
Let's take the stairs.

530
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,080
When I was a student,

531
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,120
I used to take the stairs.

532
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,520
You should experience it.

533
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,360
Why did you take the stairs?

534
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,400
I didn't like socializing I think.

535
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,600
The elevator is full of our neighbors

536
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,920
every time I go in there.

537
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,000
What I fear the most

538
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,120
was to say hello

539
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,960
to each and every one of them.

540
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,960
So I had to be mentally prepared

541
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,400
from the moment I went into the community,

542
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,480
all the way till I made it to my own home.

543
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,560
Are there no surveillance cameras here?

544
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,680
Nope.

545
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,120
Then it's very dangerous

546
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,280
for you to do this.

547
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,240
What if the light

548
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,400
goes out one day?

549
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,520
Are you not scared?

550
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,320
I think it did go out in the past.

551
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,680
You always look at thing

552
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,880
differently.

553
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,360
I just imagined

554
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,480
what you said just now

555
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,080
and I felt a bit concerned.

556
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,640
Then let me feel touched

557
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,760
for the past me.

558
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,200
I have a secret to tell you.

559
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,840
What is it?

560
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
I used to have a crush on a senior schoolmate.

561
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,600
He was 2 years older than me.

562
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,040
He was also a straight-A student.

563
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,800
Was he a better student than me?

564
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Not really.

565
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,680
One day, I brought him here

566
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,960
and wanted to make things clear.

567
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,080
You took the initiative?

568
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,240
Yeah, you know me.

569
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,560
I am pretty straightforward.

570
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,920
I usually speak my mind.

571
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,080
True. It's also one of your strong points.

572
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,560
Are you jealous?

573
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Why should I be jealous?

574
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
I mean, it's too late to be, isn't it?

575
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,680
Don't you want to know

576
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,120
what I told him?

577
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,920
Were you two a couple?

578
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,240
Didn't you say

579
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,040
I was your first boyfriend?

580
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,840
I am kidding.

581
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,200
You are the first

582
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,280
and only boyfriend I have.

583
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,600
Senior Zhousheng,

584
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,400
will you please help me

585
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,200
with my math homework?

586
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,400
No problem.

587
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,600
How about biology and geography?

588
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,640
Sure.

Fine.

592
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,680

And I won't take care of it, not even a minute.

598
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,120
Well, everyone has their own ambition.

599
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,520

Lin.

614
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,800
Could you check

615
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,200
if it's tilted or not?

616
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,720
Okay.

617
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,400
That will do.

618
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,940
[Lotus Fragrance Pavilion]

619
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,440
Okay.

620
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,720
That's still tilted.

621
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,640
That's close, right?

622
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,880
It's the old madam's 90th birthday.

623
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,120
Everything must be perfect.

624
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,040
Only if the job is done right,

625
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,240
will I rest easy.

626
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,040
All right.

627
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,000
Come eat when you're done.

628
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,000
I will be waiting for you.

629
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,800
All right, you go ahead.

630
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,680
Okay.

631
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,320
Good for you.

632
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,280
This little yard is gonna be full of people.

633
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,680
I don't care so much about other people.

634
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,880
As for the other great-uncles and grandparents,

635
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,080
they'd better come here less.

636
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,920
I just want to watch my own great-uncle and his wife

637
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,320
live a happy life

638
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,320
behind the closed door.

639
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,720
Every time when I see them

640
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,600
sitting on the couch without saying a word,

641
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,640
all I can feel

642
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,400
is a sense of joy.

643
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,800
The mere thought of someone coming inside,

644
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,640
makes me want to

645
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
kick him out.

646
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
Why are you sitting here alone?

647
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,320
Isn't it cold?

648
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,880
It's okay, I got the cushion.

649
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,200
Brother, come sit.

650
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
This is the mooncake I made.

651
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,720
Have a try.

652
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,760
Is it good?

653
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,800
Yeah.

654
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,280
Not good enough.

655
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,440
I will make some more tomorrow.

656
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,080
It's not the Mid-Autumn Festival yet.

657
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
Why didn't you tell us

658
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,960
that you were coming?

659
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,040
I could have worn something more formal.

660
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Do you know who she is?

661
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
Of course, I do.

662
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,680
From now on,

663
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,640
when I see Mr. Zhousheng,

664
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,240
I don't have to be that overcautious.

665
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,040
The biggest shareholder has been replaced.

666
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,200
Yes, from now on, I am the guest

667
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,440
and she is the hostess.

668
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,600
Here, here, here.

669
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,040
Let me show you around.

670
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,120
Everything here is yours.

671
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
You can come here as often as you want.

672
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,920
No need to ask anyone for permission.

673
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,120
Come, come.

674
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,800
This way, please.

675
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,480
The business here

676
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,560
has been doing pretty well over the years.

677
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,200
Do you know

678
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
the name of this room?

679
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,600
It's called a drying room.

680
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:34,920
When I was a kid,

681
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,560
my grandfather gave me one Guqin,

682
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,400
which was said to be from someone famous.

683
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,920
The manufacturing process takes two years,

684
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,320
one of which

685
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,760
is spent to dry in a room.

686
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,040
Like these ones here,

687
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,840
waiting to see the outside world.

688
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,960
Now that I think about it,

689
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,600
our ancestors

690
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,880
have left us many things

691
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,760
and it seems that all of them

692
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,160
went through such a process.

693
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,520
Not just for the people, but the stuff as well.

694
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,320
We have to endure loneliness

695
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,600
and hardship

696
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,700
until we finally achieve greatness.

697
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,920
Miss Shi sure can

698
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,240
give good lessons.

699
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,330
Come on.

700
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
They were joking around just now,

701
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,120
or were they serious?

702
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,400
What do you mean?

703
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,480
How many shares did you actually give me?

704
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,440
I have given you

705
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,720
all my shares.

706
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,680
All of them?

707
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,280
This is my parents' wish.

708
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,080
My father said that my mother passed away early

709
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,840
and she wouldn't see her future daughter-in-law.

710
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,400
So they specifically left this

711
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
as a gift.

712
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,120
So just take it as

713
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,320
a welcome gift

714
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,520
for their future daughter-in-law.

715
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,680
Thank you, my parents-in-law

716
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,240
for granting me great fortunes.

717
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,960
Your parents gave it to me,

718
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,720
so this is my asset now?

719
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,160
Yeah, yours.

720
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,200
What about the house in Shanghai?

721
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,120
The house in Shanghai

722
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
is also something my father

723
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,000
left for his future daughter-in-law.

724
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,000
They all belong to me?

725
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
They all belong to you.

726
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Here is the tricky part.

727
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
What if one day, I don't want to be with you anymore

728
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,240
and drive you out of my house and deprive you of everything you once owned?

729
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,120
What will you do?

730
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,580
Oh, yeah.

731
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,360
Good news is I have a skill to depend on

732
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,000
and make myself a living.

733
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,480
As for accommodation,

734
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,360
I can only go live

735
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,440
at the institute's dormitory.

736
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,480
You little poor thing.

737
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Then you must listen to me.

738
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Mr. Zhousheng, how are you?

739
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,880
I heard from Mr. Zhao

740
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,280
that your wife is here,

741
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,480
so I came here to say hello to her.

742
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,400
Nice to meet you.

743
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,120
Nice to meet you, too.

744
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,920
Are we back in production?

745
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,080
Yeah.

746
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,040
From now on,

747
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,640
we will be the pioneers among the environment friendly companies.

748
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,320
I have learnt my lesson now.

749
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,000
This is the boss from the dying factory.

750
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,040
This is my wife, Shi Yi.

751
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,640
All the shares my father used to own

752
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,520
are now under her name.

753
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,400
Our biggest shareholder.

754
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,240
How are you?

755
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,320
Today, the three of us

756
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,680
came here to see our biggest shareholder.

757
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,960
I am afraid someone might

758
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,160
gossip behind our backs,

759
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,000
saying we are meeting the biggest shareholder in private

760
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,320
without taking them with us.

761
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,320
How happy would your parents be

762
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,400
if they saw

763
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,960
how you are right now.

764
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,800
His parents

765
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,080
were really kind-hearted.

766
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,880
Chen's mother

767
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,639
received compliments from almost everyone.

768
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,000
And Chen's father

769
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,679
was polite to almost everyone.

770
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,040
He is a real gentleman.

771
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,400
I had never seen him get mad at anyone.

772
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,639
Like last time,

773
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,199
in that ancestral hall, right?

774
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,040
No need to bring that up.

775
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,480
It's all in the past.

776
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,400
It's all in the past.

777
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,440
He's like his father since he was a kid.

778
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,639
They're very alike.

779
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,320
Yeah.

780
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,920
You have an eye for men.

781
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah, that's right.

782
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,760
Yeah, I have a special eye for men.

783
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,040
You really do.

784
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,639
The workshops and factories

785
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,239
are in different places.

786
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,000
I will show them to you

787
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,280
when I am available.

788
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,080
Why did we suddenly come here today?

789
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,520
It's like

790
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,320
completing the last step of the ritual.

791
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,960
I had to personally hand down to you

792
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,360
the wedding gifts

793
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,640
my parents prepared for you.

794
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,280
The man just now said that

795
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
your father got angry in the ancestral hall.

796
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,400
Why is that?

797
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,880
They didn't agree to move

798
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,480
my mother's spirit tablet into the hall.

799
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,800
So my father

800
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,040
had a big fight with them

801
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,280
and swore from then on,

802
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,680
he would never kneel down before the ancestors.

803
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,640
So he never did it ever since?

804
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,640
What about you?

805
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,640
Same.

806
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,120
They are all my

807
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,320
uncles and aunties.

808
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,840
Nice to meet you all.

809
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,520
You go upstairs first,

810
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,440
I need to talk to them about something.

811
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,810
You asked for me?

812
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,140
Will you go to the ancestral hall of Zhou family with me?

813
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,070
To have a meal?

814
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,820
By now,

815
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,160
they should have finished their lunch.

816
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,680
How about having it at home

817
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,600
and then go over there?

818
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,840
We haven't seen each other for a long time,

819
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,120
even if he had finished his meal,

820
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
he would love to have another one with me.

821
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,720
Please have some tea, Great-uncle's wife.

822
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,360
You don't have to call me that.

823
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,680
Mrs. Zhou told me

824
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,920
that seniority in the family can't be confused.

825
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
She also told us to take good care of you.

826
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,040
I was afraid

827
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,440
you wouldn't come back.

828
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,160
Why?

829
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,680
Because last time...

830
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,680
Never mind, forget it.

831
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,680
I've prepared for you

832
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,280
new bed sheet, new bed cover.

833
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,280
Everything is brand new.

834
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,040
Are you happy with that?

835
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,400
Yeah.

836
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
Chen's uncles and aunties

837
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,880
came to visit Mrs. Zhou before.

838
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,160
But judging from today's situation,

839
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,960
soon, everything concerning Zhou family,

840
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,240
like the clan, the ancestral hall

841
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,120
and everything

842
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,920
she's responsible for

843
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
will be handed over to you.

844
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,160
Really?

845
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,360
That's for sure.

846
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,480
There's no hiding from it.

847
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,880
Oh, yeah.

848
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,640
What is that?

849
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,640
Before you came,

850
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,080
Great-uncle specially asked me to prepare this.

851
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,280
It's Qielan incense.

852
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,480
Enjoy your break, Great-uncle's wife.

853
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
Call me if you need anything.

854
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,280
They are all gone?

855
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,280
Yeah.

856
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,680
I never knew you were interested in that.

857
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,120
Why are you suddenly interested in that?

858
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,080
I asked some TCM doctors and

859
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,440
they said this fragrance

860
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,040
has the function of refreshing one's mind.

861
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,880
If you are available,

862
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,840
will you come with me

863
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,240
to visit Grandmother?

864
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,960
My mother said,

865
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,240
Grandmother kept herself in the yard

866
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
and wouldn't come out.

867
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,760
Other people couldn't do anything about it.

868
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,440
If we both went there,

869
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,280
the problem might be solved.

870
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,400
Okay.

871
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Let me reapply my makeup.

872
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,800
How long will you need?

873
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,680
15 minutes?

874
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
15 minutes.

875
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,680
All right, I will go write the wedding invitation.

876
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,680
Go take a break.

877
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,320
Apart from eating, sleeping

878
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,080
and going to the laboratory,

879
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,480
you have been writing them in your spare time these days.

880
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,240
I've been busy lately,

881
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,040
which disrupted my schedule.

882
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,720
I can only do this

883
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,680
whenever I have some free time.

884
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
How about I help you?

885
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,160
My handwriting is not bad.

886
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,000
Let me deal with it.

887
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,600
All right, I'll leave it to you.

888
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,320
Why are you being so petty?

889
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,240
It's the invitation for my own wedding,

890
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,280
why can't I have a look?

891
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,200
It's not time yet.

892
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,840
You still have 13 minutes.

893
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,640
In fact,

894
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,800
I wrote you something as well.

895
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,480
What is it?

896
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,920
It's not time yet for you to see it.

897
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,380
You have only 12 minutes left.

898
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,480
Try to persuade her.

899
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,820
She is like a child. I am helpless.

900
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,360
I will go pack up

901
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,920
the clothes she will be wearing these two days.

902
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,280
Grandmother.

903
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Chen.

904
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,000
You're here.

905
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,240
She forgot about me again.

906
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,110
Shi Yi.

907
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,840
Grandmother.

908
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,030
Where's the kid?

909
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,320
My great-grandson. Did you not bring him with you?

910
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,790
Your great-grandson.

911
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,480
Your great-grandson.

912
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,810
He's doing homework right now.

913
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,920
He's only three years old, what kind of homework is he doing?

914
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,470
He loves to do homework.

915
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,240
If he likes it...

916
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,800
Having interest is the most important thing.

917
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,920
Good, good, good.

918
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,760
Come over here.

919
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,960
Do you want to have another kid?

920
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,000
Do we want to have another kid?

921
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,800
Yeah.

922
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,560
It's up to her.

923
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,680
Do you want to have another kid?

924
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,280
Yeah, of course.

925
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,000
Did you hear that?

926
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,310
Did you hear that?

927
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,010
Yes, I did.

928
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,340
You gotta work hard.

929
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,280
Work harder.

930
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,560
Yeah, I will.

931
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,840
Grandmother.

932
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,590
How about going back to the house tonight

933
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,920
and have dinner with us?

934
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,040
No.

935
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,960
That's troublesome.

936
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,890
There are too many people there.

937
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,080
I get annoyed just looking at them.

938
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,070
But I miss you.

939
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,170
We finally

940
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:32,830
came back home.

941
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,030
Partly for the Mid-Autumn Festival,

942
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,210
partly for you.

943
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,680
Will you please

944
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,080
go there for our sake?

945
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,960
Okay, okay.

946
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,280
Let's get ready then.

947
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,320
All right.

948
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,240
