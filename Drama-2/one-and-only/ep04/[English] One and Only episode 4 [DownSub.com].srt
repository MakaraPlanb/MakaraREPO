00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,900
We came across a bunch of monks

35

when we were on our way here from the west.

36
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,659
They came from Zhongli.

The army of the Southern Dynasty

39
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,200
even attacked the temple?

40
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,920
It's not because the temple was under attack.

41
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,000
The monks saw the refugees coming to the south

42
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,080
and took in hundreds of them in their temple.

43
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,420
As more and more refugees gathered,

44
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,580
the monks could not afford to feed them in the temple.

45
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,740
So the abbot of the temple

46
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,020
decided to escort these refugees

47
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,260
to somewhere safe.

48
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,540

At that time, he came to have a peace negotiation with me

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,120
representing the emperor of Nanxiao.

194
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,360
He was a very favored prince

195
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,680
and was only second to the Crown Prince.

196
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,680
After that, I don't know

197
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,040
what happened,

198
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
he began to live a secluded life

199
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,360
and refused to see any visitors.

200
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Even if the officials from his jurisdiction

201
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
wanted to visit him,

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,480
they had to see him through a veil.

203
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,480
That's why only a handful of people

204
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,080
have seen him in the past few years.

205
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,600
I thought he was an assassin.

206
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,880
Report this back to the capital secretly

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,120

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,320
I thought there are people cleaning this place every day.

381
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm afraid they're not careful enough.

382
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,560
So I wanna clean it by myself.

383
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,800
Throughout the entire mansion,

384
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,400
this is the only place that can't have fire.

385
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Are you cold?

386
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,240
No.

387
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,680
I won't if I am occupied.

388
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,480
You'd better come up here

389
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,280
next time when it gets warmer.

390
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
The books are always here.

391
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,720
They're not going anywhere.

392
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I got a letter from Qinghe County asking you to go back.

393
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,240
Why do I have to go back so suddenly?

394
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,160
The Grand Preceptor resigned from his post and returned to the hometown.

395
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,320
He summoned all the descendants of the Cui's clan back to Qinghe County

396
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,280
to compile the country's history with him.

397
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,280
Including me and my brother?

398
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,280
Yes.

399
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
When is it?

400
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,920
Next month.

401
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
So, can we come back after that?

402
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,360
I can't decide whether you can go or stay.

403
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,480
After all, the Qinghe County

404
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,840
is your hometown.

405
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,120
Jr. Prince of Nanchen's beloved disciple

406
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,720
has to climb up to the roof in secret

407
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,120
to take a look at the Western State under her master's jurisdiction.

408
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,000
I doubt if there's anyone who will buy that?

409
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,080
Uncle has returned to Qinghe County.

410
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,840
The Clan Chief is already over seventy.

411
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,280
He should have returned earlier.

412
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,320
He's now summoning the descendants of the Cui's clan to return,

413
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,520
including me.

414
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,120
When?

415
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,800
Ma said the sooner the better.

416
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,360
I'm already engaged.

417
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,640
I could be called to enter the Imperial Palace at any time.

418
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,520
The sooner I return to Qinghe County,

419
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,080
I'll be able to serve mom a few more years,

420
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,200
and stay with her for some longer time.

421
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,840
I should be happy

422
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,720
that I can go home earlier.

423
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,000
Right?

424
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,880
It's understandable that

425
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,320
you don't want to leave here.

426
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,720
You don't have to blame yourself.

427
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,800
Your Majesty.

428
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,240
Zixing, there couldn't be a better time for you to be here.

429
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,760
We got a secret letter from the Western State.

430
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,880
Zhao Teng.

431
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,360
A prince of Nanxiao has escaped to the Western State.

432
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
And he is currently being held in custody in the royal mansion.

433
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,660
My uncle wants me to decide what to do with him.

434
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,340
But I can't make up my mind.

435
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,380
Should I kill him

436
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,980
or persuade him to surrender?

437
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,020
Or maybe

438
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,300
I should ask a minister I trust

439
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,780
and hold a secret trial in the Western State.

440
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,940
Your Majesty.

441
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,420
Don't bother to concern about such a trivial matter.

442
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,380
Just leave it to me.

443
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,940
I'm willing to go to the Western State for Your Majesty

444
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,020
to hold a secret interrogation of this man.

445
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,740
That's exactly what I had in mind.

446
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,420
Your Majesty.

447
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,780
My fiancée is there.

448
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,940
Even if this does not exist,

449
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,900
I would have asked for your permission to see her.

450
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,940
I knew you wanted to see her.

451
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,020
You've been waiting to see her for ages.

452
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,420
I'll give the order right away.

453
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
You can leave tomorrow.

454
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

455
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,700
[Xianyang Hall]

456
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,900
Say hello to my sister-in-law for me.

457
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,220
One more thing, tell my uncle that

458
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,620
I've been looking at the Western State from the Central State,

459
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,220
and I am looking forward to our reunion.

460
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,100
Your Majesty.

461
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,780
Given your high status,

462
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,660
you should think twice before

463
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,940
going to the Western State.

464
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
High status?

465
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,860
I'm just a member of the Liu's Royal family.

466
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,900
I will write a letter later

467
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,700
to tell my mother to come to the Central State and live for a short time.

468
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,380
I am sorry to trouble you

469
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,860
to take care of her, Mr. Zhao.

470
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,460
I'll take care of the Princess.

471
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,220
Don't worry.

472
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,580
How about I send my own men

473
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,860
to help you pick up the Princess?

474
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,140
Sounds good to me.

475
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,140
If you still don't believe

476
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,460
my loyalty to our alliance,

477
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,820
you can have your trusted men follow me

478
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,380
to make sure I am in one piece.

479
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,820
My men will definitely follow you,

480
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,980
but that doesn't mean I don't trust you.

481
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,180
I was just thinking that it's really a long way for you

482
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,140
to go to the Western State.

483
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,940
And I will feel more comfortable

484
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,940
to know that they are with you.

485
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,620
Then I'll wait for your arrangement.

486
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,420
All of them have

487
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,380
been following me for many years.

488
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,180
You must stay close to him at all times

489
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,140
and take good care of Prince of Guangling.

490
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,100
Yes!

491
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,700
Go take the gilt jade sculpture

492
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,060
sent by His Majesty last year.

493
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:53,820
Yes.

494
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,340
Wait.

495
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,100
Maybe it would be better to take

496
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,420
the inkstone, paper and brush sent by my father

497
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,660
She'll like it.

498
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,260
Yes.

499
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,780
Who do you think will like it?

500
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Your Highness.

501
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,300
Leave us alone.

502
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,940
You're going to see her?

503
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,179
My brother said

504
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,659
you asked for permission to go to the Western State

505
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,139
just to see Cui Shiyi,

506
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:23,860
right?

507
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,260
Xinghua.

508
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,659
I understand.

509
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,060
To be the crown prince, you must marry her

510
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,219
for the support of the Cui's clan.

511
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,260
The most important thing is,

512
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,940
you really like her.

513
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,020
I'm just jealous.

514
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:42,940
You've already started to care about her so much

515
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,420
before you actually see her.

516
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,780
If you really marry her,

517
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,580
I'm afraid there won't be

518
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,260
any space for me in your heart.

519
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,380
You and I have been close since we were kids.

520
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,140
No one can break the bond between us.

521
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,940
[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

522
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,460
Master.

523
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,780
What is it?

524
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,940
The emperor has granted permission

525
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,820
for Prince of Guangling to leave the Imperial Palace,

526
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,380
for the Western State to see his fiancée.

527
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,420
Two things for you to know.

528
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,340
Yes.

529
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,980
Although Prince of Guangling has yet to be crowned,

530
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,380
he's still a prince-to-be.

531
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,060
You should accompany him throughout his visit and make sure he is well taken care of.

532
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,260
Yes.

533
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,820
He's coming from the Central State.

534
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,260
I'm afraid this trip

535
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,580
has something to do with the prince of Nanxiao.

536
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,060
If he needs anything,

537
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,100
you are his responsibility.

538
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,140
Yes.

539
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,980
Master, you are not gonna see him?

540
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,300
I am not a big fan to

541
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,980
deal with the nobility.

542
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,620
I'd rather go back to the barracks

543
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,620
with my counsellor.

544
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,120
You're leaving again?

545
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,080
I thought you were spending new year at the mansion?

546
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,800
Miss Cui.

547
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,840
We have no clue about that either.

548
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,760
You should ask His Highness directly.

549
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,160
As for Prince of Guangling's arrival.

550
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,720
First, he's to interrogate the prince of Nanxiao.

551
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,880
Second, to meet his fiancée.

552
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,920
And the third purpose...

553
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,260
What do you think it is?

554
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,480
There must be a reason for a guest to travel from afar.

555
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,960
Master. Counsellor.

556
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,860
Master, why don't you

557
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,500
stay in the mansion to celebrate the new year?

558
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,700
The military situation has been very tense in the past few years.

559
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,700
The rebellion is still going on.

560
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,900
I'd be more at ease to stay in the camp.

561
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,980
But there's no war during the new year.

562
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,660
And it is rare to spend a new year without a war?

563
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,860
Actually, the reason he leaves the royal mansion

564
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,020
is that he wants to leave some space

565
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,660
for you and Prince of Guangling.

566
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:27,790
If so,

567
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,210
I have nothing else to ask.

568
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,820
I'll leave now.

569
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:34,340
♫No expectation for people's eulogy.♫

570
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,180
♫Only hope to leave no regrets.♫

571
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,340
Shiyi's birthday is coming in a few days.

572
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,460
♫With me a bottle of unstrained liquor, ask for directions among the universe.♫

573
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,300
Even if Your Highness wants to leave,

574
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,300
you should wish her a happy birthday before you go, right?

575
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:57,500
♫The horse galloping, the sound reverberating throughout the battlefield.♫

576
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,420
♫The lofty aspiration held firmly in my hand.♫

577
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:14,280
♫Fearless in the face of hardships, my heart and blood remain red-hot.♫

578
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,290
♫Military ranks on my shoulder, forget about being black and blue.♫

579
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:32,140
♫Willing to hold fast to the light of my life.♫

580
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,820
Every time we leave,

581
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,980
Shiyi always sees us off at the library.

582
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,780
If she returns to her hometown,

583
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,860
there will be no one left

584
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,860
to see us off.

585
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,260
Master is so cruel

586
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,820
as he never once looked back.

587
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,460
When leaving the capital,

588
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,500
His Highness didn't look back either.

589
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,260
He had his own reasons.

590
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
What reasons?

591
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,240
Can you tell me secretly?

592
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,900
If you don't look back, you don't expect to return

593
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,100
and you have no emotional attachment.

594
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,780
This way,

595
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,620
you don't fear death,

596
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,300
and you can sacrifice yourself on a battlefield.

597
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,460
Master has already prepared

598
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,900
a birthday gift for you.

599
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,140
[Huo Shan Huang Ya (Yellow Tea)]

600
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,340
[Fangshan Luya]

601
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,340
[Birun Mingyue]

602
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,100
It tastes weird.

603
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,660
Is it because melting the ice in well water

604
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
changed its flavor?

605
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,820
Why did you pour away the tea?

606
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,080
Come inside with me.

607
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,800
Master.

608
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,280
Why don't you let Eleven listen to the music?

609
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,200
It's a rare opportunity to have a musician from Nanxiao.

610
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,840
She poured away a pot of tea.

611
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,640
I was asking her to write the name of tea as a punishment.
