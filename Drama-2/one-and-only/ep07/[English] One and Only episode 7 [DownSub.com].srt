1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,280
Stop!

3
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,310
Respectable general,

4
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,280
where are you from?

5
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
You're not entitled to

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,150
ask where I am from.

7
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,920
We're escorting an important criminal.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,070
We're entering the capital according to the imperial decree.

9
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,510
Please pardon me.

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Please, general!

11
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,800
Shiyi's absolutely bold.

12
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,630
She acts as if the fake imperial decree

13
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,960
was just a real one.

14
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,000
Is Chief of State Finance in?

15
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,870
Yes.

16
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,590
I've brought some desserts from Jiangnan.

17
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,150
Your Highness, please.

18
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,910
You actually don't trust me

19
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,430
though we meet every day?

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,520
I can

21
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
take the box in.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,710
Chief of State Finance already had dinner.

23
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,960
You wait outside for me.

24
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,190
Yes.

25
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,590
Chief of State Finance.

26
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,400
I wanted to bring you

27
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,960
some desserts from Jiangnan

28
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,750
but was unfortunately stopped outside.

29
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,750
Thanks for Your Highness' kind offer.

30
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,150
Don't mind.

31
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,150
I'll punish them

32
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
for you later.

33
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,280
Thanks for taking the trouble.

34
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Chief of State Finance.

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,960
His Majesty is still worshipping the Buddha.

36
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,150
His Majesty likes to chant scriptures,

37
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,800
which is just like Empress Dowager.

38
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,960
I think I'm enjoying the honor

39
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,520
that no other eunuchs

40
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,240
have ever enjoyed.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,630
I have my own living palace

42
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,430
with palace maids.

43
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,470
And you, a member of the imperial family

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
is chatting with me.

45
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,710
We discuss political affairs

46
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,390
around the state.

47
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm sure that

48
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,720
you won't be Crown Prince anymore.

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
Look.

50
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,950
His Majesty is in the prime of his life,

51
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,510
and he will have his own sons.

52
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,750
So how could he possibly

53
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,870
make you Crown Prince?

54
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,720
But don't worry.

55
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,560
I will surely help you to

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,040
marry the lady from the Cui family.

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,270
Just count on me.

58
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,310
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

59
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,480
I'll do it.

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,720
Don't take the trouble.

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,830
It's no trouble.

62
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,240
Royal Army of Nanchen is outside the city.

63
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,190
Help me.

64
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,560
Or you won't be alive.

65
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,070
Your Highness.

66
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,040
The guilty eunuch Zhao Teng has admitted his guilt

67
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,310
and committed suicide.

68
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,920
He's dead,

69
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
so who are you serving?

70
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Just admit your guilt now.

71
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,120
Let's kill him and escape.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,310
Who dares to do it?

73
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,040
Here's the royal token of Nanchen.

74
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,159
We aim to protect Beichen.

75
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,920
You'd better give yourselves in here,

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
or you will be dead.

77
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,870
Pardon me, Your Highness.

78
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,600
Find an adopted son of Zhao Teng.

79
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,480
Tell him that

80
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,510
Zhao Teng has suddenly caught a severe illness

81
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,630
and is dying.

82
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,680
Ask Liu Yuan to immediately come into the imperial palace

83
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,830
to watch Empress Dowager and comfort His Majesty.

84
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,240
Yes.

85
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,750
Do you know who I am?

86
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,430
I'm General-in-chief of the dynasty.

87
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
If you dare to kill me,

88
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,160
your families and relatives will be eliminated!

89
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,920
Who are you?

90
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Who actually are you?

91
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,560
Who are you?

92
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,870
Who actually are you?

93
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,560
Tell me!

94
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,910
The court session is cancelled today.

95
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,910
All ministers,

96
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
you may go.

97
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,000
Cancelled?

98
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
What's happened?

99
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,720
All ministers are here.

100
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,480
Exactly.

101
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,080
Yes.

102
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,270
Isn't he Prince of Guangling's chamberlain?

103
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
What are we supposed to do?

104
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,750
Let's go out first.

105
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,750
Go.

106
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
What's going on?

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,080
Why is this happening?

108
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,550
Why was His Majesty absent from the court session?

109
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,030
There they are.

110
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,550
The court is in bad order now,

111
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,360
which is worrying us.

112
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,870
Counselor-in-chief.

113
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,200
Who are you?

114
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,320
You're Wenjun from the Cui family.

115
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,200
Good for you.

116
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,720
You rarely left Qinghe Commandery before,

117
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,270
so why are you in the capital today?

118
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,600
My elder brother is severely ill

119
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,030
and dying.

120
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,720
However, he didn't want to part with

121
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,440
His Majesty, his peer ministers

122
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,150
and Counselor-in-chief.

123
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,750
He decided to come back to the Residence of Cui in Central State,

124
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,200
and I came back with him.

125
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,120
So why are you here now?

126
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,600
I'd like to invite all of you

127
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,840
to the Residence of Cui

128
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,600
after you the court session is over.

129
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,510
Lord Cui.

130
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,870
Everybody, please be seated.

131
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,750
I've heard that

132
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,670
Zhao Teng is badly ill

133
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,720
and is dying.

134
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,630
I've also heard that

135
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,630
General-in-chief Liu Yuan went to see Empress Dowager.

136
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,200
He admitted that he had arrogated power in court

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,550
and killed loyal ministers.

138
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,200
At the time you arrived here,

139
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,120
the guilty minister Liu Yuan handed over his military power

140
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,000
and gave himself in.

141
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,670
Brother, refreshments are ready.

142
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,840
Have a taste.

143
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
These are specialties of Qinghe Commandery.

144
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,960
Counselor-in-chief,

145
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,790
didn't you hear of this?

146
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,630
You go in and out of the imperial palace every day,

147
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,790
so you should have known it earlier.

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,960
I heard of it before.

149
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,870
Liu Yuan kept maids and whores,

150
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,840
indiscriminately killed ministers

151
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,670
and turned common people into slaves.

152
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,630
I guess you've been tolerating that

153
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,000
and have waited for this result for long.

154
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,440
You're absolutely right.

155
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,270
I'm badly ill now,

156
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,320
I'm powerless though I hope to do something.

157
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,030
At such a time of turbulence,

158
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,150
please help His Majesty.

159
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,510
It's my duty.

160
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,750
I knew that

161
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,240
you would ground me

162
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
sooner or later.

163
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,150
Your Majesty.

164
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,240
The outcome is certain now.

165
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
You should be happy.

166
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,840
Why are you still praying?

167
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,030
From beginning to end,

168
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,960
I've always thought that we would win.

169
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,670
What worries me most is that

170
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,150
His Majesty doesn't trust him.

171
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,320
I worry that His Majesty thinks he has other purposes.

172
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,240
If that's true,

173
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,080
everything he does for His Majesty

174
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
will be a joke.

175
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,550
Why are you crying?

176
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Did you kill Zhao Teng?

177
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,240
Zhao Teng

178
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,600
dies of illness.

179
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,480
What about Liu Yuan?

180
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,510
He confessed his guilt

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,440
and has been deprived of military power.

182
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,480
What I say

183
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,960
will be announced to the state

184
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,240
and recorded in history.

185
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,870
Well…

186
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,600
Will I be recorded

187
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,270
as dead today in history?

188
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm afraid not.

189
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,550
You need to have several sons.

190
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,240
Otherwise, there will be more rebellions

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,150
if you don't have descendants.

192
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,200
I haven't brought weapons into the palace today,

193
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,670
just the wooden sword granted by Your Majesty.

194
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm your uncle,

195
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,480
and you are more important

196
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,440
than the throne to me.

197
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,440
Uncle.

198
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,080
Your Highness, thanks for saving me.

199
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,480
I once said that

200
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,960
you never need to kneel down in front of me.

201
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,960
After being grounded by my disobedient son and eunuchs

202
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,600
for three years,

203
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,510
I've long lost my dignity as Empress Dowager.

204
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,870
Without you,

205
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,670
I wouldn't have been set free.

206
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,910
I was wrong.

207
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,000
I will not see you as my son anymore.

208
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,960
I believed in slanderous talks

209
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,109
and wanted to come into throne as soon as possible,

210
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,640
But then…

211
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,440
But then

212
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,030
I just couldn't break away from Zhao Teng.

213
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,680
I knew I was wrong earlier

214
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,240
and couldn't eat or sleep well every day.

215
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,000
However, I didn't dare to go against them

216
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,349
because I was afraid they would kill you.

217
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,550
I was wrong.

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,720
I really was wrong.

219
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,920
I was wrong.

220
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,790
I was wrong.

221
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,880
Mother.

222
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,830
Your Highness.

223
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,640
Have you thought of many things in the past?

224
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,200
The late emperor was just in his thirties

225
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,510
when he passed away,

226
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,880
but he died as an emperor anyway.

227
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,750
It's hard to come by that

228
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,880
we've made it without much trouble.

229
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,960
Exactly.

230
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,550
It's really hard to come by.

231
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,000
Then why is Shiyi going to cry?

232
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,640
Your Highness.

233
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,270
No one likes to joke about his disciple

234
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,510
as you do.

235
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,030
I can't stand seeing this.

236
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,000
I thought that

237
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,920
you must have been imprisoned by His Majesty.

238
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,110
His Majesty did order to

239
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,310
imprison me.

240
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,550
He ordered to

241
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,510
imprison me in the palace

242
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,830
for a period of time.

243
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,160
What will happen after this?

244
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,790
I'll go back to the Western State.

245
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,550
The Shiqian Palace is an emperor's living palace,

246
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,070
but why is it vacant?

247
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,000
The late emperor passed away here,

248
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,550
and His Majesty had his bedchamber moved to the Xianyang Palace

249
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,310
for fear of feeling sad.

250
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,790
I was brought up by the late emperor here

251
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,070
when I was young,

252
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,310
so I lived here too.

253
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,880
What are you looking at?

254
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,070
I'm looking at the place

255
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,310
where you lived in childhood.

256
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,270
They don't know us.

257
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,310
That sounds right.

258
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,160
During this rescue,

259
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,440
except a few people,

260
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,070
no one else knows that

261
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,550
Jr. Prince of Nanchen is back.

262
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,680
Therefore,

263
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,680
we need to hide our real names in the palace.

264
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,440
That sounds right.

265
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,830
So I can't call you “master”, right?

266
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
We would be exposed in that case.

267
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,960
That makes sense.

268
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,480
Zhou…

269
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,920
Your Highness.

270
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,640
Empress Dowager asks Your Highness to her living palace.

271
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,880
Go to the military counsellor.

272
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,270
After all, it's not my mansion.

273
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,590
Don't go around.

274
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,790
The lady is in the palace.

275
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,440
If Your Highness wants to meet her,

276
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,830
I will invite her here.

277
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm feeling pitiful.

278
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Pitiful?

279
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
For what?

280
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,830
If we want to eliminate uncle,

281
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,960
tonight will be the best time.

282
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,400
That he came to the capital to save the emperor

283
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,830
has been known by no one else

284
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,240
except several close ministers.

285
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Therefore, Royal Army of Nanchen would not complain

286
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,270
even if he died here.

287
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,750
If we kill Liu Yuan and him tonight,

288
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,030
it will be a double kill.

289
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,590
Pitifully, His Majesty values kinship

290
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,790
more than the throne

291
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,310
and doesn't have the heart to kill uncle.

292
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,480
Change clothes for me.

293
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,790
Yes.

294
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,880
Are you seeing Miss Cui?

295
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Princess.

296
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,440
No.

297
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,750
Actually, I'm going to thank uncle for

298
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
saving His Majesty.

299
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,880
Empress Dowager has invited him over

300
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,070
a moment ago.

301
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,270
Congratulations to Empress Dowager for getting the power back.

302
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,400
You think I ask you here

303
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,270
to kill you?

304
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,750
Guess

305
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,030
who is back in the palace?

306
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,200
I haven't been concerned about worldly affairs for long.

307
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,960
The guy from the Western State.

308
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,030
You're finally back.

309
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,960
In this living palace,

310
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,550
we're family

311
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,920
rather than an emperor and his ministers.

312
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,110
You will be my sister-in-law.

313
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,310
Sorry for visiting abruptly.

314
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,790
Sister-in-law, please don't worry.

315
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm here to see him.

316
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,110
Are you Xie Chong,

317
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,550
military counsellor of

318
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,590
Jr. Prince of Nanchen?

319
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,550
Your Majesty, don't do that.

321
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,240
I can't receive this.

322
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,960
Yes. You can.

323
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,310
Rise.

324
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,510
Your Majesty.

325
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,110
You taught the late emperor

326
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,680
and support my uncle,

327
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,310
so I should bow to you.

328
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,720
I need to bow twice more.

329
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,510
You were engaged with the late emperor

330
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,030
but you didn't marry him at last,

331
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,680
so why did you do this?

332
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,070
After the late emperor died,

333
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,880
Empress Gao forced me to be a nun.

334
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,920
When she died later,

335
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,350
I wanted to leave the palace at first.

336
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,070
Then I heard that you made a severe promise

337
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,480
at the Taiji Palace that

338
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,110
you would never get married,

339
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,790
so I stayed here.

340
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,030
After all,

341
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,310
this was the place where we met.

342
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,920
Your Majesty don't come here

343
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,680
just to bow to me, right?

344
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,590
I'd like to ask about a person.

345
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,070
Have you ever heard of

346
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,750
a lady named Huaiyang?

347
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
Gao Huaiyang?

348
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,750
Yes. Her surname is Gao.

349
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,880
Your Majesty,

350
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,590
what do you want to know about her?

351
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,030
What's her relationship with uncle?

352
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,310
Your Majesty,

353
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,030
why do you think

354
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,960
she has anything to do with your uncle.

355
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,270
I asked you first.

356
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,000
I will tell you

357
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,200
after you answer my question.

358
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,480
Your Majesty,

359
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,960
she's a cousin of Empress Gao

360
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,400
and has lots of chances to come into the palace.

361
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,240
The late emperor saw her

362
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,070
and took a fancy to her soon.

363
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,270
However,

364
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,960
the one she wanted to marry

365
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,000
was your uncle.

366
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,400
Did my uncle like her?

367
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
I didn't dare to ask.

368
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
So she must be very sad

369
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,240
when uncle left after that.

370
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,640
Maybe.

371
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,030
All I've heard is that

372
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,480
Gao's clan forced her into the palace

373
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,880
so that she could serve the late emperor.

374
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,350
After all, it was always

375
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
to Gao's advantage

376
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,440
if they had

377
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,830
an adored concubine.

378
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,550
However, Empress Gao didn't want her to share the late emperor's love

379
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,110
and tried all means to stop that.

380
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,830
Finally, she couldn't marry the late emperor.

381
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,200
After the late emperor passed away,

382
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,270
I've never heard about her.

383
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,790
She has been in the palace as a nun with hair

384
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,440
until today.

385
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,750
She's still alive?

386
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,310
I thought that

387
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,030
I would see you sooner or later

388
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,880
if I stayed in the palace.

389
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,160
Did it have anything to do with me

390
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,110
when you left the palace back then?

391
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,720
No.

392
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,310
You like this place?

393
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,880
Master, you must have been tired

394
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,830
after seeing an old acquaintance.

395
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Get in the palace and sleep.

396
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,480
Where are you going?

397
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,550
I'm going out of the palace.

398
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,160
The gate was closed earlier.

399
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,240
A powerful minister can go out

400
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,510
if he has important affairs.

401
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,960
Like you said,

402
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,000
a powerful minister can go out only if he has important affairs.

403
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,790
Do you think this place is like the Western State

404
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
where you can go anywhere?

405
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,720
I've sent someone to

406
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,070
inform the Residence of Cui,

407
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,480
so you may stay here tonight.

408
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,110
Your Majesty is here too.

409
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,110
Yes.

410
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,070
I almost fainted after crying today.

411
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,110
I just chatted with your military counsellor

412
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,590
and I'm back to myself now.

413
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,680
Why don't you

414
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,880
pay respect to His Majesty?

415
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,000
As a noble lady from the Cui family,

416
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,640
where are all your good manners?

417
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,720
He has been here for 2 hours.

418
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,160
He?

419
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,510
His Majesty.

420
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,920
I told her that

421
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
she didn't need to treat me as an emperor

422
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,510
in this living palace.

423
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,830
Please don't blame her.

424
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Uncle, please be seated.

425
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,720
Sit down.

426
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,720
You eat.

427
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,480
Uncle.

428
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,350
You've done a deed of merit this time,

429
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,680
so what reward do you want?

430
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,510
I don't need that.

431
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,350
Jewelries?

432
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,030
A rank?

433
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,000
Or a land?

434
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,590
Or is it marriage?

435
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,510
I can't get married.

436
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,310
Even though you can't actually get married,

437
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
you can be with a lady

438
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,200
if you love each other.

439
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,070
His Majesty is wise.

440
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,350
A wedding is useless.

441
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,880
That you truly love each other

442
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,310
is the thing that matters.

443
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,350
I don't want you to be childless.

444
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,640
If you have a child,

445
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,680
you can bring him into the palace.

446
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,160
I'll personally bring him up.

447
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,550
No one would dare to say anything bad.

448
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,310
Your Majesty,

449
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I'm not childless.

450
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,510
So,

451
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,270
I have brothers and sisters?

452
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,960
When did that happen?

453
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,830
There are ten orphans

454
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,510
and one disciple

455
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,270
in my mansion.

456
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,200
I'm contented.

457
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,640
My military counsellor is old.

458
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,790
I hope Your Majesty won't blame him.

459
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,640
It's OK.

460
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,400
Your Majesty!

461
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,000
How dare you!

462
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,200
I told you that

463
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,400
no one should come in.

464
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,240
Please don't be angry.

465
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,310
I heard a noise

466
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,510
and was afraid that Your Majesty was in danger.

467
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,590
They are my honored guests

468
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,830
in the living palace,

469
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,960
so how could I be in danger?

470
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,830
Get out!

471
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,680
Yes.

472
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
I have nobody to trust

473
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,960
except you.

474
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,750
Your military counsellor just told me that

475
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,790
Liu Yuan and you were close when you were younger.

476
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,240
Would you like to ask for leniency for him?

477
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,960
I can give him a way out.

478
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Your Majesty,

479
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,070
please be fair and just.

480
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,000
I have only one request.

481
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,640
Go ahead.

482
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,920
Don't get my descendants involved.

483
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,160
If you're hungry,

484
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,960
you may ask someone outside the palace.

485
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,510
I'm not hungry.

486
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,830
I'm just not used to it

487
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,960
since this is my first time to sleep in the palace.

488
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,960
Master, are you worried about something?

489
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,550
Well.

490
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,360
You seem to be worried about something too tonight.

491
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm young

492
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,510
without many past stories,

493
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,960
so I don't have the chance to be worried.

494
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,510
I found that you were not in the mood

495
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,630
as soon as you came back.

496
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,550
What's actually going on?

497
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,190
The wine I'm drinking

498
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,110
is called Sangluo.

499
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,070
It's usually granted to

500
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,230
meritorious officials.

501
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,000
My father once granted it to

502
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,920
a general who claimed to

503
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,480
drink lots of wine without getting drunk.

504
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,840
However, he was drunk for half a month

505
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,510
after drinking several liters of it.

506
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,480
The wine is strong

507
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,030
and I've drunk much tonight.

508
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,230
So if you have any worries,

509
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,630
just tell me.

510
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,440
I won't remember anything tomorrow.

511
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,880
Did His Majesty bring it here?

512
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
We buried it here before.

513
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,840
We buried it in many places in the palace.

514
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,550
Who buried it with you?

515
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,070
Several friends.

516
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,440
In childhood.

517
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,880
Was the person with you?

518
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,510
Yes.

519
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,070
He's really drunk

520
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,440
and tells me everything.

521
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,480
So will you take the person out of the palace this time?

522
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,550
The person has committed a severe crime,

523
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,360
and I have no reason to save him.

524
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,320
Your eyes are red.

525
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,800
I haven't slept well,

526
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,920
so my eyes are red.

527
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,840
Shiyi.

528
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,510
We've known each other for such a long time that

529
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,960
you can't cheat me.

530
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,510
The person knows you for a longer time.

531
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,230
Did my military counsellor tell you this?

532
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,840
When His Majesty was here,

533
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,230
they chatted about this

534
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,070
and I heard that.

535
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,400
His Majesty just asked me

536
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,030
whether I would ask for leniency for the person just now.

537
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,190
Why would you ask for leniency?

538
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,710
Because of the surname Gao?

539
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,630
Liu Yuan's surname is not Gao.

540
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,190
You…you've been talking about Liu Yuan?

541
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,710
Who else should I be talking about?

542
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,670
Let this go.

543
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,030
Go to bed early.

544
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,360
Master, where are you going?

545
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,510
There's curfew in the palace.

546
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,150
You could be taken as an assassin.

547
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,280
Why are you following me?

548
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,590
I'm afraid you would be in danger.

549
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,070
Why?

550
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,360
You've drunk a lot tonight.

551
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,320
Actually, I can drink a lot.

552
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,070
That's right.

553
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,230
What's right?

554
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,150
Mom once read me several lines

555
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,230
about you.

556
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,150
“Lying on the beach with numerous corpses after getting drunk,

557
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,670
he indulges himself in singing.”

558
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,960
I should have realized that

559
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,230
you can drink a lot.

560
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,360
The crazy things I did at a young age

561
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
was actually written down.

562
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,320
There were not enough soldiers back then

563
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,670
and we didn't know if we would survive,

564
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,920
so I could indulge myself.

565
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,960
Just put this on.

566
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,150
You put it on.

567
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,110
I'm not cold.

568
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,280
Come here.

569
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,840
Master, what are you digging for?

570
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,840
Wine.

571
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,000
I'll see an old friend in a while.

572
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,510
He buried the wine with me.

573
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,670
We promised to

574
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,510
get it out

575
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,360
and celebrate my victorious comeback.

576
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,800
Who are you?

577
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,440
Let me go!

578
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,550
Do you still want to be alive?

579
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,320
Do you hear me?

580
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,000
Let me go!

581
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,800
Aren't you afraid of getting your families and relatives killed?

582
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,280
Hurry up and let me go!

583
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,400
Who are you?

584
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,510
Tell me!

585
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,110
Who are you?

586
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,800
Who…who are you?

587
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,670
Who actually are you?

588
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,590
You!

589
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,360
That makes sense.

590
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,800
Only you will come to see me.

591
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,150
I've dug this jar of wine out

592
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,480
to meet you for the last time.

593
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,760
I should have

594
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,070
asked Empress Gao to

595
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,760
kill you back then.

596
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,150
Thanks for caring about me when we were young.

597
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,840
I cared about one who wants my life now.

598
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,150
Give me some wine.

599
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,550
My throat is soar.

600
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,550
Well.

601
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,400
You're the only one

602
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,840
that makes me concede defeat.

603
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,280
Do you have any unfulfilled wish?

604
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,190
I've been arrogating power in court for years

605
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,760
and I've enjoyed the dignity as an emperor.

606
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,320
I have no pities.

607
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,230
Is there any family member

608
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,030
you need me to take care of?

609
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,360
I have a son.

610
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,280
I'll have him escorted back to Pingcheng

611
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,110
so that he can escape this misfortune.
