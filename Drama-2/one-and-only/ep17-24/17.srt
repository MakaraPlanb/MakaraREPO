Please forgive His Highness.

It doesn't matter.

When will we enter the city tomorrow?

In the morning, during the hours of the Dragon.

It's snowing.

60
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,260
When did it start to snow?

61
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,020
Just now.

62
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,620
It's snowing early this year.

63
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,580
But it looks it might rain.

64
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,340
So the snow may not last long.

65
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,340
Early winter has only just begun.

69
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,500
that one year, it also snowed

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,700
on New Year's Eve.

71
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,860
They all thought Master wouldn't make it back.

72
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,180
I alone believed

73
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,180
he would return to us.

74
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,180
I have finally

75
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,020
come back from Shouyang.

76
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,780
Look.

77
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,700
I bought you

78
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,860
a lot of delicious food.

79
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,980
How are you?

80
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,420
Did you miss me?

81
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,580
What's wrong?

82
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,100
You don't feel well?

83
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,460
No.

84
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,140
Maybe because it's too cold.

85
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,960
Yes, it is very cold.

86
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,640
Why don't you wear more clothes?

87
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
Go back and put more on later.

88
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,520
Understood?

89
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,920
Tonight

90
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
I'll go to stay by the city gate

91
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,280
to spend New Year's Eve

92
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,480
with the generals and soldiers guarding the city.

93
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,680
How about going together?

94
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
Come on, accompany me.

95
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,800
You don't want to walk?

96
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,280
It doesn't matter. I can carry you out,

97
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,360
and then we will take a carriage.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,840
So you don't need to walk at all.

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,320
There'll be a big crowd there,

100
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,280
a real lively New Year celebration.

101
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,920
It's cold here in the mansion.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,680
I want to wait for Master to come back.

103
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
You want to wait for His Highness?

104
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,640
Over this last half year,

105
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
we've always heard good news from afar,

106
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,080
but Master still never came back.

107
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
From early summer to late autumn,

108
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,440
even until this very day,

109
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,200
it's already New Year's Eve.

110
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,760
I think he'll come back.

111
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,960
If he doesn't come back,

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,920
you'll stay up all night on New Year's Eve alone?

113
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
I will.

114
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,600
Someone must do it.

115
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,000
OK.

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,640
I'll leave some soldiers here.

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,440
If you need any help,

118
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
you can order them to come fetch me at any time.

119
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,160
Your Highness.

120
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,280
Today is New Year's Eve.

121
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,440
Go fetch some Wild Pepper Wine.

122
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes.

123
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,260
You played Go against yourself?

124
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,680
I didn't expect

125
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,840
I could drink hot tea as soon as I arrived.

126
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,960
It seems that

127
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,480
my fortunes will improve next year.

128
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Your Highness,

129
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,760
Miss asked me

130
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,520
to reheat the tea immediately

131
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
once it cooled,

132
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,160
because she knew Your Highness would be back.

133
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,840
I guessed you were waiting for me,

134
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,440
so I came back first alone

135
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,800
as fast as I could.

136
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,520
The others couldn't keep up with me.

137
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,120
You rode the swiftest horse.

138
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
How could the others

139
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,840
have kept up with you?

140
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,960
But that's just as well.

141
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,120
Tonight,

142
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,240
let's spend

143

New Year's Eve alone.

144
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,360
Tomorrow morning,

145
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,640
after your senior brothers and sisters

146
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,280
come back,

147
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,120
we'll spend the lively

148
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,320
Lunar New Year's Day together.

149
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
It's the first time that you've allowed me to drink.

150
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,760
Is there something to celebrate?

151
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
On New Year's Eve,

152
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,880
we should drink a cup of Wild Pepper Wine with our household

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,600
to welcome the New Year.

154
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,320
Come on. Enjoy the food.

155
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,760
It's almost dawn.

156
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,960
Where are you going?

157
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to chat with Feng Qiao.

158
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,160
I see.

159
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,920
After you get married,

160
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,000
it'll be hard for you to see anyone from the royal mansion.

161
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,480
If your mother asks about you later,

162
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,720
I'll explain that to her for you.

163
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,880
Miss Cui.

164
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
I came to see Feng Qiao.

165
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,160
Um...

166
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,320
You're looking for Feng Qiao?

167
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,520
She is not in this room.

168
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Are you planning on escorting me the whole way?

169
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,160
Yes.

170
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,880
I'll escort you into the city

171
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,640
and then escort Grand Mentor Xie's body

172
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,800
back to the Western State.

♫The snow before the pavilion softly kisses the lattice♫

174
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I'll go light the lantern.

175
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,880
There's no need.

176
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,610
♫I don't want to dive deep into my heart to see how much I miss you♫

♫Sing my whispers while I'm slightly drunk♫

179
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,760
I won't think I spoke out of turn.

♫Listen to it, can you see that I miss you♫

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,440

♫The snow won't stop, the person won't show up, my heart won't clear up♫

184
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,080
I was afraid I would make you even sadder.

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,680
♫How can I describe you if I'm going to write♫

187
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,560
♫How can I drink a cup of tea with you♫

188
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,220
♫Under the moon at the city gate, we enjoy the lanterns and boats♫

189
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:25,170
♫Sadly I can't explain my love anyway♫

190
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,320
There was something

191
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,960
that I didn't plan to tell you,

192
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,440
and when I left the royal mansion,

193
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,280
♫The snow in front of the garden keeps falling♫

194
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,840
I held back.

195
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,800
After returning from Luyuan,

196
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,850
♫I can't wake up from your smiles♫

197
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,720
I wrote a letter to my mother.

198
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:49,420
♫Going through the four seasons on the horse, how shall I greet you♫

199
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,120
I told her that

200
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,600
I wanted to compile classics like my uncle.

201
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
Then I could stay in the royal mansion

202
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,460
♫I'm resolute now and forever♫

203
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,800
to be with you.

204
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
I want to stay in the Western State,

205
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,710
♫To enjoy the scenery with you day and night♫

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,360
remain single all my life,

207
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,400
treat the royal army

208
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:12,860
♫I'm willing to run to you even for millions of miles♫

209
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,880
as my family

210
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
and treat you as my family,

211
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,160
like my senior brothers and sisters.

212
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,920
♫The snow in front of the garden keeps falling♫

213
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,760
♫I can't wake up from your smiles♫

214
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,440
My mother said,

215
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:35,130
♫Going through the four seasons on the horse, how shall I greet you♫

216
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,240
if I was not engaged,

217
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
she would allow me

218
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,400
to stay in the Western State.

219
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:43,410
♫I'm resolute now and forever♫

220
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,120
I was so close.

221
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:49,460
♫To see the sadness and happiness with you in all love stories♫

222
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,640
Just one step away

223
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:59,920
♫Been displaced, but my heart is as always♫

224
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,280
from staying in the royal mansion.

225
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,200
It doesn't matter

226
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,760
where you will be.

227
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,760
♫The snow in front of the garden keeps falling♫

228
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,120
As before,

229
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,080
you will wait for good news,

230
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,920
while I guard the border.

231
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,290
♫I can't wake up from your smiles♫

232
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,080
Just this time,

233
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,400
you will have to

234
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,960
wait a little longer.

235
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:21,800
♫Going through the four seasons on the horse, how shall I greet you♫

236
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,000
I promise you.

237
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,640
We'll meet again.

238
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,500
♫I'm resolute now and forever♫

239
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,240
♫To see the sadness and happiness with you in all love stories♫

240
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:46,690
♫Been displaced, but my heart is as always♫

241
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
Master,

242
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,720
do not attend my wedding.

243
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,680
Fine,

244
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,400
I won't.

245
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,840
Why do you cry?

246
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,840
Are you reluctant to part from me?

247
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,560
It's almost dawn.

248
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,560
Go back.

249
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,360
We're all still alive,

250
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,360
just fulfilling our duties

251
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,680
in different places.

252
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,480
We'll reunite one day.

253
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,920
-Tianxing.
-Tianxing.

254
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,920
All followers of the Junior Prince of Nanchen

255
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,200
come to a bad end in the Central State.

256
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,000
He was forced to leave.

257
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,920
And that grand mentor

258
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,320
after living in the Central State for only a few years

259
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,320
fell ill and died.

260
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,120
Keep it down.

261
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,360
The one kowtowing on the right

262
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,320
is the daughter of the Cui family

263
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,200
who is about to enter the city.

264
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,360
She is another of his disciples.

265
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,040
Your words

266
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,000
will bring grief to

267
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
those of the royal mansion.

268
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,280
You leave the city,

269
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,480
while I'll enter.

270
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,200
We'll finally part.

271
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,840
Anyway, I hope

272
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,640
you can be happy after your marriage.

273
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,400
Generals and soldiers,

274
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,540
farewell.

275
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,980
[Central State]

276
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,580
[Central State]

277
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Where is Master?

278
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,520
Here.

279
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,720
What time is it?

280
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,280
Your Highness, it's near the middle of the hours of the Dragon.

281
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,360
She has entered the city.

282
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,880
When Meng Luan comes back,

283
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,920
tell him

284
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm going to leave the imperial palace.

285
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,040
Going to see Miss Cui?

286
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,880
Your Highness,

287
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
Honored Concubine Jin heard that

288
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
you'll get married soon,

289
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,080
so she brought a generous gift.

290
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,480
Call her in.

291
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,320
Yes.

292
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,960
Won't you open it?

293
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
The gift

294
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,080
is not important,

295
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,400
but your words are.

296
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,320
I'm afraid you've forgotten

297
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,920
our agreement.

298
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,800
The Jin family give their loyalty to you,

299
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,160
and you must

300
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,160
make me the empress.

301
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,800
Could I ever forget it?

302
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,240
You're my most powerful backup.

303
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,400
Then why did you ask for the engagement?

304
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,000
To win over the Cui family.

305
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,280
His Majesty ascended the throne at only 6

306
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,080
with the support of Cui Guang.

307
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,240
The Cui family are literati from the Central Plains

308
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,720
and supported by common people.

309
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,520
With their support, I'll be also supported by the scholars.

310
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
No matter how many excuses you have,

311
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,480
only I can be the empress.

312
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,040
I've never planned to change my mind.

313
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,440
I'd heard that your family was extremely wealthy.

314
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,840
It seems that was true aft er all.

315
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
During the reign of the late emperor, all the war horses

316
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
came from my family.

317
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,640
In Taiyuan,

318
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,920
we have so many horses roaming the hillsides that

319
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,200
we can only herd them in batches by color.

320
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,840
You can't

321
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
see this anywhere else.

322
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,440
Attendant!

323
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,320
Tell Meng Luan that

324
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
I don't feel well,

325
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,000
so I won't go to the Residence of Cui.

326
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,120
At once.

327
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,200
Miss Cui,

328
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
His Highness planned to see you,

329
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,240
but he really doesn't feel well,

330
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,280
so he can't come out today.

331
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,920
I hope you can forgive him.

332
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,600
It doesn't matter.

333
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm leaving.

334
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,600
Are you afraid of seeing the Prince of Guangling?

335
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
Are you afraid that you'll talk about the thing that you parted on bad terms last time?

336
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,680
Last time?

337
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,200
It isn't that.

338
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,000
Why were you much happier

339
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,560
hearing that the Prince of Guangling

340
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,440
wouldn't come to see you?

341
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,600
I just arrived in the Central State

342
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,560
and am not used to the place yet.

343
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
I felt nervous

344
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,800
and was afraid I would say something improper

345
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,880
when he came to see me.

346
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,320
I won't feel so nervous in a few days.

347
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,080
Cui Shiyi, daughter of the Cui family,

348
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,080
greets Your Majesty.

349
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
Last time I saw you

350
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,040
was in the year when your uncle passed away.

351
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,520
Things have changed so much.

352
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,960
No need to kneel.

353
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

354
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
The Prince of Guangling

355
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
really has taken quite a fancy to you.

356
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,520
I agreed to your engagement

357
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,120
due to his sincerity

358
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,800
in imploring me.

359
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,240
To be honest,

360
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,240
the two of you seem fated to

361
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,880
be together.

362
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,920
And so you're engaged once again.

363
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,480
Xinghua,

364
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,320
Lady Cui,

365
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
follow me.

366
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,600
I haven't seen you for a long time.

367
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,920
I live in the imperial palace,

368
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,880
but it's heard that

369
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,720
you and Uncle went to Nanxiao

370
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
to present books to Longkang Academy,

371
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,080
winning the hearts of the literati in the area south of the Yangtze River.

372
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,520
We just presented books

373
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,920
to my master's old friend by chance.

374
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,480
Why don't you look at me?

375
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,960
Your Highness.

376
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,640
His Highness had a high fever last night.

377
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,400
After hearing that you would enter the imperial palace today,

378
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
His Highness specially came to see you.

379
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,880
Your Ladyship,

380
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,360
please say more to His Highness.

381
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,640
He'll be happier.

382
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Your Highness,

383
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
take good care of yourself.

384
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,640
Your Highness, look out!

385
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,760
I...

386
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,560
I don't feel well.

387
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,880
I want to go back.

388
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,440
As a pregnant woman,

389
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,840
you should walk carefully.

390
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,520
This is the first baby

391
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
of the Cui and Qi families,

392
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,960
it is not just your own.

393
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm sorry.

394
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,320
Does Cui Feng

395
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,800
know about it?

396
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,280
No,

397
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,840
he doesn't.

398
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,240
How are you going to

399
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,080
explain to us, the Qi family,

400
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,560
and your husband?

401
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,880
Do you somehow think

402
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,520
only Her Majesty will lash out at you,

403
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,480
and our family

404
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
will let you off?

405
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Please forgive

406
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,040
my recklessness.

407
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,840
Xinghua,

408
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,720
you lied to Cui Feng

409
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
and to me.

410
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,320
Do you not feel guilty?

411
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,240
Our relationship has long been broken.

412
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,520
Both of us know it.

413
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,440
Between the two of us

414
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
there's too much pain.

415
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,280
Shiyi,

416
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,520
write and ask

417
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,520
Feng to return at once.

418
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,960
Alright.

419
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,640
Master,

420
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,160
the coroner said that

421
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,400
Grand Mentor Xie indeed died of illness.

422
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,760
You bring the grand mentor's body back to the Western State first.

423
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,240
I'm going to Shouyang.

424
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
It's calm in Xiaoyu's garrison.

425
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,440
Why are you suddenly going there?

426
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,480
After the grand mentor died,

427
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,080
the forces in the capital have fallen out of balance.

428
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,200
I guess there must be something wrong

429
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,440
in two months.

430
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,960
Of our army,

431
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
only those in Shouyang

432
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,760
are near to the capital city.

433
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,920
I can know

434
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,880
what will happen in the capital from there.

435
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
It's really bustling in the Central State.

436
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,800
I can find a chance to take you to the Western State.

437
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,080
It's more bustling there.

438
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,660
[Residence of Grand Mentor]

439
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,400
Aunt.

440
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,280
As soon as I received your letter,

441
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,120
I lost no time

442
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,440
in coming back.

443
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,840
In fact, my mother asked you to come back.

444
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,240
Because all the letters from the Central State

445
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,200
must be opened and read.

446
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,320
I wrote that letter.

447
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
What happened?

448
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,840
What didn't you mention in the letter?

449
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,920
Pour a cup of tea for Feng.

450
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,680
I'll let Shiyi tell you about it.

451
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,880
Aunt, you seldom behave like this.

452
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,280
What happened on earth?

453
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,360
The princess is not pregnant.

454
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,960
Mother found it out by accident.

455
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,880
She lied to us.

456
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,400
Feng.

457
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,360
That's great.

458
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,440
That's great?

459
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,800
If so,

460
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't owe anything to her anymore,

461
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,840
or to my family.

462
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,800
You don't know,

463
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,560
I...

464
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,600
Anyway, it's really

465
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,960
the best news

466
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,920
I've heard in a long time.

467
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,320
What happened to you

468
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,760
and Her Highness?

469
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,280
Why did she lie to you

470
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,880
and us?

471
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,720
It just happened. Don't ask about it.

472
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Before today,

473
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,200
I thought I owed her.

474
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,720
After today,

475
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,000
I can have a clear conscience.

476
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,720
Do you want to divorce?

477
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,320
Her Highness said that

478
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,520
your relationship has long been broken.

479
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,800
Your mother won't agree.

480
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,800
Our marriage

481
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,840
has been decided

482
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,400
by the family elders

483
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,080
and has entangled with various relations since the beginning.

484
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,320
I'll persuade Mother for you.

485
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
I want to try it for you.

486
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,600
Divorce?

487
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,840
I don't want Feng to be so sad.

488
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,440
You have seen

489
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,320
how the other branches of our family

490
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,680
make difficulties for us.

491
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,160
Feng is Her Highness' husband,

492
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,760
but they still dared do so.

493
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,760
Without the marriage

494
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,000
with the Qi and Liu families,

495
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,160
Cui Zheng will have no reason

496
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
to hold back against us.

497
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,800
But I'll marry the Prince of Guangling.

498
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,480
In the beginning, I was the one

499
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,240
who was married off to the royal family.

500
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,440
As my engagement was cancelled,

501
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Uncle could only ask Feng

502
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,320
to marry the princess.

503
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,520
Now that I still need to marry the Prince of Guangling,

504
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,320
why can't

505
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,080
at least one of us

506
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,800
be free?

507
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,360
Mother, please allow Feng to divorce.

508
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,400
You agree?

509
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,800
I know you're loath to marry the Prince of Guangling,

510
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
so you hope Feng can divorce as his wish.

511
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,520
I know this,

512
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,680
so I agree.

513
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,800
-Thank you, Lady Cui.
-Thank you, Aunt.

514
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Feng, you go back to Taiyuan first,

515
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,640
and Xinghua stays at home.

516
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,400
This matter

517
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,720
involves all our three families.

518
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
So I must find a perfect solution.

519
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,880
-I see.
-I see.

520
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,520
Why hasn't Concubine Jiang given birth to the baby yet?

521
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,200
What did the imperial doctor say?

522
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,160
He said

523
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,600
she'll deliver the baby

524
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,840
in a couple of days.

525
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,680
Two days, he always says two days.

526
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,760
I've waited for more than ten days!

527
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
His Majesty hasn't come out in a long while either.

528
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,960
If this goes on,

529
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
all the regional princes will hear about it.

530
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,760
If they begin to doubt,

531
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
we'll get into trouble ourselves.

532
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,000
Especially the Junior Prince of Nanchen

533
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,400
and General Jin Rong,

534
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,440
who is the closest to the Western State.

535
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,200
We can't wait any longer.

536
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:50,920
Go, ask the imperial doctor

537
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
to prescribe medicine to induce birth.

538
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,680
I must see my grandson in three days.

539
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,840
Yes.

540
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,520
This is...

541
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,840
a medicine to induce birth.

542
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,719
Will it

543
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,080
be harmful to her

544
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,040
and the baby?

545
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,239
The baby will be born soon.

546
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,679
My question was

547
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,639
could this harm her or the baby?

548
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,320
Um...

549
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,600
Um...

550
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,639
Um... I...

551
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,840
My son

552
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
should be born according to his own schedule.

553
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,960
Your Majesty, don't get angry.

554
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,300
Get out!

555
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,320
All of you!

556
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,840
Why do you kneel down to me?

557
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,800
Hurry up. Get up.

558
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,400
The grand mentor said before his death that

559
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,240
the empress dowager will kill you

560
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,840
after she has a grandson.

561
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I beg you

562
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,880
to kill me.

563
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,200
You want me

564
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,920
to kill you

565
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,720
and my baby?

566
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Exchange our lives

567
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,720
for yours.

568
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,040
Impossible.

569
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,160
I absolutely won't do it.

570
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,640
I'd rather die

571
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,720
than do that.

572
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,080
I'm going to beg her

573
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,640
and show weakness.

574
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,040
Your Majesty.

575
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,440
Where's the hairpin from the grand mentor?

576
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,080
This is the way out

577
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,440
he gave me.

578
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,200
Your Majesty.

579
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,400
He is right.

580
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,000
The empress dowager and I

581
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,160
will fight.

582
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,040
I've retreated repeatedly,

583
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,360
making Grand Mentor Xie

584
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,160
and ourselves suffer.

585
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,240
I can't treat her politely anymore.

586
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,320
Your Majesty.

587
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,600
Qin Yan?

588
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,040
Your Majesty.

589
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,040
I want to see my mother.

590
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,600
I had

591
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,920
the wool pulled over my eyes

592
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,000
by Zhao Teng

593
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,920
and Xie Chong.

594
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,160
I was wrong.

595
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,560
Please

596
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,160
give me a chance one more time.

597
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,400
Look up at me.

598
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,000
I can't

599
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,400
believe you another time.

600
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,640
I...

601
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
will abdicate.

602
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,800
If you abdicate suddenly

603
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,040
in your prime,

604
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,200
how will you make

605
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,480
courtiers and regional princes believe

606
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,240
you weren't forced by me?

607
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,960
They've been tired of me for a long time.

608
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,200
Like you,

609
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,920
they hate to see me interfering in court affairs,

610
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,640
supporting the Qi family,

611
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,320
misbehaving in the harem

612
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,160
and keeping my boys.

613
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,000
Of those secret missives you receive,

614
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,400
a full half of them

615
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,880
are asking you to kill me.

616
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,320
They've been accusing me.

617
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,920
did you think I wasn't aware?

618
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,240
I've done you wrong.

619
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,400
After today, I'll

620
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,120
be sure to punish them!

621
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,760
Serve dinner.

622
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,680
I'll dine

623
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,680
with His Majesty.

624
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,360
Yes.

625
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,520
Why is there no wine?

626
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,560
Your Majesty,

627
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,720
the imperial doctor said

628
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
you shouldn't drink for half a month.

629
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,800
I haven't dined

630
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,040
with His Majesty for a long time.

631
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,200
It doesn't matter.

632
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,680
Serve wine.

633
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,880
Yes.

634
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,760
I'll pour wine for you.

635
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:36,920
Come.

636
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,440
Sit down.

637
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,800
The two of us

638
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,240
have been at odds

639
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,800
since Zhao Teng's plot.

640
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,120
You

641
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,160
still blame me for that matter.

642
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,040
No.

643
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,120
I just

644
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,880
can't understand you.

645
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,560
You're my own child.

646
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,000
However,

647
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,480
you prefer trusting others

648
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,040
over trusting me.

649
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,600
When your great grandpa ascended the throne at five,

650
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,880
the empress dowager at that time held court.

651
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,880
And they ruled

652
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,160
in harmony.

653
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,640
If they could do that,

654
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,800
then why can't the two of us

655
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,680
do the same?

656
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,960
Over the years,

657
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,600
you've tried very means

658
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,240
to gather toy-boys in the palace,

659
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,360
and I just ignored it.

660
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,400
After Zhao Teng's plot,

661
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,960
I didn't want to get involved

662
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,120
in your private life.

663
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,600
However,

664
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,200
you emptied the treasury

665
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,080
to fund your lavish lifestyle.

666
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,280
The Qi family merely sit on the fence,

667
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,440
while they persecute the faithful and honest.

668
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,800
I can't ignore it.

669
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,800
Hui,

670
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,200
without me,

671
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,520
you would have died.

672
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,400
I'm from

673
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,560
the Qi family.

674
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,880
What if you give

675
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
your uncles more freedom?

676
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,360
I don't

677
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,840
want to betray my people.

678
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,560
Well said.

679
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,240
Come on.

680
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,440
Why don't you pick up the cup?

681
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,680
Do you fear

682
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,640
I'll poison you?

683
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,800
Drink it.

684
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,120
There's no poison.

685
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
I wouldn't do that.

686
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,040
You're my own son.

687
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,800
At worst,

688
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,120
I'd force you to abdicate.
