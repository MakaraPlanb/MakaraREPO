[Episode 22]

4
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,740
General Feng!

5
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,259
What do you think?

6
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,780
Answer me!

7
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,660
Xiaoyu!

8
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,820
Do you remember the

9
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,660
Battle of Shouyang?

10
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,180
We have no reinforcements this time.

11
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,860
We're all on our own.

12
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,139
General Cui, are you afraid?

13
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,740
Yes.

14
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,860
I'm afraid that my family name

15
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,500
would affect your ability to do your job,

16
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,060
that you'd be too concerned about my safety to fight the good fight.

17
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,740
Even if you are captured,

18
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,380
I won't retreat.

19
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,940
The royal army comes first.

20
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,380
The war comes first.

21
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,579
The people come first.

22
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,620
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

23
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,660
General Hong.

24
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,660
If anyone of us is captured,

25
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,020
consider the other person dead.

26
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,540
Don't let this

27
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,579
hold us back.

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,500
I, Cui Feng,

29
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,580
as the prefectural governor of Taiyuan,

30
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,900
failed to hold Taiyuan.

31
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,060
I'm guilty of dereliction of duty.

32
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,580
If you insist on saving a sinner like me,

33
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,340
you're wasting the lives of soldiers

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,180
who died for this battle!

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,900
He's the young master

36
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,260
of Wushui branch of the Cui family,

37
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,980
the cousin of the future empress.

38
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,700
Generals!

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,380
Make your decision now!

40
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,420
-Xiaoyu.
-Bow and arrow...

41
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,740
Bow and arrow!

42
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,780
General!

43
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,260
It's useless to kill me!

44
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,820
Even if I die,

45
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,300
there will still be someone to kill him.

46
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,940
General Cui!

47
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,100
I, Hong Xiaoyu, will kill all the traitors

48
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,700
to avenge your death!

49
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,460
Killing Cui Feng

50
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,260
won't do you any good.

51
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,060
I advise you

52
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,580
to let him go

53
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
if you want your men

54
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,060
to leave here alive.

55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,340
Bring her over.

56
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,460
I am Jin Zhen.

57
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,500
I want to see my father.

58
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,340
Your Highness!

59
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,980
General!

60
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,820
Your Highness.

61
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,620
Retreat!

62
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,260
Master.
-Master.

63
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,340
It'll be fine.

64
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,620
Your lowly servant, Cui Feng,

65
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,580
greets Your Highness.

66
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,220
Get up.

67
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,140
Xiaoyu.

68
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
General Cui.

69
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,340
Sorry.

70
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,900
Today you almost

71
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,500
got killed by me.

72
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,100
That was our agreement,

73
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,980
wasn't it?

74
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,460
Besides, in that situation,

75
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
If I could die at the hands of

76
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,820
at your hands,

77
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,860
I would be glad...

78
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,420
Stop that nonsense.

79
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,140
It will never happen again.

80
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,980
By the way, the princess and I...

81
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,500
No need to explain.

82
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,380
I know it all.

83
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,380
When we were in the Central State,

84
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,180
Shiyi already told me.

85
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,820
After we're finish with the

86
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,700
things here,

87
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,380
let's go back to Shouyang together.

88
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,060
Here is the letter of surrender.

89
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,500
This letter of surrender was brought back by Prefectural Governor Cui,

90
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,380
your cousin Cui Feng.

91
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,179
Mother.

92
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,380
People say that the daughter of the Cui family

93
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,180
often come to pray at the Baima Temple.

94
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,860
All the noble women in the capital, spread the word among themselves and followed suit,

95
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,540
hoping to be

96
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,020
half as blessed as she was.

97
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,100
I prayed for

98
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,660
the safety of the soldiers.

99
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,300
The regent decided to

100
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,220
offer sacrifices to the heavens at the Pingyin Palace.

101
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,420
Then he will ascend the throne

102
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,300
Why must he offer sacrifices at the Pingyin palace?

103
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,700
Jin Rong murdered the late emperor

104
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,820
in Pingyin.

105
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,020
So he ordered his men

106
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,940
to take Jin Rong to Pingyin,

107
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,660
so that he could use the blood of the Jin family

108
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,660
to comfort the late emperor's spirit.

109
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,500
Many well-known clans came from Beichen

110
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,940
asking my aunt to let them see Your Highness.

111
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,140
What do they want with me?

112
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,660
My aunt knew you wouldn't want to see them,

113
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,020
so she said she was sick

114
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,900
and didn't go to the palace.

115
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,060
This way,

116
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
Your Highness won't be disturbed, and neither will my aunt.

117
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,500
Pomegranates!

118
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,140
Big and juicy pomegranates!

119
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,220
Tulin pomegranates...

120
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,220
They are Shiyi's favorite.

121
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,700
Pomegranates for sale!

122
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,940
Come and have a look!

123
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,260
Tired?

124
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,300
Have you ever had Tulin pomegranates?

125
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,100
After Zhang Qian brought back pomegranate seeds from the Western Regions,

126
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,460
he planted them in various places.

127
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,100
They grew best in that place,

128
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,980
so they were called Tulin pomegranates.

129
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,980
I don't know what's got into Master.

130
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,300
He insisted on eating this,

131
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,620
and got someone to go to Pingyin to buy it.

132
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,660
Who knew Pingyin's court officer

133
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,340
heard about it.

134
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,420
That court officer did not sleep well for several nights,

135
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,820
pondering over and over,

136
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,020
wondering whether Master wanted to take this opportunity

137
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,900
to test Pingyin's attitude

138
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,380
towards the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

139
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
So he ordered his men

140
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,060
to pick 3,000 baskets of pomegranate overnight,

141
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,180
and sent them to the Western State as soon as possible.

142
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,580
See.

143
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,660
This is only a small fraction.

144
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,180
Except for these,

145
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,700
the rest are in the military camp.

146
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,620
His Highness does not like

147
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,220
to get too close to the county officials,

148
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,220
so he paid for these.

149
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,660
Try some.

150
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,420
Pomegranates.

151
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,900
Please have a look at my pomegranates.

152
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,180
Sir.

153
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
I'll take them all.

154
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,060
There will be someone coming to pick them up later.

155
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,460
Thank you, sir.

156
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,700
Tomorrow, send them to the palace in your name.

157
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,340
Yes, Master.

158
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,740
Thank you.

159
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,380
Your Highness.

160
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,460
Your Highness.

161
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,300
Are you feeling better?

162
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,860
Your Highness.

163
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,260
According to the divination, this battle will be dangerous.

164
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,420
Please choose an auspicious day to fight.

165
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,820
We've already won.

166
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,980
That's good.

167
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,940
I'm glad I was wrong.

168
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
I'm glad.

169
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,740
Master, it's time to leave.

170
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,940
We'll head for home tonight.

171
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,500
You should rest for two more hours.

172
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,460
Okay.

173
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,100
Come on.

174
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,700
We'll head for the Western State before sunset.

175
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,820
For me,

176
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,820
it doesn't make any difference whether we leave today or tomorrow.

177
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
But as the biggest contributor

178
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,820
to this rebellion,

179
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,660
I'm afraid you have no way to avoid

180
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,060
tonight's banquet.

181
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,860
I am an expert

182
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,060
at playing drunk.

183
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,260
We've won many battles.

184
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,100
That's right.

185
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,340
That's all thanks to His Highness.

186
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,420
His Highness will be here soon.

187
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,020
Right.

188
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,140
[Jiangdu Palace]

189
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,140
The Junior Prince of Nanchen has arrived.

190
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,820
Uncle

191
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
Uncle, please come inside.

192
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,660
Generals,

193
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,140
please take your seats at tables for generals.

194
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Fellow generals, please.

195
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,860
General Hong.

196
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,420
Let's first have three bowls as a toast!

197
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,580
No problem!

198
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,340
Come!

199
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,220
As you wish.

200
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,060
Cheers!

201
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,820
All ministers,

202
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,780
dry your glasses, please.

203
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,260
-Please.
-Please.

204
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,620
Today is a precious reunion for us,

205
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,540
the descendants of the Liu family.

206
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,500
-Yes.
-Yes. That's right.

207
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,260
The last time I came here.

208
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,980
It was to offer sacrifices to the heavens with the late emperor.

209
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,620
That year, you were just...

210
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,420
I just turned 11 years old.

211
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,460
That's right.

212
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,500
How fortunate we are to have you in Beichen!

213
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,619
How fortunate we are!

214
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,140
Yes, that's right.

215
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,700
Come!

216
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,300
A toast to Your Highness.

217
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,980
-To Your Highness.
-Please.

218
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,300
-To Your Highness!
-To Your Highness!

219
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,740
Here. Please.

220
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,540
You are a good drinker, General.

221
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,900
General Zhu. Come.

222
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,580
General Chen. Cheers!

223
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,500
Feng Qiao.

224
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,700
Let me have another drink.

225
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,460
What is the seating arrangement

226
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,780
for today's banquet?

227
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,300
All the kings and ministers are in the main hall.

228
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,340
We generals...

229
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,300
sit here.

230
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,660
Come, General Hong.

231
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,500
Let's have a drink.

232
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,820
I can't hold my liquor very well.

233
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,060
I shall take my leave now.

234
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,380
Your Highness, you're leaving this early?

235
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,300
I'm afraid if we stay longer, we'll get drunk here.

236
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,780
It will delay our journey back.

237
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,180
Why don't you stay in Pingyin for a few more days?

238
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,340
Look at your uncles and aunts here.

239
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,020
They're already old.

240
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,780
I'm afraid it's not easy to reunite like this again.

241
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,660
That's right.

242
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,700
-The royal bedchamber has been prepared.
-Yes.

243
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,420
Why don't you rest here for the night

244
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,340
and leave tomorrow?

245
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,140
Staying here

246
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,260
always reminds me of the late emperor.

247
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,940
That makes me sad.

248
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,700
It's best I go back to the military camp.

249
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,300
I'll take my leave.

250
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,860
Take care, Your Highness.

251
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,580
Remember to return here often, Your Highness.

252
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,380
Remember to return here often.

253
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
Take care, Your Highness.

254
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,340
-Remember to return often.
-Remember to return often.

255
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,300
Zhousheng Chen assassinated the regent!

256
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,100
Arrest him!

257
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,780
We've been set up!

258
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,780
Nanchen Royal Army has rebelled!

259
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,260
By order of the regent,

260
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,220
kill them all!

261
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,660
I have so many soldiers at my command.

262
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,540
How come no one dares to kill the traitor?

263
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,500
Whoever kills Zhousheng Chen

264
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,140
will take his place

265
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,820
and claim the Western State!

266
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,060
Jin Rong.

267
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,980
Kill them!

268
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,860
Go!

269
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,340
Feng Qiao!

270
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,860
Xiaoyu!

271
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,060
Xiaoyu!

272
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,020
Xiaoyu!

273
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,340
Xiaoyu.

274
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,420
Xiaoyu!

275
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,780
Xiaoyu!

276
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,580
-Xiaoyu!
-Xiaoyu!

277
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,460
Xiaoyu, hang in there!

278
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,100
Reinforcements will be here soon!

279
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,900
Xiaoyu.

280
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,180
Xiaoyu.

281
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,300
-Xiaoyu! Xiaoyu!
-Xiaoyu!

282
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,340
General Cui.

283
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:33,860
It was I that fell in love with you first, General Cui,

284
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,500
from the beginning to the end.

285
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,060
Xiaoyu, don't die.

286
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,860
-Xiaoyu.
-Xiaoyu.

287
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,220
Don't forget me.

288
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,700
I...

289
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,460
I'll see you in the next life.

290
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,860
Xiaoyu.

291
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,180
Xiaoyu!

292
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,020
Xiaoyu!

293
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,700
Xiaoyu!

294
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,580
Xiaoyu!

295
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,100
Xiaoyu, don't die!

296
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,740
Xiaoyu!

297
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,420
Xiaoyu!

298
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,420
Your Highness.

299
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,300
Liu Zixing and Jin Rong are in cahoots.

300
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,900
There are too many ambushes here. We gotta get out of here fast.

301
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,540
Xiaoyu!

302
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,500
Xiaoyu!

303
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,660
Let's bring Xiaoyu back.

304
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,460
Grand-uncle!

305
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,220
Grand-uncle, save me!

306
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,620
Grand-uncle!

307
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,860
Grand-uncle, save me!

308
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,460
Grand-uncle?

309
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,940
Grand-uncle, save me?

310
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,540
Zhousheng Chen.

311
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,980
He was put on the throne

312
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,060
by you.

313
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,220
I believe

314
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,580
you wouldn't want a child

315
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,180
to die for you today, do you?

316
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,460
Bring him up.

317
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,460
Your Highness.

318
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,660
Watch carefully.

319
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,460
I am the Counselor-in-chief. How dare you!

320
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,260
Your Highness, go!

321
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,020
Don't care about us!

322
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,060
Inside the hall

323
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,820
there are still dozens of members

324
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,140
of the Liu's royal clan

325
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,140
and more than two hundred ministers.

326
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,060
If you don't surrender today,

327
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,140
I'll kill them one after the other

328
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,380
to have them join you in hell!

329
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,570
Liu Zixing.

330
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,490
Are you trying to kill all your family members

331
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,570
and slaughter all the ministers?

332
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,220
I guarantee with my life,

333
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,500
as long as you put down your weapon

334
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,070
no more people will die.

335
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,980
Master.

336
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,420
I beg you. Just for once, please be selfish.

337
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,660
Leave with us.

338
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,260
Don't care about them anymore.

339
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,780
Master!

340
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,980
Grand-uncle, go!

341
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,500
I'm not scared anymore.

342
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,740
All right.

343
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,860
I yield.

344
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,260
Let him go.

345
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,860
Master!

346
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,610
I

347
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,400
don't trust you.

348
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,420
You have over two hundred ministers

349
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,500
as hostages.

350
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,580
What are you afraid of?

351
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,500
Now that you're using them to threaten me,

352
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,090
you should know that

353
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,820
I wouldn't run away.

354
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,540
Grand-uncle!

355
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,060
Don't be afraid.

356
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,100
Escort His Majesty away!

357
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,380
Yes.

358
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,060
Retreat!

359
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,500
Master!

360
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Master! Master!

361
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,620
I'm useless!

362
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,300
Master!

363
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Master!

364
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,140
Do you still mind his bones?

365
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,780
[Jiangdu Palace]

366
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,140
Who told you to kill them?

367
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,900
What else then?

368
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,420
They are all my uncles.

369
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,740
If you keep talking this nonsense,

370
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,380
I'll even dethrone you,

371
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,660
the regent.

372
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,290
Now that the royal army has been falsely accused of rebellion.

373
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,740
You've already become a rebel general.

374
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,180
You can no longer stay in the Central State.

375
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,260
You must leave today.

376
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,620
Where is Shiyi?

377
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,100
I'll take care of her.

378
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,500
As long as she doesn't leave the palace,

379
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,780
I will not leave either.

380
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,180
If you are still risking your life for Shiyi,

381
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,940
how can I leave?

382
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,580
How can you say that?

383
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,500
You are my sworn brother's family,

384
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,100
then you are my family too.

385
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,540
You may not like to hear what I'm gonna say,

386
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,460
but you are too badly injured.

387
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,380
Your stay will only hold me back from saving others.

388
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,100
If you leave, you're helping me.

389
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,300
Staying alive is the only way to get revenge.

390
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,980
News of the incident at Pingyin Palace has spread to the capital city.

391
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,540
From the officials to the merchants and civilians,

392
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,380
everyone is talking that

393
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,620
the next city Jin Rong is going to slaughter

394
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,380
is the Central State.

395
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,860
In one night, over seventy percent of the people had fled.

396
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,300
Go back!

397
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,180
Go back!

398
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,020
Go back, all of you!

399
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,660
By the order of the regent,

400
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,220
ordinary officials and folk

401
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,260
who are not in collusion with the rebels,

402
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
will not be executed.

403
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
There's no need to flee.

404
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,420
Go home now!

405
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,900
General, come with me.

406
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,420
Is there something wrong, General?

407
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,940
Look how empty these stores in the city are.

408
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,580
The General will be back tomorrow.

409
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,820
He won't be happy to see that.

410
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Take your men down there.

411
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,500
Change into civilian clothes

412
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,940
and pretend to be merchants tomorrow.

413
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,980
Also, get your men to bring back the runaways

414
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,100
from the neighboring counties.

415
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,820
Yes.

416
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,659
Close the city gate!

417
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,580
Leave them all here.

418
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,100
Be gentle.

419
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Who sent this?

420
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,780
Your Highness.

421
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,380
These are sent by Mr. Huan

422
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,420
from Longkang Academy.

423
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,739
The night I left the academy,

424
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,340
I painted a lotus

425
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,580
as a farewell gift to Mr. Huan.

426
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,460
He must have understood that painting.

427
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,420
So he gave me this lotus flower in return.

428
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,780
Mrs. Cui is asking permission to leave the city.

429
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,300
Open the gate!

430
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,620
You're letting her go that easily?

431
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,940
That's the carriage of the Cui family.

432
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,220
Think of our ranks.

433
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,020
How can we offend them?

434
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,580
General Zhou.

435
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,300
I'll first take you to

436
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,660
an inn 20 miles away.

437
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,580
There is a 3000-soldier army of the Cui family waiting for you.

438
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,620
When you arrive at the inn,

439
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,180
I'll escort you to Shouyang with the army.

440
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
The young master is waiting there.

441
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,340
Thank you.

442
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,380
Do you know

443
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,420
how Shiyi is doing?

444
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,500
No one is allowed to see her now.

445
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,100
Not even her mother is allowed to see her.

446
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,340
How is Tianxing's injury?

447
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,940
Your Highness.

448
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,420
He has recovered well.

449
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,620
I'll go see him after lunch.

450
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,100
General Zhou has recovered, indeed,

451
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,780
but he has already left.

452
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,220
He's gone back to the Western State.

453
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
When did he leave?

454
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,660
The day before yesterday.

455
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,260
He said there were enemy movements in the south.

456
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,420
And that he had to go urgently.

457
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,220
After the peace treaty at the Frontier Settlement Tower,

458
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,660
the territories had long been at peace.

459
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,020
How can there be such a sudden change?

460
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,460
The Prince of Pingqin also went with him.

461
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,980
He said that his wife was pregnant

462
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,300
and went back to take care of her.

463
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,780
Now that the royal army has gone on an expedition,

464
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
schedule for me

465
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,410
to pray for our soldiers at the Baima Temple tomorrow.

466
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,980
Yes.

467
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,740
[Baima Temple]

468
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,060
She wants to pray at Baima Temple?

469
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,900
Yes.

470
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,420
But the temple has long been empty.

471
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,740
How can we hide it?

472
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,020
Get some monks from other counties.

473
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,300
If anyone makes a mistake, kill them.

474
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,780
Yes.

475
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,820
Why has no one wiped these incense burners?

476
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,020
The monks of Baima Temple

477
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,500
have had a habit for many years.

478
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,140
Every year in the twelfth lunar month, they would ask young disciples

479
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
to check the water inside.

480
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,420
If there is a thin layer of ice on the water,

481
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,740
they'll change it immediately,

482
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,260
so that the doves can drink the water.

483
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,880
This temple...

484
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,100
Doves are very smart.

485
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,260
They like to hide in the temple in the wintertime.

486
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,100
There is not even a single dove here.

487
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,540
These monks are all fake.

488
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,620
Master, you once said,

489
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,500
if something happened to you,

490
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,300
someone would tell me.

491
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,110
♫Maybe it's the snow falling without a sound♫

492
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,100

♫My heart that can't stand being away from love♫

508

I already have ten disciples.

the scenery of the whole Western State, right?

523
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,660
I want to leave a word on it.

524
