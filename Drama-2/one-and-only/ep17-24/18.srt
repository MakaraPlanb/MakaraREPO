[Episode 18]

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
You still blame me

5
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,720
for that matter.

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,520
No.

7
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,720
I just can't understand you.

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,280
You're my own child.

9
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,360
However,

10
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,000
you prefer trusting others

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,800
over trusting me.

12
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,400
When your great grandpa ascended the throne at five,

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,600
the empress dowager at that time held court.

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,360
And they ruled

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,080
in harmony.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
If they could do that,

17
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,320
then why can't the two of us

18
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,280
do the same?

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,720
Over the years,

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
you've tried very means

21
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,079
to gather toy-boys in the palace,

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,079
and I just ignored it.

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
After Zhao Teng's plot,

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
I didn't want to get involved

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,840
in your private life.

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,840
However, you emptied the treasury

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
to fund your lavish lifestyle.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,040
The Qi family merely sit on the fence,

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,120
while they persecute the faithful and honest.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,480
I can't ignore it.

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,520
Hui,

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
without me,

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,360
you would have died.

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,240
I'm from the Qi family.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
What if you give

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
your uncles more freedom?

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,360
I don't want to betray my people.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,160
Well said.

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,760
Come on.

40
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,079
Why don't you pick up the cup?

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,360
Do you fear I'll poison you?

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,760
Drink it. Thereâ€™s no poison.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,040
I wouldnâ€™t do that.

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,880
You're my own son.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,480
At worst,

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,720
I'd force you to abdicate.

47
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,640
You should not drink it.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,760
Why?

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,600
The imperial doctor said

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,560
you shouldn't drink these days.

51
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,040
I would like to abdicate.

52
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,040

54
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,120
since you are a filial child,

55
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,760
you might as well

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,960
drink this cup of wine for me.

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,840
Haven't you tried this wine before?

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I have.

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,760

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
put poison into the wine.

65
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
Drink it.

He dares not.

He is not afraid of me,

but his old master, the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

120
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,240
I guess he went south

to seek shelter in Nanxiao

122
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,440

gets the empress dowager's permission,

131

you can give this divorce settlement to the princess.

132

OK.

does this belong to Grand Mentor Xie?

Yes, it is.

150
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Why do you have this?

151
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,600
Someone threw this into the Residence of Cui

saying it belonged to Grand Mentor Xie

154

and that you would know it if you saw it.

155
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,240

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,360
there's been an accident in the palace and you should be careful.

Just now I found

and said he would take Her Highness and Her Ladyship into the palace

165
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,600
to celebrate the birth of the prince.

166
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,440
It's reasonable for the princess to enter the palace.

167
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,520
But why should Shiyi go too?

168
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,920
That chamberlain said that

the Prince of Guangling grew up in the palace

170
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,840

the Prince of Guangling as her own son,

173
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,240
so to celebrate the birth of the prince,

174
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,880
she will naturally ask

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,240
the Princess of Guangling to go

176
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,960
and enter the palace to celebrate together.

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,040
to win the throne and marry you.

194
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,200
Be nice to him.

195
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,000
As long as you treat him well,

196
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll try my best to fight for you.

197
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't think

198
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,560
I heard what you said.

199
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
You can't say it again in the future.

200
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,720
Even if you are a princess,

201
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,320
you can't say that.

202
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,640
Zixing.

203
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,360
Your Highness.

204
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,440
Your Highness.

205
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,400
Shiyi, I'll take you to the palace.

206
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,360
Her Majesty is giving a banquet,

207
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,960
accompanied by the imperial concubines.

208
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,520
It is inconvenient for me to attend the banquet.

209
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,360
So I'll leave after I take you in.

210
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

211
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,880
Have you ever seen the little prince?

212
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,400
Her Majesty was very nervous

213
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,840
when the eldest son of His Majesty was born

214
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,520
and took care of him in person in her chamber.

215
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,640
Even the prince's biological mother never saw him,

216
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,080
let alone anyone else.

217
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,280
People have died before in every palace here.

218
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
So it's much colder

219
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,000
than outside the palace.

220
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,160
The Cui family pay attention to etiquette and law.

221
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,599
Are you

222
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,599
doing this just to me,

223
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,280
or are you doing this to everyone?

224
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,800
Let's go.

225
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,480
Don't keep the empress dowager waiting.

226
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,800
Shiyi,

227
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,280
the relationships

228
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,840
between people

229
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,640
are really unpredictable.

230
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,960
Your cousin is the prefectural governor in Taiyuan

231
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,680
in order to monitor my father,

232
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,240
but you and I drink happily at this banquet

233
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,760
in the palace.

234
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,120
So you are Honored Concubine Jin.

235
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,440
Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t recognize you.

236
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,760
I have doubts in my heart.

237
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,480
I want to ask you something.

238
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,000
Go ahead.

239
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
His Majesty sent Cui Feng

240
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,000
to be the prefectural governor of Taiyuan County.

241
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,880
Was there a verbal command

242
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,640
to kill my father at any time?

243
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,840
The prefectural governor of state and county

244
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
is not just a supervisory role.

245
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,600
It also has the duty of dispatching troops and horses

246
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,480
to suppress

247
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,680
rebellions by local vassals or princes.

248
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,760
The thirteen prefectural governors

249
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
including my cousin in thirteen counties

250
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,240
are the same.

251
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,600
I think as long as General Jin

252
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
is loyal to His Majesty,

253
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,120
my cousin

254
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,800
will never use military power without authorization.

255
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,120
Thank you.

256
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,800
Get some rest.

257
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,320
The honored concubine drank a lot tonight.

258
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,680
How can she see His Majesty?

259
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,680
His Majesty dotes on Concubine Jiang only

260
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,440
and rarely summons other concubines,

261
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,760
especially Honored Concubine Jin.

262
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,800
It is well known in the palace that

263
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,320
she is not at peace with His Majesty.

264
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,920
Since Concubine Jiang gave birth to a son,

265
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,040
no concubine can see His Majesty.

266
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,420
[Jiafu Palace]

267
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
What are you looking at? Do you not want to keep your head?

268
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
What's going on?

269
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,400
Something big.

270
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,920
His Majesty

271
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,680
passed away.

272
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,880
My son

273
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,960
is gone.

274
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,100
[Jiafu Palace]

275
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,640
-His Majesty.
-His Majesty.

276
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,160
After shaving your heads,

277
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,160
you can temporarily live in the palace

278
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,640
and chant scriptures

279
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,160
for His Majesty.

280
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,760
I don't want to shave my head.

281
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,960
I had already guessed that

282
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,280
you would be the only one in His Majesty's harem

283
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,880
who will disobey me.

284
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,520
I have also guessed that

285
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
among the imperial concubines in the harem,

286
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,920
you dare not touch me alone.

287
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,960
Among the thirteen counties in the empire,

288
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
the Western State has the most troops and horses,

289
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,080
followed by Taiyuan County.

290
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,920
My father is never at the mercy of others.

291
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,520
You want me to cut my hair,

292
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,200
so that I can be trapped justifiably

293
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,360
in the palace

294
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,040
and you can use me to threaten my father.

295
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,880
Of all those in the harem,

296
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,720
you really are the smartest.

297
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,080
Unfortunately,

298
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,960
your man, my son,

299
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,000
is now the late emperor.

300
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,920
Send the concubines to the nunnery.

301
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,400
I'm afraid your marriage with Zixing

302
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,680
will be delayed.

303
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
His Majesty passed away, and all the people are grieving.

304
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,320
How dare I talk about marriage again?

305
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,760
Then you can

306
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,000
stay with me in the palace for a while.

307
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
It's my honor, Your Majesty.

308
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,560
Not really.

309
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,800
You are the only daughter of Cui Wenjun,

310
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,280
the unmarried wife of the Prince of Guangling,

311
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,760
the cousin of the prefectural governor in Taiyuan County,

312
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,080
and the disciple of the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

313
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,520
That's why

314
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,160
I want you to stay in the palace.

315
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,400
I predicted it.

316
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:34,180
[Taiji Palace]

317
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,000
When His Majesty was six years old,

318
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,840
I took his hand

319
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
and walked into Taiji Palace.

320
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,480
Now suddenly

321
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,480
he passed away,

322
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,240
but I'm still here.

323
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,560
Your Majesty, if you are sad,

324
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,560
you might as well go back to your chamber to have a rest.

325
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,160
When the late emperor died,

326
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,280
your uncle

327
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
and three of the royal family

328
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,040
worked together

329
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,800
to help His Majesty ascend the throne overnight,

330
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,000
which helped determine the overall situation.

331
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
Uncle told me about it.

332
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,920
It was a dangerous night.

333
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,320
If they were careless,

334
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,000
they would lose everything.

335
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,280
Tonight, I feel a lot of peace

336
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,920
when there is a member of the Cui family around me.

337
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,240
This is the place where emperors of all dynasties

338
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,120
handled government affairs.

339
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,240
Write three letters for me.

340
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,600
Yes.

341
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,720
This letter was sent to the Junior Prince of Nanchen,

342
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,040
telling him that

343
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,000
His Majesty has passed away

344
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,280
and my grandson is about to succeed to the throne.

345
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,360
The situation in the court is complex.

346
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
Ask him if he can enter the capital alone

347
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,480
as he did before

348
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,600
and kowtow to the new emperor

349
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,600
in front of all the officials.

350
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
Why are you not writing it?

351
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,760
I can't write it.

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,520
Why can't you write it?

353
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,280
Please find another person to do this for you.

354
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,480
I must not

355
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,200
write this letter.

356
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,760
Tell me what you're afraid of.

357
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,480
What do you fear

358
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,240
from a mere letter?

359
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,200
Are you afraid that Zhousheng Chen

360
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,680
will recognize your handwriting,

361
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,680
and venture into the city out of concern?

362
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,640
Do you two

363
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
really love each other secretly

364
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,080
as rumored?

365
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,360
Master treated all the eleven disciples

366
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,560
like relatives.

367
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,160
If my elders were asked

368
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,600
to write this letter today,

369
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,640
as long as Master recognized the handwriting,

370
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,880
he would come to save them for sure.

371
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,600
But if on this day,

372
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,120
my elders were to be present,

373
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,400
then absolutely no one would

374
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,520
do such a thing,

375
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,040
that would put Master at risk.

376
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,960
You're not afraid to die, huh?

377
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,360
Leave it to Your Majesty.

378
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
You're trying

379
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
to conceal

380
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,560
your love for him.

381
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,880
The Junior Prince of Nanchen

382
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,080
is really untidily romantic.

383
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,120
Shiyi,

384
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,920
your uncle saved me twice,

385
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,400
so I won't kill you.

386
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Come here.

387
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,200
If my father finds out

388
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,240
you treated me like this,

389
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
heâ€™ll kill you all.

390
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,960
Your Highness, calm down.

391
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,880
Other concubines

392
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,440
have been sent to a nunnery

393
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,560
and only you're still here,

394
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,680
which shows Her Majesty's

395
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,280
special care for you.

396
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,960
Her Majesty's care for me?

397
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,520
She's just afraid of my father.

398
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,640
Your Highness, as you were a child,

399
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,680
you might not know

400
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,400
the Empress Gao's brother

401
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,400
had more troops than your father.

402
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
But what happened in the end?

403
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,360
He was killed

404
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,120
on a narrow path in the palace.

405
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,640
It's exactly that one you just passed by.

406
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,480
You're honored women.

407
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,040
As long as you don't hurt yourselves,

408
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
no one can do that to you.

409
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,360
Close the door.

410
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,400
How did Empress Dowager Gao's brother die

411
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,640
at that time back then?

412
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,080
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

413
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,040
he was tricked into the palace

414
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,320
by Her Majesty Empress Dowager.

415
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,280
On a path in the palace,

416
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,920
he was surrounded

417
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,480
and strangled by soldiers.

418
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,480
Does Her Majesty want

419
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,440
to deal with my father or your master

420
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,120
using this old trick?

421
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,280
Your Majesty.

422
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,680
How is the situation outside the palace?

423
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,000
The city people are still taking part in the grand ceremony.

424
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,240
It's very crowded and lively.

425
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,760
Hasn't Counselor-in-chief come?

426
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,640
He's on his way.

427
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,960
Close the gate.

428
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,560
Without my instructions,

429
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,720
no one enters the Central State.

430
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,600
Yes.

431
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,300
[Central State]

432
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:24,740
[Central State]

433
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,400
Move it, now.

434
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,720
This is His Excellency Counselor-in-chief's carriage.

435
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,320
You're surrounded.

436
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,440
Who are you?

437
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,560
Nanchen Royal Army.

438
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,620
[Xuanguang Palace]

439
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,400
How boring.

440
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,480
Your Highness,

441
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,320
you don't seem sad about His Majesty's death.

442
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,280
He didn't have me in his heart,

443
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,120
so I am not sad.

444
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,120
But you held a wedding witnessed by heaven and earth

445
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,480
and consummated your marriage.

446
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,760
Do you have no special feeling

447
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,560
for His Majesty?

448
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,080
As he was the emperor,

449
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,160
I married him.

450
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,800
We consummated our marriage

451
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,360
as I wanted to have a son

452
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,680
and be the Empress Dowager.

453
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,600
He has feelings

454
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,680
for Concubine Jiang,

455
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,080
but I had no feelings for him.

456
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,720
My father

457
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,400
will control the whole country

458
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,280
sooner or later.

459
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,200
By then,

460
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,920
he'll be close to death.

461
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,040
It seems

462
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,200
we can only

463
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,720
be allies tonight.

464
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,440
Yes.

465
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,720
You and I are destined to be mortal enemies later.

466
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,800
But before that,

467
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,240
we should first manage to come out of this alive.

468
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,440
Your Highness.

469
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,440
Your Excellency has a clear conscience.

470
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,920
Why do you kneel down?

471
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,720
I,

472
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,680
I finally got to see you, Your Highness.

473
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,480
We'll be saved.

474
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
Qi Zhenzhen wants

475
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,720
to command vassals with her grandson.

476
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,760
No.

477
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,920
In fact, the baby

478
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,520
wasn't His Majesty's son.

479
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,840
Didn't Concubine Jiang give birth to a son?

480
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,080
Yes, she did,

481
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,560
but the baby died that night.

482
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,840
To keep it a secret,

483
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,880
Her Majesty killed

484
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,000
29 people in Concubine Jiang's living palace,

485
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,040
including the imperial doctors, palace maids and chamberlains.

486
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,720
She even killed Concubine Jiang.

487
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,400
I was forced to,

488
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,239
so I didn't dare to resist.

489
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,920
Your Excellency's family is safe in your residence.

490
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,760
Don't say that.

491
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,520
No.

492
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,719
She...

493
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,000
My master doesn't want to look into it.

494
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,920
If you do as he says,

495
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,600
you'll have a chance to redeem your crime in due course.

496
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,199
I'd like to follow His Highness's orders.

497
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,040
From tonight on,

498
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,320
they will follow you

499
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,400
wherever you go.

500
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,560
OK, OK.

501
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,679
What will

502
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,000
she do next?

503
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,840
Help the new emperor ascend the throne and hold court.

504
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,760
Since she wants the new emperor to ascend the throne,

505
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,800
help her do it.

506
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,040
Um...

507
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,679
We should let

508
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,160
a non-existent prince ascend the throne?

509
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,720
Yes.

510
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,160
Do you still remember

511
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,480
how Liu Yuan was executed?

512
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,920
Yes, surely.

513
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,600
Yes, surely.

514
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,080
Do everything as I said.

515
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,200
Don't have an ulterior motive,

516
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,560
or you'll be the first person

517
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,240
who goes to accompany His Majesty.

518
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,760
I'll atone for my past crimes

519
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,080
and act at your command.

520
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,920
Uncle, thank you

521
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,080
for guarding the frontier for my father these past years.

522
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,760
There is a patterned sword and an axe decorated with gold for you.

523
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,200
In the future, report to me at any time you want.

524
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,880
You can go to court by sedan

525
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,280
and enter the hall with a sword.

526
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,200
I only have the wooden sword

527
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,880
Your Majesty gave me with me today.

528
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,480
As your uncle,

529
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,240
I think

530
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,160
you are more important than the throne.

531
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,960
Uncle.

532
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,920
Sorry for not

533
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,960
keeping you safe.

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
Your Majesty.

537
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,440
Your Majesty.

538
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,320
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

539
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,280
Your Majesty. Why did

540
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,080
you die so young?

541
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,560
Your Majesty.

542
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,240
Your Majesty.

543
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,280
Your Majesty.

Your Majesty.

547
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,880
Your Majesty.

548
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,040
Our country can't be without an emperor.

549
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,200
Though His Majesty passed away,

550
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,240
he left

551
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,840
a newly-born son for us.

552
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,160
I think we should

553
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,880
help him ascend the throne

554
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,040
to stabilize the court and appease the people.

555
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,520
Your Majesty.

556
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,200
Your Majesty Empress Dowager,

557
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,760
it concerns the security of our kingdom.

558
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,800
If the newly-born prince

559
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
ascends the throne,

560
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm afraid the vassals will resist and stir up great turmoil.

561
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,440
Your Majesty, please think it over.

562
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,080
It's common for a young prince to ascend the throne in our dynasty.

563
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,400
Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne at 5,

564
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
and the late emperor at 6.

565
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,920
Both of them were assisted by the empress dowager.

566
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,360
Why can't it work that way now?

567
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,600
Not exactly.

568
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,840
Your Majesty,

569
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,200
it was a temporary expedient

570
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,960
for the late emperor to ascended the throne at 6.

571
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,080
The Gao family monopolized the court affairs back then.

572
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,880
If the late emperor didn't ascend the throne,

573
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
then the Central State

574
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,760
would be controlled by the Gao family for sure.

575
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,880
We're not in imminent danger.

576
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,880
Why don't we

577
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,240
choose a man of the right age

578
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,200
from the royal family to be the heir?

579
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,120
The late emperor's remains are scarcely cold yet.

580
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,480
His newly-born son is crying in my chamber.

581
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,160
But you can't wait

582
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,040
to support another now.

583
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,160
Without any selfish motives,

584
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,080
I just think of the interests of our country.

585
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,520
Don't make excuses to me.

586
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,000
Explain to Her Majesty.

587
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,160
Your Majesty.

588
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,400
Prepare for the enthronement.

589
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Yes.

590
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:49,740
[Mingguang Palace]

591
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,840
The Cui family's opposition

592
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,080
upsets me a lot.

593
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,160
After the enthronement, everything will be settled.

594
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,080
It's useless

595
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,200
even if the Cui family opposes us

596
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
together with other prominent families.

597
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,560
But we

598
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,880
can't hide the baby's not existing

599
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,800
for long.

600
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,520
Do you still remember

601
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,800
the deceased Prince of Lintao

602
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,160
has a 5-year-old son

603
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,240
named Liu Zizhen?

604
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,280
Besides Zhousheng Chen,

605
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,920
he's the clansman most closely

606
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,000
related to the late emperor.

607
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,240
I'll bring him into the palace tomorrow.

608
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,760
Your Majesty, after this matter,

609
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,360
you can make an edict to the public that

610
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,880
you were tricked by Concubine Jiang

611
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,080
into believing her pregnancy

612
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,960
and so put

613
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,320
all the blame on her.

614
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,560
But she already died.

615
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,200
People outside the palace don't know it.

616
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,920
Then you can make an edict

617
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,800
sentencing Concubine Jiang to death

618
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,640
and letting Liu Zizhen ascend the throne.

619
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,920
In this way, you can convince

620
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,880
the officials and vassals.

621
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,720
A 5-year-old child

622
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,320
is at your mercy.

623
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm afraid the old officials

624
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,400
wouldnâ€™t believe such an absurdity.

625
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,080
I'm behind you.

626
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,800
Send Liu Zizhen to the palace.

627
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,880
Yes.

628
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,880
You're worried about Shiyi?

629
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Shiyi is in the imperial palace...

630
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,560
Her Majesty knows

631
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,440
she can hold back many forces at play,

632
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
so she won't be in immediate danger.

633
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,280
If so, why are you

634
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,760
still worried?

635
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,280
Go to the Residence of Cui.
