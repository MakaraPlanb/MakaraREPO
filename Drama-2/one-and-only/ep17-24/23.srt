Zhousheng Chen plotted to usurp the throne.

7
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,840

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,660
I'm not here to fight you today.

191
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,540
I just want to give you a piece of advice.

192
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,900
Even if you stay,

193
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,180
you'll not be able to help her.

194
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,980
You would only get yourself killed.

195
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,260
I don't need you

196
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,220
to teach me what to do.

197
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,780
I don't want to talk too much

198
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,060
to an ignoramus either.

199
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,860
I was just trying to help His Highness

200
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,660
keep some strength of the royal army.

201
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,580
This is what I owe him.

202
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,700
Whose side are you on?

203
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,460
It doesn't matter which side I'm on.

204
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,860
I owe Miss Cui two lives.

205
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,780
I owe His Highness a debt of gratitude for not killing me.

206
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,260
If you believe me,

207
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,620
go out of the city for a few days

208
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,660
and wait for my message.

209
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,940
If you don't believe me,

210
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,780
I'll save

211
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,420
Miss Cui myself.

212
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,340
Slow down.

213
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,740
It's okay. It's okay.

214
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,460
Good wine.

215
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,820
Good wine!

216
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,380
You know what.

217
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,300
There was definitely something wrong with that carriage that day.

218
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,460
Yang Shao is very suspicious.

219
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,860
I'll go to the general tomorrow.

220
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,780
Yang Shao, I knew it was you!

221
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,540
What did you say?

222
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,260
He let Zhou Tianxing go?

223
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,620
We followed him out of the city

224
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,940
but Yuan Wuchu ambushed us.

225
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,060
All the men I took died.

226
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,540
Please punish me, Your Highness.

227
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,260
Get out!

228
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,540
That is the person you trusted?

229
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,580
You loser!

230
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,700
He insulted me,

231
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,140
and I have to crown his daughter as my empress.

232
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,780
The territory has already belonged to Your Majesty.

233
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,300
One day, these people

234
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,340
will be eliminated one by one.

235
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,940
Your Majesty.

236
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,060
The blessed moment has arrived.

237
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,780
Kneel!

238
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,980
Hail!

239
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,380
Long live the emperor!

240
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,700
Hail!

241
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,980
Long live the emperor!

242
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,700
Hail once more!

243
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Long live the emperor!

245
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,460
Greetings, Lady Cui.

246
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,580
I've never been friends with Jin Rong.

247
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,660
I wonder what the reason

248
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,020
for your visit is?

249
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,260
I've been entrusted by His Highness from the Western State,

250
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,860
to ask for your help, Lady Cui.

251
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,900
You've made up your mind?

252
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,500
From now on,

253
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,620
I'll leave Wushui to you.

254
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,900
After you return to Qinghe,

255
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,740
don't delay

256
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,820
and move south with them immediately.

257
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,180
Only the people and books matter.

258
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,380
As for the other things, just leave them behind.

259
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,860
What about you?

260
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,300
Shiyi is still trapped in the palace.

261
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,660
Back then, for the sake of the Cui family,

262
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,620
I gave up on her father.

263
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,100
This time, I can't give up my own daughter

264
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,140
for the Cui family again.

265
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,900
Go.

266

267
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,260
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

268
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,420
I'm going back to the palace.

269
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,820
I'm here to say goodbye.

271
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,100
Since you married into our family,

272
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,380
neither I nor Feng

273
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,300
have ever treated you badly.

274
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,020
Now that you're leaving,

275
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,260
I have a favor to ask of you.

276
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,220
As long as I can.

277
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,140
I will do it.

278
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,420
I want to see my daughter.

279
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,620
Is that too much to ask for?

280
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,220
Zixing has been keeping

281
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,620
a very close eye on her.

282
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,180
Several times I have entered the palace,

283
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,660
but I have not been able to see her.

284
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,500
I will try to persuade him

285
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,100
to let you see each other.

286
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,540
Be patient, auntie.

287
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,980
The time will come.

288
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,580

Your Highness.

293
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,260
His Majesty has decreed

294
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,020
Miss Cui shall be conferred with the title of Honored Concubine.

295
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,260
The ceremony shall be held on an auspicious day.

for His Majesty for many years.

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,380
She will be in charge of serving Your Highness in the future.

301
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,460
I'll take my leave.

302
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,940
Your lowly servant greets Your Highness.

303
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,460
You'll give her a conferring ceremony that of the empress?

304
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,300
I have already made you the empress.

305
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,260
You are honored by all the people.

306
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,220
And now you come to make a fuss

307
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,020
about the conferring ceremony of an honored concubine?

308
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
I'm not being petty.

309
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,260
I pity her.

311
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,180
You killed her master and her senior sister.

You put her cousin under siege.

313
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,540
And now you're trying to use this to cover up your sins.

314
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,980
If I were her,

315
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,660
I would wish to eat your flesh

00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,820
If you want to win over those famous clans,

378
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,940
you must make up with Cui Wenjun.

379
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,140
He can't be trusted.

380
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,500
Tomorrow.

381
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,420
You go invite Cui Wenjun to the palace.

382
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,140
Tell her I have a favor to ask of her.

383
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

384
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,780
[Xiye Gate]

385
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,100
The Yang clan of Hongnong

386
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,380
is loyal and modest.

387
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,540
Disciples of theirs are all over the territory.

388
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,900
The Zhangsun clan of Jiyang

389
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,300
is holding the military power.

390
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,860
They are the only ones

391
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,060
who can suppress the rebels inside the Pass.

392
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,420
And the Yuwen clan

393
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,940
often lives in the northwest.

394
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:38,460
Their foundations are much deeper than the Jin clan.

395
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,300
These clans hold the military power.

396
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,500
They are the ones

397
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,060
Your Majesty must win over.

398
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,620
Can you help me

399
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,139
invite them to the capital city?

400
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,500
Candidates for all official positions in the court,

401
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,300
from the Counselor-in-chief to the Praetorian Guard,

402
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,700
can be recommended by you.

403
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,300
As long as you assist me,

404
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,220
the prestige of the Cui family

405
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,300
will only be better than it was before.

406
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,340
As for the Empress Jin,

407
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,820
I had no other choice.

408
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,300
I hope you can understand that.

409
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,940
In my heart,

410
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,460
Shiyi is my real wife

411
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,260
and my only empress.

412
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,060
Then may I ask Your Majesty,

413
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,500
when will I be able to see Shiyi?

414
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,780
Your Majesty won't let anyone near her.

415
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,340
I can understand that.

416
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,460
But I am her mother.

417
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,140
Is Your Majesty worried that

418
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,540
I would harm my own

419
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,260
daughter?

420
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,620
I don't want her to find out about what happened in Pingyin.

421
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,220
Nowadays, everyone knows that

422
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,940
the Junior Prince of Nanchen

423
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,300
was executed for conspiracy.

424
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,340
If that is true,

425
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,980
Shiyi

426
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
will understand your decision.

427
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,580
Or is Your Majesty worried

428
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,700
she doesn't know right from wrong?

429
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,420
Shiyi is sentimental.

430
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm afraid she can't bear this news.

431
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,660
She is sentimental,

432
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,620
but she knows loyalty better.

433
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,780
If you can help me

434
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,500
persuade her to accept this matter,

435
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,020
I'll be grateful.

436
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,980
Meng Luan.

437
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,020
Yes.

438
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,660
Bring her to the Eastern Palace.

439
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,700
Yes.

440
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,460
Lady Cui.

441
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,380
I treat her with sincerity.

442
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,740
I hope

443
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,540
for the sake of your daughter

444
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,380
you won't make her suffer too much.

445
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,580
When getting on the state bed, face forward,

446
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,180
climb from the foot of the bed into the brocade quilt.

447
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,900
From the empress down to the palace maids,

448
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,100
no one is allowed to turn their backs to His Majesty.

449
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,620
The same applies to getting off the state bed.

450
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,420
You should face His Majesty,

451
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,620
and slowly get off the bed from the bottom of the bed.

452
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:03,020
[Luanning Palace]

453
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,460
I will follow you inside.

454
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,100
Those are orders of His Majesty.

455
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,300
You think I don't want to see my own daughter

456
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,700
live happily?

457
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,260
His Highness has already passed.

458
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,980
What's the use for me telling her the truth?

459
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,500
I've seen this country change hands too many times.

460
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,540
I'm done caring about these things.

461
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,020
I just want Shiyi to live a happy life.

462
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,300
I'm glad

463
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,860
that's what you think.

464
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:47,780
[Luanning Palace]

465
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,420
Shiyi.

466
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,860
You don't want to talk?

467
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,100
Let me take a good look at you.

468
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,260
You look like how you were

469
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,780
before you went to the Western State.

470
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,020
Zhousheng Chen has rebelled.

471
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,540
Impossible!

472
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,620
That's impossible, Mother!

473
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,140
Impossible!

474
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,860
Calm down.

475
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,380
You must calm down,

476
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,900
if you want to hear me out.

477
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,180
In the Pingyin Palace,

478
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,860
His Highness plotted a rebellion.

479
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,780
Fortunately, his evil intention was noticed by the Palace Attendant Cui.

480
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,580
Zhousheng Chen was captured.

481
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,260
His Majesty ordered he was to be executed by dismemberment.

482
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,380
The execution lasted three hours.

483
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,260
Yet he didn't even utter a cry of pain

484
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,140
and refused to plead guilty.

485
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,820
Death by dismemberment.

486
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,740
Shiyi.

487
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,740
Death by dismemberment.

488
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,260
Shiyi.

489
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,940
Shiyi, just cry it all out!

490
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,580
I know you can't take it.

491
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,340
I'm here.

492
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,900
Cry out, Shiyi.

493
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,820
Shiyi.

494
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,900

Shiyi.

498
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,140
There are many rules in the palace.

499
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,020
It's not easy for me

500
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,380
to come visit you like this.

501
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,620
Take care of yourself.

502
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,060
Mother, he wouldn't rebel.

503
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,500
He wouldn't rebel.

504
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,020

505
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,500
It's almost time.
