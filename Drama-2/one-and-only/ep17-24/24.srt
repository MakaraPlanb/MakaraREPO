[One and Only]

3
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 24]

4
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,480
Throughout my life,

5
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,680
I've never let anyone down

6
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,240
but Eleven.

7
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,100
[Eleven]

8
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,240
General Cui,

9
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,200
have you decided?

10
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,600
A soldier must be upright above all else, even if it means death.

11
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,720
I believe my parents

12
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,760
will understand and forgive me.

13
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Let's go.

14
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,400
Under the heavens and in front of the three armies,

15
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,080
I make an oath that

16
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,720
I will give up my family name Cui

17
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,120
and give myself the surname of the Junior Prince of Nanchen and follow him.

18
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,080
For the state,

19
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
for the people

20
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,060
and for those generals and soldiers

21
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,420
who sacrificed their lives.

22
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,820
We will start the rebellion in Shouyang today!

23
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:17,440
Rebel! Rebel! Rebel!

24
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,440
That night when my husband left,

25
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,080
it was snowing heavily

26
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,920
in Qinghe,

27
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,800
just like this.

28
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,960
Your Ladyship,

29
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
we've got news from the young master.

30
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,400
He gave up his family name Cui

31
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,800
and started a rebellion in Shouyang.

32
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,080
His Majesty issued an edict to

33
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
offer amnesty and enlistment to the young master

34
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,480
and that he shall not be killed.

35
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Now that he has given up his family name Cui.

36
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,520
Will it displease His Majesty?

37
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,960
Knowing Feng's personality

38
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,960
he will not submit.

39
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,240
Since he has made his decision,

40
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,080
then let him be.

41
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,400
But,

42
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,920
he gave up his family name

43
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,840
at will

44
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,640
to follow the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

45
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,680
How unrestrained he is.

46
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
Yeah.

47
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,440
He's not like us

48
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,600
who have too many worries.

49
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,840
Is there any message from Mr. Huan?

50
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,000
Not yet.

51
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,080
Let's wait for some more days.

52
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,040
Yes.

53
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,600
Your Highness, were you awake all night?

54
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,640
Prepare some tea.

55
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,880
Yes.

56
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,960
It's indeed hard for you

57
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,560
to accept the fact that

58
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,460
the royal mansion has rebelled.

59
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,659
Here, have some water.

60
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,180
Your cousin has also rebelled.

61
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,140
If you don't believe me, you may ask your mother.

62
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,260
Among your six branches,

63
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,940
only Wushui branch

64
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,940
has hundreds of members

65
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,660
taking posts as Royal Guards in the royal court

66
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,180
and posts in different counties and prefectures.

67
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,700
How many people will die

68
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,500
as Cui Feng rebels?

69
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,539
The Gao family was eliminated due to one person.

70
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,940
The Qi family was destroyed due to one person.

71
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,380
Do you want the Cui family

72
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,900
to follow in their footsteps?

73
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,100
Here, drink some water.

74
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,300
Go get breakfast ready.

75
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,060
Yes.

76
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,940
When I was a kid, they said

77
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,940
you were good at Qin and painting.

78
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,580
I planned to ask you to play the Qin

79
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,500
on the day when you are conferred the title.

80
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,500
Now it seems

81
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,140
you won't be able to do it.

82
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,820
I'm going to summon the imperial doctor.

83
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,420
She didn't utter a word before me.

84
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,420
Why doesn't she

85
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
think for me?

86
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,020
He's been a Regional Prince

87
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,980
guarding the Western State for over 20 years.

88
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,530
No emperor would dare to keep him alive!

89
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,240
Your Majesty.

90
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,610
Zhousheng Chen.

91
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,940
But I ordered

92
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,540
him to be killed by dismemberment

93
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,540
in front of all people.

94
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,620
Your Majesty.

95
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,780
She is the Crown Princess,

96
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,740
while I am

97
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,900
a fake Crown Prince.

98
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,660
Do flowers bloom in lunar December?

99
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,180
I saw Shiyi's wound in her hand.

100
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,420
If Your Majesty wants to have the support of

101
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,420
the Yang family and Zhangsun family,

102
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,340
then do not agitate her anymore

103
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,740
before the conferment.

104
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,980
I have only one daughter.

105
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,460
Everything I do is for her.

106
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,740
Lady Cui Wenjun.

107
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,580
She doesn't believe me.

108
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,980
She has been living in the royal mansion for many years.

109
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,020
It's impossible that she would believe in such a short while

110
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,900
that the

111
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,420
royal mansion rebelled against you

112
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,500
If Your Majesty does not have enough patience,

113
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,100
why do you force her to stay in the palace?

114
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,380
I know my daughter the best.

115
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,860
Leave her be for several days.

116
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,700
She will figure it out.

117
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,660
I understand.

118
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,820
Honored Concubine ate a lot in the morning.

119
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,140
She watched the snow in the yard

120
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,410
for an hour.

121
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,100
She also ordered the servants to find a ladder,

122
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,180
intending to go up to the roof of the side palace hall to watch the snow.

123
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,500
But she was stopped by

124
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,500
Lady Li.

125
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,940
As Cui Wenjun said,

126
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,020
she will come to her senses slowly.

127
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,580
Ultimately,

128
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,820
a mother would know their daughter best.

129
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,020
Clean the roof of the side palace hall

130
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,660
and have the Royal Guards stay guard.

131
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,100
Let her watch the snow if she wants to.

132
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,180
From today on, as long as she doesn't go out of the palace,

133
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,860
she can do anything she likes.

134
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,500
Yes.

135
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,380
The royal army is back.

136
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,140
The royal army is back.

137
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,940
Why do you stay in Pinyin?

138
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,580
Flooding of the Jiang State.

139
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,340
The fierce battle in the Shuo State.

140
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,300
Six expeditions to the Dai State.

141
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,340
They all forgot your deeds.

142
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,490
They only remember you were upright, handsome,

143
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,460
and were praised by the people

144
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,940
which threatened them.

145
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,980
I'm here to send the news of victory.

146
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,020
I heard that you didn't sleep well

147
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,500
for more than ten days for it.

148
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,660
Congratulations on the complete victory.

149
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,860
[Throughout my life, I've never let anyone down, but Eleven.]

150
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,860
All your life you had no wife and no children.

151
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,020
And for what?

152
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,820
Your Majesty.

153
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,460
His Majesty ordered that

154
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,020
you can't meet the Honored Concubine.

155
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,340
He became the emperor because of my family.

156
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,220
Don't you know that?

157
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,710
Get out!

158
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,140
The Wushui branch migrated southward secretly.

159
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,460
My father sent troops

160
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,300
to trap them within the border.

161
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,060
No one knows this

162
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,660
besides His Majesty and me.

163
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,420
Your family name is very prestigious

164
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,980
among the scholars.

165
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,660
If your family moves southward,

166
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,300
Beichen will truly perish.

167
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,140
Why do I tell you about this?

168
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,220
Perhaps I want to

169
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,140
threaten you with the lives

170
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,420
of the Cui family,

171
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,520
because I'm afraid you would kill

172
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,980
Liu Zixing on your wedding day.

173
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,260
If so, I wouldn't be able to become the empress.

174
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,500
Or because

175
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,700
we were friends

176
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,060
for a night.

177
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,740
If I were you,

178
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,460
no matter how painful it is,

179
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,140
I must know the whole truth.

180
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,300
Thanks.

181
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,140
In the past,

182
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,860
no Honored Concubine

183
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,820
has had such a grand conferring ceremony.

184
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,180
Others don't know

185
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,460
His Majesty's heart,

186
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,900
but I, as his wet nurse,

187
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,220
knows that he cares very much about you.

188
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,700
You'll be busy for a whole day tomorrow.

189
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,420
Please sleep early.

190
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
-Please.
-Please.

191
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,700
Please.

192
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,780
Everyone.

193
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,180
Lady Cui Wenjun.

194
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,580
It has been a long time since we last met.

195
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,740
General Yang is as strong as before.

196
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,860
Today, Honored Concubine Cui will be conferred with the title.

197
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,660
It's truly something joyous.

198
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,660
Thank you, General Zhangsun.

199
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,140
Though, she's not conferred with the title of empress.

200
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,340
Even if the Jin family has the title of empress,

201
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,580
they can't hold on to it for long.

202
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,020
In our eyes, only Honored Concubine Cui

203
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,360
deserves the position.

204
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,580
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

205
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,260
Generals, please come with me to the palace.

206
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,380
Please.

207
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,980
-Please.
-Please.

208
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,020
It's not until today that I truly think

209
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,980
I will marry you.

210
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,740
Lady Cui Wenjun.

211
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,700
I want to have a word with her Honored Concubine alone.

212
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,260
Yes.

213
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,140
Your father appeared in my dream last night.

214
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,860
He had never shouted at me

215
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,380
from the day when he married me

216
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,340
to when I gave birth to you

217
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,380
and to when he was forced

218
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,980
to leave.

219
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,180
But last night,

220
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,140
he blamed me.

221
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,940
He blamed me for sending you to the palace.

222
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,140
He said if you stayed in Zhousheng Chen's royal palace,

223
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,100
you would have lived a free life.

224
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,300
Shiyi,

225
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,980
I was wrong.

226
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,820
I am sorry.

227
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,260
Mr. Huan is waiting for you in Nanxiao.

228
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,300
When you reach the south,

229
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,020
do not turn back.

230
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,140
Mother,

231
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,340
please forgive my disobedience.

232
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:30,140
[Chengming Gate]

233
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,300
Outside the gate of Great Xia,

234
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,660
there are over 2,000 scholars of well-known families

235
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,980
from places outside the capital.

236
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,060
They are waiting to kowtow to Your Highness.

237
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,020
Greetings, Honored Concubine Cui!

238
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,340
The Prince of Pingqin is waiting for you

239
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,380
behind the scholars.

240
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,380
When they kowtow to you later,

241
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,260
you only need to

242
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,420
run out along the middle path.

243
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,460
The scholars dare not stop you as they don't know about the truth.

244
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,140
The generals and soldiers are all my trusted subordinates.

245
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,500
Today, I will fight a way out

246
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,660
for you.

247
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,180
His Majesty has issued a proclamation.

248
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,540
Honored Concubine Cui was born into a noble family

249
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,580
and has the support of scholars.

250
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,540
Today, she will be conferred the title of Honored Concubine.

251
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,820
People in Beichen are allowed to

252
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,980
pay their respects to her outside the city gate.

253
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,420
Greetings, Honored Concubine.

254
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,660
When Miss Cui runs out later,

255
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,660
we will rush in.

256
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,660
Got it.

257
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,540
Miss Cui.

258
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,420
Why is Miss Cui going back?

259
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,820
She doesn't want to get us into trouble.

260
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,860
Why is the Honored Concubine going up to the palace gate?

261
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,740
I guess she wants to see

262
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,300
the people in the city more clearly.

263
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,740
As a woman,

264
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,180
It's a great honor for her

265
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,020
to be able to go up to the city gates

266
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,740
and be worshiped by the people.

267
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,460
Mom, I know

268
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,480
♫I don't seek glory of the multitude♫

269
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,060
you want to save me

270
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,140
with your own life.

271
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,940
But I can't escape.

272
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,660
♫I only want to have a quiet conscience♫

273
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,020
I can't let you die for me,

00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,380
nor can I put

00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:58,540
♫The horse's hooves sound on the battlefield♫

278
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:07,590
♫I am griping a great ambition in my hand♫

279

♫I don't fear the rain and wind and have an inflexible will♫

280

I, Yang Shao,

281
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,580
will see you off.

282
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:21,250
♫As a general, I may forget any wound on the shoulder♫

283
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:33,880
♫I am willing to stick to a ray of light for a lifetime♫

284

♫Never wish to have my fame spread far and wid♫

285
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,180
Since I went to the Nanchen Royal Mansion,

286
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,420
my master had given me lessons

287
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:59,320
♫Never wish to be the unmatched in the world♫

288
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,780
while my senior brothers and sisters cared about me.

289
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,660
I have never been able to return the favor.

290
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,020
Now my master has died unjustly

291
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:06,310
♫Half of my life is spent guarding the frontier♫

292
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,700
and my senior brothers and sisters have been killed.

293
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,860
My enemy is near to me but I can't kill them.

294
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:13,000
♫Never regret it♫

295
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,260
It is already painful enough.

296
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,340
I really can't marry him.

297
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,520
♫I got ambitions in the palm of my hand♫

298
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,900
I'm sorry for letting you down, mother.

299
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,900
Thank you for raising me up.

300
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:27,170
♫Fearless of hardships, my blood boils♫

301
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,580
Please allow me to

give up my family name Cui.

303
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,260
Please remove my name from the family book.

♫As a general, I may forget any wound on the shoulder♫

305

306

there is no unfilial daughter in the Cui family.

is just Eleven of the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

310
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,420
I haven't figured out how to teach you.

311
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,080
Because you're the first disciple

312
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,380
I accepted seriously.

313
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,580

♫Despite the fierce wind and waves♫

315
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,580
I couldn't call you Master.

316

I will make it up today.

When I come back next time,

try to call me Master, okay?

321
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,300
You may also call me

I've never mentioned him to anyone else

[The third year, Emperor Dongling used the reason that Jin Zhen'er had given birth to a baby]

373
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,940
[to invite Jin Rong to the palace and ambushed him.]

374
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,860
You...

375
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,020
[After Jin Rong died,]

376
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,020
[Empress Donling overtook Honored Concubine Cui as the empress after her death.]

377
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:59,780
[In order to build a good relation with Nanxiao, Princess Xinghua asked to marry there herself.]

378
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:12,540
[Not long after that, vassals from around the world launched an offensive and the Central state is helpless.]

379
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,620
[Empress Dongling is worried and outrageous.]

380
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,380
[And He died in the Palace in the Central State without a son.]

381
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,860
[Three years later, General Zhangsun Jie and Yang Shao negotiated a peace treaty,]

382
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,340
[to support Liu Zizhen as the emperor and help him establish the capital in the Central State.]

383
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,580
Hail!

384
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,660
Long live the emperor!

385
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,620
Hail!

386
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,580
Long live the emperor!

387
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,780
Hail once more!

388
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,380
Long live the emperor!

389
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,460
Kowtow!

390
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:17,060
[Western State]

391
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,660
You don't want revenge anymore?

392
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,780
His Highness was right.

393
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,180
One seeks vengeance as he can't let it go.

394
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,140
I have let it go.

395
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,780
Feng Qiao,

396
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,660
bids you farewell.

397
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,100
Please take care, Advisor Xie!

398
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,580
[Decades years later]

399
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,660
General-in-chief, let me help you.

400
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,300
Leave.

401
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:10,980
Yes.

402
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,820
The generals have left?

403
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,860
Even General Xie wouldn't stay?

404
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,180
He doesn't have any families

405
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,980
in the Western State.

406
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,540
Why would he stay?

407
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,420
General-in-chief.

408
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,460
This is...

409
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,620
No need to introduce me.

410
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,780
Yes.

411
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,900
This is my old friend.

412
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,260
He's about to travel far

413
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,020
and has come here to offer incense.

414
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,580
It seems

415
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,220
you have a close relationship with our temple.

416
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,260
Yeah.

417
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,780
I don't feel safe

418
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,340
if I don't come here before departure.

419
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,340
[Azure Dragon Temple]

420
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,540
This place has been abandoned for a long time.

421
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,690
♫Maybe it's the snow falling without a sound♫

422
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,060
It'll be a good deed if we can rebuild it.

423
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,020
We did some surveying just now.

424
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,980
♫Maybe it's the flower in the mirror without a trace♫

425
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,620
With this place as the axis,

426
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,180
a gate and halls could be built there.

427
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,770
♫I've seen all the scenes of the passing years♫

428
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,500
Front yard.

429
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,420
Back yard.

430
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,180
Around it we can build

431
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,080
♫They're not as good as you, not as good as you♫

432
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,620
Hall of Four Great Heaven Kings.

433
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,100
Hall of Ten Judges of Hell

434
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,460
♫There is grace in your eyebrows♫

435
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,220
and an Arhat Hall.

436
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,990
♫I'll spend my whole life looking for it♫

437
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,830
♫Don't blame me for the sporadic sweet talk♫

438
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,620
Yun.

439
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:24,040
♫I wake up from my dreams and I'm even colder♫

440
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,620
Master, let's go in.

441
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,250
♫My heart that can't stand being away from love♫

442
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,610
♫Hides nothing from you♫

[Azure Dragon Temple]

444
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,800
♫The scene I look down for♫

445
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,970
♫Gets clear after saying goodbye♫

446
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,740
♫Every glimpse means missing you♫

447
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:48,320
♫Even if to be a stranger to you♫

448
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,670
♫Been a mediocre person all my life♫

♫I just want you won't feel sad when looking back♫

451
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,260
♫When everything is calm♫

452
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:12,140
♫I can see who's under the moon♫

♫Turns out we've already been destined♫

[Feel happy to be with you.]
