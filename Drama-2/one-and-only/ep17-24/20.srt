00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,759
Master, we are here.

5
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,160
Xie Yun and Cui Feng haven't arrived yet.

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,000
Xie Yun wrote several letters in a row

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,680
to let us know that he's learned how to ride a horse,

8
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,080
and can lead troops Eastward

9
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
as your vanguard at any time.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
Let him stay in Beichen

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,520
and guard the border.

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,520
I'm just worried

13
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
about Cui Feng.

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,520
The new emperor is about to ascend the throne.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,760
The regional princes and the prefectural governors

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,960
have been called back to the capital city.

17
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Only Cui Feng hasn't responded yet.

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,240
Why don't we have Shiyi

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,720
write him a letter and call him back

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,480
on family matter grounds?

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
What family matter?

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
Don't keep us guessing.

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Just spit it out!

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Asking her cousin to come back

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,720
for her wedding ceremony

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
would be the best excuse.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
You heard nothing.

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:34,920
No.

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
Advisor Xiao is right.

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,200
I'll go write to him right away.

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,400
There's paper and a writing brush here.

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,400
You can write here.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,520
No.

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,000
I need to think

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,440
carefully about how

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,480
to write such a message.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,100
[I'm getting married. Hope you return.]

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
You only came up with

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,520
six characters after all that thinking it over?

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,680
Least said, soonest mended.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,680
These six characters

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,840
are convincing enough for him.

This is a gift

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,079
that His Highness prepared especially for you.

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,960
His Highness said

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
if you don't like it,

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,560
there'd still be time

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,920
to make a new one for you.

52
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,560
This one is fine.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,560
Governor, you looked worried just a minute ago.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,800
What made you smile all of a sudden?

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
My cousin is getting married.

56
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,160
That's a good thing!

57
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,080
And something better

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
is sure to follow.

Wait. Forget it.

he will figure out

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,480
this is a cue that there will be an attack in Taiyuan

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
given that none of the generals

69
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,120

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200

that there was a female general surnamed Feng

120
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,960
under the command of the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

121
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,120
She made great contributions in pacifying the chaos in the west

122
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
and saved thousands of women

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,800
and children from the foreigners' attacks.

124
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200

Okay.

131
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,960
Then I'll leave the palace first.

132
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,400
Thank you, Mother!

133
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,640
Shiyi is one of the Cuis.

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
She should be married off from our residence.

135
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,680
If we let her stay in the Xuanguang Palace,

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,760
according to the rules...

137
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,040
We've already forced her to enter the palace

138

using the so-called rules and rites.

139
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,120
Can't we just humor her once,

the new emperor

150
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,840
so that they can shut people's mouths

151
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,120
and cover the cause of death of the late emperor.

152
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,400
The other princes may turn a blind eye on it,

153
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
but I,

154
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,880
as one who owes much to the late emperor,

155
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,440
can't just let it go!

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Today,

157
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,280
I, Jin Rong, will declare war

158
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,480
for the late emperor

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,480
and for the sake of justice!

160
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,480
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

161
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

162

For the late emperor!

164
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,960
Come to think of it,

165
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,200
I wear armor

166
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,080
much more often

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
than I wear dresses.

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,760
Feng Qiao, you look good in dresses, too!

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,880
Is there anyone in the Taiji Palace tonight?

170
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
I think so.

171
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,280
Then forget it.

172
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,880
You want to go there?

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
With my rank, I'm not allowed in.

174
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,360
But since

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
I'm here already,

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
if I don't go,

177
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,880
I may never have another chance to.

178
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,400
Then let's go right now.

179
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,280
Is it appropriate?

180
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,880
Putting it aside,

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
if you are my family

182
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,920
who stays with me in the palace,

183
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,880
who's to say you can't go there?

184
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,760
Come on!

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,760
Your Highness,

186
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
after tonight,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
she'll become someone's wife.

188
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,800
If you want to see her, why don't you

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,680

She also said

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,080
that she'd do her best

376
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,120
to help the Prince of Guangling and pray

377
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,640
for the people from now on.

378
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
The library was always locked

379
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,560
when I wasn't around.

380
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,080
Since you like to read,

381
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,040
I'll leave the key

382
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,080
to you.

383
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,920
Consider it a gift for establishing our mentorship.

[Xuanguang Palace]

[Chengming Gate]

387
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,400
Here you are!

388
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,960
Hot pepper soup in the snowy Central State!

389
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,400
Please enjoy!

390
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,560
A heavy snow

391
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,480
like this is rarely seen in the south.

392
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,800
When we were in the Western State,

393
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,520
she used to climb on the roof to watch the snow.

394
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,840
Why on the roof?

395
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,840
Because she was the future crown princess.

396
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,160
If it's not necessary,

397
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,720
the palace and the Cuis

398
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,560
wouldn't allow her to show up in public.

399
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,960
When we first met in the Qielan Temple,

400
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,560
she had just arrived at the barracks.

401
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Why aren't you going to the Eastern Palace for her wedding ceremony?

402
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,280
I promised her

403
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,480
that I wouldn't go.

404
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,840
It's the same staying here,

405
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
the same Central State,

406
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,400
and the same snow,

407
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,120
watching her getting married...

408
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Kneel before the mirror.

409
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Your Highness.

410
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,840
What is it?

411
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,520
Can't you wait till the ceremony is over?

412
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,400
What did you say?

413
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,920
Please wait here.

414
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Come on! Attack!

415
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,840
Attack!

416
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,880
General Zhou!

417
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,920
Master!

418
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,960
What happened? Why the rush?

419
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,800
Jin Rong launched an offensive

420
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
and is attacking Henei right now!

421
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,880
Let's go to the barracks outside the town!

422
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,520
Yes!

423
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,920
Miss Cui,

424
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,160
His Highness won't be back so soon.

425
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,160
If you are hungry,

426
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,560
we'll prepare dinner for you.

427
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm not hungry.

428
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,400
Yuan Wuchu! How dare you

429
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,800
kidnap His Majesty?

430
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,240
It's none of your business!

431
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,480
You are overstepping your bounds!

432
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
Take him!

433
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,560
Leave His Majesty!

434
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,520
Kill him!

435
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,840

438
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,120
Don't you feel ashamed to see me?

439
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,760
Your Majesty.

440
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,080
I carried out a half-measure the other day

441
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,440
so that I could find a chance today

442
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,320
to get you out!

443

445
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,080
How am I supposed to trust you?

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,760

453
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,440
would you like to take a rest?

454
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,160
What time is it?

455
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,720
It's past 5 a.m. already.

456
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,400
Day will break soon.

457
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,920
It's winter and it snowed last night.

458
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,200
The day won't break that early.

459
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,720
The Prince of Guangling locked the door

460
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,520
of the Eastern Palace.

461
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000

462
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,800
What is happening?

463
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,960
Go ask them what's going on.

464
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,280
Miss, they said according

465
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,920
to the Prince of Guangling's order, the palace

466
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,840
is now locked and heavily guarded.

467
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,280
No one is allowed in or out!

468
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,520
What happened?

469
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,240
I don't know.

470
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,440
No one in the palace knows.

471
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,720
Miss.

472
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,080
Why is the door locked?

473
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,960
What happened?

474
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,760
I'm not sure.

475
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,000
You've been in the palace.

476
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,200
How is it that you don't know?

477
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,040
I was just sent here

478
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,520
to guard the Eastern Palace yesterday.

479
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,760
She doesn't know

480
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,520
anybody in the palace.

481
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,920
Don't panic.

482
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,720
I already felt strange

483
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,240
when the Prince of Guangling stopped our maids

484
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,480
from entering the Eastern Palace.

485
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,160
Why did he do that?

486
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,160
I think he did it for a specific reason.

487
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,080
What concerns me is that since

488
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,760
the city gate and the palace have all been locked,

489
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
and there's no one

490
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,240
on the street,

491
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,440
we don't know what will happen

492
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,280
in the Central State.

493
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,240
I want my grand-uncle!

494
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,760
I want my teacher!

495
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,920
Be quiet!

496
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,120
If you keep crying,

497
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,520
I'll dethrone you

498
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,640
and appoint another kid to be the emperor!

499
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,840
Your Majesty,

500
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,120
we've arrived.

501
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,120
Let me.

502
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,360
This is

503
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,120
General Jin's military camp?

504
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,920
Yes.

505
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,880
Where's General Jin?

506
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,760
Deeper into the camp.

507
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,720
He's been waiting for you.

508
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,000
Please follow me.

509
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,600
General.

510
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,760
General Jin, thank you for saving me!

511
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,880
Merely empty gratitude.

512
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,800
Take a seat.

513
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,040
Let's share a drink.

514
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,320
I've been sitting all the way here.

515
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I'll stand.

516
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,760
Yang Shao,

517
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,600
pour some wine for Her Majesty!

518
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,600
In the future,

519
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,159
you and I

520
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,679
will stick together.

521
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,800
Then I should

522
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,719
thank you for such recognition!

523
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,760
When will we set off?

524
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,280
Set off?

525
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,080
Where to?

526
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,560
Taiyuan, of course.

527
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,360
Zhousheng Chen is in the Central State.

528
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,840
He might've already sent out army

529
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,840
and is on his way over here!

530
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,960
I know

531
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,760
that you've enlarged your army this year

532
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,320
and you've become much stronger.

533
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,719
But you still need to be careful

534
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,400
when dealing with Nanchen Royal Army.

535
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
Is this

536
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,440
the young emperor who just ascended the throne?

537
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,040
Yes.

538
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,720
It's said that there's an unwritten rule

539
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,600
in the royal family of Liu

540
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,040
that a gold figurine shall be forged

541
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,120
before selecting a future emperor.

542
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,680
If the figurine is forged successfully,

543
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,440
it means he's the chosen one.

544
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Otherwise,

545
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,640
he should be replaced by another.

546
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,280
Your Majesty, I'd like to know

547
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,200
if a figurine was ever made

548
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,120
before this kid became the emperor?

549
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,280
It was an emergency...

550
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
An emergency?

551
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,520
It was just an excuse

552
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,360
you invented to fool people!

553
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,400
I came up with this plan

554
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
to keep the court in order!

555
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,840
You witch, I'm tired

556
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,600
of hearing your nonsense!

557
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,600
Get ready to forge the figurine!

558
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,120
I'll see it myself

559
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,560
whether this kid is

560
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,760
qualified to be

561
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,480
the new emperor!

562
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,640
Let's begin.

563
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,520
Yes.

564
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,080
General.

565
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,160
It failed!

566
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,840
General,

567
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,480
if you don't know how to forge the figurine,

568
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,200
you can ask the Qi clansmen to come here.

569
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,720
I'll let them forge one.

570
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,840
Qi clansmen?

571
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,920
There are no Qi clansmen!

572
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,680
You are lying!

573
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,640
It was the Qi clansmen

574
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,800
who got me out of the Baima Temple.

575
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,960
How could those cowards of your clan

576
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,800
have the guts to save you?

577
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,920
I don't mind

578
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,560
telling you the truth before killing you!

579
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
It's me

580
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,080
and the Prince of Guangling

581
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,480
who saved you!

582
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
Liu Zixing?

583
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,200
If it hadn't been for his Royal Guards,

584
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,520
we couldn't have been able

585
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,080
to take this kid away!

586
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,360
You...

587
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,040
Thanks to you, the Qi clan

588
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,720
has been enjoying wealth and glory.

589
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,360
And now,

590
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,760
it's time for them to go to hell along with you!

591
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,440
Guards,

592
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,120
throw her and this fake emperor

593
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,600
into the river to feed the fish!

594
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,080
How dare you, Jin Rong!

595
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,200
I'm the grand empress dowager!

596
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,880
Let me go!

597
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,560
What are you doing?

598
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,880
-Let me go!
-Let me go!

599
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,720
Prince of Taiyuan! Prince of Taiyuan!

600
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,160
Let go of me!

601
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,520
Prince of Taiyuan!

602
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,280
Prince of Taiyuan!

603
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,720
Prince of Taiyuan!

604
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,200
I don't wanna die!

605
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,640
Help!

606
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,240
Help!

607
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,960
Help!

608
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Help!

609
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,640
Help!

610
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,200
Hold on!

611
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Help!

612
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,520
Put him down.

613
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,560
Take the dragon robe off

614
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,320
of this kid emperor

615
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,800
and send it to the Central State.

616
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,200
As for this kid,

617
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,000
he's still useful to me.

618
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,520
Take him to my mansion

619
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,840
and let my wife watch over him.

620
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,480
Yes!

621
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,640
Come on.

622
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,640
General Yuan.

623
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,840
General Jin.

624
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,360
You've been watching the whole time.

625
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,760
Is it because the regent

626
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,920
is afraid that I'd betray him?

627
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
General, you misunderstood.

628
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
He said Qi Zhenzhen

629
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
poisoned his brother to death

630
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,280
and he hated her,

631
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,480
so he asked me to confirm her death

632
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,160
to put his mind at ease.

633
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,920
I didn't expect

634
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
that the regent

635
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,920
was that close to the late emperor.

636
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,240
I didn't know either.

637
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,240
Come on, let's go have a drink.

638
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,640
General Yuan,

639
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
have a drink with me.

640
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,720
Cheers!

641
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,200
Cheers!

642
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,360
It feels good!

643
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,320
Qi Zhenzhen has bullied me for years.

644
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,560
Today,

645
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,840
I finally took revenge on her!

646
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,560
General!

647
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,160
We lost the battle in Henei.

648
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,120
We didn't even withstand for three days?

649
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,880
No.

650
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,520
Where's Zhousheng Chen right now?

651
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,920
300 miles away from here.

652
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,720
Withdraw!

653
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,640
Did

654
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,200
Jin Rong launch an attack?

655
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,520
Your Highness.

656
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,320
Your Highness.

657
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,280
Sorry

658
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,640
that I had you worried these days.

659
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,040
What happened exactly?

660
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,720
Jin Rong launched an offensive in Henei.

661
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,320
Uncle went to fight against him.

662
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,400
Where's my cousin?

663
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,440
How is he doing?

664
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,080
Based on my informant,

665
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,280
Cui Feng left

666
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,600
Taiyuan days ago,

667
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,400
but his whereabouts still remain unknown.

668
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
If he left days ago,

669
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,640
he could be hiding somewhere

670
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,320
and waiting to meet my Master.

671
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,800
When my uncle returns,

672
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,760
he may have an update for you.

673
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,480
If Jin Rong is attacking Henei,

674
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,920
why is the Eastern Palace locked?

675
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,200
The Royal Guards colluded with the Qi clan and rebelled.

676
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,800
After my uncle left for the battle,

677
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,640
they kidnapped His Majesty

678
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,080
and joined Jin Rong's army.

679
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,080
His Majesty is kidnapped?

680
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,800
When my uncle left,

681
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,080
he asked General Zhou and the Royal Guards

682
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,640
to protect the palace.

683
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,200
General Zhou...

684
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,880
What happened to him?

685
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,080
He was badly injured

686
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,400
and he's still in a coma.

687
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,160
Shiyi!
