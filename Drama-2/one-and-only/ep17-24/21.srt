[Episode 21]

4
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,420
Your Highness.

5
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,060
Your Highness.

6
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,180
You must've been worried

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,380
for the past few days.

8
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,820
What exactly happened?

9
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,660
Jin Rong attacked Henei.

10
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,060
My uncle led an army to suppress the rebellion.

11
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,340
What about my brother Cui Feng?

12
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,220
How is he?

13
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,940
According to the spies,

14
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,980
Governor Cui left

15
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,420
Taiyuan County earlier.

16
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,140
We still have no idea where he is now.

17
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,860
If he left early,

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,340
he's probably hiding somewhere,

19
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,100
waiting to meet up with my Master.

20
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,700
When my uncle returns,

21
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,500
he may have news about him.

22
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,260
If he attacked Henei,

23
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,660
why is the Eastern Palace locked up as well?

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,060
The Royal Guards joined the Qi family in rebellion.

25
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,740
After my uncle led the army out,

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,579
they took the opportunity to kidnap His Majesty

27
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,860
and went to Jin Rong for shelter.

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,780
His Majesty was kidnapped?

29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
After my uncle left,

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,140
he ordered General Zhou and the Royal Guards

31
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,420
to protect the city together.

32
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,980
General Zhou...

33
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,780
What happened to him?

34
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,980
He is seriously injured

35
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,260
and hasn't woken up yet.

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Shiyi.

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,900
He's in my uncle's chambers.

38
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,140
If you want to go…

39
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,500
Meng Luan, summon the imperial doctor.

40
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,060
The imperial doctor has already seen His Highness.

41
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,580
His Highness hasn't slept for days

42
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,620
and said that

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,820
he would only go to rest

44
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,060
after seeing you.

45
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,500
Let me bring you to your room.

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,460
Get some shut-eye.

47
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,220
Rest for a while.

48
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,220
Shiyi.

49
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,940
Don't go.

50
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Xiao Yan.

51
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,020
I'm actually no different from you.

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,260
I'm not close

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,940
with my family.

54
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,760
Tonight,

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
let's guard here

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,040
and send Zizhen's soul off.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
Are you feeling better?

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,240
Am I having a fever?

59
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,200
I'll get the imperial doctor.

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
I'm showing you my weakness.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Can't you see?

62
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll ask Meng Luan to come.

63
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,600
I've been waiting for a long time.

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,960
Attendant Cui is outside the palace

65
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,200
waiting to see Your Highness.

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,120
Let him in.

67
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,880
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,440
I'll go back to Xuanguang Palace first.

69
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,200
Your Highness.

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Your Highness.

71
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,159
Spread the news of His Majesty's death

72
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,000
to the Central State in three days.

73
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,200
Jin Rong has shown me his sincerity

74
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,240
with their lives.

75
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,040
Attendent Cui.

76
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,960
How will you show your loyalty?

77
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,800
I...

78
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll show my loyalty

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,280
with only one sentence.

80
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,120
Zhousheng Chen

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,720
is a great threat.

82
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,360
If you don't get rid of him,

83
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,800
it'll be hard for you to rule.

84
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Master.

85
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,680
I would like to lead the scouting camp

86
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,960
into Taiyuan County first.

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
Be careful.

88
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,560
Yes, Master.

89
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
Cui Feng is now in the hands of Jin Rong.

90
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,320
Only a few generals know about this.

91
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,640
Don't reveal it to anyone else.

92
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,740
[Hall of the Heavenly Kings]

93
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,080
When will you take me to the Eastern Palace?

94
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,480
Be patient.

95
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,520
It's not the time yet.

96
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,640
I can wait.

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,760
You and her haven't even gone through the ceremony yet anyway.

98
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
Why did you make the move early?

99
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,280
I have no idea either.

100
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,560
You gave the order

101
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,920
to make the move early?

102
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,240
She's a member of the Cui family.

103
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
If the two of you got married,

104
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
who would recognize me as the Empress?

105
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
Whatever the case,

106
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,920
as long as you're not on the throne,

107
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,320
you can't marry her.

108
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
You are Liu Hui's Honored Concubine.

109
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,760
I must first find a good reason

110
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,960
to marry you,

111
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,640
let alone the serious task of making you the empress.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,720
Even if you list hundreds of reasons,

113
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
you can't convince me.

114
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,240
Liu Zixing.

115
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
The Jin's army

116
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
is fighting for you in the frontlines.

117
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
I hope you don't let us down.

118
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,760
Fine.

119
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,120
I promise you.

120
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,580
[Xuanguang Palace]

121
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,360
Your Highness.

122
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,880
Have a seat, I'll ask someone to prepare tea.

123
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,480
No need.

124
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
I'll leave shortly after telling you something.

125
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,080
Have a seat.

126
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,480
His Majesty has passed away.

127
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,600
When?

128
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
Nanchen Royal Army reported it secretly today.

129
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,640
He was still a child.

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,120
Your uncle has submitted a letter,

131
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,600
wishing I'd take the throne.

132
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,840
Do you disapprove?

133
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,320
You and I are destined to be married.

134
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,040
You can tell me anything.

135
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,080
Do you wish to hear the truth, Your Highness?

136
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,240
The emperor's career is unpredictable and always changing.

137
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,280
In a short period of time,

138
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,080
two young masters have been replaced in the Central State.

139
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,400
The people's support accumulated over the years

140
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
has been depleted.

141
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,840
The choice of the next emperor

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,320
must be chosen with great scrutiny.

143
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,400
Not to mention,

144
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
Your Highness is not the Crown Prince.

145
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,480
I was

146
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,000
once considered the future emperor.

147
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
I was considered the future emperor.

148
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,240
I was considered the crown prince.

149
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I don't blame you for forgetting it.

150
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,160
No one has ever taken it seriously

151
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,280
except for me.

152
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,920
When I was brought into the palace,

153
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,040
my father had no army to command and no power to win.

154
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
That was why he had no capacity to fight power for me.

155
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,280
What I've achieved thus far

156
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,200
is all my own efforts.

157
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
Perhaps in your mind,

158
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,080
my uncle is the best candidate.

159
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,840
I've never thought so.

160
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,320
My master has little interest in the throne…

161
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,040
You should call him “uncle”

162
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,720
as I do.

163
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,480
Do you know why

164
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,360
your maid wasn't allowed to enter the palace?

165
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,240
She has been with you for nearly ten years in the Western State.

166
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,120
Her presence

167
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,840
would remind you of the Western State,

168
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,570
thus you'd talk about it

169
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,360
and forget

170
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
who you belong to.

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
I had no selfish intent

172
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
when I said those things.

173
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,080
It's not appropriate to

174
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,080
talk about marriage for the time being.

175
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
Let's postpone our marriage

176
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,760
for now.

177
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,600
It's just a show

178
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,720
to appease the Jin family.

179
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,000
Your Highness, why are you so distressed?

180
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,560
My heart is tormented more than hers

181
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,840
when I see her suffer.

182
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
Take them all away!

183
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,360
Stop!

184
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,920
Xinghua.

185
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,800
They are my parents

186
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,760
and siblings.

187
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,240
Don't you know that?

188
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,520
The Qi family is guilty of the most heinous crimes.

189
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,920
Nine generations of its clan shall be executed,

190
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,240
including you, Princess.

191
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,400
You dare to hurt me?

192
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,760
Why don't I?

193
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,080
If it weren't for your high status,

194
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,840
I wouldn't have come to get you myself!

195
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,480
How dare you! Let me go!

196
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,840
General Li! General Li!

197
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
Hold on, General Li!

198
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,040
General Li!

199
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,280
May I have a word?

200
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,240
General Li!

201
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,600
The Prince of Guangling had given orders.

202
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,880
Seeing how loyal the Cui family has been,

203
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,240
the wife of Governor Cui,

204
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,080
Qi Xinghua shall be pardoned.

205
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,160
To execute the Qi family

206
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
is the consensus of all ministers.

207
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Do you

208
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,560
want to protect her?

209
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,480
Yes.

210
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,120
I want to protect her.

211
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,960
She is not only from the Qi family.

212
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,880
She's also our Cui family's daughter-in-law.

213
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,240
General-in-chief.

214
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,200
Can you let a member of the Cui family go?

215
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,280
Since you said so,

216
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,680
I'll accept this royal order.

217
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,560
Take them away.

218
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,240
Go! Go!

219
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,400
Let them go!

220
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,880
Xinghua! Xinghua!

221
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,800
Xinghua!

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Mother!

223
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Xinghua!

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,760
Mother!

225
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,600
Xinghua!

226
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,440
You can't save them.

227
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,840
I…

228
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,440
I'll go beg the crown prince.

229
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,200
Wenjun.

230
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,240
Princess Xinghua…

231
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,440
The Residence of Cui is not seeing any guests today.

232
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
Ask this guest to leave.

233
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,680
Yes.

234
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,040
This way please.

235
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,080
Brother Zixing.

236
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,280
I beg you to giver orders

237
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,140
to release my parents and other families.

238
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,540
Why did you barge into the palace?

239
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,500
They wouldn't let me see you.

240
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,420
They said it was your order.

241
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,220
I did give the order.

242
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,140
I have my own reasons

243
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,780
for not seeing you.

244
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,180
Executing the Qi family to calm the people's anger

245
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,500
is already a foregone conclusion.

246
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,819
You should stay in the Residence of Cui

247
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,900
for your own sake.

248
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,099
You...

249
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,140
You want to pave your way to the throne

250
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,660
with the blood of the Qi family?

251
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,860
Qi Zhenzhen has done evil for more than ten years.

252
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,020
She has offended everyone.

253
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,980
It's not that I want them to die.

254
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,980
It's that no one wants them to live.

255
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,820
Stay at the Residence of Cui.

256
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,780
After things have settled,

257
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,420
I'll find a way out for you.

258
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,180
But they are my own parents,

259
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
how can I hide?

260
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,740
I can't just stand by and

261
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,260
watch them die.

262
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,140
Brother Zixing.

263
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,820
Please help me.

264
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,500
Can you do something?

265
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,180
Brother Zixing!

266
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,660
I can only protect you.

267
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,060
I'll send her back to the Residence of Cui.

268
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,780
Your Highness.

269
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,020
Did the cold wake you?

270
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,940
I'm feeling fine.

271
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,380
Come sit down.

272
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,900
Where's Shu?

273
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,100
I came here in the morning

274
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,860
and saw that the fire was burning weak.

275
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,580
Go and prepare breakfast.

276
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,900
Since I entered the palace,

277
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,700
I've never had breakfast

278
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,980
with Your Highness.

279
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,700
Go now!

280
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:48,100
[Xuanguang Palace]

281
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,140
Yes.

282
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Let's go inside.

283
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,380
It's cold outside.

284
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,780
You're cold.

285
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,820
I was wrong, Shiyi.

286
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,060
I'm used to being alone in the palace,

287
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
so I don't know how to get along with people.

288
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,060
I mean...

289
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,540
Get along in a normal way.

290
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,420
Give way.

291
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,980
Give way.

292
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
What's going on now?

293
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,100
Is the enemy already here?

294
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,460
Don't panic!

295
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,980
I bring news of victory from the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

296
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,500
His Highness conquered Taiyuan County

297
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,620
and has won every battle.

298
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,260
The rebels are defenselessly

299
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,340
and fleeing in disarray.

300
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,780
Junior Prince of Nanchen! Junior Prince of Nanchen!

301
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,100
Junior Prince of Nanchen! Junior Prince of Nanchen!

302
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,020
[Central State]

303
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,340
If Master refuses to enter the city,

304
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,260
I'll have no reason to see Shiyi.

305
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
General Feng.

306
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,860
Are you worried about Miss Cui?

307
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,420
Why do you say I'm worried?

308
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,820
Though I can't see

309
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,260
the sun or the moon,

310
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
I am able to see through people's hearts.

311
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,340
The night before Shiyi got married,

312
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,660
we talked all night.

313
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,780
I felt upset for her.

314
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,100
Xie Chen.

315
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,860
Would you perform a divination for me?

316
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,260
About Shiyi's marriage.

317
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,380
I have done so already.

318
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,260
How is it?

319
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,060
Not very good?

320
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,060
It wasn't accurate.

321
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,900
How can you not be good at divination?

322
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,540
In the horoscope,

323
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,980
she's not destined to get married.

324
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,340
That does sound inaccurate.

325
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,140
Actually, that Liu Zixing

326
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,580
treats her very well.

327
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,340
I can tell.

328
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,940
What you see may not be true.

329
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,380
Where is the royal army now?

330
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,660
Just outside the Central State.

331
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,780
They're already back?

332
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,380
That's right.

333
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,180
They came back to recuperate for a few days before heading out again.

334
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,140
Why didn't they enter the city?

335
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,500
It's my master's habit.

336
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,260
They prefer to station their troops outside the city.

337
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,900
They did the same thing in the Western State.

338
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,980
What a pity.

339
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,740
The people were eager to see the royal army.

340
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,500
What else did you overhear?

341
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,780
They say

342
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,820
the Junior Prince of Nanchen wants to

343
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,100
completely eradicate the Jin rebels.

344
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,140
He has sent a royal order

345
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,020
to have all the county governors to send troops.

346
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Does that mean

347
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,460
the Prince of Pingqin is coming too?

348
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,260
Help me ask around again.

349
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,820
I want to see if the Prince of Pingqin is coming to the capital this time.

350
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,940
What are you laughing at?

351
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,700
If you want to know these,

352
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,060
just ask His Highness.

353
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,820
They came to the capital to quell the rebellion,

354
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,700
yet all I think about is catching up with an old friend.

355
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,940
It wouldn't be appropriate.

356
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,140
Forget it, ignore my request.

357
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,940
[Central State]

358
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,460
Hold it!

359
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
Where are you from?

360
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,100
What's your intention?

361
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,060
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

362
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,820
Prince of Pingqin, don't be angry.

363
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,740
He's a newcomer.

364
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,580
He doesn't know the rules.

365
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,140
Come here.

366
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,060
Well…

367
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,140
What are you afraid of?

368
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,540
Yes, yes.

369
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,980
Your Highness.

370
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,500
How do you know me?

371
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,180
[Ping]

372
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,620
You saw the flag.

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,580
Yes.

374
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
So anyone

375
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,620
who has a piece of cloth and makes a flag

376
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,180
can pretend to be me?

377
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,020
What if I'm a fake?

378
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,220
What if you let me in the Central State

379
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,100
and I have all the dignitaries

380
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,140
beheaded?

381
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,420
I was wrong.

382
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,660
Get up.

383
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

384
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,660
Whose soldiers are you?

385
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,140
Replying to Your Highness,

386
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm a member of the Royal Guards.

387
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,380
Who does the Royal Guards obey?

388
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,460
The Prince of Guangling.

389
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,260
The Prince of Guangling?

390
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,100
How old is he?

391
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,820
Has he ever led an army?

392
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,380
He dares to take over the government now?

393
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,580
Your Highness.

394
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,660
Prince of Guangling.

395
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,540
The Prince of Guangling is a member of the Liu clan.

396
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,460
Shut it!

397
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,580
You can tell what a general is like by observing his soldiers.

398
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
Seeing how weak you are,

399
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,900
I know he's never fought before.

400
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,820
Let's go!

401
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:17,060
[Central State]

402
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,020
Go, go, go!

403
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,700
I've been vexed all the way.

404
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,980
Tell me

405
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,220
why did you give up my sister-in-law to someone else?

406
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
We're not

407
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,460
in that kind of relationship.

408
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,660
You won't tell me the truth, huh?

409
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,580
Monk, you say something.

410
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,140
I don't know secularities.

411
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,500
You don't know secularities?

412
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,900
When you were in Nanxiao,

413
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,420
you had a bunch of wives and concubines.

414
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,540
There were girls throwing flowers at your carriage

415
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,540
when you went out.

416
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,140
You were a flirtatious prince.

417
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,660
You don't know secularities?

418
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,780
It seems that the Prince of Pingqin

419
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,580
knows a lot about me.

420
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,220
You follow my sworn brother,

421
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,380
shouldn't I investigate your background?

422
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,140
You should.

423
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,580
Well...

424
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,940
In my opinion,

425
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,340
since your last name isn't Liu anymore,

426
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,140
you're no longer in chains.

427
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,020
Why not…

428
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,060
What have they given you?

429
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,900
Aside for making you vow

430
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,420
to fight for them,

431
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,020
what else did they give you?

432
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,460
They only gave you this.

433
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,380
But even that you gave to me.

434
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,160
It's a precious thing.

435
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,320
Of course it's precious.

436
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,000
With this,

437
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,800
the government gave me a thousand war horses.

438
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,280
In Beichen,

439
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,640
only with war horses could I recruit soldiers.

440
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,280
This is how

441
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,920
I worked my way up.

442
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,280
He is my sworn brother

443
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
and more importantly, my confidant.

444
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,560
Most of His Highness' friends

445
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,440
were once helped by him.

446
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,720
Don't you think it's a pity?

447
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Don't you have regrets?

448
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,360
How about we talk business first?

449
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,200
Go ahead.

450
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,800
Go ahead.

451
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,000
Business... business...

452
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,040
Tomorrow, my royal army

453
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,470
and the reinforcements from the regional princes will go first.

454
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,270
I'll leave the Central State to you.

455
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,080
I'll guard the Central State?

456
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,040
Yes.

457
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,610
I've brought

458
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,420
all the best soldiers.

459
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,480
Those Regional Princes are all

460
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,200
slimy characters.

461
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,050
There is no way

462
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,370
they would give you their elite.

463
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
That's precisely why

464
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,260
you need to defend the city.

465
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,880
I don't understand.

466
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,210
If you were only called to the capital,

467
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,690
someone would surely suspect

468
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,160
you and I were joining forces

469
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,530
to take over the empire.

470
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,920
That's why I've summoned

471
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,720
reinforcements from all the Regional Princes

472
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,480
to make it not so suspicious.

473
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,560
What…

474
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,480
It's just an expedition…

475
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,640
You've really thought about everything.

476
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Once we leave tomorrow,

477
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,880
the people of the capital

478
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,120
will go under your protection.

479
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,600
And her?

480
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,680
Well.

481
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,960
Before you go on your expedition,

482
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,880
let's go see Eleven.

483
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,480
It's not proper.

484
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,680
What's so improper about going to see your disciple?

485
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,480
Are you kidding?

486
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,480
I will take you there.

487
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,880
Forget it.

488
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,560
You're asking me for help,

489
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,000
and not the other way around.

490
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,560
You entrusted me with the Central State.

491
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,840
So, you have to do

492
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,750
whatever I want you to do.

493
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,800
Good timing, Feng Qiao.

494
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,190
Feng Qiao, go with us

495
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,040
to the place we're going later.

496
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,280
You can avoid suspicion

497
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,680
with a female disciple there.

498
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,600
Monk! Monk!

499
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,000
You'll come with us too.

500
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
It'll be better with the monk there too.

501
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,360
Let's go.

502
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,960
Come with me! Let's go!

503
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,000
Come on, come with me!

504
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,080
Let's go!

505
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Eleven!

506
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,560
Cui Eleven!

507
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,920
Your sworn brother is here!

508
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,800
Come out!

509
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,880
Master.

510
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,920
I was wondering

511
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
who here in the palace would call me Eleven.

512
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,040
In my eyes, you are

513
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,520
always that little girl who couldn't speak

514
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,370
in Nanchen royal mansion.

515
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,760
Shu, prepare some tea.

516
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,320
Yes.

517
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,960
No, I'll do it myself.

518
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,120
Come in.

519
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,570
No one comes here normally.

520
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,600
So it's a bit messy.

521
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,240
It's hot.

522
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,720
Want some more?

523
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,920
That's enough.

524
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,920
When did you guys get here?

525
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,880
Half an hour ago.

526
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,720
They said it was improper to see you.

527
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,520
What's so improper about this?

528
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,720
You see?

529
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,480
We've come in, right?

530
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,120
Prince of Pingqin has great power.

531
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,000
Who dares to mess with you?

532
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,880
That's true.

533
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,440
When will you go on the expedition, Master?

534
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,600
Tomorrow.

535
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
So soon?

536
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,920
Yes.

537
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:12,960
What?

538
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,280
Do you worry about us?

539
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,320
When have we ever lost a battle?

540
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,960
For outsiders, the royal army

541
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,790
is invincible.

542
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,280
But to me,

543
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,640
those who fight in the battlefield

544
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,050
are my closest relatives.

545
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,440
Every time you guys go on an expedition,

546
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,220
I would be worried sick.

547
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,680
It's like that every time.

548
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,080
I know.

549
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:51,380
[Xuanguang Palace]

550
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,640
Take care.

551
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,560
May Master

552
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,120
live up to the people's expectations and be invincible.

553
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,040
May all the generals

554
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,400
live up to the royal orders and be victorious.

Only without worries,

568
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,300
would someone

569
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:19,420
♫It's hard to leave him unattached♫

570
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,420
become fearless

571
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,340
and risk their lives on the battlefield.

572
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,300
Your Highness! Your Highness!

573
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,620
Your Highness! Your Highness!

574
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,140
Your Highness! Your Highness!

575
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,700
Please come back safely!

576
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,460
Your Highness!

577
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,420
Come back safely!

578
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,460
[Baima Temple]

579
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,659
If I pray with you,

580
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,460
whose relatives

581
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,900
do you think will win?

582
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,580
Why are you here?

583
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,219
I'm a hostage.

584
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,739
I've been living in the Baima Temple for a long time.

585
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,100
You haven't answered my question.

586
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,260
Which side of us will win?

587
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,820
Nanchen Royal Army has never been defeated.

588
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,660
What if they lose?

589
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,580
The Junior Prince of Nanchen

590
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,220
fought in wars ever since he was 13 years old

591
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,780
and he has never been defeated.

592
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,180
Since Jin Rong rose to power,

593
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,780
only news of victory

594
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,860
has been sent to the Central State.

595
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,180
Princess Consort.

596
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,540
Another news of victory?

597
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,860
General Zhou is awake.

598
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,460
Tianxing.

599
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,500
You're awake.

600
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,300
I'll do it.

601
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,260
Oh, right.

602
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,780
I heard that Master and his men

603
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,140
had marched to Taiyuan.

604
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,380
Yes.

605
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,220
They've won every battle.

606
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,140
What about your elder brother?

607
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,420
Is he safe?

608
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,940
I haven't heard from him.

609
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,900
Here.

610
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,420
Your Highness.

611
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,820
What did General Jin say?

612
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,460
He's begging me to save him.

613
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,780
He's been trapped by my uncle for 16 days.

614
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,860
His army has run out of food.

615
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,140
They'd have to eat each other if it continues.

616
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,700
Your father has lost the battle.

617
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,820
Your Highness wants to abandon us?

618
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,900
How can you tell?

619
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,780
Though Zhousheng Chen won,

620
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,500
it won't stop you from ascending to the throne.

621
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,500
You will be the emperor for sure.

622
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,540
That is why you

623
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,340
won't care about my father.

624
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,740
Why are you keeping quiet?

625
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,860
You must be thinking of how to get rid of me!

626
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,300
Would you hide me away quietly?

627
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,500
Or just kill me?

628
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,740
I want you to go to Taiyuan County

629
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,220
to persuade your father to surrender.

630
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,620
Impossible.

631
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,620
My father would rather die than surrender.

632
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,520
Only by persuading him to surrender

633
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,940
can you survive.

634
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,520
All of you are useless!

635
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,900
You can't even stop Zhousheng Chen

636
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,620
for half a month!

637
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,660
Get out!

638
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,700
Yuan Wuchu!

639
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,500
I'm here.

640
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,180
Go.

641
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,740
Bring that man here.

642
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,420
Yes.

643
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,820
Prefectural Governor Cui.

644
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,740
Are you still not kneeling?

645
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,220
I in my life

646
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,780
only kneel to my parents,

647
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,180
His Majesty

648
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,180
and the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

649
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,940
You've been in the Nanchen Royal Army for many years.

650
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,780
You know them best.

651
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,660
If you are willing to help me,

652
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,580
I will share half of

653
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,500
the realm with you.

654
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,420
Bring him back.

655
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,460
Force Zhousheng Chen to retreat.

656
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:43,980
Yes!

657
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,570
It's no better than

658
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,260
the Northwest here.

659
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,580
Yesterday,

660
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,300
the war horses were so cold

661
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,820
that they forgot how to eat grass.

662
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,740
It's already December.

663
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,940
It should be getting cold.

664
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,860
I really want to go back to the Western State

665
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,380
to have a bowl of lamb soup.

666
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,540
-That's right.
-That's right.

667
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,300
That's true.

668
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,340
It's been a long time since I've had

669
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,700
a bowl of lamb soup from my hometown.

670
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,940
That's right.

671
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,220
-Have a bowl of lamb soup.
-General.

672
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,420
General, they've brought a man out,

673
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,580
saying it's Prefectural Governor Cui.

674
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Scouting Camp.

675
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
Follow me!

676
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,060
Yes.

677
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,540
General Cui.

678
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,100
Xiaoyu.

679
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,980
I can't believe he's still alive.

680
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,020
They want us to withdraw our troops and return to Pingyin

681
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,780
before they'll let General Cui go.

682
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,780
General Feng.

683
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,540
What do you think?

684
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,900
Say something!

685
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,940
Xiaoyu.

686
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,100
Do you remember our

687
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,910
battle in Shouyang?
