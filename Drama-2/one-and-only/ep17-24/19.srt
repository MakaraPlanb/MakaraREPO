[Episode 19]

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,160
You're worried about Shiyi?

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Shiyi is in the imperial palace...

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,840
Her Majesty knows

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,840
she can hold back many forces at play,

8
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,400
so she won't be in immediate danger.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,600
If so, why are you

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,200
still worried?

11
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Go to the Residence of Cui.

12
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,740
[Residence of Grand Mentor]

13
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,420
Your Highness.

14
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,940
How did you enter the city?

15
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,579
I've been here the whole time.

16
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,660
I came here for this.

17
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
My troops

18
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,820
in the Central State

19
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,620
can only control the imperial palace,

20
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,460
they can't dominate the whole city.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,740
So it must be solved in the imperial palace

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,500
to prevent the vassals from finding out

23
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,579
and rebelling.

24
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,460
So you plan to...

25
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,740
Enthrone a new emperor and dethrone the empress dowager.

26
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,500
When can you set us free?

27
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,420
These days Her Majesty

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
is busy with the enthronement,

29
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,500
that she has no time for you.

30
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,060
Don't worry.

31
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,900
When Her Majesty is free,

32
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,900
she will see you.

33
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,579
Who will ascend the throne?

34
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,940
The son

35
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,900
of Concubine Jiang.

36
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,940
What are you worried about?

37
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,740
After the enthronement,

38
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,500
all the vassals and prefectural governors

39
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,020
will receive the imperial edicts.

40
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,220
Do you worry that your master will come to a bad end like Empress Gao's brother

41
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,380
after entering the capital city?

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,820
Aren't you worried?

43
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,980
My father has many children,

44
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,380
so he doesn't care about me.

45
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,220
He has been on the ascent recently.

46
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,380
Even an imperial edict

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,860
can't summon him to the capital city,

48
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,820
because he worries he'll be ambushed in the Central State.

49
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,060
So it's impossible for him

50
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,940
to come to save me.

51
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,180
I have become the grand empress dowager

52
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,180
Yes, Your Majesty have become even nobler.

53
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,260
From today on,

54
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,940
you will serve me in my chambers.

55
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,460
Thank you, Her Majesty Empress Dowager.

56
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,420
Thank you, Her Majesty Grand Empress Dowager.

57
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,100
Stop.

58
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,860
I just want to hold His Majesty

59
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,140
for you.

60
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,860
You're unqualified

61
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,500
to hold the emperor as a mere eunuch.

62
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,980
Your Excellencies,

63
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,780
I salute you.

Lady Cui.

65
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,300
Her Majesty has taken control of the troops in Central State.

66
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,460
Unless absolutely necessary,

67
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,620
you'd better go back to Qinghe early.

68
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,420
Thank you for worrying about me.

69
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,980
I just came to

70
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,700
tell you something.

71
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,620
Please go ahead.

72
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,340
Have you

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,700
decided to

74
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,500
enthrone a newborn baby?

75
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,140
Many of the emperors of our dynasty

76
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,620
ascended the throne in childhood.

77
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,900
As long as he is the child of the late emperor,

78
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,980
he can ascend the throne.

79
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,060
What if

80
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,620
Her Majesty were concealing something from you?

81
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,980
Um...

82
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,780
Go.

In the future,

85
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,100
you'll be His Majesty's reading partner.

86

94
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,500
Why do you look at me?

95
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,100
Seeing others

96
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,140
standing still,

97
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,659
I follow them.

98
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,660
Your Majesty Grand Empress Dowager,

99
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,100
we heard that

100
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,340
the Crown Prince had died alongside his mother

101
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,380
on the night of the birth,

102
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,700
and the one in your arms

103
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,780
is not a prince at all.

104
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,660
Is it true?

105
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,260
Nonsense!

106
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,020
You should be beheaded for such words.

107
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,140
I also think it's ridiculous.

108
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,580
Your Majesty,

109
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,500
can you summon someone

110
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,220
to confront this?

111
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,500
Who do you want to summon here?

112
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,540
Tell me.

113
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,580
Who can prove your version of what happened

114
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,100
in the imperial palace?

115
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,740
Cui Shiyi.

116
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
OK, I'll summon her here.

117
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,780
Counselor-in-chief,

118
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,180
go and bring her here.

119

what you can get from her.

121
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,220

some questions for you.

130

Listen

131
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,980
and answer carefully.

Yes.

In this month,

134
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,620
you were the only outsider

135
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,260
living in the imperial palace.

136
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,740
I'd like to ask you a few questions

137
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,380
about the late emperor.

138
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,740
Your Excellencies, please.

139
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,380
Did you see the late emperor

140
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,820
in the imperial palace recently?

141
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,260
Yes.

142
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,380
Yes. She really saw the late Emperor.

143
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,020
Nonsense!

144
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,140
When did you see him?

145
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,620
Her Majesty gave a banquet one day.

146
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,420
I was drunk,

147
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,900
so I went back to my chamber first.

148
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,060
His Majesty secretly summoned me that night.

149
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,460
Impossible.

150
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,820
It was impossible for you to see him.

151
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,740
What did His Majesty say to you?

152
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
His Majesty said that

153
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,100
his child was dead,

154
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
and he was in poor health,

155
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,860
so he wanted to choose the right successor

156
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,260
from Liu's clan...

157
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,180
Shut up.

158
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,660
Your Majesty, please let her finish her account.

159
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,220
I want to know the truth.

160
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,700
She's talking nonsense.

161
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,220
She didn't see the late emperor.

162
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,140
When she entered the imperial palace,

163
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,220
the late emperor was still alive.

164
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,060
Why is it impossible?

165
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,940
At that time, the late emperor was badly ill

166
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,940
and even couldn't speak.

167
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,220
How could he summon her?

168
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,260
Your words are baseless.

169
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,260
Her words

170
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,820
are also baseless.

171
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,940
You'd rather believe

172
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,620
an outsider

173
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,900
than me?

174
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,260
Given all you have done these past years,

175
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,580
are you worthy of our trust?

176
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,900
Go on.

177
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,500
His Majesty also said that

178
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,700
Grand Mentor Xie didn't die of illness.

179
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,740
-It...
-It...

180
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,740
Is it true?

181
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,220
Cui Shiyi,

182
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,620
you spread vicious falsehoods to deceive ministers.

183
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,220
I will have you beheaded!

you're trying to frame me.

189
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,900
that's enough.

Your Excellency,

191
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,020
why don't you let her go on?

192

Miss Cui's words

193
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,940
are baseless,

194
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,140
so we can't believe anything she says.

195
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,420
In their confrontation,

196
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,180
we can tell the true from the false.

197
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,820
How dare you

198
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,500
interrogate Her Majesty?

199
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
Ministers,

200
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,300
it's related to the reputation

201
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,980
of the royal family.

202
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Please step out for a while

203
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,660
so that I can make things clear.

204
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,900
As a relative of the royal family,

205
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,740
I'll absolutely show no partiality to either side.

206
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,740
Why didn't you help me just now?

207
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,500
Your Majesty, listen to me first.

208
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,540
Zhousheng Chen is in the Central State.

209
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,900
Why has he come?

210
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,660
You?

211
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,580
He asked me to tell you that

212
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,780
you have been driven

213
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,620
into a corner today.

214
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,940
Does he want to rebel?

215
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,540
No.

216
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,540
He wants you to enthrone Liu Zizhen.

217
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,820
How about my grandson?

218
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,100
-He is...
-Stop.

219
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,300
You know

220
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,100
he's not your grandson.

221
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,820
If you want to protect the whole Qi family,

222
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,420
you'd better do as he says.

223
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,940
Ministers,

224
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,660
please.

225
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,740
-I...

226
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,820
I have no choice

227
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
but to do so.

228
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,100
Ministers,

229
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,020
His Majesty passed away suddenly,

230
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,300
and his son also died with his mother.

231
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,660
If others know that

232
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,260
the late emperor didn't have any descendant,

233
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,380
the country will fall into chaos.

234
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,820
So I had no choice

235
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,020
but to do so.

236
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,620
I had planned to declare to the public

237
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,660
his dethronement

238
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,740
and enthronement of Liu Zizhen

239
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,620
after the country was at peace.

240
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,500
How can you just

241
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,860
enthrone or dethrone an emperor

242
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,580
at will?

243
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,540
You're still quibbling.

244
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,380
Yes, you're quibbling.

245
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,780
It's ridiculous!

246
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,820
I

247
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,620
will issue an edict immediately

248
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,500
to enthrone him.

249
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,260
Mother.

250
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,380
You like this baby?

251
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,580
Someone from the Western State

252
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,300
wants to see you.

253
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,900
Now he's in the chamber where he used to live.

254
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,540
Go.

255
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,740
She treats the baby as hers

256
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,140
and even can't bear to put him down.

257
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,380
[Chonghua Palace]

258
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,860
-Miss Cui.
-Miss Cui.

259
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,460
Why are you all dressed

260
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,660
in the uniforms of the Royal Guards?

261
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,340
His Highness required us to do so.

262
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,500
He is inside?

263
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm here.

264
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,500
You wait for me outside.

265
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,940
Yes.

266
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,820
Master.

267
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,980
Go in.

268
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,540
You're going to keep holding him?

269
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,260
Put him here.

270
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,500
Hui ascended the throne at 6

271
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,540
but died at 19.

272
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,940
Only 19 years old.

273
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,860
He was known as a young emperor

274
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,580
all over the country,

275
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,700
but I didn't keep him safe.

276
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,660
You tried your best.

277
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,300
Look, he's asleep.

278
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,340
Is he asleep so quickly?

279
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,820
Babies do fall asleep quickly.

280
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,940
That day His Excellency Counselor-in-chief showed me a note.

281
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,140
It startled me

282
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,380
when I recognized your handwriting.

283
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,740
Thanks to your intelligence,

284
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,420
now the new emperor has ascended the throne smoothly,

285
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,100
and a power struggle has been avoided.

286
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,460
For common people,

287
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,620
it couldn't be better.

288
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,500
Why didn't you leave?

289
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,140
I was afraid you would have an accident

290
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,980
after entering the imperial palace in such chaos.

291
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,140
It's not shameful for you to cry.

292
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,100
I'm not crying.

293
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,980
It's better to stay in the Western State.

294
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
With our protection,

295
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,620
nobody would dare bully you.

296
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,240
Of course.

297
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,000
Master,

298
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,920
Feng Qiao and the military advisor

299
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,200
are on their way.

300
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,960
And the reinforcements will arrive within ten days.

301
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
OK, I see.

302
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,960
Xiaoyu,

303
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,520
my mother has allowed him

304
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
to divorce Her Highness.

305
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,320
Isn't Her Highness pregnant?

306
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,440
No, she isn't.

307
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,200
Having no feeling for each other,

308
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
they've wished to divorce.

309
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,560
But they're bound

310
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
by the reputation of the Cui and Qi families.

311
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,280
After everything is settled,

312
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,080
I'll ask the prefectural governor of Taiyuan back.

313
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,400
Then you can ask him in person.

314
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,360
Why do you smile?

315
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,160
Your smiles

316
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,920
remind me of the past.

317
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,560
When will you leave?

318
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,960
I don't know.

319
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,120
You don't know?

320
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,840
I still have a lot of things to deal with,

321
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,480
so I won't leave in 1 to 2 months.

322
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,840
Then we still have 1 to 2 months.

323
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,200
This child is unlucky.

324
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,920
He doesn't know what happened,

325
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,760
who his parents are,

326
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
and who will take care of him.

327
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
I'll take care of him.

328
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
You?

329
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,080
In my mansion,

330
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,560
there are ten orphans.

331
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,520
They all have grown up

332
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
and lived well.

333
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,860
This is

334
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,900
the Junior Prince of Nanchen guarding the Western State.

335
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,150
Greetings, Grand-uncle.

336
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,910
Why do you laugh?

337
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,540
You're his grand-uncle.

338
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,040
Come on.

339
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,560
Get up.

340
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,300
Why do you embrace me?

341
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,300
Father often told me that

342
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,540
you're a good man.

343
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,220
He knows

344
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,660
who can protect him.

345
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,060
Come on.

346
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,180
Are you afraid of being an emperor?

347
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,260
Yes.

348
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,380
Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne at 5,

349
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,780
and the late emperor 6.

350
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,380
Neither of them was afraid of it,

351
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,660
so you don't need to be afraid.

352
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,020
I want to find

353
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,060
a good grand mentor for you.

354
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,780
Before that,

355
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,300
Miss Cui

356
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,660
will be your teacher.

357
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,020
Here are my respects, Miss Cui.

358
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,820
Am I qualified?

359
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,540
Your uncle used to be the grand mentor,

360
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,980
so I believe you can do it, too.

361
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,540
Your Highness, the Prince of Guangling wants to see you.

362
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,020
Ask him in.

363
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,860
Yes.

364
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,660
Your Highness, we're leaving.

365
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,260
Let's go.

366
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,620
Your Highness, please go in.

367
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,420
Uncle, thank you for saving me.

368
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,260
You're welcome.

369
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,100
Uncle, can you allow me

370
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,900
to chat

371
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,340
with my fiancÃ©e alone?

372
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,440
OK.

373
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,660
I heard from the palace maid on the way that

374
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,500
you had been imprisoned in the Eastern Palace for several days.

375
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
After experiencing that,

376
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,340
I couldn't wait any longer.

377
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,340
Let's get married next month.

378
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,900
If you want to get married early,

379
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,340
let me tell my mother first.

380
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,140
I'll tell her.

381
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,260
Where have you stayed these past few days?

382
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,540
I stayed in Xuanguang Palace.

383
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,380
The simply-furnished Xuanguang Palace

384
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,980
was deserted for a long time.

385
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,820
You deserve better.

386
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,860
I'll send

387
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,140
some daily necessities

388
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,460
to your chambers later.

389
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

390
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,860
Greetings, Your Highness.

391
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,580
Get up.

392
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,740
The smell of herbs here is too strong.

393
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,660
I heard that Palace Attendant Cui

394
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,340
spoke for me in the court.

395
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,700
I just told the truth.

396
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,820
After Cui Guang's death,

397
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,100
you want to be the chief of the Cui family.

398
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,820
I dare not.

399
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
What daren't you do?

400
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,740
Daren't you tell the truth?

401
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,620
Go to summon the general here.

402
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,780
Yes.

403
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

404
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

405
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,980
Get up.

406
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,060
You want to serve a wise master,

407
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,380
while I want to find a trusted subordinate.

408
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,420
I've shown you my sincerity.

409
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,540
I've controlled the Royal Guards.

410
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
Knowing you're

411
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,540
used to staying in Nanchen Royal Mansion.

412
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,940
His Highness worries that you're not used to staying in the Central State,

413
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,420
so all the good things of the Eastern Palace

414
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,580
have been moved here.

415
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,100
The royal mansion is not as luxurious as you imagine.

416
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,340
I just stayed

417
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,780
in a common house there.

418
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,340
What does the royal mansion look like?

419
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,900
There're only soldiers and servants.

420
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,100
Only I had a maidservant

421
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,820
from my family in my house.

422
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,260
Doesn't His Highness

423
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,500
keep any beauties in his mansion?

424
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,900
No.

425
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,540
The members of the royal clan in the capital city

426
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,820
have countless beauties in their mansions,

427
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,780
but they still often

428
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,220
ask Her Majesty for palace maids in the imperial palace.

429
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:19,940
Yeah.

430
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,380
His Excellency Counselor-in-chief is old,

431
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,140
but he also has dozens of beauties in his mansion.

432
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,380
I didn't lie to you.

433
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,660
Can I ask more?

434
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,420
What does His Highness look like?

435
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
Is he really

436
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,820
a truly handsome man

437
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,260
rare among all those in the world,

438
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,380
as others have said?

439
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,180
He...

440
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,140
Or has his appearance been exaggerated

441
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,420
since he is His Majesty's grand-uncle?

442
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,940
He is better still than what others think of him.

443
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,660
Your Majesty.

444
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,500
Your Highness.

445
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,420
This is the Junior Prince of Nanchen,

446
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,940
my grand-uncle.

447
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,300
Your Highness.

448
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,300
I want to talk to my teacher.

449
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,860
You can leave.

450
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,180
Yes.

451
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,900
He wanted to come

452
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,780
to see his brother

453
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,060
after I just taught him to recite for a while.

454
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,260
If you teach His Majesty,

455
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,860
he won't need me.

456
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,500
No.

457
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,460
Yesterday you taught me:

458
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,220
"The people are the most important element in a country;

459
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,620
next is the country; least is the ruler himself."

460
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,860
Good job.

461
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,660
Master,

462
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,100
Her Majesty is cutting her hair.

463
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,780
Zhousheng Chen, spare my life.

464
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,980
Zhousheng Chen, help me.

465
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,180
Zhousheng Chen, help me. Zhousheng Chen.

466
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,020
Zhousheng Chen.

467
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
To see me,

468
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,940
you cut your hair.

469
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,900
Go ahead.

470
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,380
What do you want to say?

471
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,780
Hui,

472
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,460
Hui wanted to kill me.

473
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,700
He wanted

474
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,780
to kill me, his real mother.

475
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,620
Should I just let him do that?

476
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,140
Zhousheng Chen,

477
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,340
you have no child.

478
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,940
You can't understand my feelings.

479
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,020
My

480
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,900
own son

481
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,380
imprisoned me

482
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,220
and wanted to poison me.

483
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,420
How I wish that

484
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,300
I hadn't given birth to him!

485
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,740
So you admit

486
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,340
you killed him.

487
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,060
No,

488
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,420
I didn't.

489
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,420
It was Qin Yan.

490
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,340
Qin Yan poisoned him.

491
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,380
Qin Yan is your man.

492
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,140
Once it is known by the rest,

493
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,100
you won't be able to convince anyone that you weren't involve too.

494
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,820
The traitor in my army

495
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,740
will be punished by military law.

496
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,620
He'll be killed,

497
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,380
but we won't mitigate

498
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,060
your punishment.

499
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,860
You also killed Grand Mentor Xie, right?

500
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,940
No.

501
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,740
No,

502
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,500
I didn't.

503
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Don't attribute his death

504
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,140
to me.

505
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
He was related to the Gao family by marriage

506
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,660
and sent by your brother

507
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,420
to watch you.

508
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,580
I eliminated him.

509
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,620
You should thank me

510
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,500
instead of killing me.

511
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,220
Tell me

512
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,060
yes or no.

513
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,500
I'm your sister-in-law,

514
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,020
Zhousheng Chen.

515
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,820
Among those concubines in the imperial harem,

516
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,580
I was

517
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,020
the only one who risked my life in giving birth to a son

518
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,940
for your brother.

519
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,380
He loved you since your childhood.

520
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,340
For his sake,

521
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,500
please spare my life.

522
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,420
Please.

523
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,740
Qi Zhenzhen,

524
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,980
you killed

525
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,380
the late emperor,

526
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,300
plotted a rebellion

527
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,620
and persecuted the faithful and honest.

528
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,060
In this case,

529
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,220
you'd better plead for your family

530
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,380
rather than defend yourself.

531
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,460
I dare you!

532
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,020
I dare much.

533
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,420
You must offer up your life

534
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,740
for poisoning the late emperor.

535
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,140
Only after you die,

536
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,820
can your family members survive.

537
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,140
Attendant!

538
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,340
Her Majesty want to shave her hair

539
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,540
and go to the Baima Temple

540
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,120
to pray for Beichen.

541
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,400
From today on,

542
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,600
there is no empress dowager in the court.

543
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,199
Take her to the temple.

544
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,440
Yes.

545
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,880
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

546
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,239
Cheers.

547
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,120
When you joined the army,

548
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,360
I warned you that

549
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,280
if you betrayed the royal army,

550
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,640
I'd kill you

551
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,440
no matter where you went.

552
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,600
Keep silent, or you'll be killed.

553
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,840
He betrayed Nanchen Royal Army.

554
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,280
Ask your prefectural governor

555
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,840
to send his head to the Central State.

556
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,900
[Nanchen]

557
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,440
Grand-uncle.

558
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,880
Can't you write?

559
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,080
The Prince of Guangling said

560
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,080
he'll marry Miss Cui next month.

561
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,160
Yes,

562
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,800
next month.

563
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,680
What should I

564
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,400
give her?

565
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,520
As her Master,

566
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,160
you must know what she likes.

567
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,000
She likes...

568
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
likes books.

569
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,000
Mother said

570
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,720
the Cui family's collection is larger

571
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,520
than that in the palace.

572
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,120
That's true.

573
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,320
So there's no use giving her more books.

574
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,160
What else does she like?

575
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,440
What did you give her?

576
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,560
I gave her

577
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,040
seals of conquered generals.

578
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,920
You've watched them the whole tonight.

579
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,080
Are these things important?

580
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,640
Yes.

581
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,240
These are the seals

582
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,440
of conquered generals

583
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,000
my master collected from each victorious battle.

584
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,320
What do you want to say?

585
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,360
My hometown is in the west.

586
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,840
We were saved by Nanchen Royal Army.

587
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,960
Please tell us more about His Highness.

588
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,160
Yes. Yes.

589
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,320
OK.

590
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
Where is your hometown?

591
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,960
Qingcheng.

592
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,120
Qingcheng.

593
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,840
The royal army

594
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,840
fought their longest defensive battle there.

595
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,680
I was a little girl back then.

596
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,280
My mother told me,

597
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,840
without Nanchen Royal Army,

598
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,160
we would have been slaughtered.

599
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,360
I was a little girl, too.

600
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,840
My senior brother told me about that.

601
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,400
After Qingcheng was surrounded,

602
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,160
my master rushed there through day and night

603
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,720
to reinforce them with 10,000 of his cavalry.

604
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,240
However, there were 130,000 enemies.

605
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,400
They held that position for over half a month.

606
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,760
Twenty days later,

607
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,080
when the reinforcements arrived,

608
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,320
they held no strong hopes.

609
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,800
But suddenly,

610
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,120
dozens of pieces of raven-blue long cloth

611
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,720
could be seen hanging from the city wall.

612
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,700
[Qingcheng]

613
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,840
The ragged cloth

614
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,560
flew in the strong wind.

615
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,480
Raven blue is the color

616
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,360
of His Highness' flag.

617
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The flying cloth

618
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,800
over the city wall

619
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,040
meant that the city still held.

620
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,360
The 200,000 reinforcements

621
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,440
burst into cheers

622
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,160
and called him by his title at the top of their voices.

623
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,120
This is the Victory of Qingcheng.

624
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Go ahead.

625
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,960
What else do you want to know?

626
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,000
Did Miss Cui cry

627
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
when she left your mansion?

628
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
Didn't she?

629
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,620
She did,

630
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
but she tends to

631
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
cry alone,

632
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,560
so I didn't see it.

633
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:43,340
[Central State]

634
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,160
What's wrong?

635
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
This is the hometown of His Highness

636
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,160
and also

637
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,640
the most dangerous place to be.

638
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,840
Let's go.

639
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,280
Master, we're here.

640
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
Xie Yun and Cui Feng haven't arrived yet.

641
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,440
Xie Yun wrote several letters,

642
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,240
to let us know that he has learned to ride a horse,

643
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
and can lead troops Eastward

644
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,800
as your vanguard at any time.

645
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,600
Let him stay in Beichen

646
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,880
and guard the border.

647
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm just worried

648
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
about Cui Feng.

649
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,960
The new emperor is about to ascend the throne.

650
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,240
The regional princes and the prefectural governors

651
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,360
have been called back to the capital city.

652
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,600
Only Cui Feng hasn't responded yet.

653
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,680
Why don't we have Shiyi

654
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,160
write him a letter and call him back

655
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,840
on family matter grounds?.

656
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,000
What family matter?

657
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,200
Don't keep us guessing. Just spit it out!

658
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,320
Asking her cousin to come back

659
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,120
for her wedding ceremony

660
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,640
would be the best excuse.

661
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,000
You heard nothing.

662
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,440
No.

663
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,080
Advisor Xiao is right.

664
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,640
I'll go write to him right away.

665
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,800
There's paper and a writing brush here.

666
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
You can write here.

667
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:09,880
No.

668
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I need to think

669
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,880
carefully how to write such a message.
