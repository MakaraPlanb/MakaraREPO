[Episode 9]

4
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,320
I promise.

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll still give you

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
the title of Prince of Fengyang.

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,479
I'm already a monk.

8
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,120
Xiao Yan,

9
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,840
although you've got tonsured,

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,600
you still attach to the world.

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,039
When you avenge,

12
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,479
come tell me

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
whether you want this title or not.

14
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,960
I...

15
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,000
Just follow the edict

16
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,160
of His Majesty.

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Don't disobey it.

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

19
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,919
That's right.

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
When will you set off, uncle?

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Tomorrow.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,400
When will we meet next time?

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
We'd better not meet again in this life.

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,160
Have I done something wrong

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
and offended you, uncle?

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,000
My return to the Central State

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,200
always means something serious has happened here.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
so I'd rather

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,760
not see you again in this life.

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
I'll look out to the Central State while I'm in the Central State

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,440
harboring the hope that you'll be a wise emperor.

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,600
I envy you

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,840
having these able men around.

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,920
I want someone of them.

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
Who?

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
I'd like to invite Advisor Xie

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,200
to help me in the Central State

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,080
like how he taught the late emperor.

39
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,240
Are you thinking about Your Majesty's words, Master?

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Advisor Xie to me,

41
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,400
is like a teacher, a father.

42
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,950
I won't feel at ease

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,680
if I let him stay in the capital.

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
You are back, Advisor Xie.

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,840
Your Highness, I am here to say farewell to you .

46
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,120
You want to stay?

47
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,640
Yes.

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,360
His Majesty didn't force you to stay.

49
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,480
You can still think about it.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
I know

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Your Highness is concerned about me.

52
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,180
Back then,

53
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,760
I was asked by the late emperor

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,230
to follow Your Highness out of the Palace.

55
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,320
How time flies.

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,530
We have already spent over ten years

57
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,640
fighting on the battlefield together.

58
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,460
Now that Your Highness can totally

59
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,540
manage on your own.

60
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,400
Whether I am there or not

61
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,800
won't make a difference.

62
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,140
Your Highness.

63
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,780
Whenever and wherever,

64
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,180
you will always be my right-hand man,

65
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
part of my body.

66
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,740
You should never get hurt,

67
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,260
nor severed with me.

68
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,180
I can now die without regret

69
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,580
after hearing what you said, Your Highness.

70
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,460
His Majesty is still quite young

71
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,500
and there is no one he could ask for help.

72
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,210
That's why I

73
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,500
decide to stay and assist him.

74
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,740
Just like I assisted you before.

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,940
Okay.

76
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,900
Since you have made your decision,

77
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,860
I am gonna have to let you go.

78
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,780
Advisor Xie,

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,780
remember this,

80
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,220
the Western State

81
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,260
is always waiting for you to come back.

82
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,380
Okay.

83
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,340
I also want to ask Your Highness a favor.

84
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,460
On that day,

85
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,540
please bury me in the Western State.

87
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,780
Your Highness.

88
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,460
When is your wedding with the princess?

89
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,660
In three years?

90
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,560
The last words of my father says

91
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
I don't have to get restrained by the three-year mourning period for his death.

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,160
The sooner, the better.

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,120
And so is the Empress Dowager's opinion.

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,000
When did the Empress Dowager want this to happen?

95
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,720
Before I go back to Qinghe County.

96
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,120
She wants the princess

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,159
to accompany me back to Qinghe County

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,360
and observe mourning rituals for my father.

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,960
Even if we ignore the mourning period,

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,360
how are we going to hold the wedding ceremony?

101
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,760
According to the Empress Dowager' edict,

102
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,840
there won't be any wedding ceremony

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
as the marriage is complete

104
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,400
once Shiyi is sent to the residence.

105
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,050
You...

106
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I will be going back within two years.

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
Look how worried Shiyi gets.

108
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,560
She's so worried about that His Highness won't let her go back.

109
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,520
I was thinking about the time

110
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,080
to see if I can pick you up in person.

111
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,110
By then,

112
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,540
I should be in the Six-garrison.

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
The state affairs are more important,

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,200
I can go back on my own.

115
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,950
The state and family affairs are equally important.

116
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,100
Even if I couldn't make it to see her off,

117
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,540
General Cui Shou will accompany her on the way back.

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
Please don't worry, Your Highness.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,720
Father,

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,720
I conducted a divination practice for you.

122
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,520
And the symbol is ominous.

123
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,840
Involved in the battle for the supreme power,

124
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,080
I wonder whose symbol could be auspicious.

125
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,480
Don't tell anyone anything about the divination result.

126
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,600
Not even His Highness.

127
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,960
What are you doing here, General Feng?

128
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,920
Greetings, Prince of Fengyang.

129
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
How kind, General Feng.

130
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
We are so special to each other.

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,680
Both of our names contain the character Feng, meaning phoenix.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,559
I am nowhere as good as you.

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,480
General Feng is a heroine.

134
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,520
The character Feng in my name

135
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
doesn't live up to its worth.

136
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
Someone's really got a good destiny.

137
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
Born to be a prince.

138
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,559
And wherever he is, he's still a prince.

139
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,320
Someone's really got a good destiny.

140
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,120
Born to be

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,800
the disciple of the junior Prince of Nanchen.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
And wherever she is,

143
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
she's a member of the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

144
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,440
That makes sense.

145
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,560
Especially for you.

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
You're always trying to join the Royal Army.

147
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,880
But I am one of them from the very beginning.

148
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,080
So,

149
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,680
I should envy you, General Feng.

150
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,080

He is.

154
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,400
Go in there.

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
After he leaves tomorrow,

157
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,440
it will take a long time

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,040
before she can see him again.

159
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,880
I suggest you come

160
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,160

Yes.

168
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,160
This is the longest time I have been away from here

169
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
since I became your disciple.

170
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,400
Yeah.

171
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,760
My mother has fixed the date,

172
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
but I haven't been home for a long time.

If there is any delay,

174
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
I am afraid that I can only go back to the Western State

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
after a long time.

176
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,200
It's okay.

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
I don't see it's proper.

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,560
Nobody knows that

192
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,440
you are back in the Central State,

193
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,360
I am afraid we'll expose ourselves

194
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,560
if you bring us with you.

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,520
General Feng's got a point.

196
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,600
And it's natural to be sentimental

197
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
as we are about to leave here.

198
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
So I also want to have a good look at the Palace

199
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
of the Central State.

200
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,840
Sorry I can't go with Your Highness.

201
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:20,340
[Shiqian Palace]

202
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,020
Let's go.

203
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,820
[Baima Temple]

204
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,680
Master.

205
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,680
I forgot we are outside of the Palace.

206
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,840
Did you use to come here when you were a kid?

207
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,140
Before leaving the Central State,

208
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,960
I did.

209
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,020
Then I'll take a good look at this place.

210
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,620
Why is he filling it with water?

211
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,400
The well-respected monks of Baima Temple

212
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,920
has a custom over the years.

213
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,280
Every time when it's the end of the year.

214
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
They would ask their disciples

215
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,600
to check the water in there.

216
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,720
If there was a sheet of ice,

217
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,000
they must change the water immediately

218
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,720
in case the pigeons won't get the water.

219
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,560
That's very considerate.

220
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,480
Pigeons are intelligent,

221
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,560
they love to stay in the temple during the winter.

222
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,340
By the way,

223
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,220
Have you burnt incense here, Master?

224
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,180
Nope.

225
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,540
I am a general.

226
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,980
I have been through blood wars and seen numerous bones of the dead.

227
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,780
I should be the last one to disturb the tranquility of Buddha.

228
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,100
But you protect a lot more people.

229
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,020
Don't worry.

230
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,860
From now on,

231
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,540
I will burn the incense for you,

232
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,220
and for my senior brothers and sisters.

233
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,740
Let's go.

234
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,300
Let's burn the incense

235
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,580
that you failed to burn when you were young.

236
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,060
Come back.

237
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Do you know how to get there?

238
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,020
Is he a regional prince who just arrived in the capital?

239
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,940
A regional prince?

240
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,220
how can you tell he's a regional prince?

241
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,540
Look at his bearing,

242
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,740
he must be one of the nobility.

243
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,660
If there is such a man in the Central State,

244
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,740
we would've known.

245
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,420
How can we have never seen him?

246
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,340
The prince is waiting outside,

247
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,260
the princess

248
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,900
must be burning incense inside.

249
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:57,860
[Grand Hall]

250
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,060
I have finished burning the incense

251
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,180
that you couldn't burn before 13.

252
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,980
Next time we are here,

253
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,300
we can make up the rest.

254
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,700
We couldn't burn too much at once,

255
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,260
that way we are like slacking off.

256
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,340
Sounds good.

257
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,100
It's still daylight,

258
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,260
where are we going next?

259
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:15,780
[Grand Hall]

260
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,460
Are we going back?

261
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,900
[Residence of the Grand Mentor]

262
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,180
Why are we here?

263
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,140
It's getting late.

264
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,260
I need to take you back.

265
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,580
Are you leaving?

266
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,820
I still get time to sit for a while.

267
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,620
For how long?

268
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,380
If your mother doesn't mind,

269
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,220
I can stay for dinner.

270
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,780
Then let's go.

271
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,500
Your Ladyship, you are back.

272
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,860
I am taking one of my friends

273
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,220
for a quick meal.

274
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,260
Let's go.

275
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,540
Go.

276
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,580
Yes, My Lady.

277
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,100
Your Highness.

278
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,860
The reason why I am here today

279
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,020
is that I, as a junior,

280
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,020
want to burn a stick of incense in front of the memorial tablet of Grand Mentor Cui.

281
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,580
Please.

282
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,420
[Father Cui Guang Honorable Memorial Tablet]

283
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,820
I wonder if Cui Wenji would love to

284
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,700
give me a tour around the Residence of Cui.

285
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,260
I don't know Your Highness very well, I am afraid...

286
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,020
Aunty.

287
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,940
Go ahead.

288
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,300
If so,

289
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,620
I will give Your Highness a tour,

290
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,780
please.

291
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,340
Shiyi.

292
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,940
My uncle mentioned about you.

293
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,180
What did he say?

294
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,780
He said,

295
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,020
he did let you down.

296
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,780
And if he ever knew that he would let you down one day,

297
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,020
he should never go to Qinghe County to see you.

298
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
Exactly.

299
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,099
If he didn't want to marry me,

300
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,900
he shouldn't come to see me.

301
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,020
He came to see me, yet he didn't marry me.

302
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,260
How am I supposed to face the Cui family?

303
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,180
For outsiders,

304
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
they would think that I was some kind of monster

305
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,180
that made people break off an engagement

306
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,380
with some contact.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,780
He said,

308
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,700
not being able to marry you

309
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,100
is the only regret in his life.

310
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,600
My uncle was, in fact,

311
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,120
forced to break off the engagement.

312
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
The late emperor feared that the connection through marriage between the Cui family

313
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,000
and the Nanchen Royal Mansion

314
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,000
would make the Western State an overpowering state.

315
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,320
That's why

316
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,380
there was a secret edict from the Palaceï¼Œ

317
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,260
forcing my uncle to break off the engagement.

318
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,180
I am not here

319
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,700
to ask you forgive my uncle.

320
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,740
I only wish

321
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,940
you could work it out

322
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,260
and feel better.

323
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,790
Your Highness, please help yourself.

324
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,700
The liquor

325
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,220
is unique to Qinghe County.

326
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,220
Have a taste, Master.

327
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,940
Is it good?

328
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,220
Not bad.

329
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,380
This is called sandfish sashimi.

330
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,500
It's shredded skin of sandfish,

331
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,940
which is also unique to Qinghe County.

332
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,140
You won't see sandfish if you don't live near the sea.

333
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,820
Try it.

334
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,060
How's it?

335
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,180
Not too bad.

336
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,540
I'll see you off at the city gate tomorrow.

337
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,260
See you tomorrow.

338
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,420
I have to go now.

339
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,100
Being a criminal when you entered the city,

340
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,820
yet being the Prince of Fengyang when you leave.

341
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,380
No wonder people would come out to see you.

342
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,620
What they don't know, however,

343
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,420
is that their beloved junior Prince of Nanchen

344
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,860
is now at the back of the convoy.

345
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,120
If there is anything you don't know

346
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
in the Palace or on the court,

347
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,820
consult Advisor Xie.

348
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,170
Don't say anything wrong

349
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,220
that would implicate him.

350
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,340
I will make sure Advisor Xie is in one piece

351
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,020
by being next to him all the time and protect him.

352
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,940
I have trained you personally,

353
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,540
don't let me down.

354
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,420
Keep that in mind.

355
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,220
I won't, General Hong.

356
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,140
Your Highness,

357
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,060
take care.

358
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,220
Advisor Xie,

359
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,340
take care.

360
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,540
Go.

361
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,060
Advisor Xie,

362
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,140
see you.

363
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,180
Let's go.

364
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,380
Where are you from?

365
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,100
Why don't you give way

366
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,220
when you see the Prince of Taiyuan come?

367
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,940
We are from the Western State.

368
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,540
Master,

369
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
this man is called Jin Rong,

370
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,860
he is a Qihu people,

371
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,180
and got the credits for counter-insurgency during the late emperor's reign.

372
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,540
One of his daughters

373
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,780
now is a concubine in the Palace.

374
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,660
So sorry.

375
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,020
General,

376
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,940
why would you give way to them?

377
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,660
Did you see

378
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,460
the man in white just now?

379
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,500
He should be

380
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,020
the junior Prince of Nanchen.

381
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:44,260
[Mingguang Palace]

382
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,820
Your Highness.

383
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,780
Your Highness.

384
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,700
General Jin.

385
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,100
Please take a seat.

386
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,900
I saw a man

387
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,500
at the city gate

388
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,380
who looks like the junior Prince of Nanchen.

389
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,620
That's him.

390
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,140
Liu Yuan handed all the troops

391
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,940
to a man

392
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,140
named Qin Yan,

393
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,460
have you heard of that?

394
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,980
Yes, I have.

395
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,420
Some nobody

396
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,700
comes from nowhere

397
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,580
should delude His Majesty

398
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,510
to hand the strong army of the Central State

399
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,780
to him.

400
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,820
He is from the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

401
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,140
Xie Chong, the military advisor from Nanchen Royal Mansion

402
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,540
was also left in the Palace

403
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,220
to assist His Majesty in the future.

404
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,540
We have killed Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan.

405
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,380
Now comes the Xie Chong and Qin Yan.

406
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,100
The son-in-law of mine,

407
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,100
is really simple-minded

408
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,420
and is always influenced by other people.

409
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,980
Your Highness.

410
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,660
Is my daughter in the Palace

411
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,700
having a good time?

412
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,500
She is not favored by His Majesty.

413
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Nevertheless,

414
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,420
with the friendship between you and me,

415
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,500
I will take care of her for you.

416
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,140
I appreciate it, Your Highness.

417
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,340
I

418
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,740
am counting on you in the future, General.

419
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,820
No problem.

420
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,380
From now on, the Taiyuan Army

421
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,980
will be at your disposal, Your Highness.

422
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,220
Your Highness.

423
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,940
Dad finally remembers to see me.

424
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,260
Come on,

425
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,500
let me have a look.

426
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,100
Looks like someone's really mad at her dad.

427
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,980
I don't want this either.

428
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,660
I am only doing this

429
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,100
for my useless son-in-law

430
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,700
to suppress the rebellion everywhere, isn't it?

431
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,260
You help him suppress the rebellion,

432
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,380
while he already left your daughter uncared-for.

433
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,980
The Prince of Guangling is here.

434
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,620
Don't talk nonsense.

435
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,900
Shiyi...

436
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,220
Miss Cui is in the Residence of Cui,

437
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,980
does Your Highness want to see her?

438
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,980
There is no engagement

439
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,340
and no point of seeing her anymore.

440
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,580
On the day when Xinghua gets married,

441
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,660
I will take her to the Residence of Cui on behalf of His Majesty.

442
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,300
and I will see her for sure.

443
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Feng,

444
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,180
Mother's afraid that you may get cold feet

445
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,460
and she lets me accompany you all the way.

446
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,700
Does your brother look like

447
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,260
that kind of man?

448
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,940
Men from the Nanchen Royal Mansion

449
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,820
will never get cold feet.

450
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,220
Let's go.

451
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:37,660
[Residence of the Grand Mentor]

452
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,220
Your Highness.

453
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,340
Wenjun.

454
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,460
The Empress Dowager and His Majesty got caught in their business and couldn't get out of the Palace,

455
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,820
so, as the emperor's brother,

456
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,220
I will send the princess here instead.

457
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,980
Here's His Majesty's verbal instruction,

458
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,460
since Grand Mentor Cui just passed away,

459
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,860
we don't have to hold a grand wedding ceremony.

460
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,220
Everything must be kept simple.

461
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,180
I accept.

462
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,060
Xinghua?

463
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,900
Xinghua.

464
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
This is no joke.

465
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,300
Get down now.

466
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,660
It is hard for girls to leave their family when they get married,

467
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,660
and the princess is no exception.

468
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,140
Hope you won't mind.

469
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,220
Understandable.

470
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,180
Please.

471
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,540
What are you burning in the middle of night?

472
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,660
Some confidential military documents.

473
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,180
Military intelligence?

474
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,220
Why are you crying?

475
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,620
[Confidential]

476
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,500
I never knew I would marry you.

477
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,580
I have fallen in love with someone else.

478
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,300
Do you have someone you love, General Cui?

479
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,060
I'll be honest with you.

480
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,180
Yes.

481
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,140
Tonight,

482
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
are you going to take me as her?

483
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,020
You are not her.

484
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,340
You and me tonight,

485
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,820
are not who we really are.

486
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,140
But rather, the princess and general of BeiChen.

487
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,540
General,

488
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,500
please go to bed.

489
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,780
You have watched the moon for up to two hours.

490
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,060
I miss Xiaoyu.

491
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,700
Your Highness.

492
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,140
Your Highness.

493
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,620
It's pretty late at night,

494
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,100
why is Your Highness not back yet?

495
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,300
Still mad?

496
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,980
Nope.

497
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,940
On the day I learned the engagement was canceled,

498
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,860
in desperation,

499
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,380
I embarrassed you in front of everyone.

500
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,660
I owe you an apology.

501
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,220
What is done is done.

502
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,020
Your Highness doesn't have to put it in mind.

503
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,900
If Your Highness is fine,

504
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,940
I take my leave now.

505
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,220
Shiyi.

506
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,060
If I get a fief,

507
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,500
and stop being obsessed with position of the crown prince

508
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,540
and stay away from the Central State,

509
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,220
will you go with me?

510
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,340
No.

511
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,380
You still want to be the crown princess,

512
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,940
and the empress in the future?

513
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,460
Never.

514
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,220
It has nothing to do with being the crown princess or not.

515
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,020
I have never wanted to enter the Palace.

516
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,780
If you have the chance to choose again,

517
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,980
why don't you

518
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,860
choose someone you want?

519
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,900
How do you know

520
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,300
you are not the one I want?

521
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,620
And how do you know

522
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,740
that I don't want to marry you?

523
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,900
Please behave yourself, Your Highness.

524
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,140
When the engagement was made,

525
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,220
I was not born and couldn't make the decision.

526
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,260
What's in the past

527
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,780
is the agreement of our fathers,

528
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,860
not mine,

529
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,620
and definitely not my intention.

530
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,180
From today on,

531
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,220
Your Highness, please forget me.

532
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,580
A prince who has no power,

533
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,300
and an imperial concubine who is not favored.

534
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,020
In this Palace,

535
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,380
we are somewhat alike.

536
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,460
What

537
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,540
do you want from me?

538
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,739
The title of the empress.

539
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,699
The fact that His Majesty and I being each other's brother

540
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
doesn't give me the power to decide

541
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,540
which concubine he wants to favor.

542
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,900
What if you were the emperor?

543
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,820
My father can help you get the throne.

544
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
While you,

545
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,380
need to repay me with the throne of empress.

546
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:15,500
[Residence of Cui]

547
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,700
My Lady,

548
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,820
every branch of the family is here.

549
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,140
They said they wanted to offer their condolence.

550
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,900
Keep the body in the room

551
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,700
and send the princess back to rest.

552
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,620
Yes, My Lady.

553
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,780
[Residence of Cui]

554
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,220
Please go inside and have a rest, Your Highness.

555
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,900
Only Shiyi follow me inside.

556
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,460
Wenjun.

557
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
Wenjun is here.

558
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,420
Sit down and let's talk.

559
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,780
Wenjun,

560
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,980
sorry to hear the sudden death of the clan chief.

561
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,460
We made it here

562
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,220
as soon as we learned the news.

563
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,980
Why don't you send someone

564
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,860
to send a letter here first?

565
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,180
So that I can arrange people to receive you.

566
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,180
We are afraid that you worried too much.

567
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,700
Wenjun.

568
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,460
So far, in your generation,

569
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,580
only you and Wenji were left.

570
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,580
Do you

571
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,540
have any plan for the future?

572
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,860
From now on,

573
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,180
I will be in charge of

574
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,780
both internal and external affairs of Wushui House.

575
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,860
Here is the bride-price list.

576
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,500
Please have a look.

577
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,300
Who is this bride-price for?

578
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,740
To you, from me.

579
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,020
Wushui House can't sustain without having a chief, not even a day.

580
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,700
This is bride-price list

581
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,940
that I asked someone to prepare overnight.

582
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,340
I thought

583
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,340
it was prepared for the younger generation.

584
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,100
I never knew it was for me.

585
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,020
Shiyi.

586
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,220
Yes, Mother.

587
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,900
Return it to your uncle.

588
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,860
Yes.

589
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,060
If it were for the younger generation.

590
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,580
Two of the three sons left by my brother

591
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,780
remain unmarried.

592
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,140
I can help arrange.

593
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,100
If it were for me,

594
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,660
there is no need.

595
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,180
We are only doing this for your good.

596
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,820
I appreciate it.

597
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,380
As the clan chief is gone,

598
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,060
if there was no marriage connection between Wushui

599
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,060
and the rest of us,

600
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,380
once anything goes wrong,

601
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,500
we are left without proper reasons

602
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,780
to offer a hand.

603
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,660
We have the same ancestry,

604
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,180
if you want to help,

605
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,700
you will do it no matter what.

606
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,780
If you don't want to help anymore,

607
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,100
I won't say a thing.

608
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,700
We are here for your good,

609
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,020
why do you have to turn us down?

610
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,820
What you may not know

611
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,220
is that before my brother passed away,

612
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,180
he recommended his eldest and second son to the Imperial Palace

613
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,860
and he let his third son marry Princess Xinghua.

614
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,780
My youngest daughter, Shiyi,

615
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,060
who was a disciple of the junior Prince of Nanchen.

616
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Be it the Liu Royal family,

617
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,100
Empress Dowager Qi ,

618
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,460
or the Zhousheng family in the Western State,

619
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,900
we will be family to each other someday.

620
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,420
If you're

621
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,900
so insistent,

622
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,420
then I won't push it.

623
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,740
What kind of bride-price is this?

624
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,980
They are literally here

625
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,980
to rob my family property.

626
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,220
The person who wanted to marry me today,

627
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,540
is called Cui Zheng.

628
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,060
His branch was once the most thriving

629
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,340
among our six branches.

630
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,500
But they offended the emperor later

631
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,220
and in despair,

632
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,420
they had to flee to the south of the river.

633
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,220
That was also the darkest time

634
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,860
for us, the Cui family.

635
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,540
Later.

636
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,860
Your uncle became an official on the imperial court.

637
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,300
And our family

638
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,540
gradually regained its past glory.

639
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,700
And those who fled to the south

640
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,540
have gradually returned.

641
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,580
My uncle is the one who made it possible for them to come home,

642
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,060
yet they want to steal the position of clan chief

643
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,940
after he died.

644
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,180
Glad that he is gone

645
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,100
so he won't be sad about this.

646
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,540
You finally opened your mouth

647
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,140
to talk to me.

648
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,620
My master said,

649
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,820
the Gao family

650
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,460
was always trying to get a chance to destroy our family.

651
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,620
If Mother didn't do that,

652
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,540
not only you and me,

653
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,940
the whole family is going to suffer.

654
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,220
I can't help recalling that night over and over again,

655
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,580
and I regretted.

656
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,780
[Residence of Cui]

657
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,220
If only

658
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,340
I could go with him

659
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,500
on that night.

660
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,660
It is really heartbreaking

661
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,860
to see him leave alone.

662
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,260
You did that for me.
