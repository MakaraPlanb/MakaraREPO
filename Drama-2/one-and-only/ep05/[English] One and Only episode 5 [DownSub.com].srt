1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,120
Why did you pour the tea?

3
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,600
Follow me.

4
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,200
Master.

5
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,760
Why don't you allow Eleven to go enjoy the music?

6
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,560
It's rare that Nanxiao's musicians give performances.

7
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,350
She poured a pot of tea.

8
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,070
I'm punishing her by asking her to copy tea names.

9
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,350
Master.

10
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,070
Are you kidding her

11
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,390
because she can't speak?

12
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,160
Famous tea is expensive.

13
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
But she wasted it at will.

14
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,670
Shouldn't she be punished?

15
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,880
Do you feel grieved?

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,350
You should know the value of a cup of tea

17
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,829
can afford days

18
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,510
and even a month of food for common people.

19
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,790
You like to drink tea.

20
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,790
So I bought you tea.

21
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,910
But I don't want you to be arrogant

22
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,630
and unaware of how hard common people's life is.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,880
You should cultivate virtue by staying thrift.

24
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,630
You are the future Crown Princess.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
You should set an example.

26
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,040
What's wrong?

27
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,510
Jr. Prince of Nanchen's disciple

28
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,070
should remember it, but it has nothing to do with the name of Crown Princess.

29
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,920
I'm willing to be punished.

30
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,270
Most of the tea comes from Nanxiao

31
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,880
and the Jiduo Dynasty.

32
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,920
I handled that from the Jiduo Dynasty.

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Wait. Let me find it out.

34
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,240
This one.

35
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,920
Yes, that's it.

36
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,880
Look at the words on it.

37
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,120
Abstruse writing.

38
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,120
But it says cinnamon.

39
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
Cinnamon is not tea?

40
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,120
Then where's the tea then?

41
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,240
When did you learn Jiduo's language?

42
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,320
When I went to the temple

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
to pray for you guys these two years,

44
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,070
I met monks from

45
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,630
the Jiduo Dynasty

46
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,560
and I learned it from them.

47
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
Since you can learn their language,

48
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,950
you must often go to the temple.

49
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,830
I would go there when I miss you guys.

50
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,830
No wonder Xie Yun always became wordy

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,070
when he went to the battlefield.

52
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
He said there is a little sister

53
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,760
waiting for us at home

54
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,030
and we should not lose our lives.

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,590
He knows you best.

56
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,440
The four of them are guards from the imperial palace.

57
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,630
They follow to protect me.

58
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,680
Zhou Tianxing.

59
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Feng Qiao.

60
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,150
Greet Your Highness.

61
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,070
I know you.

62
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,950
You are a meritorious general following Jr. Prince of Nanchen

63
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,800
to suppress the Six-garrison Rebellion.

64
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,800
Where is my uncle?

65
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,560
Master is in the camp.

66
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,030
He left us to entertain Your Highness.

67
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,710
Uncle really loves soldiers as if they were his children.

68
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,000
It seems he is going to spend

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
the New Year with generals and soldiers.

70
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,120
Is there any scenic place

71
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
in his mansion?

72
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,800
I don't want her

73
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,440
to feel chained when seeing me for the first time.

74
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,710
There is a garden

75
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,120
with pavilion, pond and beautiful scenery.

76
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,510
Shiyi often practices instrument there.

77
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,830
Then I'll go there.

78
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,560
People in the mansion

79
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
are talking about Prince of Guangling.

80
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,390
They said he has been good-looking since he was a child

81
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,200
and he is famous outside the palace.

82
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,880
What they said is true.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
He is a quite handsome man.

84
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,120
Why should we judge people by appearance?

85
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,070
Good look is not a disadvantage.

86
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,150
The emperor of Xiyan State a hundred years ago,

87
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,030
Murong Chong,

88
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
was imprisoned as a toy-boy and suffered humiliation when young

89
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,000
because he looked even

90
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,030
better than women.

91
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,270
Isn't it because of good look?

92
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,360
It was really a pity for you

93
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,590
to lose ability to speak these years.

94
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,440
No matter he is your future husband

95
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,510
or just a guest from afar,

96
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,560
you should show hospitality.

97
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,120
You are more like the descendant from the Cui family than I am.

98
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,510
How I wish

99
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,830
you were me.

100
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,950
Here is my respect, Your Highness.

101
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,350
Your Highness.

102
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,230
It's not Central State here.

103
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,070
No need to be polite.

104
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,230
Stand up.

105
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

106
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,280
I finally don't need to

107
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,200
see you through portrait.

108
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,950
In Central State, I often heard that

109
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,590
Nanchen Royal Mansion is magnificent.

110
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,160
But I didn't think so.

111
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,920
Now when I'm here,

112
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,350
I realize it is true.

113
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,070
Your Highness, don't be misled by the public.

114
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,920
For what?

115
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,400
My master is not extravagant.

116
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,870
But as the prince guarding the borders,

117
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,680
his residence must be magnificent

118
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,200
to win the hearts of the people.

119
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,680
You are afraid that I will take him

120
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,110
as a disloyal minister like other princes?

121
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,200
I dare not think so.

122
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm not that blind and stupid.

123
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,230
Other royal families and fierce generals

124
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,640
might be rebellious

125
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,800
or wait for an opportunity

126
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,280
to rebel

127
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,350
when they take control of

128
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,200
thousands of military soldiers.

129
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,110
But uncle won't.

130
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,870
Beichen is so lucky to have him.

131
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,280
It's against the rules.

132
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,680
Are you alright?

133
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,950
I'm fine.

134
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,990
I'm just caring about you.

135
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,990
Show me your hand.

136
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,750
There are doctors in the mansion.

137
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,750
I'll see them by myself.

138
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,750
Let the imperial doctor see her hand.

139
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,470
Now!

140
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,350
Yes.

141
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,520
How did you get hurt once you met him?

142
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,950
Is it an arrangement of the fate?

143
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,800
He was closely surrounded by

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,640
four guards with knives.

145
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,750
Even the maids and chamberlains had left,

146
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,870
they guarded him also.

147
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,870
Is he still afraid there would be

148
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,070
assassins in Nanchen Royal Mansion?

149
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,040
That's the strange point.

150
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,950
Your Highness.

151
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,680
How is she?

152
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,230
She is all right. Don't worry.

153
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,710
As soon as I saw her,

154
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,320
I had a mood

155
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,400
that I can't tell.

156
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,440
Although I'm have been castrated,

157
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,230
I'm still human.

158
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,560
Since I'm human, I know emotions.

159
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,990
She is different from that on the portrait.

160
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,070
She won't stand still to let me see her.

161
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,800
She will be afraid

162
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,800
and then get away from me.

163
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,710
Uncle is not in the mansion.

164
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,520
We have to find a good reason to see him.

165
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,070
Today is your birthday.

166
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,160
What's your wish?

167
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,950
Let me tell you what gifts I've prepared for you.

168
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,070
Your Highness is a guest.

169
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,230
No need to spend money on me.

170
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,750
Here is my respect, Your Highness.

171
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,710
You two generals finally came.

172
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

173
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
Your Highness, what can we do for you?

174
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,920
I've prepared good wine and food.

175
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,710
I want to go to the army barracks with you

176
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,990
to celebrate Eleven's birthday.

177
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,350
The mansion is like a family.

178
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I think

179
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,560
Eleven must want to celebrate her birthday

180
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,680
with her family.

181
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,560
But the Royal Army has strict rules.

182
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,590
Outsiders are not allowed to enter the camp without permission.

183
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
Am I an outsider?

184
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,590
I mean those without military status.

185
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,640
What if I have an imperial edict

186
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,870
to reward the army on behalf of His Majesty?

187
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,710
In this case,

188
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I'll make an arrangement right now.

189
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,830
I just wanted to give you a birthday present.

190
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,400
I didn't know you have an edict.

191
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,830
I'm sorry for embarrassing you.

192
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,800
Never mind.

193
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,560
It's okay because it is you.

194
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,920
Your Highness.

195
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,440
The poison has been completely cleared.

196
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,440
Master.

197
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,230
Eleven comes.

198
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,710
Isn't she in the mansion?

199
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,440
Prince of Guangling brought her here.

200
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,560
He said he wanted to hold a birthday party for her

201
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,520
and took this opportunity

202
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,070
to reward the army on behalf of His Majesty.

203
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,870
Let's go and welcome them.

204
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,160
Uncle.

205
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,070
Prince of Guangling.

206
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,040
Are you injured?

207
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,440
Xie Yun, take Eleven to see the military doctor.

208
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,320
Yes.

209
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,640
Prince of Guangling.

210
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,920
Take a break in the tent.

211
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,950
No hurry.

212
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,200
It's rare to enter the army barracks.

213
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,680
I wonder if you are free

214
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,950
to show me around.

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,870
All right.

216
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,200
Come with me.

217
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,830
Show me your hand.

218
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,870
Master would be worried

219
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,920
if the military doctor didn't check your hand.

220
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,230
Although imperial doctors

221
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,990
have high official titles and read a lot,

222
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,590
they have less experience than

223
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,520
our military doctors.

224
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,710
I'm flattered.

225
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,830
They have already used

226
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,920
good medicine for treating wound.

227
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,920
But I have

228
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
folk prescription

229
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,590
which is better than this medicine.

230
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,800
I'll get it right away.

231
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,590
How did he treat you?

232
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,230
With courtesy and integrity.

233
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,440
You are shy.

234
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
I've brought Tusu Wine.

235
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,710
Okay.

236
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
Since you don't want to say,

237
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,800
forget my question.

238
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
Be careful.

239
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,040
Place everything well.

240
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,400
Yes.

241
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:25,830
Yes.

242
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,640
It smells good.

243
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,070
It's all your favorite dishes.

244
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,560
Master, I've brought Tusu.

245
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,520
Tusu?

246
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Dinner prepared tonight

247
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,470
looks a little shabbier

248
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,070
compared with Tusu, Xie Yun.

249
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,230
I'll kill some fat sheep.

250
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,680
Give me a knife.

251
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,320
Here.

252
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,160
This cup of Tusu

253
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,950
is for our guest from afar,

254
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,839
Prince of Guangling.

255
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,440
Thank you, uncle.

256
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,990
I also take this cup of wine

257
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,640
as a toast to all of you on behalf of His Majesty.

258
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,880
I hope the general can win every battle,

259
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,270
so the emperor doesn't have to spend money on building the Great Wall.

260
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

261
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,440
Thank you, Prince of Guangling.

262
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,680
This toast is for

263
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,790
the generals and soldiers

264
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,120
who sacrificed in the rebellion suppression.

265
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,270
Happy New Year.

266
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,990
I hope there would be

267
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,600
no flames of war in our country.

268
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,440
May the people of Beichen live, work and multiply

269
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,030
in peace and contentment

270
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,310
within the wide territory of the country.

271
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,360
May the people of Beichen live, work and multiply

272
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,120
in peace and contentment

273
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,550
within the wide territory of the country.

274
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,640
Finally, I want to say that,

275
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,840
it is Eleven's birthday today.

276
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,600
I hope

277
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,550
she could be happy every day here.

278
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,360
Eleven.

279
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,990
Happy birthday.

280
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,310
Thank you, Master.

281
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,030
Okay.

282
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,600
Everybody, sit down.

283
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,710
Here, Chen.

284
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,680
Sit here.

285
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,230
Okay.

286
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,200
Thank you, adoptive father.

287
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,080
Eleven, who is that?

288
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,360
It's the military
advisor, Xie Chong.

289
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,710
Your Highness.

290
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,160
The climate of the Western State is different from that of the Central State.

291
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,840
Please drink this bowl of medicine while it is warm.

292
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,200
Rest early.

293
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,950
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

294
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,920
Eleven.

295
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,080
Feng.

296
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,400
You...

297
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,920
I can speak.

298
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,550
Great, great!

299
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,030
If aunt knows

300
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,030
you can speak again,

301
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,600
she would be quite happy.

302
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,120
All right, stop standing.

303
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,080
Sit down and talk.

304
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,270
Here.

305
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,310
Hey,

306
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,470
make room for me.

307
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,120
Come on.

308
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,510
Xiaoyu.

309
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,310
Everybody.

310
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,680
Today is my sister's birthday.

311
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,750
And she finally

312
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,790
can speak.

313
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,360
I take this opportunity

314
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,080
to propose a toast to you all!

315
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,510
Cheers.

316
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,230
Cheers. Cheers.

317
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,440
Cheers. Cheers.

318
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,640
All the way here,

319
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,080
I often hear a passage.

320
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,840
I specially recited it

321
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,080
and want to read it for you.

322
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,950
What is it?

323
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,750
Beautiful bones are rare in the world.

324
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,080
There are people who have such bones, but not beautiful skin,

325
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,920
or have beautiful skin, but not bones.

326
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,790
And Jr. Prince of Nanchen

327
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,440
is the only one

328
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,440
who has both beautiful bones and skin.

329
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,880
Common people said

330
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,080
he is rarer than emperors.

331
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,920
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,120
Xiaoyu,

333
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,160
there are outsiders in the army.

334
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,920
Don't talk nonsense.

335
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,160
Are there any outsiders in the army?

336
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,120
Prince of Guangling is right here.

337
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,230
Cui Feng, how is Shouyang?

338
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,470
Shouyang is all right.

339
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,360
But soldiers are missing you

340
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,750
and looking forward to your coming.

341
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,470
Why are you hiding there?

342
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,920
I come to apologize.

343
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,640
Come and sit down first.

344
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,510
What wrong did you do?

345
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,710
I know the military rules are strict.

346
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,640
But I didn't stop Prince of Guangling.

347
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,990
He is a prince.

348
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,120
But you are just a minister's daughter.

349
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,230
How could you stop him?

350
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,120
But we are all happy that

351
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,790
we can celebrate your birthday together

352
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,750
in the army barracks.

353
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,030
Here you are, Pepper Wine.

354
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,600
I'll drink alone?

355
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,470
OK, I'll accompany you.

356
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,470
Tusu bids farewell to the old and Pepper Wine welcomes the new.

357
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,200
Let's take it for celebrating the New Year in advance.

358
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,510
Are you afraid of getting drunk?

359
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,470
God.

360
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,310
This is cup of Pepper Wine

361
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,880
is not for future

362
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,120
or wealth.

363
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,950
I only wish it could bless master

364
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,230
and senior brothers

365
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,950
and senior sisters safety

366
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,510
every year.

367
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,600
Good news.

368
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,950
Where is master's good news?

369
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,440
It has been two months.

370
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,710
Why hasn't there been good news yet?

371
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,840
It's never been that long.

372
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,840
Where are the six garrisons?

373
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,950
I don't even know them.

374
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,200
Where can I find master

375
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,790
if he dies?

376
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,920
The six garrisons are in the north,

377
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,840
north of the Central State

378
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,310
and northeast of the Western State.

379
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,840
If he dies,

380
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,360
he wouldn't want you to go find him.

381
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,400
He will be buried

382
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,790
where he dies.

383
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,030
You haven't slept?

384
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,360
You will be buried

385
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,270
where you die?

386
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,750
Why don't you let me find you?

387
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,640
Once I die,

388
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,640
everything I leave will be empty.

389
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,400
Even if you find and see me,

390
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,990
you would feel nothing

391
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,440
but sad.

392
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,310
Sleep tight.

393
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,550
Master.

394
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Have you seen Eleven?

395
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,080
She is in my tent.

396
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,640
She stays here so late?

397
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
She occupies your tent.

398
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,880
Why don't you stay with her?

399
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,640
What about you?

400
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,750
I'll just walk around.

401
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,640
Mind your business.

402
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,880
Do you...

403
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
You used to sleep in master's study

404
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,400
when you felt tired after practicing instrument in the past.

405
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,880
Only you

406
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,600
dared to do this.

407
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,510
Xiaoyu.

408
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,680
What's wrong?

409
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,550
Where have you been these two years?

410
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,120
Master, Tianxing

411
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,230
and I went to the North.

412
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,200
After pacifying rebellions in the six garrisons,

413
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
we went to Pingzhou and Shanggu.

414
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,640
Xie Yun

415
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,120
and Feng Qiao are in the West.

416
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,710
Your brother is in Shouyang.

417
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,470
We seldom meet.

418
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,880
My brother

419
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,640
is going home, too.

420
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,550
Then we won't talk about him.

421
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,510
I remember.

422
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,550
I have something for you.

423
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,750
This is a soft armor

424
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,160
a princess wore before.

425
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,790
I was afraid I would lose it,

426
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,310
so I wore it all the time.

427
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,710
It's for you.

428
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,990
I'm not going to the battlefield.

429
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,920
I can't use this.

430
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,030
Take it.

431
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,120
Don't refuse.

432
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,080
Everything on me

433
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,990
is all from master.

434
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,600
I have nothing myself.

435
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,550
It's not easy for me

436
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,640
to get such a treasure.

437
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,750
You must take it.

438
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,990
In my heart,

439
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,950
you are the princess

440
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:11,990
of our Nanchen Royal Mansion.

441
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,470
This suits you.

442
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,750
What's good to be a princess?

443
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,230
They are royal and noble.

444
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,270
Everyone envies them.

445
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,880
But I don't.

446
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,030
I envy you.

447
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,600
Envy me?

448
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,920
You joined the army with Tianxing in early youth

449
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,640
and suffered a lot with master.

450
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,710
But I just came to enjoy the fruit

451
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,840
and contribute nothing.

452
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,470
Actually, we're all late.

453
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,080
In master's most difficult time,

454
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,120
he got it through by himself.

455
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,160
You know how many

456
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,230
troops the late emperor gave him back then?

457
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,750
In those years,

458
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,230
the imperial clan took control of the army to protect their own interests

459
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,990
and refused to give up any troops.

460
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,270
When master left the Central State,

461
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
he had cavalry of only 20,000 people

462
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,680
and infantry of 10.000 people.

463
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
How could he win with such few soldiers?

464
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,080
He brought a box of official seals

465
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,880
and an edict with him

466
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,880
when leaving the capital.

467
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,680
He could be able to appoint

468
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,200
any official below the sixth grade along the way.

469
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,640
Master went all the way south

470
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,680
and used these official seals to recruit soldiers and horses

471
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,510
and formed a hasty army.

472
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,680
He made the name of Jr. Prince of Nanchen

473
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,030
resounded all over the world

474
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,750
by successively winning battles

475
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,230
and recovering territories.

476
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,550
Tianxing and I

477
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,510
were orphans escaping

478
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,550
to the temple.

479
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,080
After master recovered the lost land,

480
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,030
we decided to join the army together.

481
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,510
The Jr. Prince of Nanchen you want to see

482
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,310
is him.

483
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,160
Your Highness.

484
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,310
These two children had been yelling to

485
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,950
see you outside the military camp.

486
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,030
What's up?

487
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,750
Join the army.

488
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,600
You look young.

489
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,880
Why do you want to join the army?

490
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,080
You're not old.

491
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,230
I'm not young.

492
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,400
I just look young.

493
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,200
You know what?

494
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,470
Your Highness looks

495
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,200
similar to your age,

496
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,840
but he's been through many battles.

497
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,790
I'm not afraid of many soldiers

498
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,470
but no one will join the army.

499
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,990
The Royal Army will return to the Western State tomorrow.

500
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,920
I'll give you a night to think about it.

501
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,680
If you are not afraid of death,

502
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
just follow me.

503
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,270
Since then,

504
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,750
many years have passed.

505
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,840
I think

506
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,160
we would be killed on the battlefield

507
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,310
or die of old age in the barracks.

508
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,830
What can you do when you are old?

509
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,600
Feed and wash horses.

510
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,480
Or clean the barracks.

511
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,230
As long as I can stay in the army,

512
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,480
I can do anything.

513
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,710
Yeah

514
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,480
As long as you are here.

515
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,520
Let's find something to eat.

516
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,080
Over there.

517
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,679
Let the cook

518
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,750
make some hot for General Hong.

519
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,520
Yes.

520
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:57,790
Wait.

521
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,350
General Hong

522
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,270
is a bit shy.

523
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,600
Tell the cook that

524
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,430
it's because I'm hungry.

525
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,790
Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,270
Do you all have wives and children?

527
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,230
Will anyone bury you if you are dead?

528
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,710
I dare not to get married.

529
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,000
I don't think I have tomorrow.

530
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,350
Even if you want to get married,

531
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,710
they dare not marry their daughter to you.

532
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,520
Xie Yun

533
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,870
always looks for food at night.

534
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
He told me

535
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,430
the cook always secretly

536
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,560
leaves some pancakes for him.

537
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,270
Why is there nothing left today?

538
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,000
General Hong.

539
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,230
General Hong.

540
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,600
I patrol with Shiyi tonight

541
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,640
and heard some noise here.

542
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,560
So I came to have a look.

543
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,520
His Highness is hungry.

544
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
He asked us to cook some food.

545
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,560
If you like,

546
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,830
I can cook some for you as well.

547
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm okay.

548
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,870
But I'm afraid Shiyi will be hungry.

549
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,120
So you can make cook some as well for her.

550
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,480
Send it to my tent,

551
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,750
no, to the main tent later.

552
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,040
OK.

553
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,350
General Cui.

554
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,520
Who's inside?

555
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,830
It's His Highness.

556
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,160
He used to come to light a fire

557
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,200
before a war.

558
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,830
But I've never

559
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,080
heard of an expedition this time.

560
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,430
Go get my reed flute.

561
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,430
Yes.

562
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,680
I aroused your interest?

563
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,870
No one in Shouyang understands me.

564
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,830
It's rare to come back.

565
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,350
I want to play a song with you.

566
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,270
Okay.

567
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,680
Our first Confucian general in Shouyang.

568
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,160
Who said this?

569
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,640
Who do you think would say this?

570
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,230
It must be General Hong.

571
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,870
You are awake.

572
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,120
Xiaoyu.

573
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,870
Who plays the music?

574
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,870
Master likes to play music before war.

575
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,080
It's rare that he plays music not for war

576
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,750
but for pleasing himself.

577
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,790
Master.

578
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,870
General Hong.

579
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,230
You got up late today.

580
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,120
It's Shiyi's fault.

581
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,640
Then I'll leave her to you.

582
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,040
In this camp,

583
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,430
only you two are idle.

584
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,270
Then I'll train the soldiers.

585
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,480
I'm idle?

586
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,710
Scouting camp.

587
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,120
Military training.

588
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,790
Yes.

589
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,430
How did you two take the swords?

590
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,520
Take them well.

591
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,520
Line up.

592
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,200
Yes.

593
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,640
They seem to be afraid of Xiaoyu.

594
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,830
In the barracks,

595
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,120
it's much harder for a female general

596
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,350
to convince soldiers

597
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,310
than the male generals.

598
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,910
I'm sorry for

599
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,160
losing my courtesy last night.

600
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,230
Never mind.

601
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,910
Let me show you around

602
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,000
the barracks.

603
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Pay attention to the action.

604
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,310
When the army comes to a place,

605
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,230
Xiaoyu's scouting camp

606
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,910
will choose a place for the army to be stationed.

607
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,120
The infantry will cut down trees and build wooden walls

608
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,520
to form a military camp.

609
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,520
Tighten your thighs and clamp the horse's back.

610
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,710
Stop shivering.

611
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,830
Look at you.

612
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,430
Get up.

613
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,230
Yes.

614
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,310
Why are there wooden horses in the stable?

615
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,270
It's much more expensive to raise a war horse

616
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,910
than raising a soldier.

617
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,560
So when they train at ordinary times,

618
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,750
they all use fake horses.

619
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,120
Xiaoyu said

620
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,310
our dynasty conquers land with cavalry.

621
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,390
War horses are the most precious.

622
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,960
Continue.

623
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,080
I'll eat if you don't eat.

624
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,000
Master.

625
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,390
What's wrong?

626
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,960
The food is not to your taste?

627
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,390
I...

628
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,910
He acts as if he was in the Buddhist Tower of the mansion.

629
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,680
He is blind to kindness.

630
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,710
You can't

631
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,870
look down on him.

632
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,390
He used to be

633
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,710
a man of letters and martial arts in Nanxiao.

634
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,430
He once conquered

635
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,080
a galloping war horse alone.

636
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,350
He has much better martial arts than you do.

637
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,870
No need to mention the past.

638
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,040
Let me try your martial arts again.

639
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,680
I admit defeat.

640
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,830
You can't just admit defeat through words.

641
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,350
You have to fight with me.

642
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,230
My apprentice

643
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,680
used to live along the river for half a month

644
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,830
to learn to swim.

645
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,040
You have nothing else to do.

646
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,230
Besides chanting,

647
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,790
you can do some exercise.
