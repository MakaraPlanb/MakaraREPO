00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,940
Yes.

377
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,420
Gentlemen, this way please.

378
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,140
I have something

379
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,740
to talk to His Highness.

380
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,740
All of you, please leave.

381
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,020
Yes.

382
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,380
Mrs. Cui, please.

383
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,100
This is Cui Shou.

384
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,020
This time

385
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,500
he has led the 2,000 soldiers of our family

386
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,060
and wanted to stay in Western State to protect my daughter.

387
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,380
I hope Your Highness will allow him to do so.

388
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,540
All right.

389
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,940
I will order someone to place them.

390
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

391
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,820
General Cui.

392
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,220
Do you want to cultivate the fields?

393
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,220
Fields?

394
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,620
My army do farming normally.

395
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,220
When it's not war time, they cultivate their own fields.

396
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,460
Then General Cui shall follow the custom.

397
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,060
Yes.

398
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,900
There's one more thing.

399
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,780
Cui Feng has admired you since he was a child.

400
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,700
He wants to follow you into battles.

401
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,500
I have a letter of recommendation

402
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,100
from my brother.

403
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,460
No need to show me the letter of recommendation.

404
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,700
As long as the young lord is not afraid of death,

405
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,860
he can join the army at any time.

406
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,620
I thought I'd have to go through a lot of trouble

407
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,620
talking about this.

408
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,620
I never refuse someone

409
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,300
from a famous family who wants to join the army.

410
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,780
As for whether he can stay or not,

411
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,620
it depends on his own ability.

412
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,660
There is one last thing.

413
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,060
It's about Eleven?

414
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,100
Your Highness, you've met her.

415
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,100
Shiyi has been like this since she was a child.

416
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,540
She can't speak.

417
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,620
Is it a disease or...

418
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,140
Since her father left home,

419
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,900
she has been ill.

420
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,900
Maybe it's a real illness.

421
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,780
Maybe it's a heart disease.

422
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,420
It's so lifelike.

423
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,540
Good.

424
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,100
You've done a great job, Miss. Cui.

425
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,100
Shiyi,

426
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,580
say goodbye to your mother.

427
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,340
Study hard.

428
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,260
Once a teacher, always a teacher.

429
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,860
Listen to your master.

430
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,340
Remember.

431
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,540
Your Highness, farewell.

432
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,980
From now on,

433
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,100
I will not be by your side anymore.

434
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,420
You must get used to it.

435
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,820
[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

436
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,300
At the same age as her,

437
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,020
Master is already a great general.

438
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,660
She still can't let go of her mother.

439
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,180
You've come a long way.

440
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,580
Rest for a few days.

441
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,500
Master.

442
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,980
Why don't I take her back to the courtyard first?

443
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,340
Go.

444
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,300
Yes.

445
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,070
Wait.

446
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
You just came to the royal mansion.

447
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,380
I'd better take you there myself.

448
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,700
If anyone dares to bully my sister again,

449
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,580
I'll hunt him down.

450
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,260
Two pieces of news.

451
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,140
His Highness has agreed to let me join the army.

452
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,620
I can go with the army now.

453
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,920
Second.

454
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,520
Tonight

455
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,960
I will patrol the camps outside the city

456
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,440
with General Hong.

457
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,560
I won't be able to accompany you.

458
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,760
I can be alone.

459
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,480
Don't worry, brother.

460
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
If you feel lonely,

461
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,840
and like to read books,

462
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,000
there is a library in the backyard of the royal mansion.

463
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,480
You can go there and take a look.

464
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,040
Thank you, Feng Qiao.

465
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,920
Then take care of yourself.

466
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
We'll leave now.

467
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,640
Let's go, General Hong.

468
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
No trespassing

469
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,280
to His Highness' study.

470
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,960
What is it?

471
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
I...

472
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,400
You may leave first.

473
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:37,890
Yes.

474
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Your Highness, Miss. Cui is missing.

475
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,160
The daughter from a powerful family is missing at night.

476
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,040
If word gets out, it will sabotage her reputation.

477
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,000
I dare not say anything.

478
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,480
I can only come to you.

479
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,040
Don't panic.

480
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,980
She'll be fine in the royal mansion.

481
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,510
I'll go and look for her now.

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,020
[Library]

483
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,140
Why did you come to the library?

484
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,820
You're homesick?

485
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,659
Your senior brothers and sisters

486
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,540
always treat the royal mansion

487
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,860
as their own home.

488
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,100
Although they call me "Master",

489
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,820
we all treat each other as family.

490
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,300
You don't have to be so reserved.

491
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,860
I don't usually live in the royal mansion

492
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,699
for a long time.

493
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,659
When I was not in the royal mansion,

494
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,460
the library was always locked.

495
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,260
Since you like it,

496
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,179
I'll leave this key to you

497
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,340
from now on.

498
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,699
Consider it a gift for today's master worship.

499
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,780
You forget what I said during the day?

500
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,420
No need to be overcourteous.

501
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,500
Go back and rest.

She...

509
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,700
What is it?

510
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,340
She wants to pay her respects to you.

511
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,260
Pay her respects?

To Your Highness.

515
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
As a disciple,

516
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,880
she must not neglect her morning and evening visits.

517
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,080

What else?

521
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,080
What?

522
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,640
I'm asking

523
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,680
how many manners

524
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,440

That's a lot.

526
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,720
There are many things in terms of

527
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,560
words, food, washing, traveling,

528
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,880

If she wants to see me in the study,

531
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,760
how many rules does she have to go through?

532
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,600
Before entering, she should knock three times

533
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,480
to inform the master.

534
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,560
She shall not sit inside

535
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,520
but stand respectfully to the left of the master.

536
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,320
When the master asks her to sit, she shall resist.

537
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,760
She can only sit down

538
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,040
after the master asks her to sit three times in a row.

539
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,040
Forget about these.

540
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,120
As the old saying goes,

541
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,440
"A disciple serves his master with the same respect as his father."

542
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,400
How can I forget?

543
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,960
There is only one rule here.

544
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,440
That is, to carry out military orders.

545
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,360
Forget about everything else.

546
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,110
If you teach her that,

547
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,890
the Cui family should detest you.

548
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,320
Now that they're in Western State,

549
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,170

What are you doing?

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Sorting out the ancient books.

554
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,680
Who told you to do that?

555
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,360
Wasn't it you?

556
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,560
Master asked me to manage the library.

557
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,280
Naturally, I have to take care of the books.

558
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I gave you the key,

559
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,800
so that

560
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,480
you can come here whenever you want.

is somewhat interesting.

564
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,040
I came here to learn from you,

565
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,400
not to have fun.

566
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,800
I know.

567
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,120
Then why didn't you teach me?

568
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,810
I haven't figured out how to teach you yet

569
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,440
because you are the first pupil

570
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,760
I've ever had literally.

571
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,760
What is it, Your Highness?

572
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,320
You're unsettled?

573
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,550
I've never had a pupil before.

574
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,240
Aren't Xiaoyu and the others

575
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,020
all your disciples?

576
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,480
They call me "Master"

577
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,720
because

578
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,280
I want to give them a home

579
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,080
so that they have an excuse to stay

580
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,480
in the royal mansion.

581
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,920
I never

582
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,840
preached and taught.

583
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,640
In that case, it's true.

584
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,730
So...

585
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,240
You were once Grand Mentor.

586
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Your Highness.

587
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,680
That was 20 years ago.

588
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,200
You should have something to pass on anyway.

589
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,520
No.

590
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,720
The ones I taught were royal sons.

591
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,280
I didn't once teach

592
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,800
daughters of noble families.

593
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,690
No, no.

594
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,120
In the residence of Cui,

595
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,520
what did she learn already?

596
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,880
To Your Highness.

597
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,520
Other than etiquette,

598
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,000
she didn't learn anything else.

599
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,560
But she likes to read.

600
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,160
She always studied at the academy since she was young.

601
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Did her uncle once say

602
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,360
what he wanted her to learn?

603
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,680
No martial arts, but anything else works.

604
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
She doesn't want to learn martial arts in the royal mansion.

605
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,400
Does she just want to get a title

606
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,720
of disciple?

607
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,760
Have someone prepare the zither in the study.

608
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,960
Prepare the zither?

609
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,320
Master, you can play this?

610
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,640
What?

611
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,040
You think I don't know how to play?

612
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,800
We really thought

613
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,480
you were only good at martial arts.

614
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,400
In the past, in Central State,

615
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,720
His Highness was often criticized

616
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,540
on etiquette.

617
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,040
But in terms of talent,

618
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,290
no one was as good as His Highness.

619
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,960
You.

620
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,480
Watch and learn.

621
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,560
The instruments here are all heirlooms.

622
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,840
One of them

623
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,360
was used by His Highness when he was a child.

624
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,980
After the late emperor passed away,

625
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,840
it was sent to Western State.

626
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,620
His Highness asked

627
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,740
you to choose for yourself.

628
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,500
Which is the one Master once used?

629
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,060
Are you asking me which

630
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,060
is the one His Highness used?

631
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,640
This one.

632
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,500
It's called the High Wind.

633
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,220
The high wind raises the waves,

634
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,620
like the rising fields in the mountains.
