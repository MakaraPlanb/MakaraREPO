enjoys high prestige as well.

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,039
If I can marry a lady from the Cui family…

7
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,160
Houmochen Yue,

8
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,360
I advise you to sober up.

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,800
Miss Cui is the daughter

10
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,479
of the head of Wushui.

11
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,479
If she were to get married, a man from the six clans would be her first choice.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,759
The Liu royal family

13
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,560
and the Beichen aristocratic family would be her second choices.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,360
She's way out of your league.

15
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,759
I'm asking Miss Cui here.

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Whether you're engaged or not,

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,040
I just want an answer from you.

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm not engaged with anyone.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,240
But I already

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,720
have someone in my heart.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,200
And I won't

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,240
change my mind.

23
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,200
Please return.

24
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,400
I hereby make a vow

25
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,240
to guard the border for the rest of my life.

26
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,200
I will not have a wife

27
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,600
or have any children.

28
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,960
Your Highness, are you sure?

29
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,720
Since I would have no child,

30
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
there will be no more reasons for me

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
to usurp power and plot a rebellion.

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,760
In this way,

33
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,880
His Majesty can feel at ease.

34
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,840
All the ministers can also feel at ease.

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,400
I

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,360
will also no longer be troubled by the rumors.

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,360
Do you regret it?

38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,400
The vow you made in the hall that day,

39
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
do you regret it now?

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
A life without a wife or children.

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,280
What kind of answer do you want to hear?

42
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,720
An honest one.

43
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,720
You don't want to talk about it?

44
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,560
In this world,

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,959
the most difficult thing to do

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,640
is to be honest.

47

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,880
Yes, yes.

187
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
That's it.

188
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,240
That tower

189
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,480
is built right there.

190
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,320
This time,

191
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,120
I had someone build a tower named Frontier Settlement Tower.

192
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,680
Unfortunately, they've already torn it down.

193
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,680
I should've brought you to see it.

194
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,760
Frontier Settlement Tower.

195
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,160
Settle the frontier for ten years of non-aggression.

196
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,160
You've done a great deed for the people.

197
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,060
Your gift for this year.

198
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,520
I have always been gifting you

199
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,640
birthday gifts.

200
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,760
But you haven't prepared

201
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,080
a single one for me.

202
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,800
The next time I come back,

203
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,840
try to call me Master, okay?

204
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,920
Or call me

205
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,600
Zhousheng Chen.

206
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,720
That's the flag of Nanchen Royal Army.

207
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,520
Welcome, Your Highness.

208
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,120
Y-Your Highness?

209
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,040
Your Highness, it's safe for you to get off the boat now.

210
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,130
Come.

211
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,680
Your Highness.

212
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,120
-Master!
-Master!

213
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,720
I heard you

214
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,560
crossed the river for me.

215
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,400
I heard that Your Highness

216
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,480
almost offended the Emperor of Nanxiao because of me.

217
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
Xie Yun.

218
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,400
If I hadn't broken my leg,

219
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,880
I would have welcomed you across the river.

220
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,960
Cui Feng is late.

221
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,360
I beg for your mercy, Your Highness.

222
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,560
Feng.

223
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,640
I'm glad you two got back safely.

224
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,080
I've already gathered my troops in Shouyang，

225
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,800
ready to cross the river to save you.

226
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,840
What happened to your leg?

227
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,440
What?

228
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,640
What's with that look on your face?

229
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,520
I heard

230
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,680
General Cui is the scholar in the royal army.

231
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,560
You sure are sentimental.

232
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,900
There's no need to be sentimental, Yun.

233
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,540
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

234
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,660
Seeing your leg like this

235
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,100
all of a sudden…

236
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,300
Since the royal army has arrived here,

237
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,060
why don't we go to Shouyang?

238
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,180
Let's go see

239
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,180
the city General Cui has guarded with his life.

240
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,380
That's good. I've never been there.

241
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,940
Okay, I'll go back and make arrangements.

242
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Going to Shouyang

243
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,180
has been

244
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,580
Shiyi's wish for a long time.

245
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,940
As I have said,

246
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,060
Master loves Shiyi the most.

247
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,060
Your Highness.

248
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,660
Half of my village people

249
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,900
survived because the royal army escorted

250
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,020
us to move south for refuge.

251
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,700
Now that I have met Your Highness,

252
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,620
I have no regrets in my life.

253
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,460
Get up.

254
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,460
Thank you

255
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,820
for taking me across the river.

256
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,140
Your Highness.

257
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,140
Miss Huaiyang made this.

258
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,060
She said

259
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,180
you should eat noodles on your birthday

260
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
to ensure a long and peaceful life.

261
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,300
I'll heed her words.

262
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,900
For a long and peaceful life.

263
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,460
I'll have some now.

264
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,380
It smells so good.

265
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,260
It's delicious.

266
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,660
It's much better than what you people make.

267
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Let me tell you.

268
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,619
There must be a mistress

269
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,940
in a mansion.

270
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,780
Even the noodles taste different.

271
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,420
Your Highness.

272
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,140
You're saying

273
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,420
shameless things again.

274
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,060
Miss Huaiyang is merely staying here for a short while.

275
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,060
How has she become

276
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,460
the mistress of the mansion?

277
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:21,700
Did she

278
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,020
say something?

279
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,500
Does she not like me?

280
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,700
Your Highness.

281
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,540
Although she has a difficult time now,

282
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,700
she is not someone ordinary.

283
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,540
Just look at the temperament and appearance

284
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,300
she has.

285
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,660
As for you, Your Highness.

286
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,540
You should take a look in the mirror.

287
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,500
You brat!

288
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,220
I've spoiled you lot!

289
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,320
You show no respect for me!

290
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,260
What look in the mirror?

291
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,780
Am I ugly?

292
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,100
Not really.

293
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,900
It's just that this mirror is too small

294
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,460
to show my whole face.

295
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,550
Your Highness.

296
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,980
Miss.

297
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,260
Miss.

298
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,660
Um.

299
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,940
I'm wondering,

300
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,860
last time I asked you

301
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
to find a place for me to stay,

302
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,180
are there any houses suitable?

303
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,740
No.

304
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,200
Within the place I govern,

305
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,540
there's not a single empty house

306
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,090
except for my mansion.

307
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:47,880
No.

308
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,060
Am I so terrible?

309
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,910
You don't even want to live in my place?

310
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,180
That is not my intention.

311
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,460
I just

312
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,540
don't want to trouble you.

313
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,940
I'm not troubled.

314
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,500
I haven't been in a relationship

315
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,300
for years!

316
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,820
I wish I could see you every day!

317
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,780
Every day, you…

318
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,300
I've already said

319
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,380
such shameless things.

320
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,820
I won't take it back.

321
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,700
You don't have a place to live for now.

322
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,800
So just live

323
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
in my mansion.

324
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,800
What if one day you find me

325
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,160
pleasing to your eye?

326
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,120
Well.

327
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,160
Um.

328
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,080
Someone!

329
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,400
Where are my men?

330
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,420
[General's House]

331
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Shouyang is a small city.

332
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,200
My residence is even smaller.

333
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,440
Please forgive me.

334
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,400
We have distinguished guests here.

335
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,360
Why did you not inform me?

336
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,950
Uncle.

337
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,200
I didn't want to disturb you.

338
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,960
Are you afraid of disturbing my rest

339
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,350
or are you afraid I'll disturb my uncle?

340
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,200
The issue you and I are arguing about

341
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,240
hasn't come to a conclusion yet.

342
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,760
There's no need to tell His Highness now.

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,960
What are you afraid of?

344
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
My uncle is an elder.

345
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,840
He can help us to settle it.

346
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,720
Otherwise, I'm afraid

347
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
we won't get anywhere

348
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
even if we argue until next year.

349
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Your Highness.

350
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,560
His Highness has just returned from Nanxiao...

351
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,480
General Cui,

352
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,980
take me to the Council Chamber.

353
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,600
Xinghua, please.

354
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,960
Your Highness, please come with me.

355
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,640
They don't look like a couple.

356
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,200
Was their relationship like this

357
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,680
in the past, at the Residence of Cui?

358
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,600
In our residence,

359
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,760
I lived alone in the academy,

360
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,880
apart from them.

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,280
It's said that being a princess' husband has been hard.

362
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,280
Don't discuss about

363
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
their marital issues.

364
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,760
Maybe

365
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,080
they just happen to be fighting

366
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,200
and we saw it.

367
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,310
Let's go in.

368
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,120
Let's go.

369
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,160
Tonight

370
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,470
I'll stay with you.

371
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,960
Are you worried about me?

372
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
You are his cousin

373
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,400
and also Master's disciple.

374
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
It's okay

375
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,000
for you to go in and listen.

376
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,080
I think the princess

377
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,840
is talking about official business,

378
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,320
not a personal matter.

379
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,040
So go listen to their discussion

380
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
for me and the advisor.

381
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,840
If there is something wrong,

382
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,400
we'll be able to deal with it.

383
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,680
Give it to me.

384
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,800
How could I have you serve tea?

385
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,200
You have no experience

386
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,160
serving His Highness.

387
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,920
Give it to me,

388
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,440
so you won't be punished for your mistakes.

389
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,000
Where are the maids in the mansion?

390
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,160
In the royal mansion,

391
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,920
it's been me

392
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,000
who serves tea and water for my master.

393
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm afraid the maids won't do a good job.

394
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,800
Is what you just said

395
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,040
your intention

396
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
or Cui Feng's?

397
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,480
It's not my intention.

398
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,560
I don't want to go to the Central State.

399
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,120
You've been guarding Shouyang for so long.

400
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,640
You've done your duty.

401
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,320
Do you want to guard it for the rest of your life?

402
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,840
Yes.

403
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,920
I'm going to guard it for the rest of my life.

404
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm more attached to Shouyang

405
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,320
than I am to the Cui family

406
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,880
and the Western State.

407
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,840
I've been guarding this city

408
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,400
since I joined the army.

409
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,560
Before I married you,

410
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,160
I had made a vow

411
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,760
to guard this city

412
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,200
until I couldn't draw my sword

413
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,560
or get on my horse.

414
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,760
So, is Shouyang more important

415
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,920
than your future child?

416
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,960
What did you just say?

417
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,920
I grew up in the Central State,

418
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,560
so I can't stand the enviroment here.

419
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,120
No matter what,

420
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
I have to go back!

421
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,680
I'll take my leave.

422
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,280
Your Highness, how could you say that?

423
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
How would you explain it?

424
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,560
The imperial doctor will know

425
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,120
if you're pregnant once he examines you.

426
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,600
I must return to the Central State.

427
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,160
I've been with you since I was a child.

428
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,920
I know what you're thinking.

429
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,720
But now

430
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
you've married someone outside the capital.

431
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Why do you cling to

432
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,560
that man in the Central State?

433
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,680
He sent me a letter.

434
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,720
If I can go back,

435
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,920
I'll be able to get rid of

436
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
this arranged marriage.

437
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,920
That's why you must help me.

438
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,760
No matter what,

439
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,720
make the imperial doctor say that I'm pregnant.

440
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,040
Although your husband doesn't love you,

441
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,800
he has always treated you with respect.

442
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,680
Why don't you

443
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,920
treat him with care?

444
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,200
With your intelligence,

445
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,440
it's not hard to make your husband fall in love with you.

446
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,240
He's a good man.

447
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,000
But I...

448
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,400
But...

449
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,620
Sir.

450
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,680
You are with the princess every day.

451
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,000
You should know

452
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,080
she can't be pregnant with my child.

453
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,520
I…

454
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,920
This child...

455
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,640
I've treated you coldly after the wedding.

456
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,200
That was what led to this scandal.

457
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,520
I will write a letter

458
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,800
to report it to Empress Dowager Qi and my aunt.

459
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,640
For the sake of both our families' reputation,

460
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,880
the child's surname must be “Cui”.

461
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,040
I won't ask

462
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,320
who the father of the child is.

463
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,440
After the child is born,

464
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,600
I am fine

465
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,320
if you want a divorce

466
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,400
or to continue to live in

467
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,880
the Residence of Cui in the Central State.

468
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,240
General.

469
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
You and I were both toyed by fate

470
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,120
and ended up in this marriage.

471
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,440
In the future,

472
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,280
I'll be in Shouyang and you in the Central State.

473
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,440
We don't have to meet ever again.

474
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,800
General.

475
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,400
Feng.

477
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
You've made up your mind?

478
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,480
Yes.

479
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
I'll send the princess back to the Central State first.

480
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,760
Then I'll come back when she's settled.

481
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,880
Go in.

482
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,520
Don't keep His Highness waiting.

483
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,920
Since you're here,

484
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,760
it's better if you tell them yourself.

485
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,080
The princess is pregnant.

486
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,560
I have decided to send the princess

487
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,760
back to the Central State for the fetus's safety.

488
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,240
Congratulations, General Cui.

489
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,440
Congratulations.

490
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,880
Thank you all.

491
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,040
In that case,

492
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,040
we'll have to replace

493
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,040
Shouyang's general.

494
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,880
No need to do that.

495
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,480
I'll send the princess back to the Central State

496
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,000
and find a way to come back.

497
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,040
General Cui, it's not that simple.

498
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,720
If you leave the princess alone in the capital,

499
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,440
even if the princess won't complain,

500
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
the empress dowager and the Qi family

501
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,880
will come after you.

502
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,000
But

503
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
I can't leave here for too long.

504
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,880
I'm the only one who knows this place.

505
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,720
The advisor is right.

506
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,760
You go back to the capital first.

507
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,320
We'll discuss the date of your return later on.

508
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:41,940
Xiaoyu.

509
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,320
You were once stationed here

510
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,520
together with General Cui.

511
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
You know the place better.

512
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,360
Stay here for the time being.

513
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,600
Yes, Your Highness.

514
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,520
General Hong.

515
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm entrusting you

516
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,760
with Shouyang.

517
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,400
Don't worry, General Cui.

518
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
As long as I'm alive,

519
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,600
Shouyang will never fall.

520
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,380
[General's House]

521
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,080
Feng.

522
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,080
Although I joined

523
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
the Nanchen Royal Army,

524
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,840
I didn't live in the Western State

525
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,640
for a long time.

526
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,760
On the contrary, Shouyang

527
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,880
is more like my second hometown.

528
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:57,960
I know.

529
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,410
You've put your heart and soul into Shouyang.

530
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,720
It's okay.

531
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,120
After the princess has given birth,

532
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,000
find a chance to come back.

533
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,560
The first time I came to Shouyang,

534
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,120
it's when His Highness had just recaptured the city.

535
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,680
I came with Xiaoyu

536
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,240
and we lived here for three years

537
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,660
before she left.

538
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:27,960
I'm sorry

539
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,880
to upset you too.

540
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,960
You've kept these things to yourself

541
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,520
with no one to say it to.

542
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,720
I'm the only one you can talk to about this.

543
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,840
Since I'm here, you should get it all out.

544
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,920
It's useless to talk too much.

545
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,750
Tell General Hong

546
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,560
that if there are any good reports,

547
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,280
send that information to the Residence of Cui in the Central State.

548
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,280
Only after reading the good news,

549
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,360
will I be at ease.

550
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,880
Master.

551
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,960
Your Highness.

552
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,800
You have to hand over the military power

553
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,880
and it's a troublesome matter.

554
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,480
Don't treat us like guests.

555
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,240
Just go.

556
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,320
Yes.

557
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,920
I'm going out for a walk.

558
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,520
I wanted to let you

559
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,240
spend some days with your cousin together

560
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,520
in Shouyang

561
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,120
so that you can relax.

562
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,100
I didn't expect

563
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,580
it made you even more upset.

564
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,180
I have a question for you.

565
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Go ahead.

566
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,900
If two people really love each other,

567
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,420
but they can't be together

568
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,700
for various reasons.

569
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,620
Though they know they should let go, they just can't.

570
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
What should they do?

571
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,580
Master.

572
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,260
You don't know what to do either, do you?

573
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,540
Huan Yu asked me

574
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,980
the same question

575
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,940
at the academy.

576
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,820
He asked

577
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,980
if I regretted the vow I made when I was young,

578
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,500
to take no wife and have no children.

579
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,700
I didn't know how to answer that.

580
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,340
But on the river,

581
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,580
the boatman's words made me think that

582
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,500
whether I regret it or not,

583
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,580
every choice I made

584
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,180
is worth it.

[Taiji Palace]

586
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,100
[Jiafu Palace]

587
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,860
Come on.

588
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,220
Here, take it.

589
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,700
Don't look at them.

590
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,100
General.

591
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,780
Whenever Empress Dowager Qi feels happy,

592
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,420
she would ask us to pick up the pearls.

593
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,540
General, we're all discontented

594
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,860
that you're stopping us.

595
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,380
Just

596
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,380
turn a blind eye

597
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,210
to it today.

598
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,900
Even if you won't take it,

599
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,760
you can't stand in our way

600
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,980
to get rich.

601
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,420
-General.
-Don't let me catch you.

602
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,370
We're saying this all for your own good.

603
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,940
If you don't reward them,

604
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,540
how can you convince the people?

605
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,870
What great things can

606
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,800
a general who can't convince the people do?

607
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,180
-That's right.
-That's right.

608
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:27,930
General.

609
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,500
All of you, leave.

610
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

611
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,660
General Qin.

612
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,100
Come in.

613
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,620
I'll make a toast to you.

614
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,900
Come.

615
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

616
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,060
You can hold your liquor! Have another shot!

618
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

619
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,980
These jewels on the ground.

620
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,420
They are all yours.

621
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,739
Thank you, Your Majesty!

622
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,139
Your Majesty, you must not indulge them like this.

623
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,500
You prevented your men from receiving the reward.

624
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,340
Aren't you afraid that

625
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,460
they will hate you?

626
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,180
I...

627
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,820
They used to be Liu Yuan's soldiers

628
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,530
and they have already gotten used to such things.

629
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,460
They are no match for your Nanchen Royal Army.

630
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,540
To rule over your subordinates,

631
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,940
you need to find the right way.

632
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,420
General.

633
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,460
Her Majesty said

634
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,420
you could leave on your own

635
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,700
when you wake up.

636
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,470
Yesterday…

637
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,970
You were drunk last night

638
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,810
and slept here.

00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,270

640
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,340
Look at His Majesty…

641
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Qin Yan?

642
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,180
Why are you so distracted?

643
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,300
I...

644
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,900
It's nothing.

645
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,060
I asked you to guard the empress dowager's chambers.

646
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
You must have seen

647
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,100
things that you shouldn't have seen.

648
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,300
I was wrong to trust others

649
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,180
and imprisoned her for three years.

650
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,780
I can't help but feel guilty.

651
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,060
I can't control

652
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,580
the many absurd things

653
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,100
she does in the palace.

655
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,580
bear with it.

657
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,420

660
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,340
Didn't the imperial doctor tell you to rest and recuperate?

661
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,860
You only need to send a maid

662
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,380
and I will go over to your place.

665
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
order you around?

00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,780
I'm your husband

00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,460
as well as his father.

668
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,900
Present the gift.

669
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,980
What gift?

670
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,060
Is it for me?

671
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,900
It's not.

Your Highness,

677
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,620
I can't accept

678
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,900
such an expensive gift.

679
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,420
When my son is born,

680
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,220
you can use this to discipline him.

681

I wouldn't dare to.

Why would I

703
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,980
spare your life?

704
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,220
I should thank you

for watching over me day and night.

you can enjoy great wealth

712

Last time I was here,

was Tianxing.

00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,020
he came here.

731
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,380
The name is nice.

732
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,900
It was Master's idea.

733
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,420
It was Shiyi's idea.

734
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,740
I was

735
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,700
merely speaking for her.

736
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,540
No wonder Shiyi wanted to

737
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,300
hide the dowry here.

738
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,700
Go up the mountain now.

739
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,100
I'll wait at the foot of the mountain.

740
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,700
Let me carry you.

741
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,100
No way.

743
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,980
Give me a hand.

Let's go.
