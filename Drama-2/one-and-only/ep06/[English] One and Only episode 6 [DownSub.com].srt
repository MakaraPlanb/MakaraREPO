1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,000
Master.

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,600
What is it?

4
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
You don't like the food?

5
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,680
I...

6
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,000
He's still that ungrateful, just like how he was

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,960
in the Buddhist Tower of the Mansion.

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,800
Don't you

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,320
underestimate him.

10
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,520
Back to

11
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
the days in Nanxiao,

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
he was well-versed in both literature and martial arts.

13
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,600
He once tamed

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,440
a running battle steed with just one hand.

15
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,720
His martial arts skills are much better than yours.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,520
It's already in the past,

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
not worth mentioning.

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,400
In that case, I wanna compete with you again.

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
I surrender.

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Surrender or not, you can't say that

21
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
until we have a competition.

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,400
This disciple of mine

23
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,880
once stayed half a month

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
along the riverside to learn how to swim.

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,320
You don't have much going on right now anyway.

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
It's not a bad idea

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,320
to practice a little after chanting sutras.

28
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,160
Fine.

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
Then I'll be a kung Fu monk for a while.

30
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,120
It's just a competition.

31
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,040
Again!

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Feng Qiao.

33
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,480
As one from the Prince of Nanchen's Mansion,

34
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
you should be a good sport.

35
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,560
I lost.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,760
Who would've thought

37
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,399
you would lose one day?

38
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,240
-Your Highness.
-Master.

39
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Your Highness, I'd also like to compete with you.

40
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,120
Me?

41
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,960
That year your army and mine

42
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,600
confronted each other across the Huaishui River.

43
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
We almost had a battle.

44
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
Do you still remember it?

45
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,720
I of course remember it.

46
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,040
Back then, I was still fighting

47
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,400
all over the place for the Emperor of Nanxiao.

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
It was such a joke!

49
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,560
At that time,

50
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
you and I were enemies.

51
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,280
If we fought,

52
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
one of us would have to lose.

53
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,320
But now it's not

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
an issue anymore.

55
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
I'd like to compete with you.

56
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You are right.

57
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,080
Please.

58
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,360
Your Highness, I'm impressed.

59
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,640
I'm flattered.

60
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,280
Master.

61
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
I found a nice place.

62
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,880
Good.

63
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,080
Get me the horse.

64
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,560
Yes.

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Are you coming?

66
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
I don't have a horse.

67
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
I have one.

68
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
But it once trampled on dead bodies.

69
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,320
Are you afraid?

70
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm not.

71
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Let's go.

72
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,040
Shiyi,

73
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,440
do you wanna catch up on your master?

74
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,000
Your Highness.

75
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Where are we going?

76
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,440
To the location of the new temple.

77
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
What new temple?

78
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Ask Eleven.

79
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Oh, it's...

80
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
Tell me later when we get there.

81
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,280
Let's check it out over there.

82
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,960
There's nothing to see.

83
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,120
Watch your steps.

84
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,520
Do you have a name for the temple?

85
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Green Dragon Temple.

86
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,280
Green Dragon Temple...

87
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
No other heavenly deities

88
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,120
are more powerful than the Green Dragon.

89
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,520
It's a good name.

90
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Why Green Dragon?

91
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,760
My mother told me

92
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,919
that my father saw through the vanity of the world,

93
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,600
so he abandoned us and became a monk.

94
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
She also told me

95
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,960
that the monastery he joined

96
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,280
was called Green Dragon Temple.

97
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,920
I asked General Cui

98
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,920
and my brother to help me find it,

99
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,560
but it's been years,

100
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,880
they still haven't

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,320
found a temple

102
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
named Green Dragon.

103
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,640
They are all here.

104
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,400
Let's go.

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,800
It is nice, and it's a huge space.

106
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,320
This place has been deserted for long.

107
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,680
If we can rebuild it,

108
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,960
it'd be a good deed.

109
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,960
We just scanned the whole area.

110
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,120
If this is the central axis,

111
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,920
the gate and the Hillside Hall can go over there.

112
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Front yard.

113
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Back yard.

114
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,480
And we can build the Four Heavenly Kings Hall,

115
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
the Ten Kings Hall,

116
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,600
and the Arhat Hall around it.

117
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
Your Highness, have you thought of a name?

118
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
Name?

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,520
We'll call it

120
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,840
Green Dragon Temple.

121
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Now, let's go.

122
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,040
Let's go.

123
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:29,920
Your Highness.

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,480
Advisor Xie.

125
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,880
Prince of Guangling has been waiting for you in the camp.

126
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,960
And he brought four guards.

127
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
It's the Chief Commander's camp.

128
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,400
We can't even go in without my master's permission.

129
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,600
How dare he bring guards in?

130
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,400
I'll go kick him out!

131
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,120
Xiaoyu!

132
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
He's Shiyi's fiancÃ©.

133
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Don't make a scene.

134
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Military rules shall be obeyed.

135
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,680
You don't have to make an exception for me.

136
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,920
Master, if you don't wanna confront him,

137
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,160
I'll ask him to leave.

138
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,080
When did I ever ask you

139
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
for help while I was around?

140
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,120
Uncle.

141
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,480
Sorry that I kept you waiting.

142
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,720
What were you watching?

143
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
I was watching

144
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,400
the territory you fought for Beichen.

145
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,360
Shouyang is over here.

146
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
And one who's been guarding

147
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,160
the frontiers down the south

148
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,800
is him, General Cui.

149
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Greeting, Your Highness! I'm Cui Feng.

150
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
Your last name is Cui?

151
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,560
Yes.

152
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,680
So you are...

153
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
I'm Shiyi's cousin.

154
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
Then that makes you

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,240
my cousin brother, too.

156
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,640
I'm flattered.

157
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Uncle, I hope we can interrogate

158
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,160
the prince of Nanxiao together.

159
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
So this is what

160
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,920
you are really here for?

161
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Yes.

162
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
This is Prince Nanchen's camp!

163
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Nobody is allowed to come in

164
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,520
without permission!

165
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,600
Those who break in the camp

166
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,000
must be killed!

167
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,120
My apology.

168
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,040
Get out, now!

169
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,920
Yes.

170
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,040
Master,

171
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,240
I'll go keep an eye on them.

172
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,680
Wen!

173
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,760
From now on,

174
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,440
we'll part ways and you'll

175
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,720
no longer be my father!

176
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,680
Why are you doing this?

177
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
You are my son!

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,520
The fact is not like

179
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,880
what your mother told you!

180
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,640
-You are...
-Don't come over!

181
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
Okay! Okay!

182
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,760
If you take one more step forward,

183
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,920
I'll kill myself right now!

184
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,120
Okay.

185
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
I won't push you!

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,480
I give you more time to think it over.

187
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,320
I'll wait for you to be back!

188
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,480
Protect him in secret.

189
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,400
Bring him back to me

190
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,760
unharmed.

191
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Yes!

192
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,440
Prince of Guangling came from the Capital City.

193
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,760
He wants to meet you on His Majesty's behalf.

194
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,960
Miss Feng, please lead the way.

195
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,720
Why did you come to Beichen?

196
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,680
I escaped here.

197
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,920
From the fight over the Crown Prince position of Nanxiao,

198
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
or...

199
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,160
My mother was the Consort Dowager of the previous dynasty.

200
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,360
After the country declined,

201
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,560
she married the Emperor of Nanxiao.

202
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,200
Seven and a half months later, she gave birth to me.

203
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,600
Therefore, people of Nanxiao

204
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,720
always suspect that I'm

205
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,800
the son of the late emperor.

206
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,520
Young Prince of Nanchen must have heard of it.

207
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,240
I surely have.

208
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
Are you saying

209
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,440
the rumor is true?

210
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,520
Yes.

211
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
Before my mother passed away,

212
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
she told me the truth

213
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,440
and asked me to avenge my birth father.

214
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
I've been troubled

215
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,760
by the fact ever since,

216
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,800
and I planned this escape.

217
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,720
I will tell His Majesty

218
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,440
what you said today.

219
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,080
And it's up to His Majesty

220
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,880
how to punish you.

221
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,200
Feng Qiao,

222
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,400
see him out.

223
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,640
Yes.

224
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,040
Prince of Guangling.

225
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,760
You used me just now

226
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,160
and got rid of the four guards.

227
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,720
Do you have anything else to say to me?

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,560
I risked my life to come here because I want you

229
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,240
to send out an army and save His Majesty.

230
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,400
Zhao Teng colluded with General Liu Yuan.

231
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,320
They hold Empress Dowager hostage

232
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,120
and order around the officials in the name of His Majesty.

233
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,960
The esteemed officials

234
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,880
have all resigned to avoid trouble.

235
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,880
And what's left

236
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,040
is only the clique of Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan.

237
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,360
Grand Mentor Cui also resigned for that reason.

238
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,520
Go on.

239
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,200
Uncle, please send out an army

240
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
and take him back to the Capital City.

241
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I'll set off tonight and go back

242
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
to the palace to report.

243
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,560
Your Highness.

244
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,320
You can't send out an army.

245
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,080
If you do, I'm afraid

246
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,880
His Majesty

247
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,160
will mistake you intention for rebellion.

248
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,120
He won't.

249
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,240
When he said he looked out to the Western State

250
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,319
while he was in the Central State,

251
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
I knew right away

252
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,359
that he was still that young kid.

253
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
It's just

254
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,040
that I have to do it in secret.

255
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,920
If people see me,

256
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
they'd think something huge happened,

257
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,079
and some of them

258
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,839
would take the chance and revolt again.

259
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,520
It'd put the Central Plains in trouble.

260
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,880
We still don't know which side

261
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,599
Counselor-in-chief Liu Wei is on.

262
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,640
And he's quiet close to Liu Yuan.

263
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,760
I'm worried that he'd get in the way

264
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,640
or trick the officials

265
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,640
into forcing His Majesty to step down.

266
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,200
We need someone who's

267
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,240
more influential than the Counselor-in-chief

268
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,400
to keep him under control.

269
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,280
This person has to be highly respected

270
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
and disinterested

271
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,880
so that he won't pose any threat to His Majesty.

272
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,920
Master,

273
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
I have a person in mind.

274
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
My uncle.

275
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,880
The Tu Clan in the north is led by the Cuis.

276
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,600
My uncle Geng Yin

277
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,520
served three emperors

278
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,720
and enjoys high prestige.

279
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,840
The officials will listen to him.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
But Grand Mentor Cui has resigned.

281
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,040
He may not be willing to return.

282
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,400
I'll go talk to him.

283
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,320
And my brother will go with me.

284
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,600
my brother and I

285
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,200
will go back to

286
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,400
the Qinghe Commandery regardless.

287
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Let us give it a try.

288
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,760
I think it's worth trying.

289
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,800
Okay.

290
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
I'll let Xiaoyu see you off.

291
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,080
Thank you, master!

292
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,360
I'll go tell her.

293
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
What are you worried about, Your Highness?

294
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,360
This is the first time she's left the Western State

295
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,240
since she came to the Prince of Nanchen's Mansion.

296
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,440
To go to the residence of Cui,

297
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
her own home.

298
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,480
I will do my best

299
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
to persuade my uncle.

300
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Your Highness, rest assured.

301
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
I will talk my father into coming

302
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,200
even if I have to kneel and beg.

303
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,160
General.

304
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,880
It's cold at night.

305
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,880
Please go to sleep inside.

306
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,240
We didn't even have a piece of cloth

307
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,640
to block the wind when we were on the march before,

308
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
and we still made it.

309
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,600
We suffer 360 days a year.

310
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,240
You should at least rest for five days.

311
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,880
Otherwise, you'd be too hard on yourself.

312
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,560
It's okay.

313
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,760
You can leave now.

314
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,880
I'll watch him.

315
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,120
Yes.

316
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,400
Use an extra iron chain

317
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,240
and tie me on the shed.

318
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,200
You don't have to suffer because of me.

319
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm just curious.

320
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,640
Why do you put yourself through this?

321
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,440
My master

322
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,080
didn't ask me to torture you.

323
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,160
Suit yourself.

324
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
I used to pave gravels

325
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,200
on the floor of my room.

326
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,280
When I reviewed the reports,

327
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,520
I'd walk on the gravels

328
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,440
back and forth barefoot

329
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,400
to get used to the rough feeling.

330
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,880
In that case, when I escape

331
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,240
I can eat less, sleep on the straw mat,

332
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,600
and resist the coldness when there's no fire.

333
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,120
I trained myself to develop those habits.

334
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,120
Just to make your escape?

335
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,320
Yes,

336
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
and no.

337
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,000
I called him father and was loved by him

338
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
for over 20 years,

339
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
but as it turns out,

340
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,800
he's the one who killed my birth father

341
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,120
and slaughtered the people of my country.

342
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
My mother, bearing her hatred toward him,

343
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,160
was forced to marry him.

344
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,480
I'd never forgive myself

345
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,680
if I don't make myself suffer.

346
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,680
Master.

347
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,560
Lead an army of 30,000 soldiers tomorrow

348
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,800
and take him back to the Capital City.

349
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Master, I thought

350
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,440
we'd decide how

351
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,120
to deal with him

352
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,640
after Prince of Guangling returns to the Capital City.

353
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,200
Are you questioning my order?

354
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,600
I dare not!

355
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,840
Go ahead.

356
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,400
What are you doing?

357
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,480
Master asked me to stop you

358
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
so we can hear their conversation.

359
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,640
You want to use me as an excuse

360
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,160
and deploy heavy forces in the Central State.

361
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,640
I've heard that you'd rebel

362
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,520
for over 10 years now.

363
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
And finally I'll get to see it.

364
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,760
Who told you that I'd rebel?

365
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,800
You won't?

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
Don't tell me you send out the troops

367
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,920
to the Central State just for a drill.

368
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,160
No. For escorting you.

369
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
Though I know Kung Fu,

370
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,160
I can hardly fight against 20 soldiers.

371
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,480
You need an army

372
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,320
of 30,000 soldiers to escort me?

373
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,040
Because

374
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,120
of your special identity.

375
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,000
No matter what, I'm your prisoner now.

376
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm at your mercy.

377
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,560
You sent away the women in your mansion

378
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
and hid your son and daughter in a temple.

379
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,240
How did you know?

380
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,760
Emperor Xiao found them

381
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,520
and killed them.

382
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,760
But he regretted it right away

383
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
and gave them a proper burial.

384
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
He issued a decree

385
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,600
that you'll still be his son

386
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
as long as you get back.

387
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,040
I will never forgive him!

388
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,320
In fact, I do have another reason

389
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
to escort you back.

390
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,400
I can keep you alive

391
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,680
if you do what I say.

392
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,840
What do you want me to do?

393
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,240
Let this thing settle itself

394
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,240
and do not say a word.

395
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
What is Qinghe Commandery like?

396
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,480
I haven't been home for so long.

397
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
I don't even remember.

398
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
I'd never stepped out of the house

399
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,320
since my father was gone,

400
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,720
until I left for the Western State.

401
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,120
I heard that the snacks there

402
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,040
are quite tasty,

403
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,040
and that they are always in high demand

404
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,520
on festivals.

405
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
When we finish our business,

406
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,880
I'll take you to try the snacks.

407
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,160
We can also bring some back

408
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,080
to our fellow brothers and sisters.

409
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,600
Then I'll thank you in advance

410
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,960
on behalf of them!

411
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,760
You are very welcome!

412
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,000
Your Ladyship,

413
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,520
we'll cross the border soon.

414
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,240
Time really flies!

415
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,240
Young Master, Your Ladyship.

416
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,800
Please take a bath and change.

417
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,080
They are all waiting for you.

418
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,320
Mother.

419
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,520
My daughter was recovered in the Western State!

420
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,160
Yes.

421
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,280
That's great!

422
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,120
Please rise.

423
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,480
Though it's been a year,

424
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,520
Cui Feng hasn't changed a bit.

425
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,360
You made so many military exploits,

426
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,960
but you don't look like a fighter,

427
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,680
more like a scholar.

428
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,160
You stayed in the Western State for too long.

429
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,640
You forgot our family rules already, didn't you?

430
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,760
You were the last two

431
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,400
arrived in the Qinghe Commandery.

432
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,760
The clan leader asked about you many times.

433
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,240
We all dared not tell him.

434
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,560
Don't be mad.

435
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,960
The Western State is the furthest from here.

436
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,280
They were only a couple of days late.

437
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,960
It's no big deal.

438
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,720
But they came back late...

439
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,360
Fine.

440
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,520
Sister,

441
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
you always protect them.

442
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,320
Your uncle has been staying in the academy

443
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,800
and studying history.

444
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,640
When he has time

445
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
to see you,

446
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,240
you can go greet him.

447
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,360
In that case, I'll go

448
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,800
see my father by myself.

449
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,440
You need to go see him

450
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,640
at the academy as well.

451
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,520
What's the matter?

452
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,880
Mother,

453
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,400
we didn't come back this time

454
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,800
for the compilation of the history of Beichen.

455
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
We have something to talk to my uncle.

456
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,080
In or word,

457
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,040
we came bearing a secret letter from His Highness.

458
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,120
Father.

459
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,840
Shiyi.

460
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,480
I didn't get you into the palace.

461
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,480
I'm sorry.

462
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,320
I don't want to enter the palace.

463
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,920
And I don't blame you at all, uncle.

464
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,880
See,

465
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,800
the two people you care

466
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,000
about the most are home now.

467
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Just be relieved and focus on getting better.

468
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,880
Aunt,

469
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
when did my father fall ill?

470
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,160
How come he never mentioned it in his letters?

471
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,200
For all these years, your father

472
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,960
appeared to lay low,

473
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,920
but actually he never stopped

474
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
fighting against Liu Yuan and Zhao Teng

475
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,520
in order to save people's lives.

476
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,120
Because of that,

477
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,040
he offended Zhao Teng and his people.

478
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,160
So,

479
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,520
he can't let people know that he's ill,

480
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,520
in case

481
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,640
our family will be in danger.

482
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,880
He's a well-respected veteran official.

483
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,760
Liu Yuan wouldn't dare touch him.

484
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,240
But

485
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,320
once something bad happens to him,

486
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,680
Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan will surely seek revenge

487
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,120
for the drudge they've been holding

488
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,800
and take it all out

489
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,560
on the descendants of the Cui family

490
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,640
Therefore,

491
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
we used the history

492
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,800
compilation thing as an excuse

493
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,080
and asked you guys to resign or leave the army

494
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,000
so that you can come home for protection.

495
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
Even if your uncle passes away,

496
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,040
we can't

497
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,920
let people find out.

498
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,000
We have to keep it a secret as long as possible.

499
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,000
As soon as he's alive,

500
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,080
the Cuis will be safe.

501
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,360
Otherwise,

502
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,000
the Cui family will lose

503
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,600
its foothold in the court for sure.

504
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,400
And that's why your marriage arrangement

505
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,360
with the imperial family is more important than ever.

506
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,000
I understand.

507
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,720
What does

508
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,640
Young Prince of Nanchen want us to do?

509
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,120
My master didn't send us back.

510
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,120
It was our idea to come back.

511
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,200
My master has decided

512
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,480
to lead heavy forces to the Central State.

513
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,520
He'll get rid of those bad officials

514
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,680
and bring the court back on the track.

515
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,560
He'll do it by force?

516
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,000
My master said

517
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,040
any of his moves would spark rumors

518
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,040
about Prince of Nanchen

519
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,960
leading his troops invading the east,

520
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,120
and that would cause a big mess.

521
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,120
So,

522
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,720
he won't go

523
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
under the name of the Prince of Nanchen's army.

524
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
He's find an excuse

525
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,760
and move the army to the Central State in secret.

526
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,560
That's a good idea.

527
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
Then what about Zhao Teng?

528
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,000
He's our primary target.

529
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,960
Prince of Guangling will offer help inside the palace

530
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,000
and deal with Zhao Teng,

531
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,960
while my master will deal with Liu Yuan

532
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,200
outside the palace.

533
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,040
So what does he

534
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,080
want us to do?

535
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
To keep the court in order

536
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,320
with his prestige.

537
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,680
As long as my uncle is there,

538
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,920
even if Zhao Teng

539
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,000
and Liu Yuan are dead,

540
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,920
no one would dare say anything.

541
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,680
But we'll all die if we fail.

542
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,600
How many family members do we have?

543
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,240
Have you thought about that?

544
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,040
Wenjun.

545
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,000
What else did His Highness say?

546
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,960
My master said

547
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,600
His Majesty gave this to me.

548
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,720
You'd understand,

549
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,600
when I bring it back.

550
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,520
He's trying to remind me

551
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,080
that our Cui family has been

552
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,840
highly valued by the imperial family.

553
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,280
We should keep that in mind.

554
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,480
I'll set off

555
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,800
tomorrow.

556
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,480
How's your father?

557
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,920
I'll tell you later.

558
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,960
Aunts,

559
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,640
this is General Hong,

560
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,160
the principal disciple

561
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,960
of Young Prince of Nanchen.

562
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,960
I'm Hong Xiaoyu. Nice to meet you!

563
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,120
You can all spend the night at the academy.

564
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,440
If you need anything, just ask the servants.

565
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Thank you, Lady Wenjun!

566
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,360
My uncle is seriously ill.

567
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,920
You are the only general in our Cui family.

568
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,600
But I didn't teach you

569
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,680
any of my learning.

570
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
I feel like I've let you down.

571
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,160
Our Cui family declined

572
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,040
when I was little.

573
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,080
We had nothing back then.

574
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,840
I copied books and helped

575
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,360
my family to get by.

576
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,960
Later,

577
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,560
I became well-known for my scholarship,

578
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,000
and I was titled as Secretariat Director,

579
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,679
in charge of compiling the national history.

580
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,040
I was also appointed as Cavalier Attendant.

581
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,960
That's how I revived our Cui family.

582
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,600
And then I became the Grand Mentor

583
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,480
and the Grand Guard.

584
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,239
I

585
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,080
served three emperors

586
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,000
to get our Cui family

587
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,120
to where it is now.

588
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
From now on,

589
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,400
our Cui family

590
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,040
will rely on you guys.

591
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm not good at comforting people,

592
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,400
especially in this kinda situation.

593
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,920
You don't need to comfort me.

594
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
Like my father said,

595
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,880
the court matters are more important.

596
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,720
We need to remodel

597
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,400
Shiyi's carriage tonight.

598
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,040
My father can't sit up.

599
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,920
Everything inside must be redesigned.

600
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,760
Then we need to hurry.

601
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,360
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

602
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,800
You haven't either.

603
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,800
You are different.

604
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,400
You are our guest.

605
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,920
How can we let our guest starve?

606
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll ask them

607
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,360
to cook you something.

608
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,080
You see me as a guest?

609
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,560
Your father is badly ill.

610
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,200
I know you don't have appetite.

611
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,640
You think I do

612
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,480
when I see you

613
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,240
like this?

614
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,520
I'll go check the carriage.

615
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,240
To your uncle, those manuscripts

616
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,360
are more important than his life.

617
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,760
He doesn't allow anybody to touch them.

618
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,920
I noticed earlier that you seemed a little rusty

619
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,320
when you performed formality.

620
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,440
Do you greet with formality in the Prince's Mansion?

621
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,840
I don't have to.

622
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,040
His Majesty doesn't care.

623
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,520
He'd actually

624
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,240
blame me if I did.

625
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,600
He doesn't like that.

626
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,280
When he was young,

627
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,040
I often heard him read out a poem.

628
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,880
I thought it was quite improper back then,

629
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,360
and I found the one

630
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,600
who wrote that poem

631
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,520
was overstating it.

632
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,600
But now it seems

633
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,240
that he's really become like that.

634
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,040
What poem?

635
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,840
Just a doggerel made up

636
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,360
by some scholar.

637
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Mother, tell me.

638
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,720
âLying on the Baigu beach,

639
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,960
I can't help singing out loud.

640
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,520
With one steed

641
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
and one bottle of wine,

642
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,000
who can be as free as me?â

643
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,640
Mother,

644
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,080
if we make it this time,

645
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,880
I want to take some book from the academy

646
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,080
to the Western State.

647
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,280
There's a library in the Prince's Mansion.

648
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,120
The second floor is still empty.

649
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,480
I want to fill it with books.

650
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,320
Okay.

651
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,960
âLying on the Baigu beach,

652
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,120
I can't help singing out loud.

653
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,360
With one steed

654
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
and one bottle of wine,

655
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,200
who can be as free as me?â

656
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,480
Here, have some water.

657
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,400
Thank you, Your Highness!

658
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,240
So, are you tired?

659
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,200
We've just started.

660
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,120
I'm not tired yet.

661
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,400
Try to eat more

662
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,600
and save some strength.

663
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,320
-Keep it for...
-Advisor Xie.

664
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,120
What are you looking at?

665
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,400
I'm observing the sky.

666
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,440
Can you tell it's bad luck

667
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,600
or good luck?

668
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,040
I can tell

669
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,360
that it's a clear day

670
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,960
and windless,

671
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,840
suitable for a fight.

672
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,720
You two old timers

673
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,200
never take things seriously.

674
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,120
Okay.

675
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,760
Since I'm not serious enough,

676
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,320
why don't you tell fortune for His Highness?

677
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,000
A nothing guy like Liu Yuan

678
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,440
doesn't serve my fortune-telling.

679
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,440
If we can't win,

680
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,640
the generals should be beheaded

681
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,600
as punishment.

682
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,240
Judging by the palm force,

683
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,640
it must be General Feng.

684
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,440
You punk!

685
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,880
Your hearing is indeed good!

686
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,240
Master,

687
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:40,960
the Cui family's carriage

688
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,080
has passed through the city gate.

689
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
We'll set off

690
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,520
in one hour.

691
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,960
Stop!

692
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,880
General, where did you come from?

693
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,480
That's not a question

694
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,800
you can afford to ask.

695
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,480
We are escorting a major criminal to the Capital City

696
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,760
according to His Majesty's decree!

697
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Forgive me, General!

698
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,280
General, please.

699
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,400
Shiyi is so bold.

700
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,120
She's holding a fake decree

701
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,680
as if it were real.
