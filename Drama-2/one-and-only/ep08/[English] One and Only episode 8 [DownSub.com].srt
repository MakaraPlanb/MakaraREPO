1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,430
All right.

3
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Only you can

4
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,640
make me admit defeat.

5
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,070
Do you have any unfinished wishes?

6
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
Since I dominated the court,

7
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,520
I've enjoyed myself as an emperor,

8
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
so I have no regrets.

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you need me to

10
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,840
take care of any of your families?

11
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,240
I have a son.

12
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,960
I'll dispatch someone to escort him back to Pingcheng

13
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,680
to avoid this disaster.

14
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,240
Before His Majesty was born,

15
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,190
the late emperor had an eldest son

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,150
who wasn't born by the empress.

17
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,630
But he died at 3.

18
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,800
In order to find the truth out,

19
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,520
I offended Empress Gao.

20
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
But Liu Yuan begged for leniency

21
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,960
and saved me.

22
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,870
In my childhood,

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,400
I was on good terms

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,630
with Liu Yuan.

25
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,240
That's why you buried wine together?

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,630
Yeah.

27
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,280
Then,

28
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,280
have you ever buried some wine with any woman?

29
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,400
What do you mean?

30
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,840
Nothing.

31
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,430
You walked on every itch here

32
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,870
in your childhood?

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah.

34
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,000
Zhousheng Chen.

35
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,710
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,120
It doesn't matter.

37
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,590
I'm just not used to

38
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,910
hearing you

39
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,800
call me by my name.

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
Your family is in the Western State

41
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,800
and you will live in the Western State later.

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,310
You just said

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
it's enough for you to have ten orphans

44
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,070
and one disciple

45
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,240
in your mansion.

46
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,430
Yeah, it's enough.

47
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,390
Miss Cui,

48
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Prince of Guangling

49
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,800
is waiting for you outside the hall.

50
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,159
I'm going to ask him back.

51
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,830
My bedding hall

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
is also in the imperial palace.

53
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,510
How can you stop Prince of Guangling?

54
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,830
Ask him in.

55
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,870
Yes.

56
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,680
Wait.

57
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,920
I don't feel well.

58
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,159
I'm afraid I can't deal with him if he comes in.

59
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,830
If so, we can only ask him to go back.

60
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,800
Yes.

61
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,310
What's wrong?

62
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,720
I'll be better after having a rest.

63
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,120
Your Highness,

64
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,950
she is…

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,190
Advisor,

66
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,480
summon an imperial doctor.

67
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Your Highness, can't you

68
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,390
feel her pulse?

69
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,830
I'm unfamiliar with it

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,750
as I haven't done this for long.

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Let me do it.

72
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,000
It's more reliable

73
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,070
to summon an imperial doctor.

74
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,830
Your Highness, you know

75
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,950
my medical skills.

76
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,750
I can…

77
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,430
OK.

78
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
I'll summon an imperial doctor.

79
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,950
Advisor,

80
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
please feel my pulse.

81
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,360
Let me do it.

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,040
You feel a pain in the chest?

83
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,070
Sometimes you feel depressed?

84
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,000
You had ringing in the ears?

85
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,000
A little.

86
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,000
It's not serious. You'll be better after a rest.

87
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,870
Then I go to rest immediately

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,920
and won't meet any visitors.

89
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,870
Suit yourself.

90
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,190
The maid said

91
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,430
Empress Dowager wants to send the nun

92
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,270
to the Western State

93
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,600
to give Jr. Prince of Nanchen a favor.

94
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,360
Second,

95
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,830
if she gives birth to a baby,

96
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,270
the baby can be sent back to the palace

97
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,800
to be raised as a hostage.

98
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,630
Are you sad

99
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,750
that you're being forced to stay here by me?

100
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm just tired.

101
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,000
I know

102
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,669
you feel so restless

103
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,320
because she is in the palace.

104
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,200
Since you came here,

105
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
I've been with you,

106
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,320
haven't I?

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,320
That's just your helpless action.

108
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,030
She is my fiancée.

109
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm worried about her since she is ill.

110
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,030
Is there anything wrong?

111
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,240
After marrying me,

112
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,750
she will be your sister-in-law.

113
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,870
You can't dislike

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,440
her like this.

115
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,270
If she is good to you,

116
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,910
I won't dislike her.

117
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,270
Don't worry.

118
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,120
Your Highness,

119
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,270
Princess.

120
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,480
What's up?

121
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,550
By order of Empress Dowager,

122
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,960
some of the Cui clan directly drove a carriage from the palace gate

123
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
to her bedding hall.

124
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,600
Did you see who got off the carriage?

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,390
Many of

126
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,550
the Cui clan.

127
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,870
If you want to see me,

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,750
I can go to your mansion.

129
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,240
Why do you come regardless of your condition?

130
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,670
I'm afraid I can't wait any more.

131
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
You come

132
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,150
for the Crown Princess' engagement?

133
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,550
Now that His Majesty has concubines,

134
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,270
he'll have sons soon.

135
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,120
You won't allow Prince of Guangling

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,790
to be the Crown Prince,

137
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,840
right?

138
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,200
Yeah.

139
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,080
Prince of Guangling will be unqualified.

140
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,600
So he will be useless.

141
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,390
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,360
But…

143
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,440
Please cancel Shiyi's engagement.

144
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,670
Feng.

145
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,440
I want to ask for an engagement

146
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,390
for my son.

147
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,510
Which girl do you think suits him?

148
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,790
Tell me.

149
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,870
Princess of Xinghua.

150
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,630
My son has been guiding Shouyang for many years.

151
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,630
With many battle achievements,

152
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,840
he is worthy of Her Highness.

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,360
In the palace,

154
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,120
only she

155
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,440
reaches marriageable age.

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,030
But…

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,870
If she marries my son,

158
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
the Cui clan and your family

159
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,510
will be united through marriage,

160
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,440
which will be good

161
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,720
for you only.

162
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,910
Your Majesty.

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,870
OK.

164
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,150
I'll certainly agree with this marriage

165
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
to make up for what the royal family

166
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,720
owe your family.

167
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

168
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,120
Shiyi.

169
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
Shiyi.

170
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,910
Your Highness, please behave yourself.

171
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,080
I won't definitely cancel our engagement.

172
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,150
As the favored

173
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,390
Prince of Guangling,

174
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,030
it's not hard for you

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,150
to have a better marriage.

176
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,720
Now that Her Majesty has cancelled our engagement,

177
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,510
don't give your heart

178
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,870
to me.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,840
Shut up.

180
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,600
You called her in public like this.

181
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,550
Aren't you afraid of offending the Cui clan

182
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,200
and Nanchen Royal Mansion?

183
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,870
You're a prince,

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
but the Cui family's daughter

185
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,670
is not humbler than you.

186
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,720
Your Highness, My Lady,

187
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,630
please calm down.

188
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,510
Your Highness has loved Miss Cui since childhood.

189
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,240
He doesn't want to

190
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,840
and won't hurt her.

191
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,550
Uncle, please forgive me.

193
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,910
Go out of the palace

194
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,150
to stay in the Residence of Cui

195
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,000
with your mom for a few days.

196
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,270
And spend some days

197
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,440
with your uncle.

198
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,120
Yes.

199
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,150
Aunt, I don't want to marry him.

200
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,550
Aunt.

201
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,080
I don't want to marry him.

202
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,120
The marriage between the Cui clan and us

203
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,840
is imperative.

204
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,510
Now we just let it be.

205
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,440
So you must marry him.

206
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,270
But, but I don't like him.

207
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,550
Who do you like?

208
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,510
I…

209
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,840
I grant you the status of princess

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,030
is not to make you enjoy yourself.

211
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,030
You can choose to marry Cui Feng of the Cui clan,

212
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
or marry a ruler in the border areas

213
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,910
to make peace.

214
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,440
Cui Xiu is dead,

215
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,790
and I'm dying.

216
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,840
The Cui clan doesn't have anyone influential in the court.

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,480
Wenjun,

218
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,240
remember.

219
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,150
Don't mourn for me for three years,

220
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,870
but ask Her Highness to marry in as soon as possible.

221
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,630
Dad,

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,390
I don't want to marry her.

223
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,030
Please cancel the engagement.

224
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,750
You,

225
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,440
you unfilial son.

226
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,080
Dad.

227
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,510
Dad.

228
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,030
Unfilial son.

229
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,630
Dad. Dad.

230
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,720
Cui Feng,

231
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,030
your dad gave up his dignity

232
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,750
to ask for this engagement for you.

233
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,120
Do you really want your dad

234
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,870
to die in anger?

235
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,240
Dad,

236
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,120
I always

237
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,030
listen to you

238
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,080
and have never gone against you.

239
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,390
This time,

240
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,320
I beg you to cancel this engagement.

241
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,550
I would rather remain single all my life

242
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,550
than marry the princess.

243
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,750
Beat him.

244
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,840
Don't stop until he promises.

245
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,829
Mom,

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
stop them.

247
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,880
Your uncle is the clan master.

248
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Who dares to disobey him?

249
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,750
Master! Master! Master!

250
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,720
Dad.

251
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,200
Brother.

252
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,590
Dad.

253
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,960
Dad.

254
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,480
Favored by

255
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,240
the late emperor,

256
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,200
I was promoted to such a position.

257
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,240
I should have gone without regrets,

258
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:24,640
but I'm loath to leave the descendants

259
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,680
of Wushui.

260
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,110
Dad.

261
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:42,030
Do you still treat me as your dad?

262
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,070
Promise your dad.

263
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
You unfilial son.

264
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,510
All of us

265
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,400
get married for the Cui clan.

266
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,350
Promise him.

267
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,350
Wenji.

268
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,030
I know you dislike it.

269
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,960
But, Cui Feng,

270
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,070
each of us

271
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,680
should sacrifice for our clan.

272
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,720
When Shiyi was 10 years old,

273
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,720
her dad's clan

274
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,400
offended Empress Gao.

275
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,270
To prevent the Cui clan

276
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,750
and Shiyi from being implicated,

277
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,030
I wrote the divorce agreement

278
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
to divorce him.

279
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,240
I was more reluctant

280
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,070
than you are.

281
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,790
Cui Feng,

282
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,400
I beg you.

283
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,750
Let your dad

284
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,310
go without regrets.

285
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,400
I promise.

286
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,350
Dad.

287
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,400
Dad!

288
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,000
Dad!

289
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,880
Brother!

290
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,640
Brother. Brother. Dad.

291
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,200
Brother.

292
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,400
Brother. Brother.

293
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,270
Brother.

294
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,110
Brother.

295
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,590
Brother.

296
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,830
When did you come back?

297
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,880
Master.

298
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
I want to go back to the Western State.

299
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,030
I want to go back to the Western State.

300
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,310
I want to go back to the Western State.

301
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,680
Here you are.

302
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,920
Your Highness.

303
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,880
Cui Wenjun comes.

304
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,880
Your Highness.

305
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,880
Is Shiyi here?

306
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
She is not feeling well.

307
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,160
Give me some days

308
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
to persuade her.

309
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,590
You're her master,

310
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,160
but you're not her family after all.

311
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,200
Let us take her back.

312
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,790
You're…

313
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,680
Cui Wenji.

314
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,510
As a member of the Cui clan,

315
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,030
you should know

316
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,720
Shiyi has lived in my mansion

317
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,720
for long.

318
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,510
What she gained

319
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,310
and learnt

320
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,830
all come

321
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,350
from here.

322
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,590
So I know more about her

323
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,000
than you.

324
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,750
Brother just died.

325
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,440
Wenji and I indeed are busy

326
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,880
with internal and external affairs.

327
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,960
So we have no time to talk things out with Shiyi.

328
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Back then…

329
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,590
Your Highness, please explain it to Shiyi for us.

330
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,350
Thank you.

331
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,440
Your Highness,

332
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,510
isn't

333
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,680
Cui Wenji...

334
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
Even the Empress Dowager respects him.

335
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,240
You were so rude.

336
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,790
You wanted to see your own daughter,

337
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,750
but he stopped you.

338
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,510
Can't I

339
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,830
speak for you?

340
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,680
For me

341
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,350
or for yourself?

342
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,350
The late Prince of Nanchen

343
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
is gone.

344
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,920
Don't be

345
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,030
resentful to the mansion.

346
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,830
You think too much.

347
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,070
It has been years since my uncle's death.

348
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,790
I didn't expect that

349
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,200
she is still

350
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,720
dwelling on the past.

351
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,720
They were not destined to be together,

352
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,550
so she can't let it go.

353
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,350
In the palace that day,

354
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,160
Master Cui convinced me

355
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,680
to take Shiyi

356
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,030
as an apprentice

357
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,750
with the affair of my uncle with Cui Wenji,

358
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,830
so as to resolve the hatred between the two families.

359
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,350
Otherwise,

360
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,030
I wouldn't have agreed

361
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,880
with him easily.

362
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,030
I'm sorry

363
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,960
to embarrass you.

364
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,480
Shiyi.

365
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,720
If I had known that

366
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,110
you didn't want to take me as an apprentice,

367
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,960
I wouldn't have stayed in the Western State.

368
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,680
If not,

369
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,750
where can you go?

370
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,790
Come with me.

371
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
Who is she?

372
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,310
She is from the Cui clan.

373
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,750
Cui Shiyi.

374
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,160
She is the daughter of Li Qilang?

375
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,960
Yes.

376
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,400
Another blood debt

377
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,110
that the Gao family owes.

378
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,920
In the Taiji Palace back then,

379
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,830
considering the complicated relations

380
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,880
in the court in the Central State,

381
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,830
I just didn't want to connect with any family.

382
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,270
So back then,

383
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,070
no matter

384
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,790
who you are,

385
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,400
I couldn't

386
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,070
take you as my apprentice.

387
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,720
You smile finally.

388
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,310
Mind your words as a senior.

389
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,110
I'm less than ten years older than you.

390
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,270
I'm not a senior.

391
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,240
But as an uncle,

392
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,240
you rank as my senior.

393
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,590
Your Highness.

394
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,160
Wait for me here.

395
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,550
I'll come back to you

396
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,750
after meeting her.

397
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,110
It's late.

398
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,590
Why does she want to meet you?

399
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,440
What brings you

400
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,590
here this time?

401
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,720
May I talk with you

402
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,160
on our own?

403
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,790
There are no outsiders here.

404
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,030
Go ahead.

405
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,590
Please help me.

406
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,920
The Empress Dowager

407
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,440
let me out of the nunnery

408
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,440
to finish a task.

409
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,030
What did she want you to do?

410
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
Be your wife.

411
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,550
What if

412
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,480
I can't promise you?

413
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,480
At any cost, even if as your maidservant.

414
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,680
There is only one maidservant

415
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,030
in my mansion

416
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
and she came with Shiyi.

417
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,790
The rest are bodyguards.

418
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,720
Moreover,

419
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,400
I need no maidservants.

420
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,550
The Empress Dowager hates the Gao clan.

421
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,480
The reason why

422
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,750
she didn't kill me

423
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
is our misleading past.

424
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,070
If you don't take me in this time,

425
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,830
she'll think that I'm useless

426
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,070
and will kill me.

427
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,750
Stand up first.

428
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,880
I really can't

429
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,720
promise you this time.

430
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,750
Although I can't marry you,

431
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,310
I can take you away.

432
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,880
I have an adoptive brother,

433
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,110
Prince of Pingqin.

434
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,510
I can pretend to take you away

435
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,070
and secretly send you to him to avoid trouble.

436
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,310
What if she is provoked

437
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,830
and sends man to kill me

438
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,640
when finding that

439
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm not in the Western State?

440
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,680
As a vassal Prince

441
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,640
not from the imperial clan,

442
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,550
Prince of Pingqin is less restrained by the imperial court.

443
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,720
As Pingqin Commandery is the farthest from the Central State,

444
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,510
the people and soldiers there

445
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,880
only know him.

446
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,030
Even assassins sent there by her

447
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,350
may either die halfway

448
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,240
or never return.

449
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,640
OK, I'll go.

450
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,350
The Royal Army of Nanchen will leave soon.

451
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,920
Go back and get ready.

452
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,790
Miss Cui,

453
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,310
would you come out and see me?

454
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,590
Her uncle just passed away.

455
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,750
She is sad

456
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,110
and asleep.

457
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,880
Then I'll say it here.

458
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,790
I apologize

459
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,720
to you for my clan

460
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,960
killing your dad.

461
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,240
I accept it for her.

462
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,070
You can leave.

463
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,480
My dad...

464
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,480
As a gentleman

465
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,590
from a famous family,

466
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,680
he was

467
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,480
known for his noble character

468
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,350
among his peers.

469
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,880
He loved your mom

470
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,680
and proposed many times,

471
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,270
but he was refused

472
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,480
for his humble origin.

473
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,550
At last, he chose to marry into the Cui clan

474
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,960
and lived in the Residence of Cui.

475
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,200
How did that happen?

476
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,750
Why do you know it?

477
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,720
On the day he took you as his apprentice…

478
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,030
Why did he leave?

479
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,400
Is he hiding something from me?

480
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,880
No.

481
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,030
Perhaps

482
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,240
he wants me

483
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,160
to tell you without his presence.

484
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,200
On the day he took you as his apprentice,

485
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,350
your mom told him that

486
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,070
you got aphasia

487
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,640
because of your dad's matter.

488
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,750
Thus he got to know

489
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,110
the Li and Cui clans

490
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,480
and every detail

491
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,030
of what happened

492
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,310
to your dad.

493
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
His Highness is quite

494
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,030
attentive to you.

495
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,030
Advisor,

496
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,160
what was the Gao's clan like

497
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,790
back then?

498
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,350
I know

499
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,240
it's a forbidden subject.

500
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,030
If it's not appropriate...

501
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,310
The Gao clan had two empresses,

502
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,280
so it had its heyday,

503
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,590
dominating the court

504
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,550
and overwhelming the royal Liu clan

505
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,840
and the Cui clan.

506
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,510
However,

507
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,070
consequently,

508
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,110
few people today

509
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,630
remember the Gao clan.

510
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,400
Her Lady wants to return to the capital as soon as possible

511
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,920
to send master back to Qinghe County.

512
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,150
The condolence from ministers

513
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,760
will be over today.

514
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,800
I see.

515
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,000
So you must

516
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,400
be careful at night.

517
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,510
General Hong.

518
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,920
What can I do for you?

519
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,400
Both you and I

520
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,760
are generals

521
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,920
of the equal status.

522
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,590
Please don't say so.

523
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,800
I was ordered to

524
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
guard the peace of the Residence of Cui.

525
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,110
Here

526
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm a guard

527
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,800
and you're the master.

528
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,440
Certainly you can order me.

529
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,590
I remember you were friendly to each other.

530
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,360
Why do you

531
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,150
have a conflict right after

532
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,360
his dad passed away?

533
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,550
It isn't a conflict.

534
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,920
It's public affair.

535
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,400
Well...

536
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,920
I'm in pain these days.

537
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,000
Perhaps what I did and said

538
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,480
have offended her.

539
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,670
Tonight,

540
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,110
may I see you

541
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,920
to apologize to you?

542
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:36,920
Tonight...

543
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,840
Sure.

544
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,710
I'll guard tonight.

545
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,230
What makes

546
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,630
the Royal Army of Nanchen invincible

547
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,070
is our united morale.

548
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,190
You two should

549
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,400
patch things up.

550
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,030
Today,

551
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,190
you must talk about it over.

552
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,030
I've kept some words

553
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,800
in my heart for years.

554
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,030
Let me say first.

555
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,670
Because of your status,

556
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,670
you need to consider

557
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,110
manner and reputation

558
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,630
whenever you talk.

559
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,710
But I'm an orphan

560
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,960
without any constraints,

561
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,230
so I'll say first.

562
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:06,880
That day

563
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,150
when you first went to

564
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,230
the Western State

565
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,590
with your sister,

566
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,510
I stopped you

567
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,320
under the gate tower,

568
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,880
but you made

569
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,630
a strong impression on me.

570
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,550
I thought you

571
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,880
couldn't stand the hardships in the army.

572
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,400
However,

573
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,190
you guarded Shouyang for years

574
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,000
and resisted the enemy there.

575
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,510
Though you were in danger

576
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,000
when being besieged for several times,

577
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,510
you never retreated,

578
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,550
but guarded the south gate

579
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,230
for the people.

580
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,960
I'm flattered.

581
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,800
I really

582
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,320
admire you.

583
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
I, I also...

584
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,800
Xiaoyu, it's my turn.

585
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,400
No.

586
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,150
Let me say first.

587
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,030
Perhaps what I want to say

588
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,590
is more than your words.

589
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,150
This is your news of victory.

590
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,440
I've kept it for years.

591
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,710
You've made greater achievements

592
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,030
than I've done.

593
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,000
You've long been famous in the Central Plains.

594
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,230
I loved you,

595
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,840
but I dared not say.

596
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,800
From beginning to end

597
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,920
I always loved you,

598
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,550
but we can never be together.

599
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
I've heard of you,

600
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,360
Xiao Wen.

601
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,400
Xiao Wen is dead.

602
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,280
I'm Xiao Yan.

603
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,110
You changed your name?

604
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
My uncle believes you,

605
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,110
so do I.

606
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,960
I've drawn up an edict

607
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,510
to make you the Prince of Fengyang.

608
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,400
You'll stay in the Central State

609
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,670
and be protected

610
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,190
by Beichen in this life.

611
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

612
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,550
I don't want to stay in the Central State.

613
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,190
Where do you want to go?

614
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,800
Sure enough, people

615
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,800
prefer following uncle.

616
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,710
Your Majesty,

617
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,230
Xiao Yan wants to join the Royal Army of Nanchen

618
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,230
to get a chance

619
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,030
to avenge his parents.

620
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,920
Don't bother to explain.

621
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,280
I don't mind.

622
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,590
I promise.

623
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,510
I'll still give you

624
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,000
the title of Prince of Fengyang.

625
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,960
I'm already a monk.

626
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,710
Prince of Fengyang,

627
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,400
although you've got tonsured,

628
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,110
you still attach to the world.

629
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,510
When you avenge,

630
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,960
come tell me

631
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,440
whether you want this title or not.

632
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,400
I...

633
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,480
Just follow the edict

634
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,670
of His Majesty.

635
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
Don't disobey it

636
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

637
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
That's right.

638
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,800
When will you leave, uncle?

639
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,150
Tomorrow.

640
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,920
When will we meet next time?

641
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,070
We'd better not meet again in this life.

642
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,550
What's wrong

643
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,960
with me, uncle?

644
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Whenever I come back,

645
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,590
there will be great events in the court,

646
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,360
so I'd rather

647
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,190
not see you again in this life.

648
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,920
I'll guard the Central State in the Western State.

649
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,000
I hope that you'll be a wise emperor.

650
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,030
I envy you

651
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,320
having these able men around.

652
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,400
I want someone of them.

653
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,760
Who?

654
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,760
I'd like to invite advisor

655
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,800
to help me in the Central State

656
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,480
like how he taught the late emperor.
