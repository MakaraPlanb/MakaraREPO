[Episode 12]

4
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,720
Did I

5
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,160
say something wrong just now?

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,400
You mean about Mrs. Huan?

7
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,600
I'll find a time and take you

8
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,840
to see her later.

9
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,680
I think

10
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
after a few more days,

11
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,040
I can ask them to pay for the accommodation.

12
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,760
What do you say, dear?

13
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,120
Yes. You're right!

14
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
What I want

15
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,320
is the book collections of the Cui family!

16
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
That's an invaluable treasure.

17
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,560
Today she debated

18
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,680
with a group

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,960
of people,

20
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,880
yet she still won.

21
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
The reason is

22
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,079
that the books Miss Cui reads

23
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,920
are all rarely seen.

24
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,240
Did his wife…

25
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,720
They were of the same age.

26
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,800
They first met when they were 6,

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,920
and they got married when they were 16.

28
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Two years later,

29
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,360
the rebel forces ransacked the Residence of Huan.

30
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,720
My wife and I left everything behind

31
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,280
except our collections of ancient books

32
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,160
and escaped to the northwest desert.

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,160
She died at the desert

34
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,240
while I...

35
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,640
am still alive.

36
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,160
Please come in.

37
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,960
Before my wife passed away, she said to me,

38
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,240
"Huan Yu,"

39
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
"don't make me a memorial tablet."

40
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
"I will be with you always"

41
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
"and I'll never leave you.”

42
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
That's why I didn't make her a memorial tablet.

43
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,840
My wife is right here with me.

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,360
Have a seat.

45
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,920
I'll go get you two some tea.

46
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
The promise that Mrs. Huan made

47
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,159
became Mr. Huan's faith,

48
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
by which he lives by

49
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,960
for the rest of his life.

50
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,320
It shows how important a promise

51
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,080
can be to a family.

52
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,840
But, Master, you…

53
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
I what?

54
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
You are wrong.

55
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,960
About what?

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,640
You said

57
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,040
one would

58
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,360
leave nothing behind

59
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,160
but useless sorrow

60
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,200
after he dies.

61
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,680
To a soldier,

62
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,520
a promise is

63
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,400
more valuable than his life.

64
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,600
I can give you my word

65
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,680
that if something bad

66
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,360
ever happens to me,

67
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,430
you will be informed of

68
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,600
when and where

69
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,200
I died.

70
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,520
Master, you are an experienced,

71
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
ever-victorious general.

72
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm sure you'll live a long life.

73
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,440
So, we've arrived at the Longkang Academy?

74
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,040
Did you inform Mr. Huan of our visit beforehand?

76
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,920
I forgot.

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,080
Fine.

78
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,860
[Longkang Academy]

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Let me play some music for you.

80
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Sir!

81
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,600
An old gentleman

82
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,880
is here with…with another…

83
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,440
another old gentleman!

84
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
You were speaking unintelligibly. Try again.

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,640
An old gentleman

86
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,160
who claimed to be Mr. Xiao of Nanxiao

87
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,920
is here with another old gentleman.

88
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,480
It's only the two of them and no guards?

89
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,920
Yes. There are no guards.

90
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,960
They are dressed casually?

91
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,480
Yes, they are dressed casually.

92
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,800
Shut the curtains.

93
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,880
I don't know who he is.

94
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,320
Of course I need to shut the curtains.

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,720
Am I right, Your Highness?

96
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Yes.

97
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,080
Miss Cui,

98
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,799
can you guess who has come?

99
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,039
He called Nanxiao his own place

100
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
and his last name is Xiao.

101
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,080
Could it be the Emperor of Nanxiao?

102
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,920
Shall I ask them to come out to greet you?

103
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
Mr. Huan's residence

104
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,840
is where students come to study

105
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
and where his close friends come to visit.

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
There is no need to speak of formalities here.

107
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,340
I heard that a very important guest

108
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,260
from the Western State is visiting the academy.

109
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,500
Mr. Huan, could you

110
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,820
please open the curtain

111
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,500
and introduce him to me?

112
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,160
I don't have an important guest.

113
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,800
You are my guest,

114
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,060
so is this gentleman from the Western State.

115
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm a person who believes

116
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,600
“First come, first served.”

117
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,320
Since this gentleman was here first,

118
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,920
you should ask him if he

119
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,000
wants to see you.

120
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,000
That's fair.

121
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
Would the gentleman from the Western State

122
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
come out and meet me?

123
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,180
Since the curtain is still closed,

124
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,460
let's just pretend

125
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,420
that we've never met each other.

126
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,700
That's the least complicated way.

127
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,420
But the rumor that you're now in Jiangling

128
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,260
has caused quite a stir

129
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,900
and everyone has heard about it.

130
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,660
The rumor is not true.

131
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,260
You can tell people

132
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,860
that the prefectural governor made a mistake.

133
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,340
Your suggestion

134
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,740
would be convincing enough for the public.

135
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,300
But,

136
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,100
Zhousheng Chen,

137
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,260
how am I supposed to just let it go

138
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,620
and set you free?

139
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,900
Both of us

140
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,540
want peace for the North and the South.

141
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,460
If that's the case,

142
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,620
letting me go is your best choice.

143
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,660
But I'm the emperor after all.

144
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,700
If I let you go like this,

145
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,060
I may regret it

146
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,020
when I think about it later.

147
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,220
Young Man, I'm an elder already.

148
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,780
Shouldn't you show me

149
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,700
some respect?

150
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,380
I accidentally entered Jiangling

151
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,100
without your permission.

152
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,180
I hope you can forgive me, Your Majesty!

153
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,660
An earnest apology usually comes with a gift.

154
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,180
What gift do you offer?

155
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,300
Since Your Majesty is asking for something,

156
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,580
you must have

157
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,660
something in mind already.

158
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,540
My son,

159
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,340
Xiao Wen.

160
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,940
Aren't you afraid of not being able to come back?

161
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,420
He is my father.

162
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,380
I know him very well.

163
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,340
Since he's arrived in Jiangling,

164
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,460
he won't return empty-handed.

165
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,820
He'll force His Highness to hand me over.

166
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,820
You should go back.

167
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,540
Emperor Xiao can't kill His Highness,

168
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,060
but he won't hesitate a bit to kill you.

169
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
You are the military advisor.

170
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,900
Protecting you is my job.

171
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,220
How can you protect me

172
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,500
when you can't even defeat me?

173
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,220
You talk too much.

174
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,300
Now, row the boat.

175
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,060
If I can come back,

176
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,980
I'll teach you how to defeat me.

177
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,220
I intentionally went easy on you

178
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,300
because you were a monk.

179
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,060
You really think I can't defeat you?

180
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,580
His Highness told me

181
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,580
that you were highly gifted in martial arts.

182
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,500
No one can defeat me

183
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,660
except my master!

184
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,500
He has

185
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,020
changed his name to Xiao Yan,

186
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,180
and he serves the Royal Army of Nanchen as the military advisor now.

187
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,620
As the Chief Commander,

188
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,820
how can I hand over

189
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,460
my military advisor for my own safety?

190
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,620
You've never suspected him?

191
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,740
After all, he's my favorite son

192
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,460
who lived with me for over 20 years.

193
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,180
If you use a man, then trust him.

194
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,580
If you don't trust him, then don't use him.

195
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,020
I just want my son back.

196
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,820
It's totally up to him

197
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,740
whether he wants to come back or not.

198
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
Zhousheng Chen,

199
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,820
you are in Jiangling right now,

200
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,020
not the Western State.

201
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,820
Aren't you afraid that I would become irrational

202
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,500
and kill you to vent my anger?

203
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,940
I always say what I mean,

204
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,740
no matter when I'm in the Western State

205
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,300
or Jiangling.

206
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,580
Your Majesty,

207
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,260
we can talk about

208
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,780
the second prince's matter later.

209
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,500
The news about the Royal Army of Nanchen

210
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,740
stationing across the river

211
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,940
has spread to the whole country.

212
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,540
The word on the street is that a war

213
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,420
will break out between the South and the North.

214
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,740
If we can't persuade him

215
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,900
to go back,

216
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,860
I'm afraid…

217
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,340
I'm afraid our country would first fall into chaos.

218
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,860
Putting our status aside.

219
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,460
If we talk about seniority,

220
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,380
then you should at least

221
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,420
respect me for my age,

222
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,820
right?

223
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,060
You are right.

224
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,860
Then I'd love to know

225
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,060
if there's

226
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,580
anything else you'd want?

227
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,060
I'll see what I can do.

228
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,980
It's an apologetic gift from you,

229
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,820
so you should make a suggestion.

230
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,220
I've had something

231
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,220
prepared.

232
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
The book collections of our family consists of the ancient books of the previous dynasties.

233
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,340
It's a priceless treasure

234
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,100
that our clansmen

235
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,060
risked their lives for

236
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,500
during the Central Plains War.

237
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,220
I took 5,600 transcripts

238
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,540
of the volumes

239
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
when I left home.

240
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,420
They are my dowry,

241
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
as well as my private book collections.

242
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,020
I'm willing to give Your Majesty half of it

243
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,060
on the junior Prince of Nanchen's behalf.

244
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,000
But I have one condition.

245
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,340
The transcripts

246
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,160
must be kept in the Longkang Academy.

247
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,340
Are you serious?

248
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,540
Miss, your last name is Cui?

249
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,260
Where are you from?

250
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,900
My mother is Cui Wenjun, from Beichen.

251
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,340
Her branch name is Wushui.

252
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,740
She's the current clan chief of our family.

253
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,380
Back then, we invited the Cui family

254
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,450
to move to the South for three times,

255
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,140
but your family still refused.

256
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,690
Only one branch moved here.

257
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
However, after dozens of years

258
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,350
they moved back again,

259
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,460
which really broke my heart.

260
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,700
It's understandable that they missed their homeland.

261
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,860
Please forgive them, Your Majesty.

262
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,820
No.

263
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,220
It's because we were not sincere enough.

264
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,660
I don't have a say

265
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,820
in the relocation matter.

266
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,060
I'd love to focus on the issue at hand.

267
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,050
Your Majesty, would you like to accept the transcripts?

268
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,020
Yes! Of course!

269
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,420
Greetings, Your Majesty!

270
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,620
I've spent my whole life looking for the book collections of the Cui family,

271
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,100
but I had no luck.

272
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,020
Your Majesty, if you accept the transcripts,

273
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,020
I will take the position you offered

274
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,900
and become the…

275
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,340
the…Grand Mentor for the Crown Prince!

276
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,580
Right! The Grand Mentor for the Crown Prince!

277
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,300
Mr. Huan, you…

278
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,420
You should watch your manners!

279
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,660
It's okay. It'll be a great honor

280
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,060
to have Mr. Huan in the royal court.

281
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,820
The transcripts are in the Azure Dragon Temple.

282
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,380
Please find a time and deliver them here.

283
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,820
You gave him half of your dowry,

284
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,220
but only stayed here for three days.

285
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,460
Looks like he's got the better deal.

286
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,820
They are transcripts.

287
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,160
I can make more copies.

288
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,900
This place is too far away from home.

289
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,660
I'll ask my mother

290
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,820
to send me the original books

291
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,410
so that I can copy them in the mansion.

292
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,410
In my opinion,

293
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,140
you can open the curtains now.

294
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,859
Your Majesty.

295
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,300
The junior Prince of Nanchen.

296
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,180
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Cui Shiyi.

297
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,020
Although it's not

298
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,620
the gift I was hoping for,

299
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,580
it's generous enough.

300
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,980
Please bring a message to your mother for me.

301
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,300
We have always hoped

302
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,220
that the Cui family can move to Nanxiao.

303
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,900
I will, Your Majesty.

304
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,980
[Longkang Academy]

305
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,820
The Nanchen Royal Mansion is full of talented people.

306
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,580
We can't underestimate them.

307
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,460
Your Majesty,

308
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,020
the second prince is at the riverside and wants to see you.

309
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,820
Hurry! Let's go to the riverside!

310
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,580
Father, rest assured!

311
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,060
I promise you that one day

312
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,940
I will lead the army across the river

313
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,780
and help you fulfill your dream

314
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,340
of unifying the whole country!

315
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,980
Among all my sons,

316
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,020
you are like me and

317
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,780
understand me the most.

318
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,020
Wen!

319
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,740
Wen!

320
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,180
Wen!

321
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,980
Why did you shave your head?

322
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,020
Come on land

323
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,260
and go back with me.

324
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,580
Come back to Jiankang with me.

325
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,900
I crossed the river

326
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,660
to pick up the junior Prince of Nanchen.

327
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,460
You are the second prince of Nanxiao.

328
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,700
Why do you humble yourself

329
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,420
and serve the junior Prince of Nanchen?

330
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,260
Wen, don't fall for the rumors.

331
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,100
I am really your birth father.

332
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,060
I hold a grudge against you

333
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,860
not only for you killing my father and my wife,

334
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
but also for you destroying my country.

335
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,340
In this life,

336
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,020
you'll never be my father

337
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,820
but only my sworn enemy!

338
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,340
Step back!

339
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,420
I've said

340
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,020
that whoever dares hurt my son

341
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,740
would be executed

342
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,260
along with his whole family!

343
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Your Majesty.

344
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,500
I think

345
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
we should ask the second prince to come with us

346
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,540
so that Your Majesty will have more time to talk.

347
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,620
Sooner or later everything would be resolved.

348
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,700
There's no need for that.

349
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,660
I will

350
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,340
wait for you to change your mind.

351
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
Would Your Majesty be willing to let His Highness go?

352
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,780
He will go back tomorrow.

353
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,580
Wen…

354
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,460
My master

355
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,340
made some silly comments

356
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,900
and misunderstood the relationship you two had.

357
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,660
He hopes you won't take his word to heart.

358
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,580
He tends

359
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,260
to be silly sometimes.

360
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,860
It's all right.

361
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,860
I'll clean up the room

362
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
next door,

363
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,660
so you can sleep there tonight, Miss.

364
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,940
Isn't that room

365
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,660
packed with stuff?

366
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,140
It's not.

367
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,500
Master.

368
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,860
You talk too much. Now, leave us.

369
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,700
Serve her some dishes.

370
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,980
Help yourselves!

371
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,980
Master, clean your hands.

372
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,180
Why do you call me

373
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,260
"Master" again?

374
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,500
The people of the academy

375
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,660
know who you are

376
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,020
and who I am now.

377
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
People here are all educated

378
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,740
and pay attention to etiquette.

379
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,020
If I don't call you "Master",

380
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,540
they'd gossip about us.

381
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,420
Besides,

382
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,140
tomorrow we'll cross the river.

383
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,660
After we go back,

384
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,260
I'll need to call you "Master" anyway.

385
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,540
That's tomorrow.

386
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,900
It's not tomorrow yet.

387
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,900
Tomorrow is only around 20 hours away.

388
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,500
No need to fool ourselves.

389
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,340
Master, have some more.

390
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,020
We don't have this kind of food back home.

391
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,460
I know you like this place.

392
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,870
But we are from Beichen,

393
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,020
we can't stay in the South for too long.

394
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,620
I understand.

395
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,090
You gave all the food to me. What will you eat?

396
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
I'm not that hungry.

397
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,300
Since you are not hungry,

398
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,540
why don't we go down the mountain?

399
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,180
For what?

400
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,660
The scholars of Nanxiao are all aesthetes

401
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,740
who enjoy playing the Qin and talking about poetry after lunch.

402
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,780
Since you love Qins,

403
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,390
why don't we go and take a look?

404
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,100
Good idea! Let's go!

405
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,040
I'll be your guide!

406
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,340
Not only does my master

407
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
talk foolishly,

408
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,100
he also likes to eavesdrop.

409
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,100
You are a man.

410
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,340
Why are you wearing a veil?

411
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,540
That's part of my identity.

412
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,340
When people see this,

413
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,180
they'll know

414
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,580
Mr. Huan of the Longkang Academy

415
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,460
has come down the mountain.

416
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
Isn't that a brilliant idea?

417
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,860
You don't have these in the Western State?

418
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,780
I've never taken a walk like this in the Western State.

419
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,180
This is your fault.

420
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,220
How could you not show your disciple your hometown?

421
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,780
It's not my master's fault.

422
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,700
It wasn't

423
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,180
convenient for me to go outside in the past.

424
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,260
If he took me out,

425
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,140
he'd offend my uncle

426
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,740
and the people of the Imperial Palace.

427
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
But now

428
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,260
I can do whatever I want.

429
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,260
Why was it inconvenient for her

430
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,540
to go out?

431
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,100
She had an engagement before.

432
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,140
And now?

433
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,140
Now she's not engaged.

434
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,340
Because of you?

435
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,540
Not because of me.

436
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,500
It may not seem to be,

437
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,860
but actually it is.

438
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,260
Miss Cui,

439
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
let's go listen to some music first

440
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,660
before taking a boat tour.

441
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,260
This is

442
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,300
where we are right now.

443
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,620
If anything happens,

444
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,540
we can take the route in the north.

445
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,860
Keep that in mind.

446
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,780
And here…

447
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,540
Hey, monk.

448
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,380
What are you thinking about?

449
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,020
Actually, I'm a little afraid.

450
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,460
Of what?

451
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,220
I'm afraid that the emperor of Nanxiao would break his promise.

452
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,100
After all, holding the junior Prince of Nanchen hostage,

453
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,860
it's no different

454
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,820
from controlling half of our country.

455
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,250
He wouldn't.

456
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:14,940
Why?

457
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,500
He can be cold-blooded

458
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,940
and skeptical of the people around him,

459
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,100
but he's an emperor

460
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,820
who cares about his people.

461
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,620
He wouldn't want his people

462
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,900
to suffer in a war.

463
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,420
It's easy to detain Zhousheng Chen,

464
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,700
but he can't afford to provoke

465
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,220
his army of 700,000 soldiers.

466
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,220
That's why he wouldn't do that.

467
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,580
You want to say

468
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,380
I know him well, don't you?

469
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,860
I don't dare to.

470
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,380
I don't want to upset you.

471
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,700
In fact, I've thought of a lot

472
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,180
comforting words.

473
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,300
But nothing seems useful.

474
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,620
How about I tell you something about my father?

475
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,980
My father

476
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,630
is actually not much better

477
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,180
compared to your father.

478
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,500
He took away

479
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,140
all my mother's money for medicine

480
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,340
and went to gamble.

481
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,260
None of our relatives offered help.

482
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,940
So in the end, I watched my mother die of illness

483
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,940
right in front of me.

484
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,540
Then one day,

485
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,340
I hid a wine jar

486
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,020
on the door.

487
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,740
When my father came home,

488
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,260
the jar fell and he was almost killed by it.

489
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,380
I was so afraid.

490
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,700
I was afraid that he'd beat me to death after he recovered,

491
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,180
so I ran away.

492
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,900
I kept running for a long time but was so tired and hungry

493
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,980
that I fell asleep on the roadside.

494
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,500
When I woke up,

495
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,420
I saw my master and my senior sister.

496
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,620
So I followed them.

497
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,380
I learned martial arts and became a soldier to protect my country.

498
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,220
I enjoy it so much!

499
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,940
Do you still hate him?

500
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,220
Who?

501
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,740
Your father.

502
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,100
I don't even care about him now.

503
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,020
He doesn't deserve my hatred.

504
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,020
I am

505
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,540
General Feng who

506
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,460
intimidates people now.

507
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,660
All I care about

508
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,380
is the citizens of the Western State.

509
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,140
Looks like you are

510
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,460
much more open-minded than I am.

511
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,420
You monks

512
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,340
believe in helping everyone, right?

513
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,820
Since you care about everyone,

514
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,620
what's the big deal if you hate the Emperor of Nanxiao?

515
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,300
That's true.

516
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,940
You are right.

517
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,740
Greetings, Mr. Huan.

518
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,340
Is this gentleman your friend?

519
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,820
My best friend.

520
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,460
Are you a couple?

521
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,220
No.

522
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,700
Then, are you

523
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,220
engaged, Miss?

524
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,620
I'm not.

525
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,900
My last name is Houmochen

526
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,180
and my given name is Yue.

527
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,300
Nice to meet you, Mr. Houmochen.

528
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,820
I'm…

529
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,820
Would I give away

530
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,460
my identity if I tell him my last name is Cui?

531
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,180
This lady is from the Nanchen Royal Mansion

532
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,640
in the Western State.

533
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,940
You mean the junior Prince of Nanchen's Mansion?

534
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,340
Yes.

535
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,740
It's such a pleasure to meet you!

536
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,980
I have some fine wine

537
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,780
that's over one hundred years old.

538
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,100
May I have the honor

539
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,140
to have a drink with you, Miss?

540
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,780
Since you have some fine wine,

541
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,500
why don't you share it

542
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,740
with all of us?

543
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,940
That's right, Mr. Houmochen.

544
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,260
Drinking fine wine alone is such a waste.

545
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,900
It'd be more fun to drink it with other people.

546
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,380
That's right. Mr. Houmochen,

547
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,380
don't hide it.

548
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,980
Share it with all of us!

549
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,420
-是啊
-Come on!
-Share it!

550
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,580
Alright, fine. I'll share it with you lot!

551
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,460
You greedy drinkers.

552
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,260
Thank you!

553
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,500
You are not afraid of giving your identity away?

554
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,700
We'll be leaving tomorrow.

555
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,860
It's okay.

556
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,260
I wonder if you

557
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,500
protect every disciple

558
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,900
of yours like this.

559
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,700
Of course.

560
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,040
During the reign of Taishi,

561
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,260
the people lived a happy life.

562
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,620
Ever since my dear left me,

563
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,860
I've missed him day and night.

564
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,220
Ever since my dear left me,

565
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,340
I've missed him day and night.

566
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,540
This is a folk song of the South.

567
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,140
The Qin master likes it,

568
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
so he plays it quite often.

569
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,380
But you don't

570
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,660
put too much thought into it.

571
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,420
Why not?

572
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,420
Ask him.

573
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,180
He asked me

574
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,740
the same question in the past.

575
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,130
"Ziye Songs of the Four Seasons"

576
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,640
is also known as "Ziye Songs of Wu".

577
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,390
The lady who wrote the songs was named Ziye.

578
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,140
Huan Yu.

579
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,440
Let the Qin master

580
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,920
play something elegant.

581
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,120
What's wrong

582
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,840
with Ziye Songs of Wu?

583
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,360
You are quite busy today.

584
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,400
People like to take a boat ride

585
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,920
when the weather is nice.

586
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,200
Mr. Huan.

587
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,240
-Mr. Huan.
-Mr. Huan.

588
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,440
You guys go ahead.

589
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,600
I got a carriage.

590
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,680
I'll wait for you on the other end.

591
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,760
Mr. Huan, you are not coming with us?

592
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,520
I…

593
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,600
I'm afraid of water.

594
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,800
Afraid of water?

595
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,960
Come on! Just go!

596
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,400
I'll wait for you in the south of the town.

597
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,400
Here. Be careful.

598
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,240
Mr. Huan.

599
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,280
You love taking a boat tour.

600
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,880
Why don't you go with them?

601
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,280
I don't want

602
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,760
to be a third wheel.

603
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,120
Today is the Double Ninth Festival.

604
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,120
Yes.

605
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,800
We are supposed to climb a mountain,

606
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,840
but we are taking a boat instead.

607
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,920
We'll climb a mountain

608
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,120
when we go back tonight.

609
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,480
That's true.

610
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
I'm sorry!

611
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,400
The paddle slipped.

612
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,000
Please sit tight.

like the Ziye Songs of Wu?

620
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,520
You stopped the Qin Master just now.

621
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,400

635
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,760

Yes. He's an important guest of Longkang Academy!

Have the young master come on our ship.

645

647
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,560

would you like a cornelian cherry pouch?

Pick one. It can ward off evil spirits.

689
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,680
Yes. It can ward off evil spirits.

690

It's for ladies,

not for men.

694
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,200
Then what can he do to ward off evil spirits?

695
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,600
He can drink the Chrysanthemum Wine.

No. Chrysanthemum Wine smells very good.

Why did my master take you to listen to that?

736
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,320
Is there something wrong with the song?

737
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,640
Some are okay.

738
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,400
But some of them have inappropriate lyrics,

739
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,640
like "Clean sheet is put on my bed,

740

741
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,320

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,440
I, Houmochen Yue,

750
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,680
didn't know who you were earlier

751
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,480
and offended you. I'm here to apologize to you.

752
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,680
You did nothing wrong.

753
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,760
Why do you apologize?

754
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,920
Because I didn't know who you were.

755
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,120
While having food at home,

756
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
my parents mentioned

757
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,880
that a guest from the Cui family presented

758
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,880
800 volumes of books to Nanxiao.

759
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Only then did I suddenly realize who you are.

760
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,680
My identity is not important,

761
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,920
and you don't have

762
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,240
to apologize for that.

763
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Houmochen Yue,

764
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,040
you certainly need to apologize.

765
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,560
Not only that,

766
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,320
you also need to thank me for stopping you

767
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,120
from flirting with her.

768
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,720
Otherwise, you'd be in big trouble.

769
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,680
Neither His Majesty

770
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,280
nor her master,

771
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,600
the junior Prince of Nanchen,

772
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,960
would forgive you!

773
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,480
Thank you for that, Mr. Huan!

774
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,600
It's okay.

775
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,640
Miss Cui is not a petty person.

776
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,080
Just relax

777
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,160
and leave.

778
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,240
What? You have more to say?

779
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,360
Miss, I'm aware that you are

780
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,640
out of my league,

781
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,080
but I still wanna know

782
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,720
if you are engaged with someone.

783
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,200
You still won't give up?

784
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,920
You are asking me this

785
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,480
because my last name is Cui.

786
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,040
Since you ask me to tell you the truth,

787
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,560
you also need to be honest with me.

788
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,360
Yes. The Houmochen family

789
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,960
enjoys high prestige as well.

790
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,600
If I can marry a lady from the Cui family…

791
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,760
Houmochen Yue,

792
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
I advise you to sober up.

793
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
Miss Cui is the daughter of

794
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,320
the head of Wushui.

795
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,000
If she were to get married, the six clans would be her first choice.

796
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
The Liu royal family

797
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,840
and the Beichen aristocratic family would be her second choices.

798
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,560
She's way out of your league.

799
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm asking Miss Cui here.

800
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,880
Whether you are engaged or not,

801
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,520
I just want an answer from you.

802
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,480
I'm not engaged with anyone.

803
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,600
But I already

804
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,640
have someone in my heart.

805
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,000
And I won't

806
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
change my mind.
