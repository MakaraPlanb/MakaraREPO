00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,440
anything wrong.

192
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes, sir.

193
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,580
[Central State]

194
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,480
Who else are in the palace?

195
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,960
The kings and the empress' henchman

196
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
Qian Bin.

197
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,060
[Liu Wei]

198
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,100
[Liu Yuan]

199
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,300
[Shiqian Hall]

200
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,880
General-in-chief.

201
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,360
Grand Mentor, please.

202
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,680
Greetings, Honored Concubine.

203
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,440
His Majesty has...

204
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
His Majesty

205
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,800
has passed away.

206
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Your Majesty!

207
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,400
Since His Majesty has passed away,

208
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
why hasn't the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne?

209
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,920
The empress hasn't been informed of this.

210
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,640
How can he take the throne so hastily?

211
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,080
His Majesty is now gone.

212
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,640
The Crown Prince shall succeed to the throne.

213
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,120
This is a natural thing to do.

214
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,920
Why do we need the empress' permission?

215
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,680
Grand Mentor, what's the hurry?

216
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,280
Can't you wait till dawn?

217
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,640
The country cannot be left without a master for a while.

218
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,600
What's the point of waiting till dawn?

219
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,480
I can temporarily act as the Defender-in-chief

220
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,880
to perform the enthronement ceremony.

221
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,440
Cui Guang, you...

222
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,960
Qian Bin!

223
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,480
I approve of the Grand Mentor.

224
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
Tonight, the Crown Prince must be enthroned.

225
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,720
You...

226
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,760
You just want to leave the empress out of this.

227
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,360
Minister Zhao.

228
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,600
Bring the imperial edict, the seal,

229
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,040
and the ribbon.

230
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,360
Dress His Majesty.

231
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,240
You!

232
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,840
Qi Zhenzhen!

233
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Qi Zhenzhen!

234
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,920
How dare you go behind my back

235
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,440
and let the Crown Prince ascend to the throne?

236
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,640
Good for you, Qi Zhenzhen!

237
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,560
Qi Zhenzhen, come out!

238
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,200
Long live the emperor!

239
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,040
Long live the emperor!

240
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,720
Long live the emperor!

241
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,300
[Young Liu Hui]

242
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Long live the emperor!

243
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,140
[Qi Zhenzhen]

244
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,240
In front of the royal clan,

245
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,520
I couldn't exchange pleasantries with you.

246
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,120
Now we're in the Eastern Palace.

247
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,480
You and I can catch up now.

248
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,280
Congratulations, Your Highness.

249
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,400
After so many years of endurance,

250
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,960
finally this day has come for you.

251
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
I just get rid of the shadow of the empress

252
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,640
before falling right into

253
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,920
Liu's clan's control.

254
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,400
If you endure for a while, you will be able to live a whole smooth life.

255
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,280
Hui, leave the house.

256
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,480
Will he come back?

257
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,160
Zhousheng Chen?

258
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,000
If he questions Hui's succession...

259
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,800
Let's follow the ancestral rules and hold the funeral for the late emperor first.

260
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
What shall come, cannot be avoided.

261
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,600
Counsellor, His Highness is back.

262
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,060
[Xie Chong]

263
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,360
Congratulations to Your Highness for winning the battle.

264
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,960
Congratulations to Your Highness for winning the battle.

265
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,280
Sorry to keep you waiting, Counsellor.

266
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Master.

267
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,000
The soldiers are waiting to celebrate.

268
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,080
Good.

269
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,400
Kill the animals, prepare the wine, and start a bonfire.

270
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,060
[Hong Xiaoyu Zhou Tianxing]

271
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,120
Yes, Master.

272
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,960
Counsellor, it's cloudy today.

273
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,920
The light is poor.

274
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,120
Why don't you light a lamp?

275
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,440
Your Highness...

276
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,880
I came back with the cavalry

277
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,520
this time.

278
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Chariots and infantry

279
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,880
will be four hours late.

280
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,520
Your Highness.

281
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,680
From the Central State.

282
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,080
From the palace?

283
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,200
Some time ago,

284
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,680
the news of victory was sent to the capital.

285
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,520
I guess

286
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,440
it should be an imperial decree to reward the armies.

287
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,840
His Majesty...

288
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,480
Come on.

289
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,680
Take and put them away all gently.

290
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,880
Put the wine over there.

291
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,760
Put it here, put it here, put it here.

292
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,320
Fill it up, fill it up.

293
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,880
Okay.

294
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,440
Bring it here.

295
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,760
Senior Sister.

296
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,800
Are you done?

297
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Let's go see Master.

298
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,360
Okay, let's go.

299
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,840
Let's go.

300
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,320
You shot

301
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,720
an amazing arrow today.

302
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,240
Counsellor.

303
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,760
Wait a minute.

304
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
Wait a moment before you go in.

305
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,600
His Majesty has passed away.

306
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,920
His Majesty has passed away?

307
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,320
Your Highness, you insist on returning?

308
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,800
It was my brother, His Majesty who raised me.

309
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,400
He's gone now. I must see him off.

310
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,640
But you swore an oath, Your Highness.

311
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,320
You will never return to Central State

312
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,600
nor enter the palace.

313
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,480
Now the new emperor is on the throne.

314
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,640
You're leading the troops to the palace.

315
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,360
Do you

316
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,640
want to be accused of rebellion?

317
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,560
I can handle it.

318
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,580
[Prince of Nanchen]

319
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,280
Thousands of courtiers in my royal mansion,

320
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,520
hundreds of thousands of soldiers outside the tent,

321
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,520
and the people at the border,

322
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,400
I'll entrust them to you tonight.

323
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,280
Your Highness, this can't work.

324
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,040
I will return safely.

325
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,360
Master.

326
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,160
The divine army camp is ready.

327
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,360
We can leave anytime.

328
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,320
The divine army camp shall stay in Western State.

329
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,640
You take 3,000 horsemen

330
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,680
and follow me to Central State.

331
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,880
We are going to Central State,

332
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,360
not back to Western State.

333
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,120
Please think twice, Master.

334
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,840
Please think twice, Master.

335
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,560
Please think twice, Master.

336
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,320
I'm just going to see the late emperor

337
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,920
one last time.

338
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm not to take over the kingdom.

339
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,160
3,000 horsemen are enough.

340
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,920
His Highness is right.

341
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
3,000 horsemen are enough.

342
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
I will go with you.

343
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,520
Your Highness.

344
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,120
I already made a vow

345
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,400
the day I followed you.

346
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,800
I'll live

347
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,040
if Your Highness lives.

348
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,920
If Your Highness...

349
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,400
I will never live alone.

350
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,440
If you want to go, let's go together.

351
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,180
[Prince of Nanchen]

352
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,440
Let's go.

353
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,220
[Central State]

354
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,780
[Central State]

355
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,600
The words "Central State"

356
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
still remain the same as before.

357
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
Who dares not dismount when entering the city gate?

358
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,400
We're from Western State.

359
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,980
[Nanchen]

360
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,000
From Nanchen Royal Mansion.

361
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,200
May I ask, who this gentleman is?

362
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,960
This is Junior Prince of Nanchen.

363
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,560
Greetings to Junior Prince of Nanchen.

364
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
Has the funeral been held for the late emperor?

365
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,560
It'll be held the day after tomorrow.

366
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,320
Send the token to the palace,

367
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,800
saying that Zhousheng Chen has returned.

368
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,840
I will not enter the city gate.

369
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,480
I'll just wait here until the day after tomorrow

370
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,800
to send the late emperor to his funeral.

371
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,640
Yes.

372
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,920
Since he won't enter the city,

373
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,680
what do we have to fear?

374
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,240
Zhousheng Chen is stationed outside the city.

375
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,720
Can you fall asleep?

376
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,240
What should we do?

377
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,960
Just let him be outside the city?

378
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,520
Let him enter the city.

379
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,800
No.

380
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,160
Force him to enter the city.

381
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,320
The death of the late emperor was a suddenness.

382
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,320
There have been suspicions among the clans everywhere.

383
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
If

384
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,280
even Zhousheng Chen refuses to enter the palace,

385
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
wouldn't we fall exactly under suspicion?

386
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,920
Since he's here,

387
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,480
why don't we let him face the ministers directly

388
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,080
and force him to support His Majesty in the palace?

389
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,080
If he enters the palace,

390
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,920
I'm sure it'll stabilize the people.

391
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,400
What if he refuses to come?

392
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,920
If he refuses to enter the palace,

393
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,320
the rumors of his rebellion will be confirmed.

394
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,120
This will leave him a cause for gossip.

395
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,960
Even if His Majesty can't do anything about him now,

396
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,520
there will be a reason to crusade against him

397
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,120
in the future.

398
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,960
Anyway, in a word,

399
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,720
whether he comes or not,

400
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,720
it's good for His Majesty.

401
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,440
I beg Your Highness

402
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,640
to break your oath once for His Majesty

403
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,320
and enter the palace to support the young emperor.

404
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,760
Master, you can't go in.

405
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,760
That's right.

406
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,480
They only let you in.

407
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,080
If there's an ambush,

408
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,480
it'll be too late for us to save you.

409
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,680
You're here to attend the funeral for the late emperor

410
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,520
instead of getting yourself killed.

411
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,320
We bow to Your Majesty.

412
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
Please stand up.

413
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

414
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,920
Gentlemen.

415
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,440
Junior Prince of Nanchen is now outside Central State.

416
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,520
He comes here at this moment.

417
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,400
What does he want?

418
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,320
His Majesty is young and the country is in turmoil.

419
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,960
The court is treacherous.

420
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,560
The man who holds the army

421
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,840
returns to the capital now.

422
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,760
Yes, he returns to the capital at this moment.

423
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,160
What's the purpose?

424
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,240
He came here with an army.

425
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,440
I'm clear of the fears and suspicions

426
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,160
in your mind.

427
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,840
Because I am afraid too.

428
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,040
How many soldiers does he have with him?

429
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,920
3,000 horsemen.

430
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,160
Only 3,000?

431
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,280
3,000 is not that many.

432
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,920
I have sent an oral message

433
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,239
to ask him to enter the palace.

434
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,920
Let's wait and see

435
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,199
if he can come to the Taiji Palace

436
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,760
and support His Majesty.

437
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,360
Wait here.

438
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,400
Master.

439
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,440
You...

440
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,880
At the Taiji Palace,

441
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,280
I swear to Heaven.

442
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:53,460
[Young Zhousheng Chen]

443
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,800
From this day forward,

444
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,159
I will give up my royal name

445
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,800
and guard the Western State forever.

446
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,480
From now on,

447
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,760
I will never set foot in the Central State again.

448
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,560
He's here.

449
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,280
Your Majesty, he's here!

450
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,320
Brother,

451
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,960
my young nephew ascends to the throne, the kingdom is in turmoil.

452
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,320
I have to break my oath

453
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,800
and enter the palace to face the emperor.

454
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,940
[Taiji Palace]

455
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,960
Your Highness, please remove your sword.

456
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,280
I, Zhousheng Chen, bow before Your Majesty.

457
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,000
Please stand up, uncle.

458
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

459
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,320
I didn't mean to

460
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,600
force you to break your oath today.

461
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,840
It's only because of the anecdotal rumor...

462
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,120
Anecdotal rumor has it that

463
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,560
I have a rebellious intent.

464
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,760
That's why Your Highness summoned me to the palace

465
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,440
as a sign of harmony between His Majesty and his subjects,

466
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,840
as well as a stable court.

467
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,160
Thank you, Prince of Nanchen, for taking care of the overall situation.

468
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,360
Please accept my obeisance.

469
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,480
You don't have to do that, Your Highness.

470
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,360
I'm your subject.

471
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,680
How can you make obeisance to me?

472
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,360
For the sake of the country,

473
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,560
what would it take to kneel?

474
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,480
Since your vow has been broken,

475
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,280
will you stay in Central State

476
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,600
to serve His Majesty?

477
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,640
No.

478
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,560
I've been away from Central State for a long time.

479
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,160
I don't want to come back.

480
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,760
Western State suits me more.

481
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,520
I have been plagued by rumors for many years.

482
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,800
I would like to put an end to them today

483
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,200
as a congratulatory gift for

484
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,480
His Majesty's accession to the throne.

485
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,440
How to end them?

486
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
I hereby make a vow

487
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,800
to guard the border for the rest of my life.

488
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,920
I will not marry or have any children.

489
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,120
Since there are no children,

490
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,120
there will be no more reasons for me

491
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,880
to usurp power and plot rebellion.

492
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,440
In this way,

493
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,560
His Majesty can feel at ease.

494
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,600
All the ministers can feel at ease.

495
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,000
I

496
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,400
will also no longer be troubled by the rumors.

497
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,040
Your Highness, are you sure?

498
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,000
I am sure.

499
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,360
Your Highness really understands what is right.

500
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,760
Your Highness really has a high moral character.

501
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,740
[Liu Changshan]

502
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,400
Yet we...

503
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,020
I'm really afraid to fight you.

504
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,460
If we had this chance, it wouldn't' be bad.

505
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,940
You and I can have a showdown.

506
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,820
Your name, Junior Prince of Nanchen,

507
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,180
has been known all over the world.

508
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,700
I wouldn't dare to fight you.

509
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,100
Your Highness.

510
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,940
I have a favor to ask.

511
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
Please go ahead, Grand Mentor.

512
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,260
There is a girl in Cui family named Shiyi.

513
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,660
The late emperor once engaged her to the royal family.

514
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,060
Would Your Highness

515
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,580
like to take her as your pupil?

516
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,580
If so,

517
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,940
the royal family, Cui family,

518
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,220
and the Nanchen Royal Mansion

519
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,940
will all get closer to each other

520
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,620
for this.

521
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,700
Good idea. Good idea.

522
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,460
Thus, you'll be doubly related. Doubly related.

523
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:43,980
I...

524
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,900
I'm asking for this with great sincerity

525
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,300
to eliminate the past estrangement

526
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,380
between the Cui family

527
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,420
and Nanchen Royal Mansion.

528
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,380
I would like to do so.

529
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

530
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,740
Congratulations, Your Highness, on your new pupil.

531
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,100
Congratulations, Grand Mentor.

532
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,380
I will lead the troops to the south soon.

533
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,100
I'll be gone for several years.

534
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,460
My entire mansion is full of warriors.

535
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,780
No one will be able to take care of a young lady.

536
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,780
After I win victory in the battle of Jiangshui,

537
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,660
send her to Western State.

538
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,020
It's a deal.

539
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,100
It's a deal.
