[Episode 16]

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,160
Have you ever been outside the Pass?

5
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,479
Yes.

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,800
The scenery's beautiful there.

7
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,280
Next spring,

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,840
I'll take you to Yanmen Pass.

9
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
Really?

10
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,200
Can I really go?

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Why not?

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,560
I'm not sure.

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,039
What if Mother found out…

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
But it doesn't matter.

15
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,160
A general does not always follow the orders of His Majesty when abroad.

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
A daughter does not always follow the orders of her mother when she's not home!

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Master.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,560
What's wrong with Shiyi?

19
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,079
I accidentally stepped in a muddy pit

20
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
and twisted my ankle.

21
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
Prepare a coffin to bring to the Central state

22
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,560
and bring the grand mentor back.

23
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,040
As you command.

24
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,910
Wait.

00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,280
After entering the capital,

00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
find a way to meet Qin Yan

27
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,730
to find out

28
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,080
the whole story behind Grand Mentor Xie's illness.

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,960
Understood.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
Do you think there is something off about his death?

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,640
There's no harm in knowing

32
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,900
what there is to know.

33
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,920
Let me carry you.

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,040

Yes.

When you came to live here with me,

59
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,640
who sent you here? Do you still remember?

60
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,240

Xie Chong is your biological father.

62

Your mother

63
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,600
is from the former empress dowager's family, the Gao family.

64
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,200
Master.

65
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,140
I had also considered this for a long time

66

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,560
You may guess

70
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,480
the reason why I hid it from you.

71
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,080
You were afraid the Qi family

72
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,680
would seek revenge and kill me.

73
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
Grand Mentor Xie wanted to hide it from you all your life.

74
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,159
But I don't hope

75
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,170
his son doesn't see him off after he died.

76
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,280
I was more afraid that,

77
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,050
if I died one day,

78
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,680
no one would

General Xie has stayed in Luyuan.

General Zhou went to the Central State.

And the rest of the generals are elsewhere.

88
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
Only you and General Feng

89

are left at the mansion.

90
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,300
You should have finished your apprenticeship earlier.

91
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,740
You have to leave sooner or later.

92

If it weren't for the late emperor's

delay in granting you a marriage,

94
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,300
you would have tied the knot long ago.

95
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,060
You wouldn't have had to wait till now.

96
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,180

I miss you dearly, as I've been away from home for so long.

Since Grand Mentor Xie is gone,

101
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,700
one thought has been gripping my heart,

102
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,100
making me uneasy all day long.

103
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,900
What did Shiyi say in the letter?

and with him comes

108
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,380

What important matter is to be discussed,

115

to have brought you two here together?

116
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,540
Or did you just run into each other?

117
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,140
I was entrusted by the empress dowager

118
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,540
to accompany Chamberlain Meng to deliver an edict.

119
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,140
What's it about?

120
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,700
What has Cui Feng done?

121
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,380
General Cui works as the prefectural governor in Taiyuan

122
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,220
and is on an equal footing with General Jin.

123
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,580
He is an example to other courtiers.

124
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,820
Don't worry on that count.

125
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,020
Then what's the edict about?

126
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,620
This is the handwritten letter from Her Majesty.

127

It's for you.

is in the hands of the Prince of Guangling

130

Edict granting marriage?

131
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,100
What marriage?

132
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,180
The Prince of Guangling asked for a fiefdom.

133
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,740
Before he leaves the capital,

134
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,100
Her Majesty has agreed to fulfill his wish.

136
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,740
Considering

137
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,260
the strength of your family,

138
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,460

to marry your daughter to the Prince of Guangling.

140
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,700
I think

141
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,220
you should get  prepared early

142
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,300
and call Shiyi back from the Western State

143
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,780
to get married.

144
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,580
The Prince of Guangling is ill and can't come

145
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,340
to Qinghe

146
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,940
to meet you in person.

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,940
Do you want to resist the edict?

152
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,700
I dare not.

Pack up your winter clothes.

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,940
This time we're going to

155
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,140
spend some time away from home.

156

My mother

161
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
must have read my letter.

162
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,780

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,820

Take a seat.

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,580
I still remember clearly

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,140
the day Shiyi acknowledged you as her master.

171

Thank you for caring for her all this time.

173
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,620
She left her hometown and came to the Western State.

174
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,220
It's natural I should take good care of her.

175
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,060
You must be guessing

why I came here this time.

It's still the old one.

186

Even after all that,

187
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,140
it is still the Prince of Guangling.

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,180
Your Lady.

190
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Leave now.

191
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,940
Alright.

192
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,140
It's fine.

193
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,900
The palm won't scar so easily.

194
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,620
Did you read my letter?

195
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,180
Do you hope I have read it

196
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,500
or do you hope

197
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,940
I have never received it

198
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,220
and we won't even mention it again?

199
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,020
I want to know

200
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,820
what you think.

201
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,540
You said you wanted to stay in the Western State,

202
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,500
and compile classics and histories all your life.

203
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,660
Do you not want to get married,

204
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,380
or is it that you can't marry

205
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,579
the one you like?

206
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,540
Do you want to hear the truth?

207
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,380
You don't have to say anything.

208
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,220
I've just seen it with my own eyes.

209
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,260
I never had any delusions.

210
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,740
I just wanted to stay in the Western State

211
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,620
to stay with him.

212
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,540
You're no fool.

213
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,380
You should know it won't work.

214
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,700
Since you came back to the Western State,

215
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,540
there have been rumors among the commonfolk,

216
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,580
saying that the daughter of the Cui family and the Junior Prince of Nanchen

217
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,180
have an improper relationship,

218
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,860
disregarding his apprenticeship

219
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,620
and all ethics.

220
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,420
Who said that?

221
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,020
He and I have never crossed a line

222
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,300
and we never will!

223
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,900
There are also rumors that

224
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,500
the Junior Prince of Nanchen wants to rise in revolt

225
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,220
to ascend the throne himself

226
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,420
and the Cui family will

227
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,700
offer him this young beauty and help

228
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,340
to divide the country

229
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,620
so that the Cui family can rise in stature.

230
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,300
All noble families in the world

231
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,940
and his political enemies

232
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,540
have their eyes on you.

233
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,940
They won't give up any chance

234
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,180
to destroy and slander the people of Nancheng Royal Mansion

235
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,980
and the Cui family.

236
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,020
How could anyone believe this?

237
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,900
People love to praise heroes,

238
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,460
but also feel pity watching heroes fall from grace.

239
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,780
It has been so since ancient times.

240
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,540
Isn't there any room

241
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,100
for us to maneuver our way out of this?

242
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,380
Even if just for him,

243
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,060
instead of for all of us,

244
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,780
you must leave.

245
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,740
Before I meet you,

246
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,340
I've gone over countless scripts in my mind

247
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,260
trying to find words to persuade you.

248
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,980
But they didn't work.

249
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,380
I can't even convince myself.

250
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,460
I've been

251
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,060
through this pain.

252
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,500
Your cousin has experienced too.

253
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,660
I've thought that

254
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,340
in any case,

255
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,100
I won't let you experience the pain I've felt.

256
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,320
I've even thought that

257
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,260
if you fall in love

258
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,420
with any of your senior brothers,

259
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,220
I would help you

260
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,640
regardless of the family's dignity,

261
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,700
all to make you happy.

262
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,540
But you can't

263
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,020
marry the man in your heart.

264
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,100
I understand.

265
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,980
I never had any wild thoughts.

266
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,340
I just

267
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,820
want to be with him

268
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,300
and stay by his side.

269
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,340
That's enough.

270
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,660
Please, I beg you

271
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,540
to give me a few more days.

272
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,820
I just want to

273
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,740
stay here for a little while longer.

274
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,740
Palace Attendant Cui and Chamberlain Meng

275
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,100
are waiting in the post house.

276
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,980
You can stay

277
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,900
till tomorrow.

278
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,260
Okay.

279
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,380
This is Nanchen Royal Mansion.

280
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,940
It's inconvenient for us to live here.

281
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,940
So we shall stay at the post house tonight.

282
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,660
We'll give Shiyi time to

283
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
say goodbye to her senior brothers and sisters.

284
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,380
Tomorrow, we head out.

285
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,500
You still haven't worn the dress

286
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,380
His Highness ordered made last year.

287
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Do you want me to take it out?

288
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,540
Take it out.

289
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,980
Sure.

290
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,780
Who is it?

291
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,660
Master, it's me.

292
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,020
It's time for dinner.

293
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,500
The military advisor said

294
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,140
you haven't allowed anyone to come in.

295
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,620
I have something urgent to do.

296
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,180
Can you light a lamp first?

297
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,500
In the first two years after I came here,

298
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,580
whenever you left on an expedition,

299
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,940
I would sleep here.

300
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,220
At that time,

301
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,900
I was not familiar with the guards

302
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,260
and so I was afraid of them.

303
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
I guessed your study

304
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,020
must be a forbidden area

305
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,820
where ordinary people didn't dare intrude.

306
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,900
So it seemed safest to sleep here.

307
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,860
You never told me about this.

308
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,340
You seldom come back.

309
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,780
I'm only too happy

310
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,380
to say these little things when you're back.

311
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,700
I cooked all these.

312
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,100
I don't know if you like them or not.

313
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,100
Have a taste.

314
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,860
Is it good?

315
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,060
Then take your time.

316
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,620
Where are you going?

317
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,500
I forgot the wine.

318
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,480

I recall, when you were in the imperial palace,

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,060
you looked for wine everywhere.

Miss is having dinner with His Highness.

365
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,940
A farewell dinner.

366
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Farewell to who?

367
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,540
General Feng.

368
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,540
The empress dowager has ordered

369
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,340
the marriage of Miss Cui and the Prince of Guangling.

370
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
The edict was passed today.

371
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,420
Tomorrow,

372
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,780
Miss Cui will go back to the Central State.

373
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,100

Let's give them some time.

375

378
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,590
♫Suffered so much from this sea of pain♫

379

381
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,780

382
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,690

♫Swords and horses, leave the dust of this world behind♫

384

It will be dawn in two hours.

389

390

391
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,740
I still remember

392

393
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,700

394
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,900

Where are you going?

406
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,500
I'm going to look for a piece of clothes.

407
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,300
Someone is waiting for you in the Council Hall.

408
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,660
Who?

409
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Palace Attendant Cui.

410
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,740
He brought the empress dowager's verbal instructions.

411
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,660
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Cui Zheng.

412
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,500
Palace Attendant Cui.

413
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,380
Your Highness,

414
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,140
I came here

415
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,460
to escort Shiyi back to the Central State.

416
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,460
But also, I brought the empress dowager's

417
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,699
verbal instructions to you.

418
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,380
Proceed.

419
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,620
The empress dowager said that,

420
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,380
although the gossip and rumors are not credible,

421
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,179
the Nanchen Royal Mansion and the Cui family

422
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,780
are noble families

423
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,060
admired by all scholars.

424
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,020
In order to stop the rumors,

425
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,380
the best solution is for Your Highness

426
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:32,780
to adopt

427
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,060
Cui Shiyi as your daughter.

428
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:59,190
♫Maybe it's the snow falling without a sound♫

429
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,670
♫Maybe it's the flower in the mirror without a trace♫

430
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,170
♫I've seen all the scenes of the passing years♫

431

♫They're not as good as you, not as good as you♫

433

I will call you Eleven.

435
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,540
Is that okay?

436
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,010
♫I look at a ripple♫

437
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,180
