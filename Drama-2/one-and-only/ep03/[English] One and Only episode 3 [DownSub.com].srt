[One and Only]

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,520
All the zithers here are handed down from ancient times.

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,320
And one of them

6
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,979
was used by His Highness when he was young.

7
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,420
It was sent to Chang'an

8
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,620
after the late emperor passed away.

9
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,300
His Highness said that

10
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,620
you can choose one yourself.

11
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,440
Which one did my master ever use?

12
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,140
Are you asking me which one

13
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,770
did His Highness use?

14
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,260
This one.

15
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,260
It's called Chang Feng.

16
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,480
The waves rise as the distant wind comes,

17
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,680
like a single filed on a high mountain.

18
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,120
I'll take it.

19
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,840
The reason

20
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,600
you are unwilling to get together with me in Pingqin Commandery must be that

21
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,640
you have kept a beauty

22
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,440
inside your house.

23
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,720
Is he one of master's friends?

24
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,140
[Pince of Pingqin]

25
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,000
You are?

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,880
Whatever.

27
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
I am just gonna salute him first.

28
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,360
Are you Zhousheng Chen's concubine?

29
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
No, no, I am his disciple.

30
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,480
I see, I see.

31
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,840
I get it.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,840
I knew it the moment you waved.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,079
He can't marry you in a public manner.

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,360
You see, he'd

35
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,560
rather take a serious oath,

36
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,280
what a nuisance.

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,880
You two.

38
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,320
What you saw today

40
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,280
stays in this room.

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,000
Do you hear me?

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,800
Got it.

43
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,520
I should call you sister-in-law.

44
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,320
It should be.

45
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,080
What's the name of your mansion?

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
No, no, you misunderstood.

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Not sister-in-law?

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,360
If not, then.

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,480
Whom?

50
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,240
You, you go out and ask

51
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,160
someone in the mansion,

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,880
and you will know who I am.

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
Me? Go out?

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,760
No, my dear,

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,240
why are you driving me out?

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,160
Did I say anything wrong?

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,480
Don't take it personally.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,760
Though I am one of the princes.

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
I am actually,

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,280
I am just a vassal prince, bestowed for the counter-insurgency.

61
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,440
I am not a member of the royal family,

62
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,159
I didn't read a lot.

63
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,080
Please forgive me

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,880
if I said anything offensive.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,480
I, I will apologize.

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,280
Don't be mad, don't be mad.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
I am a man with little schooling.

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,360
I am really not...

69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,760
You scared my disciple.

70
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,000
You little...

71
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
Disciple?

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
The Cui family sent her over here?

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
But I had no idea.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,280
Sorry, my dear sister-in-law.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,240
All right.

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
You may go.

77
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,200
I have put my foot in my mouth again.

78
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Come on.

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
The people of Pingqin Commandery.

80
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,440
came along with Prince of Pingqin.

81
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
And they brought a lot of harvest from this year

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,120
to show their gratitude

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,480
for the great kindness His Highness showed to send out troops and save the city last year.

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,159
May I know if she is the princess?

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,159
No.

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,480
This is His Highness's disciple.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,560
I heard that Prince of Nanchen's disciples

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,720
are all generals.

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,480
She is new, she is new.

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,240
The people in your jurisdiction

91
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,680
are so you.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,520
You all love to see someone as someone else's wife.

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,640
Stop calling without knowing.

94
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,159
This is not concubine.

95
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,120
I was mistaken just now.

96
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,800
I mean...

97
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,480
Come on.

98
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,720
Apologize to His Highness and Miss Cui.

99
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,000
Please excuse me, sorry.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
Not a problem, it's ok.

101
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,320
You are also to blame for this.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,280
If you, the Prince of Nanchen, take someone as your disciple,

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,120
you have to let all the people from the Western State,

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,520
and the Royal Army recognize her.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,480
Tomorrow, I will take you

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,680
to see the Royal Army.

107
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,860
[The Western State]

108
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,800
Secular conduct my guide, remain integrity for good.

109
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,160
Secular conduct my guide, remain integrity for good.

110
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,600
Secular conduct my guide, remain integrity for good.

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,200
Secular conduct my guide, remain integrity for good.

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,880
Secular conduct my guide, remain integrity for good.

113
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
What's her dreaming about

114
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,360
that makes her smile like that?

115
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,240
She is not too old,

116
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
nor too young.

117
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,480
It might be inappropriate

118
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,679
to just carry her back.

119
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
What happened to master?

120
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,240
To cover Shiyi with a fox fur

121
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
on such a hot day.

122
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,680
Maybe it's for avoiding body contact.

123
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,740
How can you be doing this?

124
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
Please let me.

125
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,780
She's too heavy for you to carry.

126
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,620
Open the door, please.

127
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,020
This fox fur...

128
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,420
It's from my room.

129
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,900
Just leave it here.

130
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,540
Am I not in my master's study?

131
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,100
My Lady, morning.

132
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,380
Did you know that last night,

133
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,380
it was His Highness who carried you back in his arm?

134
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,700
You mean

135
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,140
I fell asleep in my master's study?

136
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,340
Though His Highness is not

137
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,140
someone to be easily fussed.

138
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,100
But you should always remind yourself of

139
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,740
the etiquette between a master and a disciple.

140
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,820
Especially because His Highness is the uncle of the emperor,

141
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,900
even the emperor himself

142
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,380
has to show some courtesy to him in the future.

143
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,940
I know.

144
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,860
But I didn't mean to fall asleep.

145
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,220
I get it, My Lady.

146
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,900
You were simply too tired at that time.

147
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,980
But here we are, at the royal mansion.

148
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
Nothing like that of Cui Mansion.

149
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
We must be careful all the time.

150
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,980
Master,

151
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,100
you are finally back.

152
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,820
Shiyi locked herself up in the yard

153
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,100
for no reason.

154
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,820
She refuses to eat or come out.

155
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,620
And she's been copying books all the time.

156
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,100
Cheng Xi said she is pondering over her mistakes behind the closed door.

157
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,540
Master.

158
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,020
Did she make any mistake?

159
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,460
I will check it out later.

160
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,580
Master,

161
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,220
why don't you go there now?

162
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,940
I am afraid she's starving.

163
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,720
Not everyone

164
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,700
is the same as you

165
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,500
who would starve to death without having a meal.

166
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,460
I...

167
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,300
Master.

168
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,500
It's a bit inappropriate for you

169
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,860
to crack a joke at this moment, isn't it?

170
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,020
You need to go over there now.

171
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,940
All right.

172
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,220
I will be on my way.

173
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,020
I heard that

174
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,420
you are pondering over your mistakes behind the closed door.

175
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,540
Is it because last night

176
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,380
you fell asleep in my study?

177
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,580
Master, I have realized my mistake.

178
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,460
I forgive you now.

179
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,180
Though you have forgiven me,

180
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,820
I can never rest easy.

181
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,740
I need to review as many times as I can.

182
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,660
And keep everything firmly in mind.

183
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,780
In my opinion, rather than wasting your time

184
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,420
and doing the same thing over and over again,

185
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,210
it would be better to open your eyes instead

186
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,340
and look around you.

187
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Xiaoyu

188
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,080
is now freaking out

189
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,020
because you refuse to step out of the yard.

190
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,200
Soon,

191
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,250
if she still can't see you,

192
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:15,900
I am afraid

193
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,260
she is going to tear the whole mansion down.

194
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,140
Make sure you get that.

195
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,260
I understand.

196
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,420
I gotta go then.

197
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,020
Counsellor,

198
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,220
do you know anything about aphasia?

199
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,740
As far as I know,

200
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,580
if it was a usual aphasia,

201
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,180
the most common way

202
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,940
is to stimulate the acupoints through acupuncture,

203
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,620
along with the support of some medicine.

204
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,260
It will take effect as time goes by.

205
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,900
But I see Miss Cui

206
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,260
is very clever and quick-witted.

207
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,100
She can hear while remain silent.

208
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,740
In my humble opinion,

209
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,460
the root cause lies in her heart.

210
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,020
Her mother ever mentioned

211
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,100
that she had aphasia

212
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,340
because of her father's departure.

213
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,540
Have you heard about this,

214
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,140
Counsellor?

215
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,100
I only heard that

216
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,540
the Cui Family searched everywhere

217
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,860
for a good doctor for their daughter.

218
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,780
As for the rest,

219
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,940
it seems that no one dared mention anymore.

220
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,740
Your Highness,

221
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,500
if you really can't bear to see her unable to speak,

222
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,860
I can help you search for some good doctors in the Western State

223
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,900
and ask them to come to our mansion for treatment.

224
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,260
However,

225
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,980
if what Mrs. Cui said was true,

226
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,900
as far as I am concerned,

227
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,180
the root lies in Miss Cui's heart.

228
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,980
We must seek her salve where she got her sore.

229
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,980
[The Chonghua Palace]

230
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,620
The secret letter making a false charge against me

231
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,460
should be tore on the spot.

232
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,820
How could you even hide it?

233
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,540
You misunderstood, mother.

234
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,540
I...

235
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,820
Your Highness.

236
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,340
[Liu Zixing]

237
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,420
His Majesty has not yet to read the letter,

238
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,820
as it was opened by me.

239
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh, yeah?

240
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,820
What's the content of the letter?

241
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,660
Recite it to me.

242
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,180
You don't dare to speak but to read?

243
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Zhao Teng.

244
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,460
Take him out. Give him 30 strokes of the cane.

245
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

246
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,380
Prince of Guangling has been in a poor health since childhood.

247
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,940
30 strokes...

248
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,140
I am afraid he won't hold it.

249
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,100
[Liu Hui]

250
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,860
Then 20.

251
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,580
Got it.

252
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,300
Your Highness, please.

253
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,860
Mother.

254
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,220
Why would you punish my brother

255
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,620
every time I made a mistake?

256
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,380
On your knees,

257
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,140
now!

258
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,340
Your Highness, here is your medicine.

259
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,579
[Meng Luan]

260
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,300
Everyone says

261
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,020
Your Highness has taken a huge advantage,

262
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,700
but no one knows your grievances.

263
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,540
You love birds,

264
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,660
and then death was granted by the empress upon your birds.

265
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,060
You had several fish,

266
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,860
and they were also poisoned by the empress.

267
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,780
Apart from the daily torture,

268
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,780
you have to take all the blame and punishment for His Majesty.

269
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,740
Enough.

270
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,620
I am simply airing your grievances, Your Highness.

271
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,580
In this place,

272
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,660
not to fight, not to grab,

273
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,140
not to take by force and not to think

274
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,740
are key to survival.

275
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,500

276
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,780
Your Majesty.

277
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,220
Your Majesty.

278
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,820
Don't move, Zixing.

279
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,900
It must hurt.

280
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,780
I got you into trouble again.

281
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,020
I am the reading partner of Your Majesty.

282
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,780
I deserve your punishment.

283
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,780
Your Majesty, don't you have a present ready as your apology

284
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,500
to give to the Prince of Guangling?

285
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Yeah, bring it over here.

286
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,420
What's this?

287
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,540
Your crown princess.

288
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,580
His Majesty has given an imperial edict

289
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,980
to document Miss Cui's daily life

290
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,540
in the mansion

291
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,020
and send the records to the Eastern Palace

292
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,980
once they are transcribed into volumes every year.

293
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,620
Cui Shiyi.

294
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,460
Your Highness.

295
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
What are these?

296
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,580
My Lady's birthday is about to come.

297
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,340
Here are things from the Royal Palace,

298
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,820
including rewards

299
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,820
from the Empress, His Majesty and Prince of Guangling.

300
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,660
These are all birthday gifts

301
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,020
from the Cui's clan in the Beichen.

302
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
That many?

303
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
They have got a big family.

304
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,220
The Cui's clan has six branches.

305
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,380
Even for our branch alone,

306
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,740
there are three little branches.

307
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,420
And branch to which my lady belongs is called Wushui.

308
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,340
It got prosperous because of our chief.

309
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,180
My Lady is the only girl

310
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,180
in her family,

311
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,580
also the future crown princess.

312
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,780
That's why she's got lots of birthday presents.

313
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,180
Did you forget what I said?

314
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,460
No formality inside the mansion.

315
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,020
I forgot.

316
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,620
Cheng Xi said

317
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,180
your birthday is coming.

318
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,100
I have never prepared any birthday presents

319
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,220
for anyone.

320
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
After thinking it over.

321
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,060
I think this

322
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,340
might be suitable.

323
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,300
Open it and take a look

324
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,860
before you decide whether you want it or not, okay?

325
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,580
These are all the seals from the generals who surrendered to me

326
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,580
after I left the Central State.

327
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,420
I was gonna give it to my royal brother.

328
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,300
But it's fine if I give it to you,

329
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,260
so that I don't have to think it over and over

330
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,860
for your following birthdays

331
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,060
year after year.

332
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,940
Are you sure you want to give me

333
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,740
such an important item?

334
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,740
So long as you don't hate it.

335
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,420
This is the proof that my master

336
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,180
once fought for his people in different wars.

337
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,020
I will make sure it's well-kept,

338
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,460
and protect it with my life.

339
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,060
We are about to send out our troops.

340
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,260
Get ready.

341
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,780
This is going to take months.

342
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,700
The army provisions and the defense of the Western State

343
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,740
must be taken into consideration.

344
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,780
Yes.

345
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,620
Your Highness.

346
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,700
There is one more person to concern.

347
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,180
Oh, and Shiyi.

348
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,980
When we went for a battle before, we went without delay

349
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,980
and our mansion became an empty house immediately.

350
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,480
This time,

351
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,420
we have this little disciple in the mansion.

352
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,980
We can't simply go at our free will.

353
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Well, bring her along then,

354
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,720
so that everyone will feel at ease.

355
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,840
That's impossible.

356
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,280
If Mr. Cui ever finds out that

357
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:10,880
we brought Shiyi

358
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,840
to a battlefield,

359
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,040
he's definitely going to

360
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,760
put up a desperate fight against master.

Did you forget the next line?

364
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,320
I used to recite it.

365
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
But somehow,

366
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,960
I forgot when I took the brush.

the sentence is saying

00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,560
I have to go.

378
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
And I am here to tell you that.

379
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,880
Where are you going?

380
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,490
I don't live here normally.

381
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,800
Around 8-9 months in a year,

382
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,010
I will be leading troops outside.

383
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,680
It will be the same in the future.

384
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,540
You need to get used to this.

385
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,380
After I leave.

386
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,700
You and Cheng Xi will be the only ones

387
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,340
living here except the guards.

388
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,740
Take care of yourself.

389
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,880
That's all.

390
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,040
There are no other things

391
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
I need to tell you.

392
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,080
News of victory.

393
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,480
Okay, wait for my news of victory.

394
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,920
From now on,

395
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,100
there will only be news of victory for the Royal Army.

396
00:26:52,660 --> 00:27:02,580
[the female exerts her charm while the male becomes intoxicated]

397
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,200
♫Like a gust of wind gently brushing♫

398
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,840
♫Like a cloud waiting for the rain to fall♫

399
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,970
♫There is a corner in my heart♫

400
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,840
♫Where my expectation is glowing♫

401
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,480
♫It's the shooting star lighting up the night sky for you♫

402
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,050
♫There are so many wishes I want to say to you♫

403
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,580
Master.

404
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,220
Senior sisters and brothers.

405
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,570
♫There is still a hidden sore of longing♫

406
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,180
Take care.

407
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,350
♫My thoughts stained three feet of white snow♫

408
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,740
♫Counting the days for your return over and over again♫

409
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:02,620
♫Flowers blossom and flowers fall, my heart only clings for you♫

410
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,660
Like master said,

411
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,460
he is always fighting on a battlefield

412
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,100
year after year.

413
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,550
♫My obsession is silent♫

414
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,940
And I always seem to be the only guest

415
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,660
♫I use all my life to guard only one person♫

416
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,820

♫I say nothing, only hoping to spend my life with you♫

00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,010
♫Waiting to unlock the years of time♫

♫Our eyes will still be full of stars when we reunite♫

♫Renewing our relationship♫

424
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,580
Master is used to breaking his words.

425
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,700
The time he promised to come back,

426
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,020
is not going to the real time nine times out of ten.

427
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,470
♫We used to be inseparable♫

428
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,740
He did, however, only one thing.

429
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,020
The Royal Army was never defeated.

430

♫Heartfelt thoughts are written on a piece of paper♫

431
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,660
Only the news of victory.

♫Waiting to unlock the years of time♫

443

Are you injured? Let me see.

444

I will go get the medicine.

445

00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,260
What's up?

448
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,500
You thought I was your master?

449
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,740
Your master is in the military camp.

450
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,180
Why didn't he come back to his mansion?

451
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,420
He is wounded.

452
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,420
In case of information leakage,

453
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,700
he is temporarily recovering in the camp.

454
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,820
Where are you going?

455
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,380
The military camp.

456
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,740
Did you forget it?

457
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,020
Your master doesn't allow you to go there.

458
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,860
That's what he told me before he left.

459
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,820
Now that he's back.

460
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,780
Those words don't count.

461
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,980
All right.

462
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,100
I'll take you to the camp.

463
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,180
We just won a victory.

464
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,580
He shouldn't blame you.

465
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,740
I'll take the bamboo slips.

466
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,500
You take the books.

467
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,540
You're breaking into the military camp without permission.

468
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,980
You do have the guts, don't you?

469
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,620
Xiaoyu.

470
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,020
Here.

471
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,420
Follow me to get your “punishment”.

472
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,140
Watch your step.

473
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,740
Is the letter from Shouyang here?

474
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,900
Eleven.

475
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,540
What? You can't recognize me?

476
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,340
It's another year you haven't seen each other, isn't it?

477
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,100
How long have we been away?

478
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,620
Since we left the Western State,

479
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,100
it has been 19 months.

480
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,020
Your wound.

481
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,580
It's okay.

482
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
You don't need to worry about that.

483
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,380
Master.

484
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,180
I have prepared the provisions

485
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,460
according to your order.

486
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:31,900
Great.

487
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,940
So tonight,

488
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,140
you set out with the provisions

489
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,180
to Shouyang.

490
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,620
Please leave it to me, Master.

491
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
I know the place better than he does.

492
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,700
All right.

493
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,140
Then you send the news of victory back to the Central State.

494
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:41,900
Got it.

495
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,060
Glad Shiyi is here today.

496
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,500
Even if all of us were gone,

497
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,940
there's still someone looking after our master.

498
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,780
I'll be honest with you.

499
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,340
Master fell off his horse

500
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,580
because he was shot by a poisonous arrow

501
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,060
and hurt his arm.

502
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,780
Although he was detoxified,

503
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,780
his symptoms will come back now and then,

504
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,260
and it feels like breaking a bone.

505
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,580
Master won't allow us to make it public.

506
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,940
It will get worse at night.

507
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,660
So, you need to be extra careful.

508
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,580
Now Master is all yours.

509
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,940
I'll also leave my brother to you.

510
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,860
Don't worry.

511
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,580
He will be okay as long as I am.

512
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,500
Our master and I will be the same.

513
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,180
Please take a good rest, Your Highness.

514
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,540
Why are you here?

515
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,540
I worry about you.

516
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,180
Go take a rest in Xiaoyu's camp.

517
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,380
You won't be of much help here.

518
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,860
I can handle this.

519
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,740
Go ahead.

520
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,540
Anything wrong, My Lady?

521
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,020
Well...

522
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,820
I am afraid His Highness will blame that on me.

523
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,900
Please.

524
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,580
All right, all right.

525
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
If he keeps sleeping,

526
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,980
the medicine will get cold.

527
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,220
Why are you here?

528
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,860
My Lady, what brought you here?

529
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,140
His Highness finished taking his medicine?

530
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,460
No, no, the medicine was spilled out.

531
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,540
It's all gone.

532
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,140
You are being too kind, My Lady.

533
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,220
Actually, I could

534
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,700
take the bowl on my own.

535
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,780
No, no.

536
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,180
I spilled it.

537
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,660
Spilled it.

538
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,780
My Lady.

539
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,580
What on earth happened?

540
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,340
Medic.

541
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,780
Your Highness.

542
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,580
I was being careless

543
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,660
and tipped over the medicine just now.

544
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,860
I am gonna have to bother you to cook another one for me, will you?

545
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,100
Yes, I will cook it immediately.

546
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,940
Nevertheless,

547
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,620
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for another two hours.

548
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,180
Okay, no problem.

549
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,140
Just a bowl of medicine.

550
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,220
It won't kill me with two extra hours.

551
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,740
Why are you so worried?

552
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
What do you want?

553
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,100
No matter what you say,

554
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,460
I am staying.

555
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,260
You have made up your mind?

556
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,140
These days,

557
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,980
I am afraid

558
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,660
the news of me having a relapse would get out,

559
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,500
that's why I am only keeping Xiaoyu and Tianxing

560
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,740
with me.

561
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,340
What they can do,

562
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,380
I can do just the same.

563
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,620
All right.

564
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,700
If you get tired,

565
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,980
you can sleep over there.

566
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,020
Today,

567
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,340
Xiaoyu and Tianxing were both wrong.

568
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,260
The day after tomorrow

569
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,260
marks the full 19 months.

570
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,770
♫Snow of pavilion gently kisses the window pane♫

571
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,780
The 19 months you are away from your mansion.

572
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:43,440
♫My love for you won't dive deep into my brow♫

573
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,360
♫Singing whispers while I'm slightly drunk♫

574
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,940
♫Hearing it, can you see that I'm thinking of you♫

575
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:04,120
♫Watching your shadowy form disappearing in the heavy snow♫

576
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,660
Master.

577
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,920
♫If I were a lyre, how would I be able to harmonize with you♫

578
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,780
Allow me a few more days till I get used to this.

579
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,820
I will pay a solemn respect to you by then.

580
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,800
♫If I took the brush, how should I portray you♫

581
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,650
♫With the floating tea fragrance, how should I drink with you?♫

582
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:30,240
♫Under the moon at the city gate, we enjoyed the lanterns and boats together♫

583
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:40,320
♫Pity that the feelings cannot be expressed♫

584
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:48,060
♫The snow in front of the yard keeps falling♫

585
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,840
♫Looking at your smile, I don't want to wake up♫

586
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:04,260
♫How should I greet you in the four seasons of the world?♫

587
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:11,480
♫With a sincere heart, I believe♫

588
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:17,310
♫One day, we will enjoy this picturesque world together♫

589
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,500
♫Even if it's millions of miles, I'll run to you willingly♫
