[One and Only]

3
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm here to say goodbye to Your Highness.

5
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,460
I have asked someone

6
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,700
to prepare a carriage for you.

7
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,259
General Zhou and General Feng

8
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,060
will personally escort you to Yongcheng.

9
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,300
Since I'm about to say goodbye,

10
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,979
Prince of Fengyang, this timeâ€¦

11
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,380
I'll go over there first.

12
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,260
Your Highness.

13
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,700
I want to see the child of Gao family.

14
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Who told you that?

15
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,060
It was the Prince of Pingqin.

16
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,900
He accidentally revealed this

17
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,500
when comforting me.

18
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,620
I've never told it to anyone else.

19
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,420
I just want to see the boy.

20
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,300
He is the smartest disciple

21
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,500
of mine.

22
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,140
Once you approach him,

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,380
he will definitely be able to sense

24
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,660
something fishy.

25
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,020
I've seen all Your Highness' disciples

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,380
back in the Central State.

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,579
Can you tell me which one he is?

28
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,820
I promised to a dear friend of mine

29
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,260
I'd never reveal his identity

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,500
to anyone in this life.

31
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,620
I won't tell anyone.

32
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,700
Huaiyang thanks Your Highness for my family.

33
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,340
Your Highness, you've been hiding from me for several days.

34
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,180
Is it for her?

35
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,900
It is.

36
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,300
And also for my brother.

37
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,340
Why are you outside the archery range?

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,740
They're saying goodbye.

39
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,020
From this moment on,

40
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,220
I will let go of

41
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,860
the obsession of the first half of my life,

42
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,220
to be the Crown Princess of Pingqin.

43
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,500
Your Highness.

44
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,540
Please take care of yourself.

45
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,500
You're going to guard Luyuan?

46
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,100
Master, these last few months

47
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,980
you have been trying to decide

48
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,260
what to do with me.

49
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,060
Why don't you let me choose for myself?

50
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,540
Where is Luyuan?

51
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,220
Luyuan is on the north of the Great Wall,

52
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,420
where the royal army guards the border.

53
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,020
Xie Yun.

54
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,740
You finally dare pay me a visit?

55
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,740
Why won't you stay in the Western State?

56
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,900
Everyone has their own reasons

57
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,340
for the choices they make.

58
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,900
But it's not as peaceful as here.

59
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,180
Foreign enemies are a constant threat.

60
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,420
It's too dangerous for you there.

61
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,740
I'm a general.

62
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,620
I was born to fight the enemy.

63
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,940
That's in the past.

64
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,460
Xie Yun.

65
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,060
Won't you stop pushing yourself so hard?

66
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,700
No.

67
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,140
You're sulking?

68
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,460
I'm not your future husband, you know.

69
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,580
It's useless to give me that attitude.

70
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,460
You're changing the subject.

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,820
You know very well

72
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,060
that you can't persuade me.

73
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,860
If you can afford to

74
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,220
waste your time here,

75
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,900
why don't you go get packed

76
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,020
and see me off?

77
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,180
It's much colder here than in the Western State.

78
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,659
You're still recovering from your injuries. Will you be able to stand the cold?

79
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,300
Don't worry, Master.

80
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,460
I can take it.

81
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,860
Your Highness.

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,220
No need to perform the rites of courtesy.

83
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

84
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,100
General Xie, you...

85
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,180
One of my legs was wounded.

86
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,980
But I still have one good one left.

87
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,340
What?

88
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,520
Afraid that a general with only one good leg

89
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,780
can't defend the border?

90
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,220
Don't forget me.

91
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,590
I'll stay with General Xie,

92
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
you can rest assured.

93
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,300
Wait, Zhangsun Jie.

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,460
I thought

95
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,020
you were under my command.

96
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,220
When did you join Xie Yun?

97
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,460
Exactly today.

98
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,780
After I saw the Great Wall,

99
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,100
I decided to stay here.

100
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,380
This place can't compare to the Western State.

101
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,980
Are you sure you won't regret it?

102
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,220
I know I won't.

103
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,940
General Xie

104
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,300
is far more interesting than you.

105
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,420
I'm sure I won't regret

106
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,900
to make the decision to stay here.

107
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,270
Listen.

108
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,740
What can we call this?

109
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,260
This is "Abandon the old for the new."

110
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,820
Do you really want to stay in Luyuan

111
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,940
with General Xie?

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm not lying.

113
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,700
Good.

114
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,100
Then I will entrust General Xie

115
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,980
to your care.

116
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,980
I hear and obey.

117
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,220
Master, you've got it all wrong.

118
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,420
He is following me.

119
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,880
I should be the one to take care of him.

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
Why put it the other way around

121
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,680
and entrust me to him?

122
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,310
This is a cavalry bow.

123
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
There aren't any of this sort in the palace.

124
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,360
Cavalry bows and arrows

125
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,480
are different from

126
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,640
infantry ones.

127
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,159
Generally speaking,

128
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,920
infantry bows and arrows are more powerful

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,840
while cavalry bows and arrows are lighter.

130
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,640
The feathers on the arrows used by Master

131
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,000
are either from eagles or hawks.

132
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,040
Each one of them was taken from Master's hunts

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
since he was a child.

134
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,159
This is from an eagle.

135
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,720
Are there any more white eagle feathers?

136
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,680
Of course.

137
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,950
The white eagle feathers have been well kept.

138
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,640
No one dares touch them.

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,120
Bring them to me.

140
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,800
Yes, Master.

141
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,520
Ten years ago,

142
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,720
Master hunted a white eagle.

143
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,640
It was extremely rare.

144
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,480
There was no impurity on the feathers at all.

145
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
Since he hunted it,

146
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
he has kept its feathers in his possession,

147
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,800
unwilling to make arrows from them.

148
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,760
Three white feathers

149
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
can be made into one arrow.

150
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,690
This box of feathers can make exactly ten arrows.

151
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,460
You don't have to go to war to kill the enemy.

152
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,200
That's enough.

153
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,360
You're giving them to me?

154
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,150
It's useless to keep them anyway.

155
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,820
Why not make arrows out of them for you?

156
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,720
Consider it a gift for your birthday next year.

157
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,840
Master is finally putting in some effort.

158
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,880
When have I ever done any less?

159
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,280
You just gave her brocade every year.

160
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,000
There's none better at taking

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
the easiest path than you.

162
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,240
That brocade was proof of the blood

163
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,960
spilled by the royal army for the people.

164
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,240
Every year, this gift

165
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,760
was my favorite.

166
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,840
Don't ever say

167
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I'm not fond of you.

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,840
This is a hand-stitched gift

169
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,120
from me, General Feng.

170
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
This is a remote place,

171
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,960
and you have an injury on your leg.

172
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,080
This will protect you from frostbite

173
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,040
during the winter.

174
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,480
It was worth it to injure my leg.

175
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,720
You've grown wise,

176
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,240
starting to care for me like this.

177
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,920
Don't talk nonsense.

178
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,800
Although the military doctor said

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
you couldn't mount a horse anymore,

180
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,200
I believe that one day

181
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,520
you will come back to us,

182
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,480
and to the army.

183
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,670
I'll just imagine you're out on a mission

184
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,040
during this time.

185
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,520
Don't get indolent.

186
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,280
As you command.

187
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,080
I'll keep your instruction in mind.

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,080
Behave yourself while I'm absent.

189
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,640
Don't get into any more trouble.

190
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,080
I...

191
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,920
If someone goes to the master

192
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
to complain about you in the future,

193
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,920
no one will cover for you.

194
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,720
Is that my fault?

195
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,760
Isn't it that young lady's fault?

196
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,520
I helped her out,

197
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
and she complained about me

198
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,400
in front of Master in turn.

199
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,080
Couples fight

200
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,560
all the time.

201
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,720
You can't break three of a man's fingers

202
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,080
just because

203
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,680
he pointed at his wife's nose.

204
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,920
You fought for no clear reason.

205
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,200
Who was the one that got hurt?

206
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,240
Master gave me

207
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,640
seven days of confinement.

208
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,480
You

209
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,720
just won't learn the lesson.

210
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,200
Master should have punished you more severely.

211
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
All right.

212
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
I won't make that mistake next time.

213
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,760
If I do it again, punish me

214
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,280
by not letting me lead the army

215
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
and making me guard the border with you.

216
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,480
Then I wish you could make mistakes as soon as possible.

217
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,600
What did you say?

218
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,840
I said, "That would be unworthy of your talents."

219
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,400
That's true.

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
Master wouldn't want to punish me too severely.

221
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you thirsty?

222
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,120
Let me get you a cup of water.

223
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,080
Okay.

224
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,980
[Mingguang Palace]

225
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,280
Zixing.

226
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,760
Zixing.

227
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,600
Zixing.

228
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,380
Your Majesty.

229
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,740
Lie down.

230
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,420
Why is your hand so cold?

231
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,460
Grand Mentor Xie is sick.

232
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,580
You are now sick too.

233
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,420
There is nothing

234
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,820
that can make me happy.

235
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,460
You're about to become a father.

236
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,940
Doesn't that make you happy?

237
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,060
Once the baby is born,

238
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,580
I will definitely be urged by my mother to name someone the Crown Prince.

239
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,580
As a father, you should think of your children.

240
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,140
Since Your Majesty has a child of your own,

241
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,300
it's only right

242
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,900
to pass the throne to your own child.

243
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,020
But the throne

244
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,860
should have been yours.

245
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,540
I have a question that may not be proper.

246
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,620
If one day

247
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,820
Your Majesty has to kill me,

248
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,100
will you be kind enough to let me go?

249
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,740
Why would I want to kill you?

250
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,980
If the courtiers think that

251
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,220
only by killing me

252
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,660
can Your Majesty's son

253
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,140
succeed the throne,

254
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,220
would you do it?

255
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,500
No.

256
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,900
Absolutely not.

257
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

258
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,220
I hope Concubine Jiang

259
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,500
can bring Your Majesty a son.

260
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,700
So do I.

261
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,540
I will never hurt you.

262
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,020
Your Majesty.

263
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,460
Your Majesty.

264
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,220
Cui Feng.

265
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,460
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

266
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,180
Let's go and see Grand Mentor Xie.

267
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,780
You and Cui Feng haven't seen each other for years.

268
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,020
Have a good chat.

269
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,060
I'm going to be a father.

270
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,820
You're going to be a father too.

271
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,700
Think about it, that's something to be happy about anyway.

272
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,660
My aunt won't let me enter the palace.

273
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,420
If it weren't for His Majesty

274
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,300
summoning General Cui to the palace for talks,

275
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,900
I don't know when I could see you.

276
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,100
You're going to be a mother?

277
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,780
It's not true.

278
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,660
It's just my excuse for leaving Shouyang.

279
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,260
You're a princess.

280
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,380
How dare you lie about being pregnant?

281
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,180
If I didn't lie,

282
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,700
how could I have possibly come back?

283
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,380
What about your illness?

284
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,900
What is that about?

285
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,140
Did my aunt force you to leave the palace?

286
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,180
Sickness is a good excuse,

287
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,100
but it won't last long.

288
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,540
That's for real.

289
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,380
The imperial doctor said

290
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,220
three years at most.

291
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,860
Three years of what?

292
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,340
Three more years of my life.

293
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,780
No way.

294
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,300
They are just a few quacks.

295
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Don't trust them.

296
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,340
We'll get another doctor to treat you.

297
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,580
That's enough.

298
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,940
Enough to get back

299
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,700
what should've been mine.

300
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,580
Don't go back to Shouyang this time.

301
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,020
Why?

302
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm going to decree an edict

303
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,740
to make you the prefectural governor of Taiyuan.

304
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,020
How can I be

305
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,620
so qualified

306
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,020
as to be the prefectural governor of Taiyuan?

307
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,180
I absolutely won't do it.

308
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,260
It's not some plum job,

309
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,380
it's a pit of hell.

310
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,340
Jin Rong has been

311
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,460
spending all his money

312
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,020
on recruiting troops everywhere

313
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,060
on the pretext of quelling the rebellion.

314
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,580
The army of Taiyuan is growing stronger.

315
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,060
After the death of the former prefectural governor,

316
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,700
the position has been vacant.

317
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,060
Those who are capable are not loyal enough,

318
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,460
while those who are loyal are not capable enough

319
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,220
to suppress Jin Rong.

320
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,780
Have you told His Highness

321
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,900
about this?

322
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,500
I...

323
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,340
His Highness has already mobilized

324
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,060
200,000 soldiers

325
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,940
and stationed them in the west of Taiyuan

326
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,780
to guard against him.

327
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,860
But Taiyuan is too close to the Central State.

328
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,180
If something really happens

329
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,340
and news doesn't get out in time,

330
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,500
it will be too late

331
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,580
for the Western State to save it.

332
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,060
I've been unable to find

333
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,180
the right person for the job

334
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,380
until you suddenly returned to the capital.

335
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,980
Cui Feng.

336
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,460
Only your ability and loyalty

337
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,819
can reassure His Majesty.

338
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,819
I'd like to take over the position

339
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,420
and go to Taiyuan for Your Majesty.

340
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,819
Thank you for your sacrifice, General.

341
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,900
Has the prefectural governor of Taiyuan finally been decided?

342
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,860
I'm afraid General Cui's trip to Taiyuan

343
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,500
will be unlucky.

344
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,460
My son is

345
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,980
even wary of his own mother.

346
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,860
But he trusts firmly

347
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,500
the people from the Western State.

348
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,780
But

349
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,860
he does have a good eye for people.

350
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,060
Even if all the world is against him,

351
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,100
Zhousheng Chen will defend the kingdom for him.

352
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,660
It's a pity.

353
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,020
There is a traitor among you in the royal army.

354
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,300
Xie Chong didn't die.

355
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,460
I guess I should help him.

356
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,860
I beg you, Your Majesty, to spare Grand Mentor Xie's life.

357
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,100
If he knew

358
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,380
you were in my chamber right now,

359
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,020
he would have had you killed.

360
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,060
If you plead for his life,

361
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,740
you are asking for your death.

362
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,140
Do you understand?

363
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,180
In the past, he taught me a lot

364
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,300
When I was in the royal army.

365
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,940
I beg you to be lenient.

366
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,740
When Grand Mentor Xie recovers,

367
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,820
I will find an excuse

368
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,780
to send him out of the palace.

369
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,660
He'll never threaten

370
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,540
your great work.

371
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,740
I can't wait any longer.

372
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,580
My grandson will be born soon.

373
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,820
I just can't wait any longer.

374
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,720
I, Yang Shao,

375
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,070
come to greet the prefectural governor.

376
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
What did you call yourself?

377
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
I am

378
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,300
Yang Shao, who was stationed at Yongcheng.

379
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,340
You're the one who kidnapped Shiyi?

380
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,540
It was me.

381
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,540
I've defected to General Jin.

382
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,980
I will work with you

383
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,220
together in Taiyuan in the future.

384
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,460
Let's not talk about the future.

385
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,940
Let's settle old scores today.

386
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,620
Wait a minute.

387
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,220
Last month I ran into

388
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,700
the Junior Prince of Nanchen and Miss Cui.

389
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,020
His Highness let me live.

390
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,380
Those old scores were settled long ago.

391
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,900
If you don't believe me,

392
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,420
you can go to the Western State and ask around.

393
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,260
If I'm lying,

394
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,660
you can kill me

395
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,740
anytime you want.

396
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,300
But I guess

397
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,300
you have more important things to do here.

398
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,260
No need to waste time on me.

399
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,300
Although I have joined General Jin,

400
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,420
I still remember that

401
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,620
Miss Cui once saved me.

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,340
If you get into trouble in Taiyuan,

403
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,380
I will be your only helper.

404
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,380
Now that we've talked through it,

405
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,060
we'll be partners

406
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,780
and fellow soldiers from this day on.

407
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,100
Taiyuan is ahead.

408
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,900
Good wine and cuisine

409
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,740
have been prepared for you.

410
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,580
Let's go.

411
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,410
Your Majesty.

412
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,100
I beg Your Majestyâ€¦

413
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,820
g-give me a hand.

414
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,500
Your Majesty.

415
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,540
Before Concubine Jiang gives birth to your son,

416
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,540
find a chance to imprison the empress dowager.

417
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,780
How could I do that again?

418
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,180
If you don't imprison her,

419
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,800
she will kill you sooner or later.

420
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,860
She and Liu Wei are already colluding.

421
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,320
Once the little prince is born,

422
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,620
they will certainly make their move.

423
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,910
What your mother needs is

424
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,860
just a puppet.

425
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,780
Once the little prince is born,

426
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,120
you will be of no use

427
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,820
to her.

428
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
Your Majesty.

429
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,180
But...but I have wronged her.

430
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,140
I can'tâ€¦

431
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
As a foreign minister,

432
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,740
how dare you disregard the courtesy a subject owes his ruler

433
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,380
and accept treatment in His Majesty's chamber?

434
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,660
Xie Chong, are you aware of your guilt?

435
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,040
Of course I am.

436
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,050
Take him away!

437
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,940
Stop it!

438
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,500
Mother.

439
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,220
If you have a grudge against me,

440
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,130
just punish me.

441
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,980
Why do you have to take it out on Grand Mentor Xie?

442
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,580
Your Majesty is the emperor.

443
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,820
No one can punish you.

444
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,780
This man

445
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,020
is not only guilty of disrespect.

446
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,420
He is also guilty of deceiving Your Majesty.

447
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,260
When has he ever deceived me?

448
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,860
Which clan is

449
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,900
your wedded wife from?

450
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,820
His wedded wife

451
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,580
is from the Gao clan of traitors.

452
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,420
When Your Majesty was born,

453
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,300
the Gao clan tried to poison you several times.

454
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,500
If I hadn't have taken precautions,

455
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,380
Your Majesty would have been

456
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,260
on the road to death.

457
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,460
After Your Majesty's ascension to the throne,

458
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,780
They even tried to rebel.

459
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,060
Fortunately, I uncovered their plot,

460
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,260
and saved Your Majesty again.

461
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,780
Now Xie Chong has concealed everything

462
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,540
ingratiated himself by helping you in the palace.

463
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,740
He's just waiting for an opportunity

464
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,220
to avenge the fall of the Gao clan.

465
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,060
Is it true, what my mother has said?

466
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,500
Your Majesty.

467
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,700
I am guilty of deceiving Your Majesty.

468
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,740
Take him away.

469
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,660
Please, Mother.

470
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,780
For the sake of

471
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,820
his many years of service to me,

472
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,780
spare his life.

473
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,140
Stop them and help the grand mentor back to his bed.

474
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,300
Qin Yan, why don't you move?

475
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,780
Do you want to disobey my order?

476
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,620
Close the inner and outer gates of the palace.

477
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,780
From this day on, no foreign ministers are permitted

478
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,820
in His Majesty's chambers.

479
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,380
Other than Concubine Jiang,

480
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,900
no concubine of the palace

481
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,060
is allowed to see His Majesty.

482
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,100
Yes.

483
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,620
Qin Yan.

484
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,060
I misjudged you.

485
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,460
His Highness has misjudged you too.

486
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Your Majesty.

487
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,900
Your Majesty.

488
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,300
What should we do?

489
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,460
I don't know either.

490
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,340
Her Majesty Empress Dowager is here.

491
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,380
Greetings, Her Majesty.

492
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,780
The grand mentor is seriously ill.

493
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,540
His Majesty is so upset about this that

494
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,900
he too has fallen ill.

495
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,980
I will take over His Majesty's administration

496
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,420
until the day His Majesty gets well.

497
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,580
There is also a happy event taking place in the palace.

498
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,540
I saw a good sign in my dream.

499
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,020
This time, His Majesty

500
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,190
will get a son.

501
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,580
I'm going to celebrate in the palace for half a month

502
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,340
until the birth of my royal grandson.

503
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
Prime Minister.

504
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,740
Congratulations to His Majesty! Congratulations to Your Majesty Empress Dowager!

505
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,660
Congratulations to His Majesty! Congratulations to Your Majesty Empress Dowager!

506
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,180
Your Majesty,

507
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,100
I have something to tell you.

508
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,740
You live in the Eastern Palace.

509
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,540
If you have something to report,

510
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
it's not necessary to be in the Taiji Palace.

511
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,980
Your Majesty.

512
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,900
it's good to have a witness

513
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,460
in front of the ministers.

514
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,620
Go ahead, then.

515
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,900
I hope Your Majesty can issue a decree

516
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,420
granting me a fiefdom.

517
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,900
Let me establish a permanent residence,

518
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,060
and stay away from the Central State from now on,

519
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
so that there will be no confusion or whispers

520
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,100
in the palace or the court.

521
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,100
The future prince will be crowned

522
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,740
in a more clear and just way.

523
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,460
Let me think about it.

524
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,380
Wait until I find a suitable fiefdom

525
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
before issuing the decree.

526
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

527
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:30,620
[Taiji Palace]

528
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,460
Your Majesty, which land are you going to

529
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,060
give him?

530
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,380
I don't know

531
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,460
whether he is sincere or not.

532
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,860
Keep him in the palace for now.

533
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,820
Let him go when everything is settled.

534
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,860
His Majesty was not at court today.

535
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,380
The empress dowager was in charge instead.

536
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,940
It seems that

537
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,620
she can't hold back any longer.

538
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,900
Don't be in a hurry.

539
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,380
I have an idea

540
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,060
to help us meet soon.

541
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,500
Her Majesty, please.

542
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,020
Zixing.

543
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,300
This toast is for you.

544
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,900
I've been ill for a long time, unable to drink.

545
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,780
When I was imprisoned,

546
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,580
it was you who traveled thousands of miles to the Western State to ask for help.

547
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,610
Now I feel sorry for you.

548
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,100
If you have a wish,

549
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,540
just say the word.

550
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,220
I wish for a marriage.

551
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,340
With which girl?

552
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,260
Cui Shiyi.

553
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,780
Her again?

554
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,620
Yes.

555
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,300
Before Cui Guang died,

556
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,700
this marriage was a real prize.

557
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,900
But now, Cui Wenjun and her family

558
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,820
are no longer as powerful as before

559
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,860
among the Cui clan

560
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,900
due to Cui Guang's passing.

561
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,420
Instead, Cui Zheng's faction

562
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,150
is becoming more and more powerful in the court.

563
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,220
If you insist on marrying a girl from the Cui clan,

564
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,540
why don't you let Cui Zheng

565
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,300
choose a good girl for you?

566
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,580
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

567
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,500
I don't want just any girl of the Cui clan.

568
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,500
I want just Cui Shiyi.

569
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,500
Cui Wenjun may not agree.

570
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,620
She is unreasonable.

571
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,780
Even if she's tough, she wouldn't dare to disobey

572
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,100
an imperial edict.

573
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,260
That's right.

574
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,180
It's up to Her Majesty.

575
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,220
You won't regret it?

576
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,500
I implore Your Majesty to grant this marriage to me again.

577
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,540
Very well. I'll grant it to you.

578
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,900
You have my gratitude, Your Majesty.

579
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,100
[Xianyang Palace]

580
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,300
Since I ascended the throne at the age of six,

581
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,420
I have had a rocky journey.

582
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,980
I was once gullible to slander,

583
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,620
which led to traitors taking advantage of me.

584
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,860
Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan usurped power.

585
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,500
I almost lost the foundation my ancestors had laid.

586
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,380
Fortunately, my uncle overlooked the past

587
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,860
and quashed the rebellion.

588
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,160
But before I could achieve my goal,

589
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,600
My mother, sheâ€¦

590
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
I regret I didn't listen to the advice of the grand mentor

591
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,160
and so today's disaster has taken place.

592
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,840
It's my incompetence that caused the grand mentor's death.

593
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,600
I am now at the end of my rope.

594
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,200
I have nothing left.

595
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,160
No, Your Majesty.

596
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,840
You have me.

597
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,290
You have our

598
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,920
unborn baby.

599
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,770
Advisor Xie.

600
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,000
What are you doing here?

601
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,360
If I die, I can go back to the Western State.

602
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,570
And you?

603
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,400
Where can you go back to?

604
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,120
My hand was forced.

605
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,320
The empress dowager set me up.

606
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,320
I shouldn't have stayed.

607
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,840
I should have gone with General Hong.

608
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,520
Advisor Xie,

609
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
I am sorry.

610
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,210
You should go.

611
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,139
Go.

612
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,080
Do you have any message for His Highness?

613
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,040
I will try to tell him.

614
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,680
I, Xie Chong, was honored by the late emperor.

615
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,160
I have been loyal and righteous all my life.

616
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,900
The only guilt I feel is

617
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,490
failing His Highness.

618
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,980
What did you see?

619
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,960
Nothing.

620
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,880
This herd of deer seems to have seen something.

621
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,030
The Buddha disguised himself as a king of deer many times

622
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,030
in order to save the world.

623
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,540
They are the most emotional animals.

624
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,500
Master.

625
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,140
Grand Mentor Xie

626
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,020
is gone.

627
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,060
He passed away ten days ago

628
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,340
in the palace of the Central State.

629
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,700
After his death,

630
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,380
His Majesty decreed the posthumous title of Minister for him.

631
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,300
Prefectural governor of Yongzhou.

632
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,740
Whenever Master is upset,

633
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,660
he stays in the stable all alone.

634
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,940
He is a noble prince

635
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,900
in charge of hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

636
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,460
He couldn't reveal his ordinary emotions

637
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,460
in front of people.

638
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
It would be easier for him

639
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,900
to be with these animals instead.

640
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,100
When I came here, the royal army was so lively.

641
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,580
Nowadays,

642
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,660
he has fewer and fewer people around him.

643
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
You stay with him.

644
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,420
I'm going to take care of the grand mentor's funeral.

645
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,940
Master, where are you going?

646
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
To feed the horses.

647
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
I'll go too.

648
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,860
Don't follow me.

649
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,100
The meadow looks beautiful from afar.

650
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,740
I didn't realize it was all mud and water up close.

651
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,820
I came because I was worried about you.

652
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,860
Advisor Xie has gone.

653
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,060
I know it's hard for you.

654
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,340
That night you asked me

655
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,060
if the late emperor had any suspicions about me.

656
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,340
In fact, he asked Xie Chong to follow me

657
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,540
just to keep an eye on me.

658
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,620
After the late emperor passed away, he told me the truth

659
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,620
and let me choose whether to kill him or keep him.

660
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,860
You didn't just keep him,

661
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,940
you trusted him.

662
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,460
That's right.

663
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,420
He was a sword hanging over my neck

664
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,660
sent by the late emperor.

665
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,620
He was also my advisor for many years.

666
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,900
There is one thing

667
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,380
the advisor asked me

668
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,740
to tell you after his death.

669
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,820
His wedded wife's surname is Gao

670
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,060
from the Gao family of the former empress dowager.

671
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,500
He was afraid that I would hate him?

672
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,340
Yes.

673
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,180
I don't have that much hate.

674
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,660
There are thousands of people in the Gao clan.

675
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,980
Do I have to

676
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,060
hate them all?

677
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,660
He was different.

678
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,140
He considered himself

679
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,780
the one that witnessed to your formative years.

680
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,980
Of course he felt guilty.

681
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,820
What about his wife?

682
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,620
Does she need the care of the royal mansion?

683
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,580
She is no longer in this world.

684
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,140
Do they have children?

685
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,180
They have a son.

686
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,250
In case the fact that

687
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,540
he is a descendant of the Gao family becomes known

688
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,220
and he suffers retaliation from the Qi family,

689
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,300
he was fostered by a close friend

690
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,020
when he was very young.

691
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,380
Have you been outside the Pass?

692
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:17,780
Yes.

693
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,100
The scenery's beautiful there.

694
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,580
Next spring,

695
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,980
I'll take you to Yanmen Pass.

696
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,580
Really?

697
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,460
Can I really go?

698
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,500
Why not?

699
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,940
I'm not sure.

700
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,420
What if Mother finds outâ€¦

701
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
But it doesn't matter.

702
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,420
A general does not always follow the orders of His Majesty when abroad.

703
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,860
A daughter does not always follow the orders of her mother when she's not home!
