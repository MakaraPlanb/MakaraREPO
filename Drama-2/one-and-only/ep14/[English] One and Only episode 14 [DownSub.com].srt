[Azure Dragon Temple]

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Last time I was here,

6
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,640
the hall here had been completed.

7
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,680
The person who first found this place

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,920
was Tianxing.

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
The last time he left you

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,720
and the barracks,

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,760
he came here.

[Azure Dragon Temple]

13
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,140
The name is nice.

14
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,740
It was Master's idea.

15
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,139
It was Shiyi's idea.

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
I was

17
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,660
merely speaking for her.

18
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,820
No wonder Shiyi wanted to

19
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,220
hide the dowry here.

20
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,540
Go up the mountain now.

21
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,020
I'll wait at the foot of the mountain.

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,660
Let me carry you.

23
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,940
No way.

24
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,820
Tianxing, give me a hand.

25
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,579
Let's go.

26
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,180
When everything is done,

27
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,980
this would be an excellent place

28
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,940
to cultivate and train.

29
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,620
Why do you insist on becoming a monk?

30
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,300
Can't you stay in the royal mansion?

31
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,180
I'm asking this for Master.

32
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,620
He treats you as a military advisor

33
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,140
while the only thing you care about is cultivating.

34
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,620
That would break his heart.

[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

36
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,260
Since you returned,

37
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,780
you've been packing books.

38
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
Did something unpleasant

39
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,060
happen to you in Nanxiao?

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,700
Or was there a problem with His Highness?

41
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,460
What does it have to do with Master?

42
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,700
When His Highness was not in the royal mansion,

43
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,020
you would long for news from the royal army

44
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,340
and hope that His Highness returns victoriously.

45
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,900
Now His Highness is here in the mansion.

46
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,700
But you hide here and won't see him.

47
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,220
There must be a rift

48
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
between you two.

49
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,420
Half of the books were given away.

50
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,380
If I don't count them,

51
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,420
I won't feel at ease.

52
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,740
You have a lot on your mind.

53
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,740
Do you want me to read your fortune?

54
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,820
They say you only perform divinations for wars.

55
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,180
Why do you suddenly want to read my fortune?

56
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,020
You're an exception.

57
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,700
During His Highness' expedition to the north,

58
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,260
he came across a city that was under attack.

59
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,620
The people he saved

60
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,380
were all sent back to their homeland.

61
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,780
I didn't know where I came from.

62
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,580
I should have been sent to the nearby Taiyuan County.

63
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,340
But because I am blind,

64
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,700
His Highness took me in.

65
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,220
I was even lucky enough

66
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,340
to be adopted by Advisor Xie as his son.

67
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,060
I know.

68
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,300
That's why you were given the name Xie Chen by the advisor

69
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,860
to thank Master for taking you in.

70
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,740
Aren't you curious

71
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,180
why His Highness only took me in?

72
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Is there a special reason?

73
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,340
His Highness told me

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,980
there was a girl in the royal mansion

75
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,540
suffering from aphasia.

76
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,020
He was reminded of the girl

77
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,940
at the sight of me.

78
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,620
What do you want to ask about?

79
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,260
I want to know about...

80
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460

81
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,980
I'll take your silence as a yes.

His Highness invites you over.

85
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,380
Okay.

86
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,060
You stay and look after Xie Chen.

87
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,100
Are you performing divination?

88
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,460
No.

89
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,420
No, I'm not.

90
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,620
Go get ready.

91
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,460
Yes.

92
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,740
Two guests have arrived at the royal mansion.

93
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,500
Both of them have a connection with you.

94
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,900
Back then,

95
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,820
I thought you

96
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,100
were the Princess of Nanchen.

97
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,460
Do you remember?

98
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,460
Yes, I do.

99
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,100
You...

100
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,420
You can talk now?

101
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,460
This...

102
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,540
She began speaking years ago on New Year's Eve.

103
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,180
That's great news!

104
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,780
Since...

105
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,220
you couldn't speak,

106
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,820
you master worried you a lot.

107
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,100
You must not know about this.

108
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,620
In the first two years when he took you as his disciple,

109
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,420
he visited all the

110
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,540
renowned doctors.

111
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,820
He also said

112
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,100
you had a fear.

113
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,060
He was afraid that you'd be terrified

114
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,420
seeing those doctors.

115
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,620
So he went to see those doctors himself.

116
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,220
He learned all his medical skills

117
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,900
secretly from those doctors.

118
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,300
What brings you here

119
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,620
this time?

120
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,419
I'm here to discuss something serious.

121
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,140
The royal court has

122
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,860
given me the mandate to govern Yongcheng.

123
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,500
Yongcheng was once under your protection.

124
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,659
I should thank you, Miss,

125
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,900
on behalf of the people of Yongcheng.

126
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,300
No need to be so courteous.

127
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,380
That's one thing.

128
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,980
The other is,

129
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,940
I've brought Huaiyang with me.

130
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,340
To deliver the wedding fruits?

131
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,940
You're right.

132
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,260
It's a long way.

133
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,340
I didn't want her to come.

134
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,180
But she said she wanted to see her old friends

135
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,260
after hearing we were passing through the Western State.

136
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,900
She has no family.

137
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,900
So she said you are her family.

138
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,220
We're getting married next month.

139
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,100
Congratulations in advance.

140
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,780
Congratulations to Your Highness.

141
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,540
Thank you, Miss.

142
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,580
I'll be back from Yongcheng

143
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,380
in three days' time.

144
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,500
Please take care of Huaiyang for me.

145
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,940
Farewell.

146
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,140
Life

147
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,660
is full of surprises.

148
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,300
Who would have thought

149
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,700
the person once trapped in the palace's nunnery

150
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,940
by the empress dowager,

151
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,380
would later escape

152
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,340
to become the Princess of Pingqin?

153
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,620
-Master.
-Master.

154
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,420
Your Highness.

155
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,060
Master, I'll stay behind.

156
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,300
There's an old grudge

157
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
between her family and my family.

158
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,780
It would be awkward for us to meet.

159
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,340
Come with me.

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,380
Me?

161
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,660
She's practicing Buddhism without cutting her hair,

162
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,620
while you're a half practitioner yourself.

163
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,460
You two may have something in common to talk about.

164
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,700
What are you afraid of, Your Highness?

165
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,140
What possibly can I be afraid of?

166
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,620
Are you afraid of being alone with a beautiful woman?

167
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,500
Or are you afraid

168
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,980
of causing another beautiful woman to misunderstand you?

169
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,940
You really understand people's emotions.

170
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,980
Well, I've experienced many things

171
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,500
for the past decade.

172
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,860
Your Highness.

173
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,900
Prince of Fengyang.

174
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,820
Princess of Pingqin.

175
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,860
Would you

176
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,340
allow me to

177
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,940
talk with His Highness alone?

178
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
I...

179
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,980
A man and a woman should not speak alone.

180
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,180
It would be more appropriate

181
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,300
with another person being here.

182
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,700
I remember you hated rituals the most.

183
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,140
But you're now also burdened by it.

184
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,420
Rituals are sometimes a burden,

185
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,620
but at other times

186
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,380
it is a sure way to avoid gossip.

187
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,620
Is it your first time being in the Western State?

188
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,300
Yes.

189
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,060
Then you should take a walk around.

190
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,460
This is the ancient capital of several dynasties.

191
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,740
The scenery here is like no other.

192
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,860
I'd like to see

193
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,900
the place that His Highness has been guarding all these years.

194
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,460
The Princess of Pingqin would like to take a night tour of the Western State.

195
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,220
His Highness asked you two to make arrangements.

196
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
Will Master go as well?

197
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,980
His Highness...

198
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,820
I have a collection of books that needs sending tomorrow.

199
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,220
I'll go count them again.

200
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,100
You've already given away thousands of volumes.

201
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,340
Why are you giving more away?

202
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,300
I've read all these books.

203
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,260
Having them here would only serve as a book collection.

204
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,700
There are many poor students in the academy

205
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,860
who love books as much as their lives.

206
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,380
It would be more meaningful to give these to them.

207
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,220
The generals are with the guests

208
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,180
while you're hiding here.

209
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,820
Someone who doesn't know what's going on

210
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,620
may think you're having a fight with His Highness.

211
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,940
The caravan is still outside.

212
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,340
It's not too late to go now.

213
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,740
I don't want to go.

214
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,430
Huan Yu loves books as much as his life.

215
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,820
He's lucky to have met you.

216
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,260
Why aren't you going with them, Master?

217
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I was going to go.

218
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,260
Have a good time.

219
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,500
They've already left.

220
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,380
I was waiting for you.

221
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,620
I saw you didn't come down.

222
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
So I came up here to hurry you.

223
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,900
Why are you waiting for me?

224
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,620
For a night tour of the Western State.

225
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,740
[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

226
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,740
Where to?

227
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,560
To the famous Weiyang Palace,

228
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,060
Changle Palace, and Mingguang Palace

229
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,060
of the Western State, of course.

230
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,260
What's there to see when there's no one there?

231
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,940
That's exactly why

232
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
it would be nice to go now.

233
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,300
Leaving the Weiyang Palace,

234
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,660
we'll take the road to Xi'an Gate

235
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,980
to sightsee the ruins

236
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,380
of the world-famous E-pang Palace.

237
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,300
It's all burnt down. What's there to see?

238
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Though it's burnt down,

239
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,260
it was once the most famous palace in the world.

240
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,020
It's a pretty special experience

241
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,380
to gaze upon the moon at the ruins.

242
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,820
Let's go.

243
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,300
Are we not waiting for Master?

244
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,100
Is he going?

245
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,820
Is he

246
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,740
not going?

247
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,540
He's not going.

248
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,140
He has his own plans.

249
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
We are the only ones to accompany the guests tonight.

250
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,700
Your Highness.

251
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,180
Where are you going?

252
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,980
Open the door.

253
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,220
Yes.

254
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,460
Why didn't you go with her?

255
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,300
Who said I would go with her?

256
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,100
The Prince of Fengyang said so.

257
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,340
He said that, so he go accompany her.

258
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,980
They're people from Nanchen Royal Mansion.

259
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,060
That's General Zhou.

260
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,140
General Zhou!

261
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,340
Where are they going?

262
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,660
Xi'an Gate.

263
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
What about us?

264
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,780
Chucheng Gate.

265
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,180
We're going the exact opposite direction.

266
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,380
Let's get going.

267
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,980
What are you looking at?

268
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,860
Nothing.

269
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,260
It's really lively tonight.

270
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,860
It's as if they are celebrating the Lantern Festival.

271
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,460
You're not answering my question.

272
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,460
You must be hiding something.

273
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,580
The Western State used to be the capital city

274
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,900
where the imperial chefs used to live.

275
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,660
As time went on and this place became well-known,

276
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,900
many vendors from all around the kingdom

277
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,100
came to this street selling all kinds of food.

278
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,300
Do you come here often?

279
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,180
I came here often for food

280
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,180
when I first arrived in the Western State.

281
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,260
Do you want to have that?

282
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,500
Let's go.

283
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,060
I'll take you to eat

284
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,060
something even better.

285
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,180
Come and have a look!

286
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,060
Take a look!

287
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,140
Freshly slaughtered sheep!

288
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,700
This is it.

289
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,180
Roasted, stewed, fried, and braised!

290
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,180
Lamb soup is provided to all customers!

291
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,700
Come and have a look!

292
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,140
Fresh lamb feet!

293
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,140
Lamb head, lamb meat!

294
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,980
We have enough for everyone!

295
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,940
Come and have a look!

296
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,740
Sir,

297
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,380
could we share the table with you?

298
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,300
We have our weapons with us

299
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,940
and have been looking around for seats,

300
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,300
but everyone has refused us.

301
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,060
Please have a seat.

302
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,900
Thank you.

303
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,540
You've also come from outside the city

304
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,940
to eat at this restaurant, right?

305
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,500
Yes, that's right.

306
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,380
And you?

307
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,220
We're looking for a good master

308
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,260
and build up our careers.

309
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,460
Have you found such a person?

310
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,180
We came to the Western State

311
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,500
intending to join the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

312
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,820
But unfortunately...

313
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,740
Here's the lamb soup!

314
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
Here's your lamb soup!

315
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,540
Thank you.

316
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,460
Brother, here.

317
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,220
Thank you.

318
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,980
Enjoy your meal.

319
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,100
Unfortunately what?

320
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,620
If we follow him in the Western State,

321
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,140
we would have to work hard

322
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,580
just to gain a reputation.

323
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,380
However, that is not what we want.

324
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
We struggle

325
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,420
not for fame

326
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,020
but for wealth, prosperity, and a future.

327
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,420
That's right.

328
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,820
The Junior Prince of Nanchen doesn't love gold and silver.

329
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,900
He has no ambitions.

330
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,180
He doesn't even love women.

331
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,180
I heard from people here that

332
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,420
the generals who follow him are all like this.

333
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,290
They don't want to be rewarded, they just want to serve their country.

334
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,680
We can't be

335
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,860
such people.

336
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,050
So what's the alternative?

337
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,820
Who do you want to follow?

338
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,020
Jin Rong of Taiyuan Army.

339
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,380
If we follow him, at least we'll be well fed, well clothed,

340
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,380
and well paid.

341
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,780
Thank you, brother.

342
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,020
Here.

343
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,500
The bread tastes better in the soup.

344
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,260
Among the 13 counties in Beichen,

345
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,500
only the Nanchen Royal Army

346
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,860
is invincible

347
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,220
and wins every battle.

348
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,540
That is because their chief commander is good.

349
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
Though he defends this land,

350
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,060
he wants not a royal name,

351
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
has no interest in amassing wealth and the supreme power,

352
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,560
nor does he lust for women.

353
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,600
Under the heavens,

354
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,880
he is the only one who deserves

355
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,360
the reputation of "beauty bones".

356
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
That's right, that's right!

357
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,980
[Daxing Gate]

358
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
Your Highness.

359
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
I was wondering who His Highness would...

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
It turns out to be Miss Cui.

361
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't talk nonsense.

362
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,720
Be careful not to ruin

363
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,960
the reputation of His Highness and the royal army.

364
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
His Highness is going to the Wei River again?

365
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,240
Open the gate.

366
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,360
Bring me a horse.

367
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,000
Yes.

368
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,400
Do you often come here, Master?

369
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,280
The first time I suffered severe injuries

370
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
was at this place.

371
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,160
It was when I was a teenager.

372
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,320
We won that battle by a narrow margin,

373
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,800
suffered many casualties,

374
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,040
leaving behind a mountain of bloody corpses.

375
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,520
That victory did not please me.

376
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,680
So I got drunk here.

377
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,640
In fact, there is no good

378
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,360
following me.

379
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,160
For many years,

380
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,040
the Nanchen Royal Army has made countless achievements.

381
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
But the royal court is still suspicious of me.

382
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,760
Thus I've never been able to seek the reward

383
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,320
my subordinates deserve.

384
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720
I'm sorry for them.

385
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
We never

386
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
wanted a reward.

387
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,680
People of the royal army and the royal mansion

388
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,040
aren't the only ones who understand you.

389
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,160
When I was in mourning for my uncle,

390
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Mother and I often talked about you.

391
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,840
I told my mother,

392
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,760
in the eyes of outsiders,

393
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,520
there were 700,000 capable men

394
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,080
in Nanchen Royal Army.

395
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
However, their numbers kept decreasing with each war

396
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,240
and not many people wanted to join them.

397
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,120
If things continued like this,

398
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,120
even the strongest royal army

399
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,150
would disappear one day.

400
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,760
Mother said,

401
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,600
it doesn't matter if the soldiers are gone.

402
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,660
Zhousheng Chen of the Western State has been guarding the people in the city

403
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,180
for half his life,

404
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,740
if one day he is no more in power,

405
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,660
the Cui family will give him the academy.

406
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,260
Mother also said

407
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,700
that kingdoms changed hands easily

408
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,100
but a hero did not appear often.

409
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,180
I'm not a hero.

410
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,020
I'm also selfish.

411
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,820
I also have some things I want to do

412
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,060
but can't.

413
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,920
It's going to rain soon.

414
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,010
I'll go get the horse.

415
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,060
I don't want to go back to the city.

416
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,220
I mean

417
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,180
the city gate is too far.

418
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,540
Let's find a place to take shelter

419
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,940
and go back when the rain stops.

420
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,190
No matter where we go,

421
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,990
we have to get the horse, right?

422
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,820
This rain

423
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,500
came just in time.

424
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,760
Why are you monks

425
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,940
so difficult to understand?

426
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,380
When was this palace locked?

427
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,620
As soon as Master entered the Western State,

428
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,100
he gave orders to

429
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,300
lock all the palaces.

430
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,260
Do you believe it?

431
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,740
He never came here.

432
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,620
The locking was all done

433
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,060
by my eldest sister.

434
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,220
He didn't come

435
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,660
because he's afraid people would say

436
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,300
he wanted to be an emperor.

437
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,660
Master doesn't

438
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,820
care about the gossip of others.

439
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,420
He once said

440
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,060
if a general

441
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,660
lost his reputation,

442
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,540
the army would surely get lax.

443
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,180
Of the 13 counties in Beichen,

444
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,700
the Western State

445
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,700
is the only one that no one dares to invade.

446
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,460
This is all because of Zhousheng Chen.

447
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,020
How dare you!

448
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,220
No one has ever

449
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,420
said that to me.

450
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,620
Though you say you want to be a monk,

451
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,340
inside, you still want to be a prince.

452
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,900
Where are you going?

453
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,380
Going somewhere else for shelter.

454
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,580
Let's go inside.

455
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,290
Sit here.

456
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,980
How do you know

457
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,420
there are abandoned houses here?

458
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,540
I gave the order to

459
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,300
evict the villagers here.

460
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,220
In the past, soldiers were recruited here.

461
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,860
Most of the men died in the war.

462
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,740
What's left here were

463
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,740
the old, weak and young.

464
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,780
Xiaoyu helped them move a few years ago

465
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,260
and relocated them in the Western State.

466
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,740
Thank you. Thank you.

467
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,140
Thank you.

468
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,020
I say, young man.

469
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,340
Dry her hair first.

470
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,820
Why do you keep wiping her face?

471
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,020
She'll get sick

472
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
with hair being wet all night.

473
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,140
We found a good place.

474
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,420
There's even a fire.

475
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,140
Come here.

476
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,820
Come and sit down.

477
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,020
You know her?

478
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,780
She's a beautiful lady.

479
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,900
If you like her,

480
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,300
take her with you.

481
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,900
We're not far from the Western State.

482
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,220
Don't cause any more trouble.

483
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,780
I'm afraid of

484
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,180
the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

485
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,620
Sit here and rest for a while.

486
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,180
Should we leave?

487
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,580
We don't know what's going on outside.

488
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,500
Let's wait for a while.

489
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,340
Friends outside the house,

490
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,780
do you guys want to come in to warm up by the fire?

491
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,700
There is an empty room here.

492
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,180
We'll get a fire started.

493
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,020
All right then.

494
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,700
It's too close to the Western State.

495
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,420
It's better we leave early.

496
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,740
Leave at dawn.

497
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,100
What are you afraid of?

498
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,940
If we run into the Nanchen Royal Army,

499
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,580
just say we were defeated soldiers.

500
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,150
War is going on everywhere.

501
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,700
No one would know which county we're from.

502
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,940
I didn't know what was going on inside the house

503
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,020
and was afraid of hurting Miss Cui.

504
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,780
For my failure to come in and save you,

505
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,580
I beg for your mercy, Your Highness.

506
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,580
Who are these people?

507
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,980
They are deserters from the siege of Yongcheng.

508
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
According to them,

509
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,020
there was a general who collaborated with the enemy in the house.

510
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,500
There are commoners in the house.

511
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,460
Don't hurt them by mistake.

512
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,620
Yes.

513
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

514
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,980
Forgive me for not recognizing you.

515
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,660
It's all right.

516
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,740
Zhangsun Jie.

517
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,820
Boil a pot of hot water

518
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,620
and get some meat and wine

519
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,660
for the people here.

520
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,500
Serve them well.

521
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,020
Yes, Your Highness.

522
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,460
-Thank you, Your Highness.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

523
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,540
Thank you, Your Highness. - Thank you, Your Highness.

524
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,580
Why did you save Liu Changshan?

525
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,300
He put in a good word for me

526
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,060
when I was down and out.

527
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,700
Then why did you kill that man?

528
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,020
When Yongcheng was under siege,

529
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,380
he was in league with the enemy

530
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,780
and sold out the prefectural governor

531
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,820
and the people.

532
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,580
So...

533
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,020
Though you knew you would offend me,

534
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,980
you risked your life to sneak back here anyway

535
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,540
just to kill him?

536
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,540
That's right.

537
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,140
You can go now.

538
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,420
I threatened you.

539
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Don't you want to kill me?

540
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,100
Tonight,

541
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,340
you killed him out of loyalty.

542
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,700
If I seize the chance

543
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,980
to take you to the Western State,

544
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,740
I'm afraid I won't be able to console

545
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,140
the dead prefectural governor

546
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,980
and the soldiers who died in Yongcheng.

547
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,820
Come.

548
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,340
Thank you for not killing me, Your Highness.

549
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,540
But I still hope Your Highness

550
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,440
won't easily let your enemy go

551
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,290
in the future.

552
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,900
You'd better run far away

553
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,460
and stop doing bad deeds.

554
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,540
Let him go.

555
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,980
We'll leave at dawn and go back to the Western State.

556
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,700
Yes.

557
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
You should rest.

558
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,580
I'll watch the fire.

559
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,100
Are you not tired?

560
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,420
It doesn't feel right, letting him go.

561
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,220
Let me teach you a lesson.

562
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,420
Everything that has happened

563
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,580
is inevitable.

564
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,300
It's useless to overthink about it.

565
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,420
Since you don't want to sleep,

566
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,820
why don't I draw a chessboard

567
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,980
and let's play chess.

568
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,820
My junior sisters and I always talk about you.

569
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,900
Really?

570
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,739
What do you talk about?

571
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,100
Many things.

572
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,420
All kinds of things.

573
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,940
For example,

574
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,060
you inherited the title from your uncle

575
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,940
and took the liberty of

576
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,420
adding "Junior" in front of it

577
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,420
as a sign of being a subject.

578
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,060
The late emperor wrote a letter to criticize you

579
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,980
because of this,

580
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,659
saying you changed your title without permission

581
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,620
and that you showed no respect for the emperor.

582
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,980
The emperor did that

583
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,139
for the others to see.

584
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,380
Was it because of your merits?

585
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,020
Did the late emperor

586
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,500
really not suspect you?

587
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,980
It doesn't matter.

588
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,740
Why doesn't it matter?

589
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,860
You've been leading the army for many years

590
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
with no wife and no children.

591
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,540
If they are still suspicious of you

592
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,060
then even I would feel sorry for you.

593
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,100
I've been away with the army

594
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,780
not for the sake of protecting the kingdom.

595
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,780
It is for the sake of peace

596
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,070
in the country.

597
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
I only hope

598
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,870
that people can live in peace.

599
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,940
General, the rain has stopped.

600
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,700
His Highness and Miss Cui really get along well.

601
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,620
Those who don't know would think they are a couple.

602
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,980
They've been playing chess for two hours

603
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,820
and still haven't gotten tired of it.

604
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,420
I was afraid you'd say something like that.

605
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,660
His Highness opened the door half way.

606
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,140
In doing so,

607
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,940
he hopes to protect

608
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,800
the reputation of Miss Cui.

609
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,760
You've won again.

610
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,380
If I can't beat you, how am I your master?

611
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,380
You must have not

612
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,300
taught me all your chess skills.

613
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,140
You admit it?

614
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,900
I do.

615
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,260
Don't you want to rest?

616
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,500
One more round.

617
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,180
One more round?

618
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,460
Then I'm going to win

619
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,980
the next round more slowly.

620
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,820
Drawing the chessboard

621
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,580
is much more difficult than playing chess.

622
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,250
Zhangsun Jie!

623
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,700
What's your order, Your Highness?

624
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,020
Can you draw a chessboard?

625
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,060
Well...

626
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,540
Forget it.

627
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,740
Bring us some food.

628
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,900
Yes, Your Highness.

629
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:35,970
I'm ready.

630
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:37,970
Let's go.

631
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,720
Hold on.

632
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,820
You'll meet many people

633
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,460
when returning to the city later.

634
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,260
Your Highness, we are ready to leave.

635
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,060
Good.

636
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,980
There's no breeze at all.

637
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,620
Come and help me.

638
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,140
Me?

639
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:00,980
Yes.

640
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,380
I can't see.

641
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,340
What can I do for you?

642
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,540
Can you come to me by hearing my voice?

643
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,260
Come here for a moment.

644
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,940
Be careful.

645
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,460
Yes, you've got the right direction.

646
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,740
Watch your step.

647
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,060
What are you doing?

648
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,420
What can I do?

649
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,340
Follow the wooden chair

650
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,700
and you'll find a scroll of bamboo.

651
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,140
There.

652
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,740
Try harder.

653
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,060
Thank you.

654
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,740
You're welcome.

655
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,020
You're blind.

656
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,220
I can't walk.

657
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,820
We can be companions.

658
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,780
I don't want to be your companion.

659
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,740
You don't like me?

660
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,100
You talk too much.

661
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,260
It's noisy.

662
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,100
You...

663
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,700
Be careful.

664
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,540
It's rare to hear

665
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,060
Xie Chen talking so much with someone.

666
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,180
It's rare you have time

667
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,220
to come to talk with me.

668
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,500
You've been here all day.

669
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,340
You should get out of the mansion.

670
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,340
I won't go out.

671
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,100
I'll waste the time of a soldier

672
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,620
if I do.

673
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,100
I might as well stay here and bask in the sun

674
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,940
so as not to cause you guys any trouble.

675
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,660
Master has asked me several times

676
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,660
if there is a place

677
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,540
for you to go.

678
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,860
I want to ask about your opinion.

679
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,220
I have my own plans.

680
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,380
There's no need for you guys to worry.

681
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,460
Where do you want to go?

682
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,220
I thought you wouldn't be able to shoot well

683
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,420
with a troubled mind.

684
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,180
Qin Yan's letter says

685
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,900
Advisor Xie may not survive the winter.

686
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,900
I want to send someone to bring him back.

687
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,460
That's a good idea.

688
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,100
You change the subject

689
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,660
when you're troubled.

690
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,540
Do you want to prove to me

691
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,180
or do you want to prove to yourself

692
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,460
that you're still the Zhousheng Chen

693
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,220
whose mind is as calm as still water?

694
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
You're wrong.

695
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,200
I've never been a person

696
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,560
whose mind is as calm as still water.

697
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,820
I'm here to say goodbye to Your Highness.

698
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,740
I have asked someone

699
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,060
to prepare a carriage for you.

700
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,430
General Zhou and General Feng

701
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,070
will personally escort you to Yongcheng.

702
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,740
Since I'm about to say goodbye,

703
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,580
Prince of Fengyang, this time...

704
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,940
I'll go over there first.

705
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,660
Your Highness.

706
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,860
I want to see the child of Gao family.

707
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Who told you that?

708
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,300
It was the Prince of Pingqin.

709
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,300
He accidentally revealed this

710
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,900
while comforting me.

711
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,020
I've never told it to anyone else.

712
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,700
I just want to see the boy.

713
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,480
He is the smartest disciple

714
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,820
of mine.

715
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,390
Once you approach him,

716
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,660
he will definitely be able to sense

717
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,910
something fishy.

718
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,420
I've seen all Your Highness' disciples

719
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,560
back in the Central State.

720
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,860
Can you tell me which one he is?
