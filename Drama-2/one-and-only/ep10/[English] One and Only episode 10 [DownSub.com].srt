[Episode 10]

4
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
It is really heartbreaking

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,640
to see him leave alone.

6
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,600
You did that for me.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,720
It snows.

8
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,000
And these.

9
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,920
My Lady,

10
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,000
you have taken a lot of books.

11
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,520
My brothers said

12
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,040
no one would read these books.

13
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,480
It's fine that I take them away.

14
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
These are not enough.

15
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,380
Your Highness, you're in a good mood.

16
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,980
What happened?

17
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,460
Shiyi's mourning has ended

18
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,860
and she is about to set out to the Western State.

19
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,380
Master just received the letter.

20
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,060
Your beloved disciple is coming back.

21
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,260
Drink.

22
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,660
Are you going to

23
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,420
take away all books

24
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,460
collected by my dad?

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,340
Feng.

26
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,560
There are some changes in Nanxiao.

27
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,880
I need to go back to Shouyang ahead of schedule.

28
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,460
So I can't escort you to the Western State.

29
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,860
It doesn't matter.

30
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,100
General Cui will protect me.

31
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,980
Don't worry.

32
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,260
Tell His Highness

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,220
I'm waiting for him in Shouyang.

34
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,820
Take care.

35
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,620
It seems he has lost much weight.

36
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,180
And he looks blue.

37
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,900
The servants in their mansion said

38
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,580
the princess often

39
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,940
forces him to marry

40
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,580
those two remote cousins of

41
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,380
the Qi family.

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,900
Why do they force him to take a concubine?

43
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,260
Empress Dowager Qi ordered that

44
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,620
the princess must give birth to

45
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,460
a son of the Qi family and the Cui family.

46
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,500
The princess seems reluctant to have a child,

47
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,380
so she came up with this idea.

48
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,260
How many books do you want to take?

49
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
They must be carried by several carriages.

50
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,580
Others might think

51
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,340
I am sending your dowries.

52
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,580
Load the carriages.

53
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,820
I'm afraid it'll be too late tomorrow.

54
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,780
Miss Cui can't bear any delay.

55
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,020
She's eager to set out.

56
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,460
After Shiyi left,

57
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,540
the yard is empty.

[Wende Hall]

59
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,500
Why don't you ask her to stay?

60
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,300
At her age,

61
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,620
she should have finished her training.

62
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,740
She doesn't need to go back to the Western State.

63
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,260
If possible,

64
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,260
I hope she won't follow our

65
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,659
or Feng's path.

66
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Since her engagement with the royal family

67
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,659
was broken off,

68
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,820
they have been trying to

69
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,300
seek marriage.

70
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,820
She has to go back to the Western State

71
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,140
to avoid it.

72
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,700

Liu Changshan,

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,720
we met last time

75
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,240
in the Taiji Palace.

76
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,920
I admit defeat

77
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,240
to you.

78
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm yours.

79
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
I won't kill you.

80
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
Only His Majesty

81
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,600
can kill you.

82
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,600
What are you sighing at?

83
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm thinking

84
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,560
how my ancestors would feel

85
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,960
seeing their descendants

86
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,320
fighting each other.

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,440
It's tiring to suppress the rebellion.

88
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,159
You'd better think about

89
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,000
whether it will rain these days.

90
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,400
Why?

91
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,480
Does it matter?

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,960
If it rains,

93
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,520
march is slow

94
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,440
and you can see Miss Cui

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
after some days.

96
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,920
If it doesn't rain,

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,010
you can see her earlier.

98
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,080
I had a royal mansion before I became a monk.

99
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,920
I also had a wife and concubines.

100
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,480
You can hide it from your disciples,

101
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,480
but not me.

102
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,920
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,120
You're so mysterious.

104

How is my master's

120
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,700
suppressing rebellion?

121
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,380
We won.

122
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,100
Look.

123
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,260

this place was in ruins.

141

Go.

Well, be careful.

We are from

145
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900

146
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,020
We pass by here today,

You may live here as you like.

He invited me to drink tea.

but refused to dispatch troops.

189
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260

he did want to help us,

191
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,060

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,420
What about other regional princes?

195
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,860
Did they also refuse to aid?

196
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,300
Among the nine of them,

197
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,500
only the junior Prince of Nanchen and the Prince of Pingqin

198
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,420
did not reply

199
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
as they were out of their fiefs.

200
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,300
Other regional princes

201
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,940
all refused to help.

202
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,020
I saw several thousand soldiers and horses of the Cui family

203
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,180
at the foot of the mountain.

204
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
I guessed you were here

205
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,700
so I broke in.

206
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,300
Please save Yongcheng.

207
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,340
Cui Shou.

208
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,460
Miss Cui,

209
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,700
we have only 3,000 soldiers.

210
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,980
There are less than 2,000 soldiers

211
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,540
but tens of thousands of people in Yongcheng.

212
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,100
Even if we have only 300 soldiers,

213
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,220
we can't abandon our people

214
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,300
and peers.

215
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,140
Set out to Yongcheng now.

216
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,420
I got it!

217
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Thank you, Miss Cui.

218
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,300
I'm going to select a horse for you.

219
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,620
No, you can't go.

220
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,580
I will follow you wherever you go.

221
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,220
You hide the books in the temple

222
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,500
and pick a horse. You go back to the Western State

223
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,540
and wait for my master.

224
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,380
Tell him

225
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,700
I'm waiting for him in Yongcheng.

226
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,220
Go.

227
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,180
[Yongcheng]

228
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,900
The enemy army has withdrawn.

229
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,820
Miss Cui?

230
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,740
Go into the city.

231
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,140
Miss Cui, why do you come here?

232
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,220
You don't know how to fight.

233
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,180
I met General Yang Shao

234
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,020
and come here to reinforce you.

235
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,380
With you here,

236
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,860
I feel uneasy as I am worried about your safety.

237
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,700
The enemy's reinforcements

238
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,940
are five li away from us.

239
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,580
Do you want to put her into danger?

240
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,980
I've never fought a battle,

241
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,820
but my escorts

242
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,140
are all battle-scarred.

243
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's stop talking about this.

244
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,900
When did you come?

245
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,460
Why did the enemy army retreat?

246
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,580
I beat them back.

247
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,060
I set out as soon as I received the message.

248
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,060
The Royal Army of Nanchen has never been defeated.

249
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,300
We're not like these weak scholars.

250
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,140
Do you have training at ordinary times?

251
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,420
Why are you so weak?

252
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,540
General,

253
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
why don't you ask

254
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,820
how many soldiers

255
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,540
we had

256
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,460
when we were trapped these days?

257
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
You are famous indeed,

258
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,700
but we are not weak.

259
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,300
I…

260
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,740
Generals, stop quarrelling.

261
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,180
Where's the prefectural governor of Yongzhou?

262
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,940
He died in the battle.

263
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Let's first check the defense of the city.

264
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,660
We're not in the Western State.

265
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,540
Both you and I are not familiar with it.

266
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,820
Let's go up to the city wall.

267
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,420
Miss Cui,

268
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,340
are you familiar with the defense of the Western State?

269
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,660
The Western State is my hometown.

270
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,700
I should be familiar with it.

271
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,260
Be careful. Be careful.

272
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,220
Come on.

273
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,780
Come on.

274
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,420
The defense is too bad.

275
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,460
Call all bowmen up here.

276
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:16,940
Yes.

277
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,060
Prepare catapults.

278
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,900
What do you mean?

279
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,460
Do you want to go against me?

280
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,060
I dare not.

281
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,220
Their army is coming.

282
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,780
Archers, get ready.

283
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,020
Miss Cui, go inside.

284
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,260
It's very dangerous here.

285
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,540
Miss Cui,

286
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,780
please go inside.

287
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,260
Fire up.

288
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:09,940
Shoot.

289
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,579
Charge.

290
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,380
Master, Tianxing.

291
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,540
No, thanks.

292
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,740
No, thanks.

293
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,900
Has the advisor sent the order?

294
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:55,860
Yes.

295
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,180
Here you are. Eat something.

296
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,980
Don't worry.

297
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,700
Did you really marry?

298
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,540
You must have had

299
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,460
a wife

300
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,980
and many concubines.

301
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,300
Yes, I had some women.

302
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,700
Where did they go

303
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,020
after you became a monk?

304
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,740
They were dismissed.

305
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,620
So ruthless.

306
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,740
Master.

307
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,540
Master, Yongcheng has been surrounded.

308
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,300
Shiyi and General Gan

309
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,340
went there with reinforcements.

310
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,180
Who?

311
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,780
Shiyi, master.

312
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,780
Master,

313
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,300
I'll first go reinforce them with the cavalry.

314
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,540
Cavalry, get ready.

315
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,260
Yes.

316
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,340
I'll first go with the cavalry.

317
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,300
Xiaoyu, Tianxing,

318
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,500
go cut off the enemy's route of retreat.

319
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,300
Feng Qiao,

320
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,660
go reinforce us with the infantry later.

321
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,060
Yes.

322
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,900
General Yang, the gate is in danger.

323
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
Defend it to death.

324
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,700
Yes.

325
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,660
Quickly. We're the closest to Yongcheng.

326
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,140
The Royal Army is coming.

327
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,900
It's Xie Yun's cavalry.

328
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,780
General,

329
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,100
will we enter the city?

330
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,980
It's very dangerous to open the gate now.

331
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,980
First repulse the enemy.

332
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,700
Xie Yun.

333
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,260
General Yang, open the gate quickly.

334
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,300
If we open the gate,

335
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,180
we can't block

336
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,660
the coming enemy.

337
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,420
Miss Cui,

338
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,700
there're no military forces in the city,

339
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,140
so we can't open the gate.

340
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,820
Do you want me

341
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,380
to leave Xie Yun in the lurch?

342
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,500
General, I'm late.

343
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,140
My leg was broken.

344
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,100
Leave quickly.

345
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,100
Leave.

346
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,300
Let's live

347
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,780
or die together.

348
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,820
General Gan.

349
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,620
Master is coming.

350
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,220
Go kill the enemy's generals.

351
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,420
Retreat.

352
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,300
Retreat.

353
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,140
Xie Yun.

354
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,370
♫The snow is falling in front of the yard♫

355
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:55,120
♫Thinking of your every twinkle and smile, I don't want to wake up♫

356
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:04,640
♫Going through the four seasons on the horse, how shall I greet you♫

357
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:13,040
♫I will never change my love for you♫

358
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,800
♫I'll share all the tears and laughter with you♫

359
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:28,760
♫Even if we have a rootless life, I'm devoted to you♫

360
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,780
Sorry, I'm so incompetent.

361
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,860
General Gan was killed.

362
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,420
You've done a good job.

363
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,820
It's I who came late.

364
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,180
Thank you for saving me.

365
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,900
Gan,

366
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,140
thank you for saving Yongcheng.

367
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,140
[Residence of the Prefectural Governor]

368
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,540
How long didn't we meet?

369
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,780
One year and seven months.

370
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,420
During this period,

371
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,020
the Royal Army went north

372
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,320
and regained 13 cities.

373
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,060
As usual,

374
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,020
I've kept the vanquished generals' seals

375
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,540
for you.

376
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,940
I didn't experience any seizure battle,

377
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,940
so I thought it's interesting

378
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,140
to keep them.

379
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,180
But today,

380
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,660
I know

381
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,340
what you've experienced these years.

382
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,620
Master.

383
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,380
This general wants to see you.

384
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,580
Greetings, Your Highness.

385
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,540
Have you helped the city people settle down?

386
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,700
Yes.

387
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
I'll go back to the Western State tomorrow.

388
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll leave 20,000 troops for you.

389
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,760
I'll also leave.

390
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,760
As a guarding general,

391
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,760
why do you leave?

392
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,040
Do you worry about the city

393
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,080
or me?

394
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
Both.

395
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,680
With His Highness' Royal Amy,

396
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,280
the city will be strongly fortified.

397
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,320
I'm disappointed

398
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
about Beichen,

399
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,280
so I don't want to defend the city here.

400
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,680
Miss Cui,

401
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,600
I owe you a life

402
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,000
forever.

403
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Please take care.

404
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,960
What does he mean?

405
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,320
The prefectural governor died at his post.

406
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,960
Nine people who were send to ask for aid,

407
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,160
but only he survived.

408
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,120
Why did

409
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,200
only he survive?

410
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,640
It's because

411
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,860
Shiyi saved

412
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,620
him.

413
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,300
Since ancient times,

414
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,660
the beauties have liked to marry

415
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,300
the heroes who saved them.

416
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,860
I'm afraid

417
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,860
he has fallen

418
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,220
in love with Shiyi.

419
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,660
Xiaoyu, stop kidding.

420
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,580
I'll go to see Xie Yun.

421
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,820
Send people to keep an eye on Yang Shao

422
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,460
and see whom

423
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,180
he'll surrender to.

424
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,940
Yes, Master.

425
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,740
Why does Master want to

426
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,620
keep an eye on a petty guarding general?

427
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,260
He must have his own reasons.

428
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,420
You asked me

429
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,300
to explain the march strategies

430
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,380
south of the Yangtze River to you,

431
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,860
but you didn't

432
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,540
hear a word.

433
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,560
How do you

434
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,460
know that?

435
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,140
I've seen through the mortal world.

436
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,900
Obviously,

437
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,300
you're watching the sand table,

438
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,220
but you're thinking your girl.

439
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,900
Your Highness.

440
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,540
How is Xie Yun?

441
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,540
General Xie,

442
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,140
General Xie…

443
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,940
Go ahead.

444
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm afraid

445
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
he can't ride forever.

446
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,180
It's lucky

447
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,580
for you to escape with bare life every time.

448
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,100
Feng Qiao,

449
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,540
are you praising me or laughing at me?

450
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,540
I've fought hard

451
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,340
and never thought to escape every time.

452
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,860
It sounds

453
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,100
I am only good at escaping.

454
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,100
Let me check your injury.

455
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,540
You must be crazy.

456
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,860
Am I your enemy or your senior brother?

457
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,660
I'm worried about you.

458
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,380
It hurts.

459
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,020
Shiyi.

460
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,180
Shiyi,

461
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,780
ask Feng Qiao to leave now.

462
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
Have some noodles.

463
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Look.

464
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,060
This is my good junior sister.

465
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,860
I'll go and ask

466
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,500
whether the monk, a prince of Nanxiao,

467
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,100
has any good medicine.

468
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,140
Maybe he has some miraculous medicine

469
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,660
which can't be found in our place.

470
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,180
No need.

471
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,340
Our medicine is effective.

472
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,860
Don't bother him.

473
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,219
Here you are.

474
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,860
Why do you all

475
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,540
trust this monk?

476
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,060
I think

477
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,659
he is a spy in our army

478
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,500
and gained our sympathy by schemes.

479
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,179
Master trusts him,

480
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,020
so do I.

481
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,060
Why do you all

482
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,659
trust an enemy from Nanxiao?

483
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,340
Does it hurt?

484
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,940
As your senior brother,

485
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,420
I can endure it.

486
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,340
Xie Yun,

487
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,980
do you blame me?

488
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,460
Why do I blame you?

489
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,580
I didn't open the gate for you.

490
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,420
Luckily, you didn't do it.

491
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,780
Though you've read military books,

492
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,460
you know little about the seizure battle.

493
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,340
The gate is of vital importance.

494
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,580
Once it's broken by the enemy,

495
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,220
the city

496
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,380
will be lost for sure.

497
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
What Xie Yun said is right.

498
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,860
Leave us alone.

499
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,140
I'll say something with him.

500
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,500
Why are you standing here?

501
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,980
Master is talking with Xie Yun,

502
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,340
so he asked me to come out.

503
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,820
What are they talking about secretly?

504
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,140
I don't know.

505
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,700
Master.

506
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,140
Go inside.

507
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,780
Shiyi, I…

508
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,580
Feng Qiao, go inside first.

509
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,380
I'll go with Master.

510
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,180
Did you make master angry?

511
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,420
I fetched you medicine,

512
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,660
but the monk said it's not that effective

513
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
as your bone was hurt.

514
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,300
This medicine is more effective for injuries.

515
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,340
Xie Yun.

516
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,300
If you don't like the monk,

517
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,540
I won't mention him.

518
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Do you like him?

519
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,900
I…

520
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,580
I was kidding.

521
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,340
Never mind.

522
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,740
I am

523
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
sad

524
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,860
about something.

525
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,060
Master, what's the matter?

526
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,780
Nothing.

527
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,500
I need a walk.

528
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,340
You're obviously worried about something.

529
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,460
It flashed

530
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,140
through my mind that

531
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,020
you've accompanied me to fight hard

532
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,780
these years.

533
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,140
You're lying.

534
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,140
I failed to live up to Adviser Xie

535
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,380
and his instructions.

536
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,940
I failed to take good care of you.

537
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,780
I'll be on duty tonight.

538
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,940
Go back to the prefectural governor's residence.

539
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,180
Yes.

540
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,460
You and your master

541
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,620
are about the same age,

542
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,260
but he has to take his responsibility

543
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,220
as your master.

544
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,740
He blames himself

545
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,820
for General Xie's injury.

546
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,820
Master hasn't come back.

547
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,700
Has he had breakfast?

548
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,580
General Hong.

549
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,820
Master.

550
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
Has Shiyi had breakfast?

551
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,780
Yes.

552
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,460
But she had no appetite.

553
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,820
The city has been surrounded for several months,

554
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,500
so there's

555
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,700
no good food.

556
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,660
After going back to the royal mansion,

557
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,820
find someone to make

558
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,100
her favorite dishes.

559
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,340
Yes, master.

560
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,940
Master has been on duty for three days,

561
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,020
and Xie Yun has locked himself in the room for three days.

562
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,260
Yang Shao, what are you doing?

563
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,500
Freeze.

564
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,620
Yang Shao,

565
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,540
let go of Feng Qiao.

566
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,660
Shiyi, don't come over.

567
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,740
I have only one request.

568
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,300
Let me take away Liu Changshan.

569
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
Why do you want him?

570
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,540
It's none of your business.

571
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,660
Get him to me.

572
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,100
Go get him.

573
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:26,900
Yes.

574
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,300
Don't come over.

575
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,500
Yang Shao,

576
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,300
if I had known

577
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,820
you were so ungrateful,

578
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,260
I wouldn't have helped you.

579
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,300
Miss Cui,

580
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,900
I have my reason to save him.

581
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,820
Freeze.

582
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,940
If you don't force him,

583
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,460
he won't hurt Shiyi.

584
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,660
General Yang,

585
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
do you come to save me?

586
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,700
Cut the cackle. Go with me.

587
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,780
Prepare a carriage for me

588
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,780
outside the city.

589
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,180
Prepare a carriage.

590
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,940
Yes.

591
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,180
Miss Cui, sorry.

592
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,260
Since you can't do martial arts,

593
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,660
I can leave here more safely.

594
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,100
Go.
