1
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,886
I guess someone got the romance going.

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,220
It's unnecessarily pretty.

3
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,473
-It really is pretty.
-Hey--

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,415
I nearly died just now.

5
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,084
Death was right in my face.

6
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,835
-What?
-What?

7
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,090
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I finally found you.

8
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,592
Seong-hyeon?

9
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,427
It's been a while, Hye-jin.

10
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,975
I don't know what's going on,

11
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,145
-but will you get me up first?
-Sorry.

12
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,071
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,782
We meet again. Hold on a second.

14
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,327
I just saved your life, didn't I?
We're even now, right?

15
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,831
I guess. But you didn't
have to repay me all at once.

16
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,792
You see, I don't like being in debt.

17
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,378
Anyway, this is incredible.
What a coincidence.

18
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,505
I know.

19
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,967
Do you two know each other?

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,218
You two know each other?

21
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,219
And you two?

22
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,308
You wandered off again.
Maybe I should get you an ID bracelet?

23
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,270
This is assault.
Maybe I should get you arrested.

24
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,522
Be quiet. The village chief is waiting.

25
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,315
-Let's go.
-Right now?

26
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,859
Chief Hong, come with us.

27
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,110
Sure.

28
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,903
By the way, who are you?

29
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,033
It's me. Wang Ji-won, the writer.

30
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,579
You don't remember
after spending two days together?

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,335
It's okay.

32
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,006
I can sometimes look totally different.
I did Get Me Beauty for many years.

33
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,466
You look totally…

34
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,260
Have you two been introduced?

35
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,971
This is Chief Hong,
who guided me around Gongjin.

36
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:00,889
And this is

37
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,058
OVN's troublemaker and…

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,353
…star director, Ji Seong-hyeon.

39
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,441
Hello, I'm Ji Seong-hyeon.
Nice to meet you all.

40
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,695
Aren't you the young man
who came by my house?

41
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,780
-Who?
-Everyone.

42
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,283
Today we're in Gongjin to visit

43
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,995
the oldest fresh pollack soup restaurant
in the country.

44
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,790
We explore the oldest restaurants
throughout the country.

45
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,791
Who are we?

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,293
-The First Taste Ever.
-The First Taste Ever.

47
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,294
That's right.

48
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,548
Can you guess what goes into
the dish you're having?

49
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,841
-Water celery.
-Chives.

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,384
-Tofu?
-Radish?

51
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,928
-Chili powder.
-Crown daisy.

52
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,471
-Rice wine.
-Soy sauce.

53
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,975
No one has guessed
the most important ingredient yet.

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,810
-Fresh pollack.
-Oh, right.

55
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,811
That's right.

56
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,812
Correct!

57
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,982
What's the food show
where you have to guess the ingredients?

58
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,442
We Eat Anything.

59
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,945
-You're incredible.
-That's right.

60
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,280
And this man here is
the director of that show.

61
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,406
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

62
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,867
I knew it. I did think he looked familiar.

63
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,911
And what brings you here to Gongjin?

64
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,789
Well, I'm planning to shoot
a new variety show

65
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,542
named The Seashore Grasshopper in Gongjin.

66
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,421
We'll try our best not to cause
any inconvenience for you.

67
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,258
I hope you'll understand. Thank you.

68
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,719
And that means

69
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,682
our town, Gongjin, will be on TV.

70
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,933
You have no idea how--

71
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,354
Mr. Ji, next time, come to my restaurant.
I'll serve you the best jjajangmyeon ever.

72
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,982
-Okay, I--
-A team dinner would be even better…

73
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,317
Ms. Dentist, how do you know him?

74
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,695
We went to college together.

75
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,447
-What about you?
-We met on the street.

76
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,492
You could say
our relationship is based on lies.

77
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,576
What?

78
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,786
Wait a second.

79
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,872
So he really knows Baek Jong-won?

80
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,624
There you go.

81
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,584
-Give me your business card.
-Attention.

82
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,712
I'll book a table for your team.

83
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,756
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,508
-I can't believe you.
-Eat up.

85
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,218
Will you stop?

86
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,803
-By the way--
-Excuse me.

87
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,346
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

88
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,306
Thank you.

89
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,640
Go ahead.

90
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,976
-What did I do?
-How could you say that?

91
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,854
-Don't be like that.
-Stop it, both of you.

92
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,190
Sorry it took me so long.

93
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,527
Don't worry.
You were popular back in college too.

94
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,570
Gosh.

95
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,405
How long has it been?

96
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,073
Ten years?

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,869
Ms. Dentist, let me steal this guy
from you for a second.

98
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,204
I'd like for you to explain something.

99
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,125
You knew I got the wrong idea.
Why didn't you tell me?

100
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,878
Because there's not
much of a difference anyway.

101
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,505
I visit restaurants
and analyze the flavors.

102
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,674
What I do is basically mukbang shows.

103
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,844
Besides, I got to get some valuable advice
from you thanks to that.

104
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,180
It was quite valuable, right?

105
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,432
Anyway, nice to see you again.

106
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,226
You too.
Will you let me talk to Hye-jin now?

107
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,478
She's all yours.

108
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,399
The other day, I saw someone who looked
just like you and followed her.

109
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,485
It must've been you.

110
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,737
-Really?
-Yes!

111
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,072
What are you doing here?

112
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,617
I opened a clinic here. Recently.

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,827
-Yoon Dental Clinic?
-How do you know?

114
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,038
Unbelievable. I just happened to see it.

115
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,915
-I even took a picture.
-Really?

116
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,041
Is that your clinic?

117
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,752
-Yes--
-I found the spot and renovated it myself.

118
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,545
-Is that how you met?
-Exactly.

119
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,590
Well, yes. That's what happened.

120
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,383
My goodness.

121
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,346
Mr. Ji. Dr. Yoon. Do you know each other?
You seem pretty close.

122
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,473
-We went to college together.
-I see.

123
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,060
But you seem to be
more than just college friends.

124
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,897
Is it just me or is there something
going on between you two?

125
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,899
It's not like that. Seriously.

126
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,193
-It's not like that.
-Why are you so upset?

127
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,612
What is it? Did I guess right?

128
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,074
It's not like that.
She's just a friend I really care about.

129
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,283
A friend you care about?

130
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,078
See? I knew you weren't just friends.

131
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,332
Hey, wait. I'm not finished yet.

132
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,919
You were talking the entire time,
so I assumed you were done.

133
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,295
I'm not. Put it back down.

134
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,339
Hey, you have water celery in your teeth.

135
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,423
Oh, my.

136
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,217
Did you enjoy the soup so much?

137
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,260
That little…

138
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm sorry, but I have to work tomorrow.
I'll get going now.

139
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,599
Since when was that a problem?

140
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,642
Be quiet.

141
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,229
Hye-jin, where do you live?
Let me walk you home.

142
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,898
No, I live close by. It's okay.

143
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,736
-He's walking her home.
-Whatever.

144
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,572
I'm stepping out for some air.

145
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,949
-All right.
-I'll be right back.

146
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,368
-Are you leaving too?
-I'll get going.

147
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,953
-What?
-Where are you going?

148
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,121
Move.

149
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,748
-Are you going home?
-Yes. See you.

150
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,334
Why did you have to sit there
and mess everything up?

151
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,836
-Let's all go home.
-They all suddenly left.

152
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,047
This is really unnecessary.

153
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,174
Exactly.

154
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,427
She lives just around the corner.

155
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,680
Then why are you following me?

156
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,225
I'm not following you.
I'm just worried about that guy.

157
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,186
He might get lost on his way back.

158
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,980
That makes sense.

159
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,941
Hey, I'm not that hopeless.

160
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,360
-Yes, you are.
-You are.

161
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,031
How many times did you get lost on campus
and I had to help you out?

162
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,700
That's true.

163
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,368
Listen, I have an idea.

164
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,747
After taking Ms. Dentist home,
how about you and I grab a drink?

165
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,956
Sounds good.

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,666
-What is this?
-What?

167
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,294
Why would you go for a drink without me?

168
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,671
You said you have to work tomorrow.

169
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,633
I can stay out until midnight.

170
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,885
This is where Chief Hong lives.

171
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,096
Let's go in.

172
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,807
Is this your house?

173
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,934
Isn't it amazing?

174
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,062
It has such a fantastic view.

175
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,358
The place looks great.
You have good taste.

176
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,904
From the furniture to the lamps,
I put everything together.

177
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,324
I painted, hung, made,
and bought everything in here.

178
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,408
All by myself.

179
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,078
Did you make all these liquors
yourself too?

180
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,079
Of course.

181
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,456
It's my collection.

182
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,501
Liquors on the bottom shelves,
and teas on the top shelves.

183
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,003
What's this empty space for?

184
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,258
Oh, that? I had an unwelcome guest over.

185
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,761
It was for a bottle of ginseng liquor
that had aged for a whole year.

186
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,430
Seong-hyeon. Hey.

187
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,474
Have a seat.

188
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,893
I was thinking of helping him.

189
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,521
It's okay. Don't worry about Chief Hong.

190
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,691
He can do everything on his own.

191
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,151
That's right. Go ahead and have a seat.

192
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,069
Okay.

193
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,655
-By the way, where's the bathroom?
-Seong-hyeon.

194
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,448
Open that door and you'll find it.

195
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,035
I see. Okay.

196
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,673
Why did you want to bring him here
without me?

197
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,258
To talk about me?

198
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,011
Sometimes, doctors don't realize
their own disease.

199
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,846
-What?
-You should see a doctor.

200
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,889
You seem to be excessively self-conscious.

201
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,643
Let go of the delusion
that everyone is interested in you.

202
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,105
Whatever. And not a word to him, okay?

203
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,608
Especially about that night.

204
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,402
Oh, you mean our biological crisis--

205
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,487
-Stop it.
-Hey, I'm holding a knife.

206
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,323
-It's dangerous.
-I'll hit you here.

207
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,616
-Careful.
-What are you doing?

208
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,956
-Are you done?
-Yes.

209
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,876
Well, let's go sit on the sofa.

210
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,045
The sofa here is extremely comfy.

211
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,718
Officer Choi.

212
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,054
Ms. Pyo.

213
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,016
Aren't you off duty? Why are you so busy?

214
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,268
-I've been waiting for you.
-For me?

215
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,771
-Why?
-What?

216
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,192
Well, I…

217
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,028
Hey.

218
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,113
Why don't we have that together?

219
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,699
I love rotisserie chicken.

220
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,702
I'm sorry.
I don't eat anything after 6 p.m.

221
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,997
I see. You're on a diet?

222
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,293
No wonder you're so fit.

223
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,673
-Then should we take a walk--
-Gosh, who did this?

224
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,632
Pardon?

225
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,718
Jeez.

226
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,347
What are you doing?

227
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,516
It's illegal to put these up here.

228
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,184
Whoever did this,

229
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,854
they didn't know it's against
Article 3 of the Minor Offenses Act.

230
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,775
You must've been born to be a cop.

231
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,901
Thank you.

232
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,028
Gosh, it won't come off.

233
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,738
Hold on.

234
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,033
Let me see.

235
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,078
How about now?

236
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,747
It's probably easier to scrape it off
when it's wet.

237
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,166
Isn't that expensive?

238
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,295
No, it's not expensive at all.

239
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,714
Should I spray some more?

240
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,050
Yes, please. Spray generously.

241
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,135
-Generously?
-Yes.

242
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,345
Over here. Where you just sprayed.

243
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,180
-Here?
-Yes.

244
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,683
Spray generously all over, please.

245
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,852
How much does one of these cost?

246
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,688
I think I paid 67,000 won.

247
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,398
What? 67,000…

248
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,360
Did you say… What are you thinking?

249
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,779
-It's fine.
-But…

250
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,990
Why didn't you…

251
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,367
Finally.

252
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,162
Dig in.

253
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,747
It looks fancy. And you work so fast.

254
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,500
-Tell me if you need more.
-Look at the shrimp.

255
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,628
Just soju and beer?

256
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,173
Not going to share
your collection with us?

257
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,383
We'll start with these.

258
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,177
After drinking them with some food,

259
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,473
we'll switch to my homemade liquor
when we can genuinely appreciate it.

260
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,350
-Sounds like a plan.
-Allergic to shrimp, by any chance?

261
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,354
In the past 34 years and 2 months,
I haven't found anything that I can't eat.

262
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,107
Hold on. 34 years and 2 months?

263
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,943
-We're the same age.
-We are?

264
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,905
-Let's be friends.
-Yes, let's.

265
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,283
You're suddenly friends?

266
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,995
-Of course, why not?
-Exactly.

267
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,789
-Let me make some somaek for you.
-Please.

268
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,253
-Hey, stop!
-Chief Hong!

269
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,464
-Are you crazy?
-That's too much beer!

270
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,049
What are you talking about?

271
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,761
I followed the nation's favorite ratio,
the golden ratio of 7:3.

272
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,679
Come on. You don't understand.

273
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,974
To fully enjoy the soft and clean flavors
of soju,

274
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,602
-the ratio should be 6:4.
-Well said.

275
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,895
Is that your favorite?

276
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,063
-Of course.
-Mine too.

277
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,065
-Good.
-Then make some for yourselves.

278
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,316
I'll do it for you.

279
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,152
-You will?
-All right. Let's see here.

280
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,988
One, two, three, four.

281
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,784
-One, two, three, four.
-There you go.

282
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,120
You're very meticulous.

283
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,457
Okay. One second.

284
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,583
Watch this.

285
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,046
-Here you go.
-You're so good.

286
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,464
He spilled it everywhere.

287
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,924
It's no big deal.

288
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,384
All right. Let's drink.

289
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,303
-Ch-- Oh…
-Ch--

290
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,597
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

291
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,765
Cheers.

292
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,480
-This is nice.
-It's smooth.

293
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,692
Hye-jin, you still don't finish
the first glass at once?

294
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,693
You remember that?

295
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,779
You always drank the first three glasses
slowly to warm up.

296
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,657
God, you haven't changed a bit.

297
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,993
-I don't think so.
-She's always been like this?

298
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,370
Yes, she's still the same person
I used to know.

299
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,455
Opening a clinic here and everything.

300
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,957
-What?
-What?

301
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,500
Instead of chasing big goals,

302
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,629
you probably opened it here
to help those who really need you.

303
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,675
I hear the countryside has
a lot fewer clinics than Seoul.

304
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,427
This is so like you, Hye-jin.

305
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,221
Are we really talking
about the same person?

306
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,639
The Ms. Dentist I know--

307
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,934
-What's with you?
-Sorry.

308
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,270
My leg fell asleep,
so I had to straighten it.

309
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,647
I didn't mean to touch your foot.
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,774
But that felt pretty intentional.

311
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,903
Wow, this gambas looks really delicious.

312
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,196
It would go well with wine.

313
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,741
-You like wine too?
-Yes, I love it.

314
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,909
What kind?

315
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,621
I like Burgundy wines. Pinot noir.

316
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,164
-For real?
-Yes.

317
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,624
Me too.

318
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,044
-Really?
-They are soft and have the right acidity,

319
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,046
-so they go well with food.
-Right?

320
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,047
-Yes.
-Come on.

321
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,050
Burgundy wines are too bland.

322
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,801
Bordeaux wines are superior.

323
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,805
The richness of
the Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend.

324
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,099
You said you didn't know much about wine.

325
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,601
It's just…

326
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,770
I'm just saying.

327
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,854
Okay.

328
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,900
Time flies.

329
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,444
Yoon Hye-jin likes wine now?

330
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,115
The Yoon Hye-jin I remember
liked comic books and tteokbokki.

331
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,326
I still like them.
Especially spicy tteokbokki.

332
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,995
-Spicy tteokbokki?
-Yes.

333
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,958
Me too. I know an amazing restaurant
near my workplace.

334
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,043
I eat it every time I'm editing.

335
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,545
-It's nice and spicy.
-Is it good?

336
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,715
I don't understand
why people like tteokbokki so much.

337
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,679
What?

338
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,057
What about comic books?

339
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,894
These days, I've switched to webtoons.

340
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,523
But they definitely lack
the sentiment of paperbacks.

341
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,401
I agree.
The texture, the smell, and everything.

342
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,903
I'm still holed up in comic book cafés
when I'm free.

343
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,697
-Really?
-Yes. Oh, right.

344
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,741
Have you heard
that Seok-hun is married with kids now?

345
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,160
-He got married?
-Yes!

346
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,621
-I'll show you some pictures.
-Please.

347
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,709
-Here.
-How cute.

348
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,293
My goodness. Is it a girl?

349
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,671
-Yes. She's adorable.
-She's really cute.

350
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,297
-Cute.
-She looks like Seok-hun.

351
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,299
-Yes. She just turned one.
-Adorable.

352
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,265
Now that we're friends,

353
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,434
can I ask you a favor?

354
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,561
Sure, let's hear it.

355
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,689
-Please be my team's guide.
-What?

356
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,984
Ms. Wang said you were very helpful.

357
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,903
What do you say?
Do you want to work with me?

358
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,906
I'm not sure. I'm pretty busy.

359
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,659
Yes, Chief Hong is way too busy.

360
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,245
That only makes me more desperate.

361
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,292
How about we play a game to decide?

362
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,877
-A game?
-Yes.

363
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,379
If I win, you'll accept my offer.

364
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,090
If you win, I'll give up.

365
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,468
-What's in it for--
-Hold on.

366
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,303
I'll prepare the game.

367
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,765
-Seong-hyeon.
-What are you thinking?

368
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,308
What are you going to do?

369
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,477
Why are you going through my stuff?

370
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,439
Okay. Let the game begin.

371
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,650
One of them is normal Americano.

372
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,945
The other is Americano
with sand lance sauce.

373
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,908
We'll guess which one
is the normal Americano.

374
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,576
I've seen it on TV.

375
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,038
I'm sure you have.
I have a feeling you're familiar with it.

376
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,333
Just by looking at them,
it's impossible to tell them apart.

377
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,087
To make sure it's fair,
I'll ask you to shuffle them.

378
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,130
-Me?
-Yes.

379
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,257
-This guy scares me.
-Please.

380
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,093
-I mean…
-He's too enthusiastic.

381
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,344
Why are we doing this?

382
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,263
I'll shuffle them.

383
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,599
I'm a little nervous.

384
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:25,979
Here you go.

385
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,109
-Stay away.
-Gosh, you startled me.

386
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
You can't smell them.

387
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,529
What's with you? I get it.

388
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,115
-All right.
-Goodness, you scare me.

389
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,117
-I'll pick one.
-Go ahead.

390
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,744
Go ahead and pick one.

391
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,414
The one on the right.

392
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,625
Then I choose the left.

393
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,546
Well then.

394
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,090
Let's start.

395
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,509
My goodness.

396
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,640
What's going on?
Chief Hong, did you get coffee?

397
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,309
Both of them can't be coffee, right?

398
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,769
Mine is coffee.

399
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,897
Are you going to drink it?

400
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,358
Look at his eyes.

401
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,901
Seong-hyeon.

402
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,988
There's a whole lot of
sand lance sauce in there. Oh, my.

403
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,323
Damn.

404
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,331
-Jesus!
-Oh, dear.

405
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,085
There were about 36,000 sand lances
in there.

406
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,712
Are you okay? Gosh, it stinks.

407
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,255
I finished it, so it's a tie.

408
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,674
Next!

409
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,592
-Tang.
-Su.

410
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,509
-Yuk.
-Tang.

411
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,427
-Su.
-Yuk.

412
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,511
Tang.

413
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,348
It's never going to end!

414
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,474
Next game.

415
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,726
Yorkshire Terrier

416
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,852
Yorkshire Terrier

417
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,978
Yorkshire Terrier

418
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,188
Yorkshire Terrier

419
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,439
Yorkshire Terrier

420
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,481
Yorkshire Terrier

421
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,192
Yorkshire Terrier

422
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,776
Yorkshire Terrier

423
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,403
Yorkshire Terrier

424
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,072
Next, Golden Retriever. Start.

425
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,032
Golden Retriever…

426
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,117
Strawberry, three.

427
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,786
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry.

428
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,539
Strawberry, seven.

429
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,416
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry,

430
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,585
strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry, strawberry.

431
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,004
Strawberry, five.

432
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,675
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry, strawberry…

433
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,803
I'll do it. I'll be your team's guide.

434
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,347
Let's stop.

435
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,350
I don't want to decide this way.

436
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,685
I want a fair result.

437
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,898
Now let's see who can put
the most clothespins on his face.

438
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,400
Damn it.

439
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,944
Please stop.

440
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,747
Seong-hyeon is drunk.

441
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,626
Where's Chief Hong?

442
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,007
I should go home.

443
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,399
Chief Hong.

444
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,991
You're so heavy! Gosh.

445
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,868
You'll freeze to death
if you sleep outside.

446
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,956
Chief Hong, I saved your life.

447
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,585
I'm going home.

448
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,365
Darn it.

449
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,708
Why is it
Everything's so hard…

450
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,836
I feel heavy all day if I don't go
to the bathroom in the morning.

451
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,552
Hye-jin!

452
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,389
Seong-hyeon, did I wake you up?

453
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,599
No, you didn't.

454
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,102
I drank too much.
I don't really remember what happened.

455
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,021
Me neither.

456
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,608
By the way, can I have your number?

457
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,485
-I forgot to ask yesterday.
-Sure.

458
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,407
Here you go.

459
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,868
-Still the same last four digits?
-You remember that?

460
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,370
I do, for some reason.

461
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,624
I have to go to work, so I'll get going.

462
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,168
-Have a nice day. I'll call you.
-Okay.

463
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,253
Where's Ms. Dentist?

464
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,838
She left.

465
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,632
-She did?
-Yes.

466
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,425
I'll get going too.

467
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,302
Hey.

468
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,972
Do you want some ramyeon?

469
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,691
Gosh, you startled me.

470
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,610
Another night at Chief Hong's?

471
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,197
Yes. But we just slept. Again.

472
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,949
And we weren't alone.

473
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,076
I see. Who else was there?

474
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,328
Do you remember Seong-hyeon?

475
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,330
Of course. Ji Seong-hyeon?

476
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,416
Yes. He's in Gongjin now.

477
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,043
He's shooting a show here.

478
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,878
Unbelievable.

479
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,631
Can I take a shower first?

480
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,508
My head is splitting.

481
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,512
Why is my whole body aching?

482
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:55,100
Caught between a rock and a hard place,
Chief Hong and Ji Seong-hyeon.

483
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:59,896
Will Yoon Hye-jin's simple life
finally get more complicated?

484
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,899
-I can hear you.
-Gosh.

485
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,110
This is really exciting.

486
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,113
I made a lot. Eat as much as you want.

487
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,326
Hold on. Did you put eggs in it?

488
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,911
Yes, to add some protein.

489
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,165
Come on. This is unacceptable.

490
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,208
Eggs ruin the flavor of the soup.

491
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,045
It's best to follow the instructions
on the back of the packet to a T.

492
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,132
Come on. To each his own, isn't it?

493
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,967
Why are you so strict?

494
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,510
Forget it. Don't eat it then.

495
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,096
-I'll eat it all.
-No. I'm sorry. I'll eat it.

496
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,311
-You'll be our guide, right?
-The noodles are getting soggy.

497
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,270
Eat up.

498
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,782
I need more allowance.

499
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:57,162
Times have changed. 20,000 won a week
is not even close to enough.

500
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:02,125
You'll just spend all your allowance
on magazines that feature DOS anyway.

501
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,628
You want me to run away from home again?

502
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,089
Sure, do that. Leave right now!

503
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,634
-What?
-Do you think I'll bat an eye?

504
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,385
Hye-jin.

505
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,971
-Hey.
-Hello.

506
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,265
Will DOS really be on that variety show?

507
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,100
-Will they?
-Dr. Yoon.

508
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,770
-Is the director really--
-Can I order first?

509
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,357
Ju-ri. Aren't you going to school?

510
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,651
-What time is it?
-No!

511
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,237
Hurry up and go to school!

512
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,697
Did you pack everything? Go now.

513
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,741
-Hye-jin, I'll call you.
-Okay.

514
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,952
You'll get penalty points again!

515
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,580
-Ms. Yoon, an iced Americano for you?
-Yes, please.

516
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,748
Coming right up.

517
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,583
Let's see here.

518
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,919
SEONG-HYEON

519
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:49,339
Hye-jin, it was really nice
seeing you again.

520
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,217
See you soon. I'll call you.

521
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,096
Ms. Yoon, are you listening to me?

522
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,389
Oh, yes.

523
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,140
Come on. No, you're not.

524
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,438
I drank too much.

525
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,490
What's this?

526
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,825
Coffee-flavored candy.

527
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,452
It really wakes you up in the morning.

528
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,082
Do you have a whole supermarket
in your bag or what?

529
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,458
Pretty much.

530
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,212
It's good.

531
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,174
Look at you two.

532
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,302
I can tell you tortured
your livers all night.

533
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,886
He did, but I didn't.

534
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,805
Don't put me in the same boat as him.

535
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,932
Aren't we though? Why do you have to--

536
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,184
Sand lance sauce, tangsuyuk,
and what else?

537
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,686
-Strawberry, seven.
-Exactly.

538
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,521
Do you want to play some more games?

539
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,733
-No, thanks.
-Have pity on him.

540
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,777
Even his subconscious is
swamped in his work.

541
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,279
I thought I'd die playing games.

542
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,031
Good job. Keep it up.

543
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,372
Did you sleep well?
Your eyes are all puffy.

544
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,709
I'm glad I did. I'll be sleep-deprived
for the next few months.

545
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,711
-Good thinking.
-Why do you look a mess?

546
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,088
Well, let me introduce our guide to you.

547
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,509
This is Chief Hong of Gongjin-dong.
He'll be our guide while we're here.

548
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,136
Nice to meet you all.

549
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,138
He'll be working closely with you.

550
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,766
Hello, I'm Kim Do-ha,
the assistant director.

551
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,559
I'll be in your care.

552
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:25,935
Looking forward, buddy.

553
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,687
"Buddy"? We only just met.

554
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,941
Just get used to it. It's his style.

555
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,568
It's more of a philosophy.

556
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,320
Hand in hand. We are the world.

557
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,697
We're all friends, aren't we?

558
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,740
-We are.
-Let's go.

559
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,827
What a cool guy. I like him.

560
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,953
Let's go.

561
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,710
-I know this place.
-Right?

562
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,462
Ms. Wang, you've been here.

563
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,838
I have.

564
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,756
It's nice here.

565
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,467
-There's a lake over there.
-Is it nice?

566
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,220
That's a port. You can't surf there.

567
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,846
-I can take a picture of you.
-No.

568
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,224
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.

569
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,017
I meant for work.

570
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,644
Did you two just meet?

571
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,355
Snow crab season is almost over.

572
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:17,070
So tell me.
Where will the main shoot location be?

573
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,905
I have a place in mind.

574
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,283
All right.

575
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,247
No, you can't. You came here for nothing.

576
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,708
I've lived in this house all my life.

577
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,877
I can't give it up for you.

578
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,797
Ma'am, we're not asking you
to give it up for us.

579
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,383
We're just asking if we could borrow it.

580
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,386
Three days, five times.
So fifteen days in total.

581
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:46,266
Just leave. Whatever you say,
it's not going to work.

582
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,977
-Grandma, you know--
-Shut it.

583
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,772
I'm not going to fall
for whatever you say.

584
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,317
You don't have to decide right now.
Give it some thought and--

585
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,571
Even if you ask me a hundred times,
my answer will be the same.

586
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,906
Beg me all you want,

587
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,076
but my house is off-limits.

588
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,547
Okay, I understand.

589
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,550
If you're so strongly against the idea,

590
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,011
I shouldn't try to force it upon you.

591
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,723
I'm sorry for all the trouble, ma'am.

592
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,726
See you again.

593
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,227
All right.

594
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,813
-Let's go.
-Okay.

595
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,274
Grandma, take it easy.

596
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,661
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

597
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,038
Director Ji bought them.

598
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,708
I didn't expect Ms. Gam-ri
to be so adamant.

599
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,920
Hey, I've seen a few more houses.
Do you want to check them out?

600
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,839
You mean Mr. Kim's house
with the red front door? I'll call.

601
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,549
-Forget it.
-What?

602
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,885
I won't film it unless it's that house.

603
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,935
What are you talking about?
I thought you gave up.

604
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,189
I didn't. I just said
I'd stop persuading or forcing her.

605
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,609
Isn't that the same thing?
Then what's your plan?

606
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,569
I'm hungry.

607
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,447
All of a sudden? In this situation?

608
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,035
Chief Hong, let's have lunch first.

609
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,286
You're hungry too?

610
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,163
Seong-hyeon has to eat right now.

611
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,748
He can't stand being hungry.

612
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,999
He just had breakfast.

613
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,751
He had both ramyeon and rice.

614
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,380
That's not enough.
His stomach is a bottomless pit.

615
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,883
Unbelievable.

616
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,386
You never cease to surprise me.

617
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,179
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

618
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,974
This is the third time I've been here.

619
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,977
Are you involved with them in some way?

620
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,313
I know you liked the food here.
Today I'm not going to cook.

621
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,149
What can I get you?

622
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,234
-Hello.
-Hello.

623
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,195
-No. Let me surprise you.
-Sure.

624
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,032
Here it comes.

625
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,244
Enjoy.

626
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,579
It looks fantastic.

627
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,707
I told you you wouldn't be disappointed.

628
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,001
I've never seen this before.
What fish is this?

629
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,210
Fringed blenny.

630
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,547
They're impossible to farm,
so they're always wild.

631
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,175
I haven't had this in forever.

632
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,845
You can have this at this price only here.

633
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,347
-In Seoul, it's 100,000 won per kilo.
-That's right.

634
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,683
-I can't wait.
-Thank you.

635
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,768
-Enjoy.
-Dig in.

636
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,728
Oh, my.

637
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,105
Dip it in soy sauce.

638
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,356
It's delicious.

639
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,191
It's amazing.

640
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,123
Sweet, chewy, soft.

641
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,792
The flavors form
a perfectly-balanced triangle.

642
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,670
It's as if the fish comes back alive and…

643
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,549
swims in my mouth.

644
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,802
On top of that,
the perfect texture and fresh flavors.

645
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,887
You know what this is?

646
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,972
-The Holy Trinity.
-The Holy Trinity.

647
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,063
-Do-ha, observe them closely.
-Why?

648
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,148
You don't want to end up like them.

649
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,151
-It's so good.
-I'll kill you if you do.

650
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,028
-Okay.
-Eat up.

651
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,821
-Enjoy.
-Go ahead.

652
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,323
Let's eat.

653
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,493
They're so noisy.

654
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,376
My stomach is about to burst.

655
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,460
Me too.

656
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,754
Same here.

657
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,090
But one person is still going strong.

658
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,342
-Unbelievable.
-No way.

659
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,678
Hey, Ms. Dentist. Are you here for lunch?

660
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,722
-My gosh. Hye-jin.
-Seong-hyeon.

661
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,016
Oh, hello.

662
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,185
I'm Hye-jin's friend, Pyo Mi-seon.

663
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,688
We met once a long time ago.

664
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,564
-When?
-A while back.

665
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,900
I remember. Hello.

666
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,110
Hello.

667
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,612
Am I invisible? No one says hi to me.

668
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,114
-Hi, Chief Hong.
-Hi.

669
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,032
-Dr. Yoon's here?
-Hello.

670
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,867
Do you want to sit with them?

671
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,328
We're finished. Let's get going.

672
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,539
-Pay with our company card.
-Okay.

673
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,999
I'll go look at the menu.

674
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,125
-Okay.
-Let's go.

675
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,837
-It's hot out, isn't it?
-It is.

676
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,881
We would've come later
if we'd known you were coming.

677
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,551
It's nice to see you anyway.

678
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,137
-Aren't you hung over?
-That's why I came here.

679
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,848
-The jiri was really good. Have that.
-Let me decide.

680
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,266
Order jiri.

681
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,020
By the way, it looks like
he's decided to accept the job.

682
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,689
-Yes.
-I'm devoting myself to Gongjin.

683
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,065
As if.

684
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,193
Has he told you about his fees yet?

685
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,612
-Not yet.
-Oh, right.

686
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm glad you brought that up.
Will you explain to him about my fees?

687
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,327
I'm not your spokesperson or anything.

688
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,747
Explain it to him yourself.

689
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,664
I'm all ears.

690
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:08,337
You just have to pay him
the minimum wage. By the hour.

691
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,924
The overtime rate is
1.5 times the regular wage.

692
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,009
Good job.

693
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,636
And other than that,
he doesn't accept any money.

694
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,264
He's a bit of a weirdo.

695
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,641
Why would you say that?

696
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,060
He needs some days off too.

697
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,229
And on his days off,
he refuses to do any work.

698
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,107
So make sure you agree
on the schedule in advance.

699
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,150
Is that right?

700
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,571
But do you have to work with him?

701
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,532
-What?
-Seong-hyeon, we should get going.

702
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,785
-Bye.
-Get going then.

703
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,747
-I'll treat you to something nice soon.
-Okay. I'll look forward to it.

704
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,708
-See you.
-Bye.

705
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,795
"I'll look forward to it."

706
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,379
Is there a problem?

707
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,381
I thought you didn't let anyone treat you.

708
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,926
-Aren't you leaving?
-"I'll look forward to it."

709
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,928
Were you trying to sound cute?

710
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,346
-You're annoying.
-Enjoy.

711
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,430
Go away.

712
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,267
Man, the sky is amazing today!
The air is fresh too!

713
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,311
You're in a good mood again.

714
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,606
Your biorhythm sways on what you eat.

715
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,068
Seong-hyeon, are you really not going
to check out other houses?

716
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,195
Since we're full,
why don't we go shopping?

717
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,446
What? Shopping?

718
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,948
The market is that way, right?

719
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,032
Shopping?

720
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,619
Mr. Ji, you don't even know
where you're going!

721
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,287
Don't tell him where it is.

722
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,705
Well…

723
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,458
I have a serious question for you.

724
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,545
Why do you work with a guy like that?
You're a freelance writer.

725
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,130
You must have a choice.

726
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,509
I look up to Director Ji.

727
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,303
What? You look up to him?

728
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,221
Yes.

729
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,184
-Resp…
-Gosh, that was cheesy.

730
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:49,230
Respect? I see, none of you are normal.

731
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,399
These must have come in today.

732
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,067
-The onions?
-Yes.

733
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,736
They have a lot over there.

734
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,197
-Hello, I'll have a look around.
-Hello.

735
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,491
-These look nice.
-Are these your style?

736
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,617
-Come here.
-Why?

737
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,619
-What are you doing?
-Stay still.

738
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,912
Gosh.

739
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,581
These look good.

740
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,749
-These suit me better.
-I'll take these three.

741
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,501
-Are they for me?
-Hold on.

742
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,837
-You look good.
-Look at me.

743
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,299
-We'll buy ten squid.
-Sure.

744
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,508
Dried pufferfish…

745
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,510
Why are you buying so much?

746
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,469
These are small.

747
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,514
-They're different sizes.
-They're used for different dishes?

748
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,808
-I'll take both.
-What?

749
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,393
Guys, let's try that!

750
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,313
Go follow him.

751
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,480
What did he find?

752
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,733
What is it?

753
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,902
Is he eating again?

754
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,695
-Hello, sir.
-Welcome.

755
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,031
-I'll take all of these.
-Sure.

756
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,866
-Take this.
-Hey, take this.

757
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,492
-Eat it!
-The whole thing?

758
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,411
-Look at the legs.
-It'll be an insert.

759
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,579
Here.

760
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,998
Bite it off.

761
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,833
There you go. Are you eating it?

762
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,002
This candy… Hold on.

763
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,545
-Come on.
-What's wrong?

764
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,048
-Why are you buying so much?
-Please pack it for me.

765
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,716
-This.
-I'll carry it.

766
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,092
-Somebody stop him.
-This.

767
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,929
-Senbei?
-I'll take these three.

768
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,263
Do we have everything?

769
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,229
Ms. Kim.

770
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,399
Here. This is gangnaengi.

771
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:19,362
This is hangwa.
Aren't the colors so beautiful?

772
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,992
Look how shiny they are.
I'm sure they taste great.

773
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,037
Do you think I'll fall for this?

774
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,456
Put them away or I'll kick you out.

775
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,377
Come on. Don't be like that.

776
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,963
Stop bothering me.

777
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,967
I made myself clear yesterday.

778
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,010
I know.

779
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,806
I'm just repaying you for the delicious
meal you made for me the other day.

780
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,891
Stop lying.

781
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,853
Do you think I don't know this is a bribe?

782
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,064
No, it's really not.

783
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:59,068
I'm not going to shoot anything here
because you said no.

784
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,948
Ms. Kim, today I just came by to say hi.

785
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,327
So please take these, okay?

786
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,079
Gam-ri.

787
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:15,793
You shouldn't ignore his kind gesture.
That's not right.

788
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,295
She's right.

789
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,256
Just this once then.

790
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,593
I'm only taking these to save your face.

791
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,055
Sure. Please enjoy. Help yourselves.

792
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,226
-Here.
-Come on.

793
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,062
Ms. Kim!

794
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,772
-What?
-Put it down!

795
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,733
-I'll carry it. Put it down.
-It's okay.

796
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,693
I'll carry it for you.

797
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,778
It's really fine.

798
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,988
I was going to wash it.

799
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,741
I'll wash it. Rest up.

800
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,327
I'll wash it.

801
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,454
It's very dirty.

802
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,915
I saw it at the market
and thought it was so pretty.

803
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,000
Oh, my.

804
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,168
Try it on.

805
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,502
No way.

806
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,962
Don't be like that. Try it on.

807
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,505
I have many hats.

808
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:06,260
I'll leave it here,
so try it on later. Okay?

809
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,928
Goodness.

810
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,480
Let's see if it looks good on me.

811
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,318
Oh, my.

812
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,202
Like this… There you go.

813
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,286
It's back on!

814
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,497
-It's fixed.
-Good.

815
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,126
Here. Drink this.

816
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,753
-Thank you.
-Good job.

817
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,299
You did a great job.

818
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,718
There you go.

819
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,304
It's very good.

820
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,597
It won't go off now.

821
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,891
Okay. Thank you.

822
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,963
That young man's given up so easily.

823
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,184
You saw Dr. Yoon and Director Ji
coming out of Chief Hong's place?

824
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,353
How many times do I have to tell you?

825
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,312
-Really?
-Yes.

826
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,107
-Why?
-How should I know?

827
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,319
Anyway, a love triangle seems to be
the new trend in Gongjin.

828
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,113
A trend? Who else?

829
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,114
I can't believe you.

830
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,075
Yeo Hwa-jeong, Chang Yeong-guk,
and Yu Cho-hui.

831
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,869
They're the ones who started it.

832
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,496
Tell me more. I don't remember it well.

833
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,957
You don't?

834
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,500
Why would you look so happy?

835
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,377
Then I'll have to tell you.

836
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,629
It was 15 years ago.

837
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,757
That's when Cho-hui was
first transferred to Gongjin.

838
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,719
And she boarded at Hwa-jeong's house.

839
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,512
BOARDING HOUSE

840
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,764
You have so many books.

841
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,892
Isn't that heavy?

842
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,143
I'll put it here.

843
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,897
Hwa-jeong, I brought some dried fish.

844
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,023
Come…

845
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,958
Hey! You dropped it.

846
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,630
You all know what Hwa-jeong was like.

847
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,507
-She was a tomboy.
-You want to die?

848
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,633
You're right.

849
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,760
And what was Cho-hui like?

850
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,930
She was delicate like a wild flower
swaying in the wind.

851
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,473
Imagine how Yeong-guk felt.

852
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,934
He fell in love at first sight.

853
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,353
Soon the three of them
started hanging out together.

854
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,979
Only they didn't seem to know

855
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,608
that they were trapped
in the Bermuda Love Triangle.

856
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,401
-Bermuda?
-Yes.

857
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,071
And? What happened next?

858
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:12,988
BOARDING HOUSE

859
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,741
-Cho-hui, take care.
-You too.

860
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,743
-Call me when you arrive.
-Go back inside.

861
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,869
Bye.

862
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,787
See you.

863
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,830
Goodbye.

864
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,378
And then one of Cho-hui's parents
became unwell.

865
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,171
-Right.
-It was her mother.

866
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,714
Her mother fell ill.

867
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,676
After just a year, Cho-hui
moved back home, and that was it.

868
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,429
That's it? It's nothing.

869
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,597
Exactly. It's nothing.

870
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:43,269
Well, I guess it wasn't anything special.

871
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,147
But you should know this.
Guys never forget their first love.

872
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,778
-Is that the case for you too?
-Me?

873
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,490
I don't even remember
who my first love was.

874
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,578
-You're lying.
-No, I'm not.

875
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,164
You're wrong.
First love is no big deal to men.

876
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,083
Since we were so inexperienced.

877
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,835
-Exactly.
-Inexperienced in what?

878
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,336
I mean, it's incomplete.

879
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,130
How does it become complete then?

880
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,425
You're unbelievable.
When it's incomplete, how is it?

881
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,260
-I don't know.
-It's more meaningful.

882
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,306
Hello.

883
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,850
Hello.

884
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,893
-Hello.
-We were cleaning the fish.

885
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,854
-I see.
-Do you want to try some?

886
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,231
-Sorry?
-What can I get you?

887
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,524
A cup of coffee, please.

888
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,527
Coming right up.
Guys, clean the fish somewhere else.

889
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:44,330
I-jun, stop reading and play with me.
How about wrestling?

890
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,664
Or should we play catch?

891
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,751
Have you forgotten you broke a vase

892
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,628
and Mom kicked you out last time?

893
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,671
Right. I remember now.

894
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,967
Next time, come to my place.

895
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,428
There's nothing to break there.
You can play catch.

896
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,848
But your place smells bad.

897
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,183
Really?

898
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,646
Do I smell bad too?

899
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,317
No, you don't. But your place does.

900
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,194
Dad.

901
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:20,616
Wash your clothes and feet often,
and don't forget to air out the house.

902
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,201
Okay?

903
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,996
Okay.

904
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,706
My boy is all grown up.

905
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,922
I have to use the bathroom.

906
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,801
Okay. It must be all the water you drank.

907
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,731
I think I saw it somewhere around here
some time ago.

908
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,901
Where could it be?

909
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,486
Let's see here.

910
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,623
I found it.

911
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,751
That's mine.

912
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,964
You said you'd be home late.

913
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,967
Why would you go through my drawer?
Put that down.

914
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,219
I was just wondering…

915
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,055
You know, just in case.
It looks exactly the same.

916
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,933
Are you sure it's yours?

917
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,644
Nothing in this house belongs to you.

918
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,980
Is that right? Then I'm sorry.

919
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,658
Why aren't you coming out?

920
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,164
I have something to tell you.

921
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,919
I'm thinking of having a meal
with Cho-hui. Alone.

922
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,672
Is that okay?

923
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,635
-Are you out of your mind?
-Sorry, I thought I saw a mosquito.

924
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,429
-Hey!
-A fruit fly, maybe?

925
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,558
Hey!

926
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,642
I caught it.

927
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:14,897
What?

928
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,483
There really was one?

929
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,735
I want to join you two.

930
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,903
What?

931
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,156
The other day, Cho-hui said
we should all have a meal together.

932
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,450
That's…

933
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:30,078
Let's meet at Mozart tomorrow.

934
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,208
Sure, let's do that.

935
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,460
Gosh, that stings.

936
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,326
-Hello?
-Min-ju, is that you?

937
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,410
Grandma?

938
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:15,123
Yes, it's me.
I'm glad you answered my call.

939
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,960
What time is it there in America?

940
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,712
Here? It's 6 a.m.

941
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,258
Oh, no.
You must be so busy with your studies.

942
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:29,596
I'm so sorry I woke you up.

943
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,808
It's fine. Anyway, why did you call me?

944
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:38,814
I just missed you. That's why I called.

945
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,694
Your vacation starts soon.
Are you coming to Korea?

946
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,530
If you come to Gongjin,

947
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:52,119
I'll cook you any dish you want.

948
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:57,457
I'm going to California
for vacation with my friends.

949
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,459
But I'll try to visit you.

950
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,922
I see. Don't worry about me.

951
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,049
Do whatever suits you best.

952
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,012
Eat well and take care of yourself.

953
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,307
Okay. Bye.

954
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,948
Oh, that?

955
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,535
The implant will be angled
to fit inside the bone.

956
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,121
In that case,
an SCRP might reveal the hole.

957
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,123
That's why I asked for the cement type.

958
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,085
Yes.

959
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,879
Okay.

960
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,893
BORA SUPERMARKET

961
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,312
Someone won 1.4 billion won?

962
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,733
-Hello.
-Hi, Mi-seon.

963
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,527
-I'll take these.
-Sure.

964
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,321
One, two, three, four.

965
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,115
-Yun-gyeong.
-Yes?

966
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,535
Is it true? The third mystery of Gongjin?

967
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:21,458
Yes. Three years ago,
someone in Gongjin won the lottery.

968
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,002
The prize was
no less than 1.4 billion won.

969
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,296
That's incredible.

970
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,592
But how do you know
it was someone living in Gongjin?

971
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:34,554
A typhoon swept through
the entire city that week.

972
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,765
All the roads were blocked,

973
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,142
and some parts were completely flooded.

974
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,852
No outsiders could enter Gongjin.

975
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:45,399
I remember it clearly.
We were open for only two days that week.

976
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:50,612
I see. But don't you remember
who you sold the ticket to?

977
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,030
The thing is,

978
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,118
most neighbors bought
lottery tickets around that time.

979
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,371
Since the situation was so grave,
they wanted some kind of hope.

980
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,958
All we know is
one of Gongjin residents won the lottery.

981
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,085
But no one's life seems
to have gotten rich.

982
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,920
I'm dying to know myself.

983
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,345
Two five-thousand-won
lottery tickets, please.

984
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,306
Officer Choi.

985
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,851
Ms. Pyo. Did you just get off work?

986
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,103
Yes. What about you?

987
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,147
I'm still on duty. Get home safe.

988
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,483
Hold on. Take this.

989
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,902
I bought two. I'm giving you one.

990
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,113
What? No, I'm fine.

991
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,908
You can have it. Treat me if you win.

992
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
No. I'm really fine.

993
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,457
-Can't you just take it?
-What?

994
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,751
It's not like this is a bribe.

995
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:49,880
It's just a 5,000-won gift.
Why do you have to turn it down so coldly?

996
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,008
Throw it away if you want.

997
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,594
Wait…

998
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,067
-What are you up to?
-Can't you see? I'm washing the blankets.

999
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,570
-Oh, my.
-Hello.

1000
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,281
What brings you here?

1001
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,533
You forgot your wallet at the clinic.

1002
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:23,413
My goodness. What was I thinking?

1003
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,291
Thank you so much
for coming all the way here.

1004
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,376
Don't worry. I'll be going then.

1005
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,294
Okay.

1006
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,922
What's with you?

1007
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,552
-What's wrong?
-Grandma!

1008
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,429
Ms. Dentist wants to help out.

1009
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:43,391
Oh, my. That would be so great.

1010
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:48,063
Dr. Yoon, you're such a kind young lady.

1011
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,773
It's nothing.

1012
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,692
What are you waiting for? Go change.

1013
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,031
Do you have any clothes she can borrow?

1014
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,293
What do you think? Are they comfy?

1015
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:14,005
They're nice and airy.
They're the best work clothes.

1016
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,174
So? Do they fit you?

1017
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,300
Yes, they do.

1018
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,095
What are you doing?
Come here and get to work.

1019
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,014
What am I supposed to do?

1020
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,225
Just get in here and start stomping.

1021
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,061
You're as heavy as a sack of rice.
Put it to use.

1022
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,564
I'm not that heavy.

1023
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:40,031
By the way, why do you wash them this way
and not use a washing machine?

1024
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,034
Blankets are meant to be washed this way.

1025
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,287
It also relieves stress.

1026
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,874
If it's that good, you can do it alone.
Why drag me into it?

1027
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,750
It's too good to enjoy it alone.

1028
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,336
-I should share it with my friend.
-As if.

1029
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:59,009
I thought you'd throw a fit.
But you're pretty calm today.

1030
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:02,012
Have you decided to be friends with me?

1031
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,388
Whatever.

1032
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,558
You're making the water dirty.

1033
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,935
No. You're the one making it dirty.

1034
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,147
That's ridiculous.
The ground is tilted and everything.

1035
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,858
Yes, that's why the dirt flows
toward me from you.

1036
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,444
When did you last wash your feet?
Gosh, Chief Hong.

1037
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,487
The fact that you imagine that--

1038
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,364
Be quiet and stomp harder.

1039
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,616
Hey, that hurts.

1040
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,473
What are you doing?

1041
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,769
Wait a second.
I just remembered something weird.

1042
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,438
Don't you think this situation
could look weirder?

1043
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,231
-Sorry.
-Gosh.

1044
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,317
Are you a rhino or what?

1045
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,569
I thought I was being rammed by a mammoth.

1046
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,695
What?

1047
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,324
Please keep in mind
that your body can be a deadly weapon.

1048
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,285
Watch it. Be careful what you say.

1049
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,203
I will.

1050
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,997
Keep in mind that your body can--

1051
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,499
Stop it.

1052
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,583
It's a weapon.

1053
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,173
-Are you dancing?
-This is what you're supposed to do.

1054
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,926
-Stop splashing me.
-Watch and learn.

1055
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,888
It's more fun this way. Stomp harder.

1056
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,237
Love and passion to you.

1057
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,574
I love you…

1058
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,044
ZONE CHIEF YEO

1059
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,591
He's not picking up?

1060
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:07,220
No. He never shows up on time.

1061
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,638
It drives me crazy.

1062
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,974
I hope nothing bad happened.

1063
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,143
I don't think so. I'm sure he'll come.

1064
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,060
Okay.

1065
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,604
Let's look at the menu.

1066
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:23,236
"Seafood tomato pasta,
chicken cream risotto,

1067
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,197
lasagne, carbonara, vongole,

1068
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,866
aglio e olio"?

1069
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,680
Are you okay?

1070
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,682
I didn't mean to step on your foot. Sorry.

1071
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,726
Sorbang, sorbang

1072
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:55,935
What's that?

1073
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,520
Sorry, sorry, bang, bang.

1074
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,024
-You're so behind the times?
-Be careful.

1075
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,664
Keep twisting it. Keep going.

1076
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,552
This goes here. Stretch it.

1077
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,304
-Pull that side.
-Okay.

1078
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,906
They've been damp all summer.

1079
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,076
Take these too.

1080
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,579
Well, but… All of them?

1081
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,373
-Wash these too.
-I'm going home.

1082
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,792
Okay. Hold on.

1083
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,510
What's that?

1084
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,720
Good work.

1085
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,389
Have a little snack first.

1086
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,100
-Thanks, Ms. Gam-ri.
-Thank you. It looks tasty.

1087
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,065
-It's so good.
-It is?

1088
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,025
Labor is a good thing.

1089
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,445
It makes a person nice and simple.

1090
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,612
Right?

1091
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,072
Hye-jin.

1092
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,617
-Seong-hyeon!
-Chief Hong is here too?

1093
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,952
You want some corn?

1094
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,038
No, thanks.
Hye-jin, what are you doing here?

1095
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:44,002
Well, Ms. Kim is a patient at my clinic.

1096
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,422
So I was helping her with her laundry.
I look ridiculous, don't I?

1097
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,884
-Hey, look at you.
-Hi.

1098
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,470
I haven't seen you in a few days.

1099
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,139
Wait. Did you miss me?

1100
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,474
I didn't say that.

1101
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,143
What's going on here?

1102
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,314
Why are you being all coy with him?
When did you get so close?

1103
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,649
We're not close. Don't be silly.

1104
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,904
Ms. Kim, I brought a cake.

1105
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,406
It's from a super famous bakery.

1106
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,407
Here.

1107
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,453
Why do you keep bringing these things?

1108
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,747
Did you have dinner?

1109
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,375
No. I'm on my way to dinner with a friend.

1110
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,463
Should I tell him to come in and say hi?

1111
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,840
-Sure.
-All right.

1112
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,217
JUNE, come in!

1113
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,097
Hello.

1114
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,651
Who's that young man?

1115
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:53,780
Do you remember the band
from the Lighthouse Song Festival?

1116
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,823
JUNE is a member of that band.

1117
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,283
I see.

1118
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:02,705
Goodness, you're skinny as a needle.

1119
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,582
That's no good.

1120
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:09,003
I know. It's because he's been
only eating salads lately to lose weight.

1121
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,840
You can't live on just salad.

1122
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,425
Have dinner with us.

1123
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,885
Can we do that?

1124
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,721
You must be tired
after coming here from Seoul.

1125
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,890
Take it easy while I prepare dinner.

1126
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,018
Goodness. What should I make?

1127
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,186
Thank you.

1128
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,648
-What?
-You said we were having something nice.

1129
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,525
Hey, you'll be amazed.

1130
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,610
You can't find anything like it in Seoul.

1131
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,822
-This was your plan all along, wasn't it?
-Come on, Chief Hong.

1132
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,492
Guys, you know who JUNE is, right?

1133
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,743
Please come back

1134
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,787
-Just a feeling
-You're good.

1135
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,790
I've seen so many pictures of you,
I feel like I know you.

1136
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,375
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

1137
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,753
Do you remember me?

1138
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,130
-Yes.
-What?

1139
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,716
You're the dentist who treated me, right?

1140
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,552
Yes, that's me. It's been a while.

1141
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,679
-What a small world.
-I know.

1142
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,139
You two know each other?

1143
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,349
What a tiny world.

1144
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,185
I've never seen her light up like that.

1145
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,317
Hye-jin. Is it true
that DOS will be shooting here?

1146
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,193
Is JUNE really coming here? Is he?

1147
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,699
By the way, JUNE…

1148
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,200
Yes?

1149
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,829
Oh, my gosh.

1150
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,415
-Dad!
-Gosh, you startled me.

1151
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,334
You ruined my heart.

1152
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,587
Dad, pinch me. Right now.

1153
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,380
-You want me to pinch you?
-Yes.

1154
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,423
Okay.

1155
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,262
I'm not dreaming? This is real.

1156
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,015
This is real! What should I do?

1157
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:50,104
God, what's with her?
I feel like I don't know her anymore.

1158
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,734
It's not much, but help yourselves.

1159
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,611
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1160
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:57,737
Ms. Kim, have a seat.

1161
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,614
Yes, eat with us.

1162
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,157
Okay. Gosh.

1163
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,576
-You must be hungry. Dig in.
-Okay.

1164
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,002
-This is fantastic.
-What?

1165
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,588
It's the best doenjang jjigae
I've ever tried.

1166
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:20,385
It's made with soybean paste
I made from scratch.

1167
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,844
It tastes incredible.

1168
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,015
I haven't had
a home-cooked meal in a while.

1169
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:30,103
It's nothing like the delivery food
you have in Seoul, right?

1170
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,188
-I totally agree.
-That's right.

1171
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,816
You must be too busy to have proper meals.

1172
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:40,613
Right. Ms. Kim,
this guy has been working nonstop

1173
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,448
since he was very young.

1174
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,077
You're still so young,
and you work so much?

1175
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,830
Try this.

1176
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,082
Here.

1177
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,168
-Try it.
-Thank you.

1178
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,503
What about me?

1179
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,088
You're a grown-up.

1180
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,465
Eat on your own.

1181
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,552
Fine. Here you go.

1182
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,932
I make it look tastier, don't I?

1183
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:12,937
See? It tastes even better
when you give it to me.

1184
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,357
Try some pollack too.

1185
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,986
-It's been simmered in sauce.
-Okay.

1186
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,779
-Eat up.
-Hye-jin, is JUNE really--

1187
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:22,697
What?

1188
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,202
How does it feel to see him in person?

1189
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:32,206
All the walls in her room are covered
with pictures of you.

1190
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,960
Is she the fan you told me about earlier?

1191
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,545
-Yes.
-You know her?

1192
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,464
-I know her very well.
-What?

1193
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,175
You're Oh Ju-ri, 14 years old, right?

1194
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,218
Yes, that's… right.

1195
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,597
Did you eat something?

1196
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,098
-Why the hiccups?
-It's just…

1197
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,099
-Are you okay?
-What?

1198
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,893
-Drink some water.
-Thank you.

1199
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,939
-Oh, my.
-Ju-ri, what's with you?

1200
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,151
You're not helping her hiccups go away.

1201
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,069
Drink slowly.

1202
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,821
-Drink this.
-Hey!

1203
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,784
-Did it stop?
-No, it didn't.

1204
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,077
My goodness.

1205
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,245
She's so cute.

1206
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,872
Ju-ri, are you okay?

1207
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,503
Goodness.

1208
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,964
I didn't realize how late it was.

1209
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,759
Cho-hui must've been waiting long.

1210
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,678
What?

1211
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,306
A thief in this situation?

1212
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,766
-He must be asleep.
-Gosh.

1213
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,560
Darn, my eyes.

1214
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,939
Are you nuts? Why are you lying there for?

1215
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,732
It's a long story.

1216
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,276
Anyway, where's Cho-hui?

1217
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,528
Yeong-guk.

1218
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,197
Cho-hui.

1219
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:51,369
I sprained my back and can't move.

1220
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,873
What? Stay away.

1221
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,168
Stay away.

1222
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,211
Much better.

1223
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,215
-Cho-hui, will you help me?
-Okay.

1224
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,341
Don't come closer!

1225
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,969
I'm fine. I'd rather be found as a mummy.

1226
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:11,806
-I'll grab his arms. You grab his legs.
-Okay. Are you okay?

1227
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,433
I'm fine. Please stay away.

1228
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,477
-Lift him on three. One, two,
-Okay.

1229
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,271
-three!
-Just don't!

1230
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,401
Well? Should I dress you?
Should I take you to the hospital?

1231
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,488
Forget it. I can take care of myself.
You can leave.

1232
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,409
Cho-hui, I'm sorry
that you had to see me like this.

1233
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,577
Don't worry.

1234
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,079
Should I go get some pain-relief patches?

1235
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,456
No, I'm fine. Oh, right.

1236
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,418
You'll find a first-aid kit
in one of the TV stand drawers.

1237
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:41,919
I'll go look for it.

1238
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,385
Hwa-jeong, will you pass me
that hairspray?

1239
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,762
What do you need it for?

1240
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,393
Gosh! Stop spraying me!

1241
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,813
I-jun said my place smells weird.

1242
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,232
-And Cho-hui's here now.
-Unbelievable.

1243
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,651
Can't you try to be nice?

1244
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,195
Yeong-guk, there's no pain-relief patch,

1245
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,448
but I found a muscle relaxant. Take this.

1246
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,658
Cho-hui, will you get me up?

1247
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:15,620
Easy now.

1248
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,372
There you go. Oh, my.

1249
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,592
I-jun takes after you.

1250
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:35,056
That's news to me.
I think he looks just like Yeong-guk.

1251
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,849
I mean his personality.

1252
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:42,104
He's smart and thoughtful.
He helps out his friends a lot.

1253
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,816
Just like you helped me out
back in the day.

1254
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,654
That was a long time ago.

1255
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,282
But I still remember it clearly.

1256
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,703
Those were the happiest days in my life.

1257
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,208
I…

1258
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:07,505
want us to go back
to the way we used to be.

1259
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,131
What?

1260
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,343
The three of us, hanging out together.

1261
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,977
-I'm so full.
-Are you okay now?

1262
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,020
What? Well, yes.

1263
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,775
Hey, are you really the Ju-ri I know?

1264
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:31,779
I don't know what you're talking about.
What did I do?

1265
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,740
You're scaring me.
Stop speaking so politely.

1266
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:40,705
Ms. Kim, thank you for the food.
I really enjoyed it.

1267
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,624
I'm glad to hear that.

1268
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,961
But you're too skinny.

1269
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:50,047
-You need to put on some weight.
-I will.

1270
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,758
Ms. Gam-ri, start a restaurant.
It's not too late.

1271
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:57,304
If you keep being silly,
I'll kick you out.

1272
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,265
All right, guys.

1273
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,518
I'll do the dishes
in return for the delicious food.

1274
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,270
I'll help you, Seong-hyeon.

1275
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,648
No, you have back problems.
And you washed blankets today.

1276
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,775
-It's okay.
-She has back problems?

1277
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,737
Yes. She got a herniated disc
after a car accident.

1278
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,405
Back in high school, right?

1279
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,616
You remember everything.
How is that possible?

1280
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,160
Of course.

1281
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,872
You guys can take it easy.
Leave everything to me.

1282
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,832
-No.
-I'll help you.

1283
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,584
Well, if you insist.

1284
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,086
-Gosh.
-Come on.

1285
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:35,176
You're practically washing
all the dishes I have.

1286
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:40,222
There are so many to wash. I feel bad.

1287
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:44,268
Don't worry. It won't take long.
I'm very good at this.

1288
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,145
That's a relief.

1289
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,856
I even brought a friend along today.

1290
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,276
Thank you for the delicious food again.

1291
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:57,281
Don't mention it.
It's just the food I eat every day.

1292
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,700
I thought it was quite a feast.

1293
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:00,701
What?

1294
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:06,165
I can't remember the last time

1295
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,709
I had to take out so many spoons.

1296
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:13,172
I'm sure the spoons were happy
to be used for the first time in a while.

1297
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,175
I had a great time, Ms. Kim.

1298
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,635
What?

1299
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,180
I enjoy hanging out with people

1300
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:24,892
more than anything else.

1301
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,188
Eating, laughing, and talking together.

1302
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,316
That's all there's to life, isn't it?

1303
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,444
I guess so.

1304
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,797
Good morning.

1305
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,882
-Chief Hong, is that you?
-Yes.

1306
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,551
It's very hot this morning.

1307
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,640
CHUNG-HO MILK

1308
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,230
Ms. Gam-ri!

1309
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,190
What?

1310
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,025
Hey.

1311
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,115
This is tasty.

1312
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:25,703
Thanks to you,
I get to drink milk for free.

1313
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,165
Drink as much as you want.

1314
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,250
It's good for your bones.

1315
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,421
Can you bring me chocolate milk tomorrow?

1316
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,549
I can't. Do you like going to the dentist?

1317
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:44,013
I need you to bring
that director guy to me today.

1318
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,472
What?

1319
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,100
Tell him he can borrow my house.

1320
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,271
Are you sure? Is that really okay?

1321
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,230
Yes.

1322
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:59,737
I've been living in this house
for 50 years now.

1323
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,656
I gave births in this house,

1324
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:07,453
and all my children are
now grown up and married.

1325
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,581
I'm left alone in this empty house.

1326
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,500
If I let people have fun here,

1327
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,670
the house will feel less lonely. Right?

1328
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,381
You didn't feel lonely yesterday, did you?

1329
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,676
Stop teasing this old lady.

1330
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,137
I'll tell him today.

1331
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,348
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

1332
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,226
Goodness.

1333
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,581
If you're up, open the front door.

1334
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,478
Seong-hyeon.

1335
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:17,273
Are you up? I hope I didn't wake you up.

1336
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,359
No, you didn't. But what's this?

1337
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,112
Did you drop by?

1338
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,990
I promised to treat you to something nice.

1339
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:30,035
But since you must want to rest at home,
I delivered it to your door.

1340
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,497
There aren't any brunch places
around here.

1341
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,999
Did you travel a long way?

1342
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,793
Don't worry. I'm not that busy yet.

1343
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:41,630
But let's have a proper meal soon.

1344
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,467
Okay. Let me treat you then.

1345
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,594
I'll have a five-course meal at least.

1346
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:50,681
A meal that takes forever
and leaves you stuffed.

1347
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:51,974
Sure.

1348
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:56,103
My clinic is doing well these days.
So let me treat you.

1349
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,692
I'm relieved.

1350
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,360
What?

1351
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,363
I sometimes wondered

1352
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,366
if you were still running around
in a hurry all the time

1353
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,536
and if you were sleeping and eating well.

1354
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:17,333
The 20-year-old Yoon Hye-jin I knew
was always busy and stressed.

1355
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:21,920
But you don't seem to be
like that anymore. I'm glad.

1356
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,133
I'm relieved, Hye-jin.

1357
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:31,096
The call is busy…

1358
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,600
She's still on the phone?
Should I pick up breakfast or not?

1359
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,101
Ms. Pyo.

1360
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,313
Hello.

1361
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,522
Did you take a bath?

1362
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,400
Yes. See you around.

1363
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,777
Hold on.

1364
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,404
Please, wait here for a second.

1365
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:50,616
No, I… Officer Choi!

1366
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:54,870
Gosh. I don't have any makeup on.

1367
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:57,790
I look so unkempt right now.

1368
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,966
-Take this.
-What?

1369
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,345
It's rotisserie chicken.
You said you like it.

1370
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,681
Thank you.

1371
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,809
But why are you giving me this?

1372
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,852
With the lottery ticket you gave me,

1373
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,105
I won 5,000 won.

1374
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,608
Enjoy then.

1375
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,616
But this is more expensive.

1376
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,077
This costs 7,000 won.

1377
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:41,792
You're not allowed to change
the way the house looks.

1378
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,837
-I wasn't planning to.
-Even inside.

1379
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,257
Ask Ms. Gam-ri's permission
before making even the slightest change.

1380
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,592
The moment you change anything,

1381
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,096
you're forced to return the house to her.
Add that in the contract.

1382
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,432
Sure, no problem.

1383
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:01,687
Also, it's your responsibility
to restore any damages found afterwards.

1384
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,314
Add that as a special clause.

1385
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,732
-Deal.
-Write it down.

1386
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,904
-Make sure to pay her enough.
-Of course.

1387
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,615
I know it's none of my business,

1388
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,619
but is it okay to say yes to everything?
Shouldn't you be more meticulous?

1389
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,372
Chief Hong, do you like baseball?

1390
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:24,084
Not really, but I know the rules.

1391
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,504
They say baseball is a pitchers' game.

1392
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,841
Good pitchers don't always
throw the ball as hard as they can.

1393
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:35,554
Sometimes, they save their energy
and control their power

1394
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:38,348
so that they can throw at full speed
at a crucial moment.

1395
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,142
I'm the same.

1396
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:41,852
I don't sweat the small stuff.

1397
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:43,896
So you're saying you're a good director.

1398
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,564
You're unbelievable.

1399
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,524
Is that how it sounds?

1400
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,780
There's something I want to know.

1401
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:54,740
Okay.

1402
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,494
Is Hye-jin seeing anyone?

1403
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,047
I can't believe him.

1404
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:14,426
How am I going to eat all this?

1405
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,271
Is she seeing anyone or not?

1406
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,982
I don't think she is.

1407
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:33,237
That's good.

1408
01:15:58,595 --> 01:15:59,721
Hey.

1409
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,351
Du-sik.

1410
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:06,186
Chief Hong.

1411
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,773
What are you doing here?

1412
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,234
Are you asleep?

1413
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:16,655
So you can't hold your liquor after all.

1414
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:26,790
Chief Hong, if you sleep here,
you'll get facial nerve paralysis.

1415
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:28,750
Do you know what that is?

1416
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,086
Did you watch the show, Hur Jun?

1417
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,589
If you did, you'd know.

1418
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:39,303
Gosh, what do I do?
I have to work tomorrow.

1419
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:42,931
Chief Hong.

1420
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,269
Facial paralysis means
your face will get twisted.

1421
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,320
Hey. You opened your eyes.

1422
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,746
Why are you looking at me like that?

1423
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,960
Hold on. I know that look in your eyes.

1424
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:17,549
It means you want to cry.

1425
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,305
Are you crying?

1426
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:25,557
Don't cry.

1427
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,813
Do you cry when you're drunk?

1428
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,816
It's dangerous to sleep outside.

1429
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,778
Let me get you up on three.

1430
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:41,615
Here we go. One, two, three.

1431
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,617
Gosh.

1432
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,246
Don't go.

1433
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,714
Don't…

1434
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,759
leave me behind.

1435
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:09,559
Don't go…

1436
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:13,522
I won't.

1437
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:17,943
I'm not going anywhere.

1438
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,613
Don't worry, Chief Hong.

1439
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,660
I'm not going anywhere.

1440
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,088
Guys aren't nice for just any girl.

1441
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,300
Being kind is just
a part of Seong-hyeon's nature.

1442
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:25,469
For three seconds,
shout at the top of your lungs!

1443
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:27,679
Down on the board!

1444
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:30,932
-This looks so good.
-Excuse me.

1445
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,642
Are you Yoon Hye-jin, the dental major?

1446
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,644
I'm Ji Seong-hyeon.

1447
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:38,482
I'm just asking
because it's all in the past now.

1448
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,442
-Is Chief Hong a good kisser?
-Are you nuts?

1449
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:53,705
