1
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,017
Chief Hong.

2
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,226
Yes?

3
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,520
About…

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,315
that night…

5
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,152
Are you sure nothing happened?

6
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,948
Yes. Nothing happened.

7
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,576
Really?

8
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,537
Yes.

9
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,757
I have somewhere to be, so I'll get going.

10
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,422
Hye-jin, you're losing it.

11
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,760
Why don't you have the lights on?

12
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,973
What? Hey.

13
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,355
Is anything the matter?

14
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,482
What's wrong?

15
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,195
What is it?

16
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,576
A kiss?

17
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:44,622
Is that why you looked like
your whole world had burned down?

18
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,291
I thought the clinic was done for.

19
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,502
Hey, don't jinx us.
Take it back and knock on wood.

20
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,171
There.

21
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,423
I understand the power of liquid courage,

22
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,758
but you're not one to instigate a kiss.

23
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,385
I must not have been myself.

24
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,930
Have I been out of the dating game
for too long?

25
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,974
No, I should cut back on drinking.

26
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,142
What did he say?

27
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,351
Don't ask.

28
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,147
He obviously remembers
but is playing dumb.

29
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,775
I get it now.
That's why you're feeling so down.

30
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,985
Hardly!

31
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,530
As if. I can see right through you.

32
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,742
I'm only asking out of pure curiosity,

33
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,161
-but what do you think of Chief Hong?
-What?

34
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:27,582
I mean, it's been a while since I saw you
bothered by a guy like this.

35
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,251
If you have feelings for him…

36
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,795
-This is bad.
-What?

37
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,215
The fact that
I'm getting this nonsense from you

38
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,134
proves the fault in my actions.

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,679
I've been letting myself
get too comfortable here.

40
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,015
There's no need to go that far.

41
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,683
This won't ever happen again.

42
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,146
From now on,
I won't ever get involved with Chief Hong.

43
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,274
-Is that so?
-Never.

44
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,086
KISS

45
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,841
A FIRST KISS TASTES LIKE MUD,
SUNLIGHT, AND ROSES.

46
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,011
An iced latte with lots of ice and syrup.

47
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,852
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

48
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,526
Hey, good morning.

49
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,781
-Where's Mr. Oh?
-He's on his way.

50
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,325
A latte for Ms. Pyo
and an iced Americano for you, right?

51
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,410
The new beans
that came in are to die for--

52
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,369
I want something else.

53
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,788
Sure. Take your time then.

54
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,458
You were worried you'd have a cold.
Are you feeling okay?

55
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,795
What's it to you?
I can take care of myself.

56
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,421
I'm just worried, that's all.

57
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,048
Why would you worry about me?

58
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,008
Am I not allowed to worry anymore?

59
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,428
I get that being nosy is incurable,

60
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,764
but I'd appreciate less of your concern.

61
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,891
It's uncomfortable and annoying.

62
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,144
Ms. Dentist,
that really hurts my feelings--

63
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,106
I don't care if it's only a pop quiz!

64
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,525
What's with this grade?

65
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:45,279
This is all because you only think about
that no-good boy band.

66
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,282
Yell at me all you want,
but don't badmouth my sacred DOS.

67
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,700
What's with you?

68
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,871
What? If you care about me
half as much as you do for them,

69
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,790
you'd never get a grade like this!

70
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,708
How about a quarter of a quarter?

71
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,879
-Twenty points? Ju-ri.
-Give it here. It's mine!

72
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:02,964
You saw that, right?

73
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,383
-She's driving me crazy.
-That hurts!

74
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,927
-You. Sit right here.
-Why?

75
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,138
Can you two please talk to her?

76
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,306
Tell her how crucial school grades are--

77
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,683
As if they're important.

78
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,269
What she wants to do with her life counts.

79
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,562
You prick.

80
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,981
Nothing matters more to a student.

81
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,108
It's good to have dreams,

82
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,694
but in most cases,

83
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,156
you need a college degree to achieve it.
That's how it works in Korea.

84
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,702
Dr. Yoon, I can't believe
we're on the same page!

85
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,162
Ju-ri, you heard her.

86
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,664
I need to go to work, so may I order?

87
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,708
Gosh, silly me. What can I get you?

88
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,711
An iced Americano
and an iced latte, please.

89
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,547
-Du-sik, did you get that?
-Could you make it yourself?

90
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,465
Me?

91
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,843
Should I?

92
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,595
Sure. Why not?

93
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,097
Then…

94
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,600
-His coffee sucks.
-I wonder if she'll like it.

95
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,561
-I'll get going then.
-Sure thing. Thanks for today!

96
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,355
Ju-ri, listen to her.

97
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,984
-Look at that. Don't wander off.
-Dad…

98
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,575
So she remembers.

99
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,706
My coffee is much better now,

100
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,291
you'll be pleasantly surprised.

101
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,753
Dad, I want braces.

102
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,838
Don't start.

103
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,465
Then I'll study harder.

104
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,841
-I promise.
-Don't study.

105
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,676
My score will go from 20 to 200.

106
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,262
I told you, that's not going to happen.

107
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,973
Hye-jin, check this out.

108
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,767
Will you really address me like that?

109
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,479
-I saw it.
-Doesn't my snaggletooth need correcting?

110
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,980
-Right?
-I already said no!

111
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:43,898
Why not?

112
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,567
The snaggletooth makes you look cute.

113
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,486
It adds to your charm.

114
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,821
Without it, you'd be a plain Jane.

115
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,366
As if. You only say that
because it costs a lot.

116
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,117
Hye-jin, take a look.

117
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,120
Please give me your professional opinion.

118
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,497
Okay.

119
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,042
Snaggleteeth are corrected

120
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,671
when they trap bits of food
or when they are at risk for cavities.

121
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,507
But yours are adequately aligned

122
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,175
and has been kept clean.

123
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,971
If it's just to beautify yourself,
I don't recommend it.

124
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,264
Gosh.

125
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,765
And I thought you were cool.

126
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,017
You're of no help. Out of my way!

127
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,852
Dr. Yoon, that was unexpected.

128
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,688
I'm so grateful.

129
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,941
I absolutely love
everything you said today.

130
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,902
You know what?
You coffee will be on the house today.

131
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,489
Let me get some ice. My gosh.

132
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,955
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

133
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,249
According to the X-ray, it's all good.

134
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,837
Just like I said last time,

135
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,424
it seems the pain is coming from
the muscle above your molars.

136
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,675
Is that all right?

137
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,261
Of course. I'll prescribe you
a muscle relaxant

138
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,930
as well as something
for the pain and inflammation.

139
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,308
Stay medicated for a week

140
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,560
and try to refrain
from eating anything chewy.

141
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,477
I will.

142
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,982
I'm glad I rented
the office space out to you.

143
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,570
This is all because Chief Hong
gave you my slippers to wear.

144
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,698
I'm guessing it was meant to be.

145
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,700
I see.

146
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,163
Please come back
if the pain doesn't subside after a week.

147
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,498
-It should get better by then. Thank you.
-Sure.

148
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,499
I'll get going now.

149
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,501
-Have a good day.
-Take care.

150
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,922
My gosh. A flower is going to bloom.

151
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,342
What is this plant called?

152
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,761
I'm not sure what it is.

153
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,678
It's a fortune plant.

154
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,139
-Is this a fortune plant?
-Yes.

155
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,391
Water it though, will you?
The leaves are dry.

156
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,977
Why do you have a plant
you don't know the name of?

157
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,479
That's none of your business.

158
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,356
Why are you here?

159
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,232
You take walk-ins too, don't you?

160
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,415
-I'm tilting your chair down.
-You sound like a real doctor.

161
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,628
Sir, you're at a dental clinic.
Let's keep it professional.

162
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,088
Even more so.

163
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,301
I see that you're here for a checkup.

164
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,929
Yes. I heard I should have
my teeth checked regularly.

165
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,263
I'll take a look then.

166
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,738
Wait. I hate it when my face is covered,
so go ahead without it.

167
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,451
The lights are bright,
so at least close your eyes.

168
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,913
Is it good now?

169
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,918
Please open up.

170
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,422
Now, bite down.

171
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,425
And open.

172
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,510
Please bite down again.

173
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,390
Your teeth are in good shape.

174
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,475
Has anything been troubling you?

175
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,352
-Yes.
-Do tell.

176
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,437
Our relationship.

177
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,317
Is it because of that kiss?

178
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,991
See? You're coughing now.

179
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,452
This is exactly why I played dumb.

180
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,953
-What?
-Just look at you.

181
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,123
Because of a drunken mistake,
things are now awkward between us.

182
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,084
People think that it's a big deal
only in Korea.

183
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,669
It's not in other countries.

184
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,838
On the other side of the globe,

185
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,675
Jean and Chloe are probably
rubbing their cheeks and saying "bonjour".

186
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,305
Besides, for two people of
the opposite sex to become good friends,

187
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,099
we must be able
to move past a biological crisis.

188
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:52,229
Which means we've been given a chance
to actually become true friends.

189
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,983
Don't you need me?

190
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,487
Your teeth and gums are in good condition.

191
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,824
You'll be glad to know that your mouth
is free from a biological crisis.

192
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,285
Ms. Pyo, please be thorough when scaling.

193
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,203
-Sure.
-Wait.

194
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,330
Just like that? I thought it was all good.

195
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:13,000
You should still receive scaling
at least once a year.

196
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:19,006
Then can you please make sure
it doesn't hurt?

197
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,674
-Please lie down.
-Sure.

198
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,263
-Lie down, please.
-Why didn't you lift this?

199
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,440
Why can I taste
the disinfectant in the wind?

200
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,736
I hope that resolves
any tension between us.

201
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,698
Hello?

202
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,659
Yes, this is he.

203
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,422
Seriously.
That isn't a brick in front of you.

204
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,967
Can't you enjoy it
so that I can enjoy mine too?

205
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,635
It's good.

206
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,012
So how did it go?

207
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,890
Did you talk it out with Chief Hong?

208
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,892
I purposely gave you some space.

209
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,145
He acted like it was no big deal
and suggested we be friends.

210
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,272
I see.

211
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,823
And he must've meant it.

212
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,870
What's this?

213
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,330
-Is that Chief Hong?
-Yes.

214
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,790
Is that a guy or a girl?

215
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,749
A girl, of course.

216
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,136
That prick.

217
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,722
Chief Hong is walking
with a woman along Gongjin Harbor.

218
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,723
She's pretty.

219
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,022
They're now on the beach.

220
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,903
Judging by their body language,

221
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:08,782
I'm guessing they're not
exactly lovey-dovey yet.

222
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,951
-The peninsula?
-The Korean Peninsula Waterway.

223
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,244
If you see it upside down?

224
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,204
-It's a famous spot here.
-I see.

225
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,797
Reporting from the observatory.

226
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,091
Anyone can tell that they have chemistry.

227
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,552
Dr. Yoon must not be on his mind.

228
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,354
Gosh. Them and their gossip.

229
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,690
Jeez. I'm sick of it all.

230
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,265
What the hell?

231
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,894
-How long have you been here?
-For five minutes.

232
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,270
I see.

233
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,732
This is an official notice from OVN.

234
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,109
Could you take a look?

235
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,193
Right.

236
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:32,658
What are they planning to do
after the singing contest?

237
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,204
I have no clue.

238
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,747
Anyway, I'll get back to work.

239
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:41,959
Mr. Ban.

240
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,711
Yes?

241
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,796
What do you think it means

242
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,882
when a person still keeps a gift
that was given 15 years ago?

243
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,677
Either they love the gift
or it's that sturdy.

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,137
No, not like that.

245
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,597
I mean,

246
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,268
doesn't it indicate a deeper meaning?

247
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,272
Could it mean that the gift-giver
holds a place in their heart?

248
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,024
Why does he even ask?

249
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,195
Seems to currently be heading
to Hwajeong Raw Fish Restaurant.

250
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,698
Reporter Yeo, we expect an update.

251
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,872
Why is my ear itching all day?

252
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,459
-Thief!
-Ma'am…

253
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,127
-No, I'm not a thief.
-As if.

254
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,296
-Ma'am, that's not it.
-Ms. Gam-ri, what is it?

255
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,922
How are you not a thief?

256
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,967
-My gosh.
-Gosh. He's a damn thief.

257
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,470
Ma'am, you got the wrong idea.

258
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,347
-What?
-Gosh, that hurts.

259
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,891
-You?
-You?

260
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,228
What?

261
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,607
What's that?

262
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,029
Housebreaking for you,
and assault for you.

263
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,573
In the eyes of a third party,
you're both at fault.

264
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,367
But since you took a hefty beating,

265
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,580
Ms. Gam-ri is offering you
this meal as an apology.

266
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,624
-Are you good with that?
-Of course.

267
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,459
I caused the misunderstanding,

268
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,170
so I'm grateful
for this meal you prepared.

269
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,800
Get to the chatting later and dig in.

270
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,426
-Sure.
-I'll enjoy this.

271
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:20,849
From what Du-sik tells me, you film…

272
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,976
-What was it again?
-Mukbang shows.

273
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,937
-What?
-Mukbang shows.

274
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,106
So that's what you do?

275
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,816
Yes, something like that.

276
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,942
Not that famous though.

277
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,653
Right, I see.

278
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,281
-I hope I didn't hurt you badly.
-I'm all right.

279
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,868
It's what you get
for surprising me like that.

280
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,538
You entered someone's house unannounced

281
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,790
and stood there like some thief.

282
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,126
So I hit you out of fear.

283
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,753
I'm sorry about that.
I couldn't help myself

284
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,631
when I saw this beautiful house.

285
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,927
What do you mean, beautiful? It's just
an old house that an old woman lives in.

286
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,929
Really. I mean it.

287
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,849
It's the kind of house
I've been picturing.

288
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,517
Humble and welcoming.

289
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,436
If I had a grandma in the countryside,

290
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,647
she'd live at a place like this.

291
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,861
Goodness. You and your kind words.

292
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,154
Try this too.

293
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,031
She serves the best food in Gongjin.

294
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,408
Goodness.

295
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,076
How is it?

296
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,830
It's absolutely delicious.

297
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,418
Eat up. You must need more rice.

298
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,837
-I'll get you some more.
-Sure.

299
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,218
Why are you getting food
all over the place?

300
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,721
I'm the clumsy type, you see.

301
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,764
Hold on.

302
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,392
Where is it? Here it is.

303
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,188
-What? What's that?
-There.

304
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,485
This is nice. It'll keep me clean and dry.

305
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,156
-Please enjoy.
-You too.

306
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,201
So you booked a place to stay?

307
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,328
Yes. Parang Guesthouse.

308
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,456
Parang Guesthouse? Right.
That's on the way to…

309
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,916
Well, you wouldn't know.

310
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,212
Listen carefully. From the intersection,

311
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,963
-take a right.
-A right.

312
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,840
-Then walk ten steps.
-Ten steps.

313
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,635
-On the left is a real estate agency.
-A real estate agency.

314
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,011
Ask for directions there.

315
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,931
-What?
-You won't remember my directions.

316
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,311
Got it. Anyway,
thank you for today as well.

317
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,731
Don't mention it. I got to go now.
Get there safely.

318
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,566
-Sure thing. Bye.
-Bye.

319
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,242
He sure is a pure soul.

320
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,760
To the right!

321
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,637
The right…

322
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,139
Whatever. I didn't see that.

323
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,313
I'll be late tonight,
so have dinner without me.

324
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,941
I was offered a free skin care treatment.

325
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,444
All right. I'll see you later, Snow White.

326
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:25,659
That reminds me. Your friend took
his new friend to the observatory earlier.

327
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,828
Too much information isn't appreciated.

328
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,333
What the hell am I going to eat?

329
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,669
I hate everything in this small town,

330
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,963
but especially the lack of delivery food.

331
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,632
Damn it.

332
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,594
-My gosh!
-My gosh.

333
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,471
Who's there?

334
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:55,230
Chun-jae, you didn't have
to wait for me outside, you know.

335
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,273
-Du-sik.
-Yes?

336
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,984
What am I going to do? I can't find Ju-ri.

337
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,652
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

338
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,947
It's not like that. The money's gone too.

339
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,991
-What?
-What do I do?

340
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,868
This is driving me nuts.

341
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,496
You haven't seen her?

342
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,044
Got it. Please call us
if you happen to see her.

343
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,879
All right. Thanks.

344
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,549
I locked the safe
after realizing some bills were missing,

345
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,301
but she took the entire thing.

346
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,596
How did she manage to carry it?

347
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,765
I should call the police.

348
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,433
-No.
-I should hurry.

349
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,976
No need for that.

350
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,396
I'm sure she's still somewhere in Gongjin.

351
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,908
You're not here to ask an English question

352
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,452
but to have a free meal.

353
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,538
Hye-jin, can I have the neck?

354
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,332
Go ahead.

355
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,629
-Did you starve today?
-Yes, I had my reasons.

356
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,633
-Slow down.
-Can I have some water?

357
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,642
What the hell is this? Damn, my toes.

358
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,811
-What's in here?
-It's nothing!

359
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,312
-Don't.
-Let me see.

360
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,814
My gosh.

361
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,191
Is this a safe? Did you steal this?

362
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,277
How can it be stealing
when it's from my dad's shop?

363
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,904
That's still stealing.

364
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,948
I said it's my dad's.

365
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,700
Did you run away from home?

366
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,383
Why are you here?

367
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,510
It's not you I'm here to see.

368
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,096
Is Ju-ri here by any chance?

369
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,099
-Wh… What?
-You're stuttering.

370
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,727
Excuse me for a bit.

371
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,229
-But--
-Oh Ju-ri!

372
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,234
Get over here.
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

373
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,195
-I thought you wouldn't come looking here.
-How dare you--

374
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,574
Gosh, that must hurt. Oh, dear.

375
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,618
Do you know how worried
your dad and I were?

376
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,246
How should I know?
Is this how it's going to be?

377
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,998
-Get over here.
-No.

378
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,833
-Get over here while I ask nicely.
-No.

379
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,711
What do you think
you're doing in my house?

380
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,920
Are you playing a game?

381
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,965
You should've called
if a kid came by at this hour.

382
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,383
Think about her father.

383
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,594
-Are you seriously telling me off?
-Darn it.

384
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,304
I only just found out.

385
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,973
-Get back here.
-No.

386
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,183
-Get back here.
-Why?

387
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,267
-Get back here.
-No.

388
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,644
-Get over here.
-Sorry, Hye-jin.

389
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,649
Get out here, Ju-ri.

390
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,068
-Get out here.
-No way.

391
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,237
You shouldn't put others out like this.

392
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,572
Get out here!

393
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,908
The one causing inconvenience here is you.

394
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,825
What?

395
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,204
Ju-ri's my guest
while you weren't invited in.

396
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,081
She can stay here tonight,
so please leave.

397
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,708
But Chun-jae's waiting at home.

398
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,752
I'll call him myself then.

399
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,087
-Ju-ri, what's your dad's number?
-Don't tell her.

400
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,132
Be quiet. It's 010-0247-8359.

401
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,718
Seriously. What the hell are you doing?

402
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,178
Hello?

403
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,014
-Ju-ri will stay with me tonight.
-Who the hell are you?

404
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,433
I informed her father,

405
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,936
and I'm an adult of the same sex.
So it's no problem.

406
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,064
There. Do you need anything else?

407
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,236
Ju-ri, get back home tomorrow.

408
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,155
-"Be back home tomorrow."
-Are you mocking me?

409
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,074
Your dad is worried.

410
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,245
Sorry for the intrusion.

411
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,434
Hye-jin, is Uncle Du-sik gone?

412
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,435
Yes.

413
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,522
Nice, Hye-jin. Thank you so much.
I'm sorry for pushing you, but--

414
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,151
I met Chief Hong on my way in.

415
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,320
Who are you?

416
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,572
You're rude.

417
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,241
Who may you be?

418
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,368
Who's asking?

419
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,496
I'm Pyo Mi-seon.

420
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,915
Who's she?

421
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,878
What on earth is she thinking?

422
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,009
-Hey, Chun-jae.
-Du-sik!

423
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,096
I think Ju-ri was kidnapped
by some crazy woman!

424
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,648
Yes, I'll let her stay the night
and bring her over tomorrow morning.

425
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,860
Sure. Don't worry too much.

426
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,822
Good night.

427
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,826
What did my dad say?

428
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,703
That you're dead meat tomorrow.

429
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,039
-Now, go to bed.
-Okay.

430
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,419
-Good night.
-You too, Hye-jin.

431
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,011
RESEARCH ON THE SURVIVAL RATE
OF RE-EMBEDDED IMPLANTS

432
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,064
JU-RI'S

433
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,202
She's quite good.

434
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,132
Dr. Yoon, once again,
please take good care of my girl.

435
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,760
Of course. Don't worry.

436
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,724
I'm sorry to ask,
but did she wash up before bed?

437
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,853
She can't skip lotion
due to her chronic atopic dermatitis.

438
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,815
Yes, she didn't forget
to put on some lotion.

439
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,070
You probably have this covered,

440
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,739
but please make sure
she brushes her teeth.

441
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,581
She may not seem fussy,
but she doesn't sleep well in other beds.

442
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,583
If she can't sleep,

443
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,045
please give her a glass of milk
with a spoonful of sugar.

444
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,593
Hye-jin, I can't sleep.

445
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,266
Drink this and head to bed.

446
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,517
Sure.

447
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,977
That's nice and warm.

448
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,314
By the way, the girl
in the photos in your room. Is it you?

449
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,774
Yes.

450
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,610
The years weren't so nice to you.

451
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,613
Hey. Seriously?

452
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,283
All living creatures
look better when young.

453
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,413
I heard that your mother passed away
and you only have a father like me.

454
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,166
Rumors travel fast.

455
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,836
Do you remember a lot about her?

456
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,963
Somewhat.

457
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,549
However, I was too young,

458
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,093
so I mostly remember her being sick.

459
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,220
You at least have some memories of her.

460
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,850
My mom passed away right after I was born,

461
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,810
so I only got to see photos of her.

462
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,730
Really?

463
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,608
So my grandma used to say
when I was little

464
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,568
that I ruined my dad's life.

465
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,612
He got so mad at her

466
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,490
that we only see her only on holidays.

467
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,996
I get that he cares so much about me,

468
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,625
but it's stifling at times and annoying.

469
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,251
So it's like this.

470
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,047
He should only be a dad,

471
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,257
but he's trying to be a mom too.

472
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,884
Do you get what I mean?

473
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,552
Yes, totally.

474
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,724
Hye-jin, why did you
let me stay here today?

475
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,393
No reason.

476
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,230
It just reminded me of the past.

477
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,651
I was once like you too.

478
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,444
Like me?

479
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,697
No way. Did you run away from home too?

480
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,366
Why?

481
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,660
It was back in high school.

482
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,995
GONGJIN MARKET PARKING LOT

483
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,123
I skipped school,

484
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,668
took a bus at the terminal,

485
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,920
and went to the beach.

486
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,219
Long distance! You play big, don't you?

487
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,012
Why though?

488
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:54,060
Because my dad
had gotten himself a girlfriend.

489
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,021
No way! Was that your reason?

490
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,983
I didn't peg you to be so close-minded.

491
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,945
Look. If my dad were seeing a woman,

492
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,364
I'd back up their relationship
all the way.

493
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,323
What?

494
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,284
It's kind of sad

495
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,495
to let him live forever
missing a dead person.

496
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,207
Gosh. You're definitely
more thoughtful than I am.

497
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,711
I wonder why you left home
when you're this mature?

498
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,966
That's because my dad
wouldn't let me get braces.

499
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,637
So could you please persuade him a little?

500
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,308
Why do you want braces
when your snaggletooth is adorable?

501
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,020
Just like everyone else in this world,
I want to look pretty.

502
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,063
I'm sure you understand that. Right?

503
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,066
-Braces alone won't do the job.
-Jeez.

504
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,778
That's straight in the guts. I'm so hurt.

505
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,196
I hurt you?

506
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,783
Here. Drink this and go to bed.
I need to get some work done.

507
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:58,374
Doctor, do you offer
your friends any discount--

508
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,876
-Go to bed.
-Got it.

509
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,793
Darn.

510
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,591
Good night. No, just a second.

511
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,051
A discount…

512
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,011
Got it. Good night.

513
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,170
You always drink the good stuff
on your own.

514
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,141
Chun-jae.

515
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,106
Are you crying?

516
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,817
Why would I be crying?

517
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,868
Just wait until she gets back.
I'm shaving all her hair off.

518
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,371
As if you'd ever go through with that.

519
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,874
You adore the curly baby hair
on her forehead.

520
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,462
I guess I love her so much
that I've spoiled her.

521
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,382
I raised a thief.

522
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,594
She plays big.
She definitely doesn't take after you.

523
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,263
Maybe her mom.

524
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,808
Jeez.

525
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,813
What will become of her? I'm so worried.

526
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,817
It's not like
I'm going to be around forever.

527
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,737
In order to manage on her own
once I'm gone,

528
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,989
she needs to at least finish college.

529
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,492
Is that why you've been
on her case lately?

530
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,952
It's the same with the braces.

531
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,329
Of course, I asked around.

532
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,374
-Since she wants it so badly.
-But?

533
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,712
It involves plucking
a few perfectly good teeth!

534
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,049
Even when she scrapes her knee,
it gives me a heart attack.

535
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,342
What if something happens
during the procedure?

536
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,596
Ju-ri's such a lucky kid
to have a dad like you.

537
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,140
Those without parents
should feel sorry for themselves.

538
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,773
Don't be ridiculous.

539
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,235
You grew up well on your own, you know.

540
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,323
No one in this world is as decent as you.

541
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,533
Hold on. Are you drunk?

542
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,912
Du-sik.

543
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,500
Try and make something happen
with Dr. Yoon.

544
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,585
Stop it. It's not like that for us.

545
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,297
Don't say that to Ms. Dentist either.
You'll lose a regular customer.

546
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,716
Then date someone at least.

547
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,135
Find someone to lean on for once.

548
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,264
You spend your life
dealing with people's baggage.

549
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,518
When do you ever get to lessen yours?

550
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,895
I don't have any.

551
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,523
You almost finished the bottle.
Let me get a glass.

552
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,235
Don't you dare drink another drop.
I'm finishing that.

553
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,779
Jeez.

554
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,934
That drink sure was strong.

555
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,213
WHAT MEN LIVE BY BY LEO TOLSTOY

556
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,328
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

557
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,459
I'm sorry. I won't ever do this again.

558
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,503
So please let me have my braces.

559
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,631
-Please?
-No.

560
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,425
Now that you pulled this, there's no way.

561
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,720
You can no longer get what you want
by acting out.

562
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,723
I hate you. You're super annoying!

563
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,767
Likewise! It's not like I…

564
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,185
That brat.

565
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,398
I'm sorry, doctor.
And thank you for last night.

566
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:15,942
It's all right.

567
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,569
She's not usually this bad, but…

568
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,658
Jeez. Raising a daughter sure isn't easy.

569
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,203
I may be overstepping my boundaries,

570
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,081
but Ju-ri's not a little kid anymore.

571
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,209
-Sorry?
-Yes, she's still a child,

572
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:38,172
but she's past the age where she needs
constant care from her dad.

573
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,302
She has her own world now
and needs her alone time.

574
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,723
I just hope you can accept
those changes in her life.

575
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,225
Right.

576
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,270
And Ju-ri isn't some mindless teenager.

577
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,146
She already found what she wants to do.

578
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,982
Have you seen her sketches?

579
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,985
-It's Ju-ri's.
-Does Ju-ri draw?

580
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,949
-Is this hers?
-Yes, she drew those.

581
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,492
Did my Ju-ri--

582
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,160
-Did you get rid of them?
-What?

583
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,497
My DOS poster and fan merchandise.
Did you get rid of them?

584
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,207
Yes, I threw them away.

585
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,168
I couldn't take you
losing focus over them,

586
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,712
so I threw them all out!

587
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,339
Why would you throw out what's mine?

588
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,551
Who gave you the right?
Those were all limited editions!

589
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,344
It's never good to get involved.

590
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,982
My gosh. Chief Hong's
spending the day with her again.

591
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,069
I guess so.

592
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,656
I'm stopping by the supermarket.

593
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,708
-Welcome!
-Hi.

594
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,380
I'll take all of these.

595
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,009
-All of them?
-Yes.

596
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,636
You must love them.

597
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:12,099
They make good snacks,
although I did use to live on them.

598
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,435
I see.

599
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:21,359
So Producer Ji,
where are we headed this time…

600
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,526
Hello!

601
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,652
Welcome.

602
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,616
Do you have any sausages?

603
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,827
Actually, someone bought
all I had just now.

604
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,374
Gosh. I see I'm not the only one
who loves them.

605
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,084
I'll be back some other time then.

606
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,794
Yes, have a nice day.

607
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,003
Sure.

608
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,008
Why does he look familiar?

609
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,677
He's not from Gongjin.

610
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,806
Where did I see him?

611
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,725
Is Uigeumbu the name of a region?

612
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,477
Isn't that Uijeongbu?

613
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,897
Uigeumbu and seolleongtang.
Don't they ring any bells?

614
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,981
Nothing.

615
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,582
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

616
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,711
I see they have a dental clinic here.

617
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,715
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

618
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,850
-Octopus over rice?
-Yes, the place nearby is to die for.

619
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,227
Really? Sounds delicious.

620
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,480
Chun-jae, why didn't you bring Ju-ri?

621
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,274
She's giving me the silent treatment.

622
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,818
And World War 3 is imminent.

623
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,404
-She's just a kid.
-You being here

624
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,322
makes your move finally feel real.

625
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,699
I feel the same way.

626
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,244
Hwa-jeong, are you feeling better today?

627
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,663
Yes, I'm fine now.

628
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,331
Thanks for the concern.

629
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,167
Hello.

630
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,711
-Gosh, hello.
-Hello.

631
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,629
-Come on in.
-Hi!

632
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,131
-This way.
-Please sit.

633
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,674
I see there's an empty seat.

634
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,592
Where?

635
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,302
Right here.

636
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,471
There's barely any room.

637
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,473
Gosh, there we go.

638
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,727
Before we begin today's meeting,

639
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,188
a message for the village
will be delivered.

640
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,647
Village Chief?

641
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,987
Hello, everyone. I'm Chang Yeong-guk,
the Village Chief of Gongjin-dong.

642
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,241
Take it easy, will you?
There's no need to deepen your voice.

643
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,536
Right.

644
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,415
I'm sure you know the Lighthouse
Song Festival's in two weeks.

645
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,375
I hope many sign up again this year.

646
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,753
I'll hand out applications,
so fill them out

647
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,880
-and bring them to the office.
-Sure.

648
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,718
Hold on. Up until last year,
the award included

649
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,595
a voucher to spend locally.

650
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,014
But this year,
the winner gets three million won.

651
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,141
-What?
-In cash?

652
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,936
-Yes.
-You'll be given hard cash.

653
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,938
Runner-up, 1,000,000.
Third place, 500,000.

654
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,189
-My goodness!
-No way.

655
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,191
-Unbelievable.
-Nice.

656
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,360
So I hope many will enter the competition.

657
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,445
Don't if you're too busy though.

658
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,781
Only do so if you want.
Here are the forms.

659
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,283
Officer Choi, are you not entering?

660
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,701
I'm afraid not.

661
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,370
Why not?

662
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,789
Chief Hong, go ahead.
You can carry a tune.

663
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,582
Sing what you sang last time.

664
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:28,295
She's right. You and Dr. Yoon can team up.

665
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,422
Again with the nonsense.

666
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:34,760
How can you be so dense
and embarrass people like that?

667
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,721
Can't you tell by the way
they're sitting far apart?

668
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,723
It's already over between them.

669
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,808
Gosh.

670
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,060
What's there to end

671
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,437
when nothing even began?

672
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,357
Nothing's going on
between Chief Hong and me.

673
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,610
If you keep spreading false rumors,

674
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,445
I won't let it slide.

675
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,446
Well…

676
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,575
-I…
-Gosh.

677
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,619
I'm leaving.

678
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,746
-What?
-What…

679
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,039
-Wait.
-Hye-jin.

680
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,124
-What…
-Is she pissed?

681
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,834
-Well…
-Just a second.

682
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,877
They were close but sat far apart today,

683
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,422
so I just figured…

684
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,513
Just let it slide.

685
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,266
The gossip just to kill the time.

686
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,227
Why does it have to be at my expense?

687
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,188
It's upsetting and I'm offended.

688
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,191
As long as it's not true,
there's no need to overreact.

689
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,070
Let's not be so sharp around the edges.
That's my advice as a friend.

690
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,072
Who says we're friends?

691
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,365
What?

692
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,868
Us having some moments recently

693
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,370
must've made you think that way,

694
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,957
-but I don't befriend just anyone.
-"Just anyone"?

695
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,585
While we're at it,
let me lay it out there.

696
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,754
You exhaust me.

697
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,507
I don't care for the rumors
and prefer not to be considered as a pair.

698
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,720
I'm grateful for your help, but I'd like
for you to stop crossing the line.

699
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,140
I thought you had changed.

700
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,185
I guess I was wrong.

701
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,274
Here you go.

702
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,140
Power on.

703
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,685
Bluetooth activated.

704
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,230
Why don't we enter
the singing contest as a team?

705
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,358
You know I'm a natural on stage.

706
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,360
Give me a chance and I'll shine.

707
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,486
Enough!

708
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:01,615
Would it kill you
to live quietly for once?

709
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,700
Mat-i, let it be just us two then.

710
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,453
We can split the prize money.
What do you say?

711
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,168
Gosh, must be a cold.

712
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,047
Hey.

713
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,384
-Do I know you?
-It's Nam-suk. Hold on.

714
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,803
I knew it was you.

715
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,513
-Gosh, hello.
-Hi.

716
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,599
Don't tell me
you're here to enter the singing contest.

717
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,101
Nonsense.

718
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,021
Goodness. I was right.

719
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,816
It's wrong for someone like you to enter.

720
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,734
You're a singer. It's not fair.

721
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,236
Must you talk so loudly?

722
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,529
Gosh, I'm sorry.

723
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,781
Is it because of the big prize money?

724
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,701
Nam-suk, why is it that you're everywhere?

725
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,119
-Nam-suk.
-Gosh.

726
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,996
Is she the mayor or something?

727
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,498
Listen up, everyone!

728
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,543
Oh Yoon who won the number two song
on Top Ten Songs

729
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,587
will enter the Lighthouse Song Festival.

730
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,214
How is that fair?

731
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,509
Chun--

732
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,512
I took care of him.

733
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,805
-Here's my form.
-Sure.

734
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,307
I have 320,000 won.

735
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,526
Unbelievable.

736
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,821
Gosh.

737
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,541
LIGHTHOUSE SONG FESTIVAL

738
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,014
CHUNG-HO SPECIALTY PRODUCTS

739
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:51,975
LIGHTHOUSE SONG FESTIVAL

740
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,187
-Let's go.
-I don't want to.

741
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,023
Who watches singing contests these days?
They're so lame.

742
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:01,652
Come on! Do you really think
I'm here for the contest?

743
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,404
Of course, I'm here
to bump into Eun-cheol.

744
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,114
Jeez.

745
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,282
Seriously.

746
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,494
Hey, Chief Hong!

747
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,957
-Hi.
-Hey.

748
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,750
Have you seen Officer Choi?

749
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,002
He's sorting things out
by the parking lot.

750
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,630
He said he was off-duty today. How come?

751
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,840
A fender bender made a mess of things.

752
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,177
I'm not sure he'll make it here on time,
but don't lose hope.

753
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,637
Okay.

754
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,538
-Hi.
-Cho-hui, over here.

755
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,333
That seat's taken. It's Hwa-jeong's.

756
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,627
What do you mean?
I've been saving it for her…

757
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,754
Hold on. What…

758
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,216
It's fine. I can move over a seat.

759
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,260
Hey.

760
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:12,222
She doesn't even know
when people do her a favor.

761
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,601
-Please have a seat.
-Sit down.

762
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,685
What's the matter?

763
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,729
It's all good.

764
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,646
What was that?

765
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,106
It's nothing.

766
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,278
What's with all the cameras
at a small-town festival?

767
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,197
It wasn't like this last year.

768
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,035
Maybe it's because of the prize money,
but it's a bit different.

769
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,328
-Right?
-Yes.

770
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:38,957
Hello, I'm comedian Yang Seung-won
here to host the Lighthouse Song Festival.

771
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,501
-It's good to see you.
-It's Yang Seung-won!

772
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,753
What?

773
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,923
-I'll start with a few voice impressions.
-Isn't it that man on TV?

774
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,550
-Yes, it is.
-Here we go.

775
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,053
Before we begin the singing contest,

776
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,096
an opening ceremony will be delivered.

777
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,182
He's the pride and joy of Gongjin-dong.

778
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,434
Please welcome singer Oh Yoon.

779
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,694
Hello, everyone.

780
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:11,365
-He actually agreed to it.
-A mountain guy

781
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,618
turned out to be an ocean guy,
and that's how I settled here.

782
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,663
I am the star of Gongjin.
What's my name again?

783
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,872
-Chun-jae!
-Chun-jae!

784
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:19,873
What's my name?

785
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,166
-Oh Yoon!
-Oh Yoon!

786
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,251
Yes, I'm Oh Yoon!

787
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,381
Ju-ri, I love you!

788
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,181
The night is cold, I hate this night

789
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:40,477
Here I am living in this city day by day

790
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,357
But once again, I realize she's gone

791
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,111
All that's left is an empty seat
And her laughter

792
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:54,157
I can't contain this feeling

793
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:59,663
Exercising in the moonlight doesn't help

794
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:04,126
Only the wind of life that crashes into me

795
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,921
Eventually brings me to tears

796
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:12,008
But once again, I realize she's gone

797
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:16,138
All that's left is an empty seat
And her laughter

798
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,270
Thank you. I love you all.

799
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,606
I'm Oh Yoon!

800
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,361
Ju-ri, it's your dad!

801
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,954
No way. What's this?
A live guerrilla performance?

802
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,331
It'll be over before then, right?

803
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,753
Ju-ri, are you entering the contest too?

804
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,087
Mind your own business!

805
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,089
Don't fumble up there.

806
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:08,565
Don't give up on anything

807
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,734
Don't. Don't you dare do it.

808
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,278
He's so good.

809
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:29,753
Sick and tired of my lousy life

810
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:33,590
-I now set out to find you again
-Don't listen, my baby.

811
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,469
I will run to you
And throw myself in your embrace

812
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,514
You won't be able to ignore me

813
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,810
Louder and louder
I will call out your name

814
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:49,940
The name of whom I love

815
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,114
I'm Cho Nam-suk
of Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

816
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,116
I hope you enjoy my song.

817
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,383
-Don't criticize me
-Oh, my.

818
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:20,470
-Block your ears.
-For being cruel

819
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:27,352
I only chose to part ways briefly
For your sake

820
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:31,481
I love you

821
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,859
Gosh, Nam-suk.

822
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,737
Thank you! Please applaud--

823
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,993
Can I get a do-over?
The key must've been set way off.

824
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,870
I asked for B sharp!

825
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,290
Squid, shrimp, anchovy

826
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,334
Webfoot octopus, baby octopus,
shark, and turtle

827
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,796
You were born in the ocean

828
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,966
What do you think about while you live?

829
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,469
Good, good, good, good, let's laugh

830
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,722
That's right, right, right, right

831
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,974
What were the lyrics?

832
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,684
You wench!

833
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,394
-I forgot…
-How could you?

834
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,104
-It could happen, gosh!
-Seriously?

835
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,857
Is that the best you can do, you idiot?

836
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,817
How can you be so dumb?

837
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,236
It's not like I wanted to forget.

838
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,237
-Damn you!
-Hey!

839
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,282
Cut the music!

840
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,552
She's so adorable.

841
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:46,139
Ms. Dentist, can you come
with me for a minute?

842
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,515
Where?

843
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,808
This is urgent. Come on.

844
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,976
What now?

845
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,144
Someone's hurt.

846
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,855
Hurry.

847
00:53:55,899 --> 00:54:00,320
You are my precious love

848
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:07,702
You are

849
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:14,209
My eternal love

850
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,545
I love you

851
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:21,466
I love you

852
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:25,845
But why do tears

853
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,601
Keep falling?

854
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,870
She sprained her ankle while dancing.
Take a look.

855
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,373
I'm a dentist, not an orthopedist.

856
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,667
You're still more qualified than I am.

857
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,419
Ju-ri, which foot is it?

858
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,129
What? The left.

859
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,887
-It hurts.
-Does it?

860
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,805
Yes.

861
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,976
It's swollen too much.
You should go to the hospital.

862
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,019
No way.

863
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,813
She wants to perform.
She's willing to dance in this state.

864
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,815
I doubt you can even walk.

865
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,983
I have to win this.

866
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,943
I need the prize money to get braces.

867
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,945
-What?
-Seriously?

868
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,031
I think your snaggletooth looks adorable.

869
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,451
You're just like Dad. Stop saying that.
I absolutely loathe it!

870
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,577
You what?

871
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,204
You can get them when you're older.

872
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,874
Now's not the time.
Let's go to the hospital.

873
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,459
No, it has to be now.

874
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,335
Why are you in such a rush?

875
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,713
Is there a particular reason?

876
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,923
There's this boy I like,

877
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,925
but I can't smile in front of him.

878
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,678
The snaggletooth shows first,
so I keep covering it up,

879
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,221
and it kills my self-esteem.

880
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,015
What if he falls for some other girl?

881
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,100
It's why I need braces right now!

882
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,727
-Please.
-The next contestant is

883
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,979
a seventh grader
at Cheongjin Middle School,

884
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,398
-Oh Ju-ri!
-Now? Are you kidding me?

885
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,611
Did he just say Ju-ri?

886
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,362
-Oh Ju-ri?
-Is she entering?

887
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,906
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

888
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,660
-Ju-ri?
-Is she…

889
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,872
Why is she limping? Ju-ri, what's wrong?

890
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,041
Ju-ri!

891
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,336
-Ju-ri…
-Oh Ju-ri will begin her performance.

892
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,969
Tears drop as I turn the steering wheel

893
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,264
I'm on my way to you

894
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,309
I feel terrible
But there's so much traffic

895
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,894
I…

896
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,275
Ju-ri, get down here. Come on!

897
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,904
Just a second.

898
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,573
We'll take it from the top.

899
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,326
Hye-jin?

900
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:57,956
Uncle?

901
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,415
Hey.

902
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,835
Let's place first. I hate second place.

903
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,380
Ju-ri, sit.

904
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,217
-Du-sik, what's wrong with Ju-ri?
-Goodness.

905
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,721
What?

906
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,225
Seriously? Chun-jae, get up.

907
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,644
-Do you know this dance?
-I don't.

908
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,020
Then leave the stage.

909
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,189
I thought the embarrassment
could be shared.

910
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,525
Besides, it's all about
making people excited

911
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,735
on events like this.

912
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,154
Ju-ri, you got this.

913
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,241
Tears drop as I turn the steering wheel

914
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:36,494
-I'm on my way to you
-What is she doing?

915
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,205
I feel terrible
But there's so much traffic

916
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,749
I call but you don't pick up

917
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,628
Beautiful northern lights

918
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,798
-Were they always a team?
-I desperately call for you

919
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,924
-Who knows?
-I hear you

920
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:54,304
-Is Dr. Yoon a good dancer or a bad one?
-Our time together

921
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:58,975
She seems to be trying,
but it's kind of choppy.

922
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,232
Who knew that Chief Hong
was bad at something?

923
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,611
Hurry up tonight

924
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,405
Please come back, just a feeling

925
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,412
I will be there for you

926
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,207
Hurry up tonight

927
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,418
Please come back, just a feeling

928
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:33,635
Bewildered and mesmerized
I can't escape you

929
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,347
Please, please, turn around

930
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,651
-My gosh.
-Ju-ri, it's Dad!

931
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:57,492
That was great. Our Du-sik is good
at absolutely everything.

932
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,415
So much for not getting involved.
She's in deep.

933
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:23,768
Sit here.

934
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,814
-Oh, no. My good reputation.
-Hi, I'm Choi Bo-ra!

935
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,691
As if you had one.

936
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,693
This is all your fault.

937
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,946
One might think I made you go up there.

938
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,614
That was your own choice.

939
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,324
Must you always blame others?

940
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,118
-You're so annoying!
-Likewise.

941
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,830
Did you see the crowd earlier?
We might actually win!

942
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,748
-Yes!
-My gosh!

943
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,625
-I never lose, you know.
-First place.

944
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,920
I will tightly embrace

945
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:55,049
My friend's broken heart

946
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,678
Just like someone did

947
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:03,725
When I was feeling down

948
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,477
A friend's wrongdoing

949
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,814
Will be embraced with warm forgiveness

950
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:14,402
-Honey. Is that really our daughter?
-And one's mistake

951
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,447
-Tell me about it.
-Will be understood…

952
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,324
Goodness.

953
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:23,661
There was a true singer
in Gongjin all along.

954
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:29,500
What will I do
With hatred that involuntarily formed

955
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:35,757
With love

956
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,762
I will embrace those with love

957
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:44,641
I will hug you tightly

958
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:49,771
With the warmth in my heart

959
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:53,441
Please hug others tightly

960
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:56,569
With tender love

961
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:00,531
To let happiness

962
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:05,411
Bloom inside our hearts

963
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:09,374
I will hug you tightly

964
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,626
I will take my friend

965
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:17,215
In a warm embrace

966
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,842
I will take my friend

967
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:26,891
In a warm embrace

968
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,858
You did great!

969
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,699
And the winner is…

970
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,827
-Choi Bo-ra!
-Yes!

971
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,496
Bo-ra, that was amazing.

972
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,999
How is it that you never sang for me
when you are this good?

973
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:56,254
Bo-ra, how about we swap our prize money?

974
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,755
Don't be ridiculous!

975
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,841
Bo-ra, let me keep it safe for you.

976
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,218
-You too.
-Fine.

977
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,178
I-jun, how was I?

978
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,097
Yes, you were great.

979
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,808
Let's play the claw machine.
I have three million won!

980
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,435
-Bo-ra!
-No, don't go.

981
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,728
Take me with you then.

982
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,523
I didn't know Bo-ra was that talented.

983
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,278
Give me all the prize money.

984
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:23,698
-What?
-What? We should split it three ways.

985
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,158
-No, it's mine.
-No way.

986
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,827
Are you seriously
trying to steal a kid's money?

987
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,830
Ju-ri, it's fine by me, so take my share.

988
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,123
-It's mine.
-No!

989
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,583
-Seriously?
-Give it here!

990
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,625
Come on.

991
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,004
I'll take this and do your braces.

992
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,338
-What?
-What?

993
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,090
I'll do your braces.

994
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,510
It's not for free though.

995
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,887
This is the first payment.

996
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,347
Pay the rest when you grow up.

997
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,311
So grow up well
if you want to pay your debt.

998
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,188
Hye-jin!

999
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,361
Thank you all for waiting.
We'll now take some photos.

1000
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,821
-Here.
-Right.

1001
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,531
Here, hold this for the photo.

1002
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,500
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

1003
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,297
Watch your step.

1004
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,674
Are you seriously on your phone?

1005
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,760
DOS is going live.

1006
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,470
-It's almost time.
-Watch your step!

1007
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,679
Ju-ri!

1008
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,681
Juri, are you okay?

1009
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,809
Startled by her own dad.

1010
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:36,187
Lastly, we have a special event.

1011
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,565
Wait, those people…

1012
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,112
-Ju-ri…
-She won't talk to me.

1013
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,198
-Not even look at me.
-Two, three.

1014
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,741
-Hello.
-Hi.

1015
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,077
-The operating system…
-Of the K-pop industry.

1016
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,411
-We're DOS.
-We're DOS.

1017
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,503
No way.

1018
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,965
Ju-ri, it's DOS.

1019
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:11,806
Tears drop as I turn the steering wheel
I'm on my way to you

1020
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:15,142
I feel terrible
But there's so much traffic…

1021
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,437
By the way, who are those boys?

1022
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,108
Who knows? I don't recognize any of them.

1023
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,528
What were they called again?

1024
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,155
D! O! S! My gosh.

1025
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,615
Are they DOS?

1026
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,367
No wonder Ju-ri calls them her life.

1027
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,748
-Did you film me earlier?
-Of course not.

1028
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:41,752
If that's what you want
I can bring you back

1029
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,339
Let's hope for a miracle

1030
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,301
Please come back, just a feeling

1031
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,682
How can boys be that pretty?

1032
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,934
Seriously.
It's good for prenatal education.

1033
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,769
Are you seeing this, my baby?

1034
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,230
I'll send you the video I'm filming.

1035
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,357
-Thanks.
-Thanks for what?

1036
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,275
What?

1037
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,366
Please come back

1038
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:22,627
Bewildered and mesmerized
I can't escape you

1039
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,713
Please, please, turn around

1040
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,840
-DOS.
-You're the best!

1041
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,091
The best!

1042
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,095
Look how handsome they are!

1043
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,390
The ending was killer. My gosh.

1044
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,979
Where did she go?
Why isn't she picking up?

1045
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,067
It hurts.

1046
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:48,736
It stings.

1047
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,912
Someone said that being nosy is incurable.

1048
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,456
That it's annoying and uncomfortable.

1049
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:04,460
She also said that she didn't
want to be the subject of gossip.

1050
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:09,048
Is being inconsistent your motto?
Your words don't match your actions.

1051
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,132
I'm leaving.

1052
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,510
Maybe you like being on stage.

1053
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,679
I guess you have a flair for the dramatic.

1054
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,807
No wonder you danced on the pole
after having too much wine.

1055
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,017
Are you nuts? Shut it!

1056
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,229
You're actually
crossing the line right now.

1057
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,648
You're the one who crossed it.

1058
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:29,235
Exactly. And I'm telling you
to cross it comfortably like I do.

1059
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,741
Don't be childish
and draw imaginary lines.

1060
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,410
Let me borrow your eraser

1061
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,620
and copy your homework once in a while.

1062
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:41,706
Homework? Why would I?

1063
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,333
Chief Hong!

1064
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,251
Coming!

1065
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,099
Where on earth did she go?

1066
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,188
JUNE!

1067
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,864
JUNE, just a second!

1068
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,120
-Get on.
-What?

1069
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,663
-Hop on!
-All right.

1070
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,667
-Let's go.
-JUNE, wait!

1071
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,295
JUNE, just a second!

1072
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,672
-JUNE, wait!
-Wait!

1073
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,050
-JUNE, hold on!
-Just a second!

1074
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,969
-Wait!
-Wait!

1075
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,056
JUNE, just a second. Wait.

1076
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:43,267
-Wait!
-Don't go yet.

1077
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,271
JUNE.

1078
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,482
JUNE, just a second.

1079
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,358
I'm a member of Hacker.

1080
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,528
-I'm 14 and my name is Oh Ju-ri.
-Hang on.

1081
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,363
That snaggletooth.

1082
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,991
-I think I saw you somewhere.
-What?

1083
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,994
I went to three of your concerts,
but I doubt you spotted me.

1084
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,746
-Three times?
-Getting tickets was--

1085
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:06,999
-Right. At the cafe.
-The cafe?

1086
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,459
You called me a fake.

1087
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,171
Never have I gotten that from anyone.

1088
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,551
-I let it slide since you're cute.
-What?

1089
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,138
-I'll see you around.
-Sure.

1090
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,391
You'll see her around? Why? What for?

1091
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,227
JUNE, you're super handsome!

1092
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,779
Unbelievable.

1093
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,953
Are you okay?

1094
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,288
Yes, I'm good.

1095
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,460
Gosh, all right.

1096
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,129
Let me see.

1097
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,006
Look at that nasty bruise.

1098
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,219
This is what you get
for being such a tomboy.

1099
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,971
You should get acupuncture.

1100
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,472
Forget it.

1101
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,977
Get some for your back instead.

1102
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,064
Why carry me with a herniated disc?

1103
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,317
Just thank me if you're grateful.

1104
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:21,031
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't have gotten to talk to DOS.

1105
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,325
That's not how you pronounce it.

1106
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,786
Who cares how I pronounce it?

1107
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,248
-Everyone cares.
-Something's weighing me down.

1108
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,792
-Can you check for me?
-What's this?

1109
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,086
What is it? I wonder what this is.

1110
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,797
Wait. What's with all this money?

1111
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,842
-What--
-It's what I got for today's gig.

1112
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,428
I'll use it to pay for your braces.

1113
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:44,805
Here.

1114
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:46,891
I'm not getting it.

1115
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,101
Why not?

1116
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,023
I don't want to anymore. There's no need.

1117
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,649
What? Why?

1118
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,694
JUNE only recognized me
because of my teeth.

1119
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:02,072
Plus, he said I was adorable. Adorable!

1120
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,200
Can you be any more annoying?

1121
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,743
What am I going to do with you?

1122
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:09,413
I called you cute too,
but you didn't care for what I said.

1123
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:10,748
That's different.

1124
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:15,502
That JUNE must have superpowers.

1125
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,214
Come on. You should get something to eat.

1126
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,798
Can you help me up?

1127
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,550
-Hey.
-Help.

1128
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:24,470
-Hop on.
-Maybe I should.

1129
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,596
All right.

1130
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,681
-My gosh!
-What now?

1131
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,976
I'm afraid I can't carry you twice a day.

1132
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,603
-Forget it.
-Here.

1133
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:35,189
Do we have patches left?
I'll stick a few on your back.

1134
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,733
Slow and steady though.

1135
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,402
Appreciate the scenery while we walk.

1136
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,363
You brat.

1137
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,990
-You know what?
-What?

1138
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:48,202
Like you, I tried everything

1139
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:50,162
to look good for your mom.

1140
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,247
Really?

1141
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,749
-I never told you this.
-What?

1142
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,501
I even pierced my ears.

1143
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,004
-Really? Let me see.
-It closed up ages ago.

1144
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,924
Your mom hated it,
so I took it out three days later.

1145
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,634
Can I pierce my ears too?

1146
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,307
JINSEONG EXPRESS

1147
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,997
It's still chilly at night.

1148
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,584
Let's go home.

1149
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,314
Dad, I thought you'd be in bed.

1150
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:43,567
I was just about to turn in.
Is something up?

1151
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,070
Do I need a reason to call?

1152
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:47,905
I just did.

1153
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:49,365
I see.

1154
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,951
The plant that you sent me…

1155
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,079
It's bloomed.

1156
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,497
-Really?
-Yes.

1157
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:00,167
Wow. From what I hear,
it only blooms once every seven years.

1158
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,960
Really?

1159
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,630
Yes. It's said that
the greatest luck in life

1160
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:07,132
finds its way to the person who sees it.

1161
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,181
Are you still there?

1162
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:17,559
Yes. I'll water it well
and take good care of it.

1163
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:18,685
Good.

1164
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,563
Not too often though. The roots will rot.

1165
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,565
Got it. Good night then.

1166
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:27,528
Wait. Call once in a while
even though nothing's up.

1167
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:28,445
I will.

1168
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,703
So it bloomed?

1169
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,916
What are you doing here?

1170
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:44,169
Out on a walk.

1171
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:47,798
What? Do I need permission to go on walks?

1172
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:48,757
Which way?

1173
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,592
This way.

1174
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,052
Bye.

1175
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,099
Why are you following me?

1176
01:13:57,182 --> 01:14:00,436
Again with Princess Syndrome.
I was headed this way too.

1177
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,814
To be honest,
I came close to hating you again.

1178
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,899
-What?
-But

1179
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:08,569
what you did today was cool,
and I'm proud.

1180
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:12,656
This is the type of thing
you shouldn't do.

1181
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:14,491
People will get the wrong idea.

1182
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,909
It'll be the last time.

1183
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:19,413
I don't befriend just anyone, you know.

1184
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,760
Those must be fireworks!

1185
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,971
Well, they aren't gunshots.

1186
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,850
I guess someone got the romance going.

1187
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,727
It's unnecessarily pretty.

1188
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,234
-It really is pretty.
-Hey--

1189
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,346
I nearly died just now.

1190
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,515
-Death was right in my face.
-What?

1191
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:23,602
Seong-hyeon?

1192
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,148
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I finally found you.

1193
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,619
To the right! The right…

1194
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,497
Whatever. I didn't see that.

1195
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:44,957
Excuse me.

1196
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,523
It's been a while, Hye-jin.

1197
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,089
That will be 1,400 won.

1198
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,512
Just a second.

1199
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,599
Here's 100 won.

1200
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:47,311
-That's 1,400 won, right?
-What?

1201
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,105
You don't have to.

1202
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:51,356
Enjoy your milk.

1203
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:52,899
Wait!

1204
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:08,957
YOON HYE-JIN

1205
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:26,600
HONG DU-SIK

1206
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,828
Do you two know each other?

1207
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:29,162
How long has it been?

1208
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,289
I'd like for you to explain something.

1209
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,083
And not a word to him,

1210
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,252
especially about that night.

1211
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,003
What are you doing?

1212
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:41,258
Caught between a rock and a hard place,
Chief Hong and Ji Seong-hyeon.

1213
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,969
-Grandma, you know--
-Shut it.

1214
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,471
I'm not going to fall
for whatever you say.

1215
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,391
I won't film it unless it's that house.

1216
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:51,601
There's something I want to know.

1217
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,395
Is Hye-jin seeing anyone?

1218
01:18:55,355 --> 01:19:00,360
