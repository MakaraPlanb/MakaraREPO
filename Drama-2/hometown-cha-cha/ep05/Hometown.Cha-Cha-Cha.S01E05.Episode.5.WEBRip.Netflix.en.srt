1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,018
Hey, Dr. Yoon…

2
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,978
What?

3
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,567
Oh, my goodness.

4
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,534
Guess what? I just saw Dr. Yoon
walking out of Chief Hong's house.

5
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,787
Early in the morning,
like a sneaky little cat.

6
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,373
Here I thought Du-sik was a tame one.

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,292
There's no more innocence
left in the world.

8
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,169
Nam-suk, stop badmouthing people.

9
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,761
Ladies, look at this.

10
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,888
-What?
-What is it?

11
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,360
You slept with Chief Hong?

12
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,947
Hye-jin and Du-sik sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

13
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,657
Oh, dear.

14
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,954
What's wrong?

15
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,039
So it's true?

16
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,876
Do we have any hangover tea?

17
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,835
Let me look.

18
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,444
God, my head.

19
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,156
EPISODE 5

20
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,385
She must've left in a hurry.

21
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,807
FOR BROTH, BEAN SPROUTS

22
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,066
All right.

23
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,865
Tofu is a must
for kimchi soup with bean sprouts.

24
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,911
This headache is killing me.

25
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,581
How much did I drink
that I blacked out there?

26
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,625
God, my head.

27
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,380
Du-sik.

28
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,423
I even learned pole dancing.

29
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,016
-Don't I look like Yuna Kim?
-What the…

30
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,476
Oh, my.

31
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,894
Look at this.

32
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,604
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

33
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,148
Look here. One, two, three.

34
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,652
This is nuts.

35
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,114
The combination to my door lock

36
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:46,369
is eight, seven, zero, seven, two, four.

37
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,747
Chief Hong!

38
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,962
Aren't I so good?

39
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,046
Aren't I strong?

40
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,173
Aren't I really good?

41
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,802
One, two!

42
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,555
Two! Aren't I so good?

43
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,641
One million and twenty-two,
twenty-three, twenty-four.

44
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,101
Chief Hong!

45
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,022
I should quit drinking.

46
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,527
Hold on.

47
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,447
That's odd.

48
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,824
I was out all night,

49
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,994
so how did I end up
back at his house again?

50
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,749
Du-sik.

51
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,586
Chief Hong!

52
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,466
What? Why can't I remember
what happened next?

53
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,763
-Let's go.
-Mi-seon.

54
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,932
-Why don't we take the day off?
-Sure.

55
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,225
-Seriously?
-Yes.

56
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,936
Your credit card bill is on the table.

57
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,605
-This month--
-Don't tell me.

58
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,899
Let's just go to work.

59
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,234
Let's go.

60
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,904
What's wrong?

61
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,406
-This is bad. You should go first.
-What do you mean?

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,534
This is going to be
a long battle. Go first.

63
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,088
Darn it.

64
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,466
MARK AND CHECK COUNTRY OF ORIGIN

65
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,052
-Hey!
-Hey!

66
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,721
Hey! They slept together?

67
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,556
Did they?

68
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,724
The two slept together?

69
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,309
Be quiet.

70
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,394
She yawned and took
the sleep out of her eye.

71
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,271
-She looked content.
-It's true.

72
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,856
-Content?
-She did?

73
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,652
-Hello.
-Gosh.

74
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,153
-Hello.
-Hello.

75
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,072
-Hello.
-Ms. Dentist!

76
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,490
-It's Du-sik.
-Hey.

77
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,242
Gosh.

78
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,828
You left early without doing the dishes.

79
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,995
My gosh.

80
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,166
Well… Don't you think it's rude
to make your guest wash the dishes?

81
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,877
-I even brought expensive wine.
-My phone…

82
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,547
-Did you forget the ginseng wine you had?
-The wi-fi…

83
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,382
We had ginseng wine?

84
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,635
Forget it. Did you eat?

85
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,554
Let's take a photo.

86
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,264
I was going to work.

87
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,808
But how about breakfast?

88
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,521
-What are we having?
-Let's go old-school.

89
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,314
-Okay.
-Look at them together.

90
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,399
What are you doing?

91
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,692
Just taking a photo.

92
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,277
-Du-sik.
-A photo?

93
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,487
You look tired. How wonderful.

94
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,198
Why are you taking photos
and calling out here?

95
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,784
-The connection is best here.
-You look good.

96
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,828
What are you saying? That's absurd.

97
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,912
-Bye, then.
-Gosh.

98
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,789
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

99
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,084
They're having hangover soup.

100
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,836
Do you see them?

101
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,883
What are you doing there?

102
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,718
Hey, come take a look.

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,760
Hurry.

104
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,888
Come on. This is huge.

105
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,641
-I can't see.
-Let's open it a crack.

106
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,976
Be quiet!

107
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,895
Do you see them?

108
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,438
-Yes.
-What's going on?

109
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,231
-Can you see?
-How pretty.

110
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,695
By old-school, I meant
meat on the bone, not ox blood.

111
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,405
Ox blood is the best.

112
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,282
It's chewy and savory.

113
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,160
It's rich in vitamin A and iron.

114
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,121
-That's not important right now.
-Then what is?

115
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,041
Just eat as casually as possible.

116
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,170
Pick up your spoon
and don't look to your left.

117
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,507
No. I told you not to look.

118
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,263
Gosh. Come on.

119
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,849
I can feel that many people

120
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,101
are watching us. What's going on?

121
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,729
People got wind

122
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,814
of us…

123
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,819
sleeping together last night.

124
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,199
I… I can't see clearly.

125
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,493
So anyway,

126
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,787
did anything happen yesterday?

127
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,710
Something did.

128
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,296
What?

129
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,507
Well…

130
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,512
A lot happened.

131
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,097
You don't get drunk easily?

132
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,183
I thought I was watching a TV show.

133
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,103
You suddenly ran out, sang, and danced.

134
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,438
Hanging from a pole,
"Don't I look like Yuna Kim?"

135
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,399
Then you started running again

136
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,317
and screamed my name.

137
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,278
It was one hell of a spectacle.

138
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,947
That's odd.
I don't have any drinking habits.

139
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,407
Maybe I wasn't feeling well.

140
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,492
So that's normal for you?

141
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,246
Then you threw a tantrum
and insisted we should drink more.

142
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,292
So we came back to my place,
and you drank my homemade wine.

143
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,627
You better pay for the ginseng wine.

144
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,754
I didn't know ox blood was rich in iron.

145
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,089
What?

146
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,883
-It's good.
-Gosh.

147
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,470
Here.

148
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,014
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

149
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,348
Did he just touch her?

150
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,142
What are they doing?

151
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,811
Are you a kid? Wipe your mouth.

152
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,813
They'll get the wrong idea!

153
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,692
You scared me. You looked like Joker
with blood on your lips.

154
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,863
You ruined it all.

155
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,823
What did I do?

156
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,036
I was going to kill that rumor
by eating nonchalantly with you,

157
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,121
so why did you have to wipe my mouth?

158
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,752
Now they're going to ramble on
about how great we look together.

159
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,428
Do you sense any chemistry between them?

160
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,932
If I were to compare it
to music, there's no hook.

161
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,143
-It's so bland.
-I agree.

162
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,230
He wiped her mouth
like Geum-cheol would Bo-ra's.

163
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,565
I sensed fatherly love.

164
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,360
-Right?
-Yes. Something like this.

165
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,236
Yes, exactly.

166
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,073
Maybe nothing happened last night.

167
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,160
Come on! They're adults.
I'm sure something happened.

168
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,412
Seriously.

169
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,956
-Gosh.
-That's enough!

170
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,085
So this was what you were doing.
What a waste of energy.

171
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,337
-Don't you know about privacy?
-Not the spelling.

172
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,132
Why would you gossip?

173
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,301
I just stated what I saw.

174
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,011
-She was wrong, right?
-Gosh.

175
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,930
That's just foolish bravery.

176
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,100
Ruining one's reputation with facts
is also defamation, got it?

177
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,394
-Got it?
-Okay, smarty-pants.

178
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,353
Just leave.

179
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,106
Go on, now.

180
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,565
Fine. Let's go.

181
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,151
I should go prepare
some noodles. Let's go.

182
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,240
I have to go receive coffee beans anyway.

183
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,118
I should go back to my store.

184
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,994
Why is he still there?

185
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,956
Come on!

186
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,543
Wait! My legs cramped up!

187
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,176
I made a new chatroom without Hwa-jeong.

188
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,011
Let's talk more at Bora Supermarket.

189
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,597
Chief Hong could do better than Dr. Yoon.

190
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,724
Of course, he could.

191
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,685
You can say that again.

192
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,439
Compared to Chief Hong,
Dr. Yoon is nothing.

193
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,731
People are lined up for Du-sik.

194
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,527
There's nothing Du-sik lacks.

195
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,405
Every single girl in Gongjin
had a crush on him at least once.

196
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,739
Right.

197
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,991
He's also my first love.

198
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,327
-What?
-Did you think it was you?

199
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,124
Gosh, you're all so brazen, aren't you?

200
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,961
How could you think
Du-sik is better than the dentist?

201
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,380
-What?
-What? Are you siding with her?

202
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,257
-So?
-So? What?

203
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,220
So tell me, Chun-jae.
What's your take on this?

204
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,807
Gam-ri. I told you
to call me Oh Yoon, not Chun-jae.

205
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,100
-Gosh.
-Oh Yoon.

206
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,643
-Oh Yoon.
-Right.

207
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,229
Du-sik? He's a wonderful guy.

208
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,606
Right.

209
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,940
But she's not bad either.

210
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,817
You only get one vote.

211
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,278
-Goodness.
-Hello.

212
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,159
So? Is it Hye-jin or Chief Hong?

213
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,912
You see, Chief Hong is good at everything.

214
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,247
-Right. He is.
-There's nothing he can't do.

215
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,376
-Right? But Dr. Yoon is a dentist,
-Right.

216
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,045
so she must make lots of money.

217
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,713
That tips the scale for her side.

218
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:22,218
While Dr. Yoon can only fix teeth,
Du-sik can fix anything.

219
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,469
You're right.

220
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,471
But he can't fix teeth.

221
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,722
You're spitting everywhere!

222
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,848
Here's my card.

223
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,683
No, it's on me.

224
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,603
No, thanks. I don't let
just any guy pay for my meal.

225
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,731
Good for me, then. Thanks for the meal.

226
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,358
We'd like to pay separately.

227
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,819
That'll be 8,000 won.

228
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,328
Thank you.

229
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,917
Let's stop by Chun-jae's cafe.

230
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,129
I make a mean hangover coffee.

231
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,715
Chief Hong.

232
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,842
Do you like me?

233
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,011
Don't be absurd.

234
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,640
How deluded must you be to misinterpret

235
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,685
an invitation to a cup of coffee
as an "I like you"?

236
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,396
-Do you have Princess Syndrome?
-I just thought…

237
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,065
It wasn't groundless suspicion.

238
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,149
What?

239
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,903
Think about it. You found my shoe for me

240
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,239
and came to my rescue back at the clinic.

241
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,740
You're always around.

242
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,410
I picked up that shoe

243
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,745
so that it wouldn't pollute the ocean.

244
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,623
As for that pervert,
Ms. Gam-ri called me out of the blue…

245
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,584
What? I'm always around you?

246
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,795
It was you who came by last night
and offered to have a meal today.

247
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,505
Forget it, then.

248
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,300
I just wanted to check
to prevent any disasters.

249
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,261
To be frank, we're not a good match.

250
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,308
You and I have different social positions.

251
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:53,893
Social positions?

252
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,354
You know the more similar backgrounds,
the better people get along, right?

253
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,482
Since they have
similar values and lifestyles,

254
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,569
they'll clash less.

255
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,030
But we're…

256
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,951
I wasn't trying to judge you.

257
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,453
I just wanted to clear up--

258
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,997
I pity myself, but I pity you too.

259
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,666
-What do you mean?
-Don't be so calculating.

260
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,335
Isn't it tiring?

261
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,311
Was I too harsh on him?

262
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,357
Don't you agree with me, though?

263
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,277
Objectively speaking,
I'm too good for Chief Hong.

264
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,697
I was tired,
but this helped clear my head.

265
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,284
Everyone says you're the lucky one.

266
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,204
I can't believe them.

267
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,707
I get that he's from Gongjin too,
but that's just not right.

268
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,710
I'm a doctor.
I graduated dentistry school.

269
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,170
Chief Hong is from
Seoul National University.

270
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,421
From what?

271
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,090
Seoul National University.

272
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,176
-Don't lie.
-It's the truth.

273
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,389
He didn't just go to any school in Seoul,

274
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,766
-but Seoul National University?
-Yes.

275
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:21,063
If you think about it, he's been
extraordinary ever since he was little.

276
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,398
-Right.
-Right.

277
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,695
-Sky is black, earth is yellow
-He was always smart since he was little.

278
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,324
-Space and time, vast and limitless
-At age six, he memorized the Cheonjamun.

279
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,662
-Sun, high or low, Moon, full or parsed
-I've never seen anyone like him.

280
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,580
Even with all that playing,

281
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,251
whenever he took a test,
he would always get first place.

282
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,587
He even won gold medal
at the Mathematics Olympiad.

283
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,799
That's not all.
He was a great fighter too.

284
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,884
No one in Gongjin
could hold a candle to him.

285
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,272
He did fight well,

286
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,066
but that's not something to brag about.

287
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,403
He fought to save you
from getting beaten up.

288
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,241
You see, I've always been
a pacifist against violence.

289
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,493
Goodness. That's embarrassing.

290
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,163
But he eventually got into SNU
to study engineering.

291
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,206
-With the highest grades at that.
-Right.

292
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,167
We called him the pride of Gongjin

293
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,794
and even put up banners.

294
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,920
-Right.
-Didn't he

295
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,756
also get a scholarship every year?

296
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,049
-Right.
-Yes.

297
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,383
We sure are proud of him.

298
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,053
Then why does he live the way he does?

299
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,097
They may address him as Chief Hong,

300
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,599
but he's just a part-timer.

301
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:43,020
You see,
there are three mysteries in Gongjin.

302
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,147
-That's so random.
-Listen up.

303
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:50,027
Number one. The real reason
why Ms. Yeo and Mr. Chang divorced.

304
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,988
Right. No one seems to know.

305
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,366
Number two.
Chief Hong's whereabouts for five years.

306
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,578
His whereabouts for five years?

307
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,456
He returned to Gongjin
five years after graduating,

308
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,292
yet no one knows
what he did during those years.

309
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,668
There are only rumors.

310
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,295
REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT OF BAEKDU

311
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,300
I heard that he was sent
to North Korea as a spy.

312
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,976
You're wrong.

313
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,978
It makes more sense that he worked

314
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,607
for the National Intelligence Service
and had to fake his identity.

315
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,321
Wasn't there a rumor
that he took care of lions

316
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,907
while working
for an animal rights group in Africa?

317
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,744
There was also a rumor
that he swam across the Pacific.

318
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,455
You're wrong. It was the mountain.

319
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,125
He climbed Mount Everest
without an oxygen tank.

320
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,338
You all talk about him
in a positive light.

321
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,259
You know there are other rumors.

322
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,104
Some say he was locked
in a mental asylum for all those years.

323
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,691
Others say he was incarcerated for murder.

324
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,943
Why does my ear itch so much?

325
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,070
-Gosh.
-That's ridiculous.

326
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,364
-How absurd. He's not that type.
-Gosh.

327
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,659
You lunatic.
You just have no filter, do you?

328
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,579
Aren't you his friend?
How could you believe those rumors?

329
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,623
-I need a lock.
-Why?

330
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,334
I ought to lock his lips with it.

331
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,752
-Yes, do that.
-Honey, please.

332
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,546
Can you please be quiet?

333
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,757
-What? I just heard those rumors.
-Be quiet!

334
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,467
You always bash me! Damn it!

335
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,678
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear.

336
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,805
-Where's he going?
-Who cares.

337
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,640
-I feel bad for you.
-What's his deal?

338
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,811
Hey. Where did you hear all that?

339
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,980
The Gongjin Friends chat room.

340
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,816
Why did they invite you and not me?

341
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,818
Beats me. They just invited me.

342
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:00,199
So? Who do you think is better off?
Chief Hong or me?

343
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,285
We're expecting a patient soon.

344
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,954
Darn it. Are we really friends?

345
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,832
Do you really think he's better than me?

346
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,044
Hey. Love shouldn't be
about weighing things.

347
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,922
It's all about what's in your heart.

348
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,966
That's rich coming from someone
who only cares about the looks.

349
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,262
You're the one who fell in love
with Choi Eun-cheol at first sight.

350
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,140
That's right. I'm simple like that.

351
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,558
But what about you?

352
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,603
You consider their looks, height,
educational background, and job.

353
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,648
I'm just filtering as much as I can
since I can't date them all.

354
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,609
So? How did that work out for you?

355
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,363
Did you not learn anything
after what Lee Gang-uk did to you?

356
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,494
Hye-jin.

357
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,040
Would you like to know
what the third mystery is?

358
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,625
I'm going to the restroom.

359
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,051
Me and my big mouth.

360
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,122
Gang-uk, your taste
in women changed a lot!

361
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,415
Shut up, you bastard.

362
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,418
She isn't bad for a dental student.

363
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,379
She has a nice body
but terrible fashion sense.

364
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,589
I feel embarrassed whenever we go out.

365
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,217
I thought she'd
get dolled up today, but no.

366
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,386
I almost told her to go home earlier.

367
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,180
But I like how she looks simple.

368
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,684
There's a very fine line
between looking simple and poor.

369
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,312
She only has
a few pieces of clothes and shoes.

370
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,105
She looks pathetic.

371
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,940
Let's just drink.

372
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,150
Damn it.

373
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,284
Please tell them I left
because something urgent came up.

374
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,925
You stayed in touch with Chief Hong
while he was in Seoul, didn't you?

375
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,593
Don't you know what he was up to?

376
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,386
What does it matter?

377
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,181
What's important is
that he's with us right now.

378
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,476
But still, I can't help but feel curious.

379
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,605
It did seem a bit odd
when he returned. Don't you agree?

380
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,273
I don't want to hear it.

381
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:24,236
Enough with your rambling.

382
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,782
Look at all these beautiful flowers.

383
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,825
Right.

384
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:35,122
Isn't this great? I'm glad
we planted so many flowers.

385
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,835
It's so strange. When I was young,
I didn't care to appreciate them.

386
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,963
That's because
we were the flowers back then.

387
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,173
Yes. You're right.

388
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,136
Since they're already in full bloom,

389
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,305
the only thing left
is to wither away graciously.

390
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,267
Look over here!

391
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,977
What?

392
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,525
What? Why'd you take a photo of us?

393
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,820
Take photos of these flowers,

394
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,989
not of old women like us.

395
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,950
-I don't even have makeup on.
-Exactly.

396
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,077
Don't worry.
You're prettier than the flowers.

397
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:18,540
You and your sugarcoated words.
We know you don't mean that.

398
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,919
Though I'm in my 70s,
it still feels great to hear I'm pretty.

399
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,213
-Don't you guys agree with me?
-What?

400
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,349
That sounds great.

401
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,394
Is this a nanta performance or what?

402
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,438
-Don't I have a good rhythm?
-You do.

403
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,565
This is proof that I'm indeed a musician.

404
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,028
Stop eating our snacks and go work.

405
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,948
-Hwa-jeong.
-What?

406
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,658
What will you do

407
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,244
about Ms. Yu Cho-hui?

408
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,291
So that's why you're here.
Am I your next gossiping victim?

409
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,961
Yu Cho-hui? Why does it sound familiar?
I heard that name before.

410
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,965
She's Yeong-guk's first love.
The teacher who taught here 15 years ago.

411
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,718
Yes! I remember!

412
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,428
He fell head over heels in love

413
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,972
-with her.
-Exactly. You remember her, right?

414
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,265
She's back.

415
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,975
-Seriously?
-Yes.

416
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,853
I looked into her, and she's still single.

417
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,106
No way. Yeong-guk
must be on cloud nine then.

418
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,149
And you know,

419
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,860
she's much prettier than her.

420
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,988
Right. Hwa-jeong, she was pretty.
She was definitely pretty.

421
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,035
She's so strong.

422
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,788
-She popped the head.
-Goodness.

423
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,039
That's enough.

424
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,583
He's not my husband anymore.
Why talk to me about her?

425
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,670
I'm just worried about you. That's all.

426
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,004
Why is that?

427
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,132
Although you're divorced,
Yeong-guk oppa must still bother you.

428
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,926
-Yeong-guk oppa?
-Yes.

429
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,971
-Yeong-guk oppa.
-That's understandable.

430
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,723
You treat me like we're the same age,

431
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,558
but why treat him like he's older?

432
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,394
He and I are the same age, you know?

433
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,146
Only your birth year matters
once you become an adult.

434
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,773
Then I'm older than you!

435
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,734
Gosh, you and I were in the same grade,

436
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,611
but not him.

437
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,696
That's enough.

438
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,322
She'll kill you.

439
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,659
Gosh.

440
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,079
Do you want me to treat you
like you're older?

441
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,083
I'll do that. Let me do this for you.

442
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,419
-But you look older.
-Shut up.

443
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,796
-Hwa-jeong, you look young.
-You do.

444
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,720
Cho-hui.

445
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,724
Would you like to walk on the beach…

446
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,936
Gosh, that's too old-fashioned.

447
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,360
Cho-hui, you like coffee, don't you?

448
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,990
Would you like to have
a cup of iced Americano… No.

449
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,868
A cup of I.A. with me?

450
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,120
This is driving me crazy.

451
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,749
Just send it to her!
You're so frustrating to watch.

452
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,001
How much did you read?

453
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,671
A drive, a movie,
a walk, and a cup of coffee?

454
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,131
That's a lot of dates.

455
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,468
I'm going to file a complaint about you,

456
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,470
a civil servant, slacking off at work.

457
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,930
Texting her isn't something
to be ashamed of.

458
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,558
You've been divorced
for three whole years.

459
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,935
You're right.

460
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,230
What's stopping you?
You're reunited with your first love.

461
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,691
And both of you happen to be single.

462
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,693
Isn't this fate?

463
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,321
It's the perfect time to ask her out.

464
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,657
Send her the text and come in.

465
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,580
Exactly.

466
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,750
Why now, and not back then?

467
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,145
Thank you. You saved my life.

468
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,023
No, I saved your camera's life.

469
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,568
A person can be rescued and dried,
but a camera dies right away.

470
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,696
Shock-proof doesn't mean waterproof.

471
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,407
You know your way around cameras.

472
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,367
What? Wait.

473
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,914
This was the last model…
I hear it's really rare.

474
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,208
The lens was harder to get.

475
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,377
Only 500 of them were produced worldwide.

476
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,505
Let's keep some distance from each other.

477
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,299
Sure. How did you find such a rare item?

478
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,426
It was a lot of legwork.
It took a few years.

479
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,304
Will you sell it to me?
Please do. I'll pay you twice as much.

480
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:10,767
Gosh, is it a trend nowadays to be brazen
and demand more from your lifesaver?

481
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,101
Would you sell it?

482
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,397
Well… Then can I touch it for a moment?

483
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,026
Let me just hold it. You can hold mine.

484
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,861
-Deal?
-Deal.

485
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,326
This looks sturdy.

486
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,746
Did the camera and the lens
cost about 20 million won?

487
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,373
It was a bit over that.

488
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,919
I believe this was made in 1957.

489
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,420
You took great care of it.

490
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,006
Judging by the price,
I doubt this is just a hobby.

491
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,842
Is this your job?

492
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,427
Well, yes. I guess you can say that.

493
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,054
What do you mean?

494
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,473
I take photos and videos.

495
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,643
Are you here on a location shoot?

496
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,479
I'm not sure
the neighborhood counts as that.

497
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,731
I see. You live nearby.

498
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,943
Then do you know
how to get to the observatory?

499
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,572
Look.

500
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,491
Take a left in front of that forked road.

501
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,202
Walk 30m, and you'll see a barbershop.

502
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,290
Take a left, and you'll see a set
of stairs that lead to the mountains.

503
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,667
Just go straight. Simple, right?

504
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,336
Yes. Thank you for everything today.

505
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,089
We should always lend a hand
to others. Have a safe trip.

506
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,049
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Bye.

507
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:40,273
Hey! Take a left, not a right! Take…

508
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,278
Darn it.

509
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,324
Hey!

510
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:50,992
Hey!

511
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,330
Why am I here?

512
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,292
This is a killer view.

513
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,711
The breeze is so refreshing too.

514
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,672
You're such a happy-go-lucky guy.
First time in Gongjin?

515
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,967
No. This is already
my fourth time here this year.

516
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,094
Did you hide treasure here? Why so often?

517
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,555
Gongjin wasn't my original destination,

518
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,974
but I lost my way.

519
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,145
Gosh. Have you ever thought
about using recent technology?

520
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,439
There's GPS or online maps.

521
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,858
Even they couldn't be of help.

522
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:29,113
But because of that, I stumbled
across this great place, Gongjin.

523
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,118
You're an optimist
with a bad sense of direction.

524
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,205
It's okay to get lost
or take the long route every now and then.

525
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,459
Every time that happened,
life took me on an interesting ride.

526
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,090
I hope self-driving cars will
be available soon.

527
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,718
It worries me.

528
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,265
People like you really need those things.

529
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,395
I'm hungry.

530
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,439
Just enjoy the view.

531
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,405
Why do you look so glum?

532
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,324
Embarrassed about mentioning

533
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,827
social positions to a guy
from a prestigious school?

534
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,037
That wasn't why.

535
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,373
But thanks for reminding me.

536
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,544
There's something
I'm really curious about.

537
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,922
Did you really not sleep with him?

538
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,173
Hey.

539
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,551
But then again,

540
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:35,096
a conservative girl like you
would never give in to your desires.

541
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,310
I think I blacked out yesterday.

542
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,855
-Completely?
-Not completely,

543
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,274
but I only remember bits and pieces.

544
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,609
I hung on a streetlamp

545
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,945
and laughed like a lunatic.

546
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,072
What should I do?

547
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,033
You don't need to tell me.

548
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,076
Stop thinking and forget about it.

549
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,122
Do you know why
it's so painful after blacking out?

550
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,043
It's because you try so hard
to remember everything.

551
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,253
What's done is done. Just press delete,

552
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,422
forget about everything, and feel at ease.

553
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,300
-Should I do that?
-Yes.

554
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,098
But when you blacked out,

555
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,641
did it become rated R?

556
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,893
Hey!

557
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,479
Hello.

558
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,897
-Hello.
-Hello.

559
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,523
Don't you live next door?

560
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,858
Yes.

561
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,527
I moved in a few days ago,
and I finally get to greet you.

562
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,987
My name is Yu Cho-hui.

563
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,073
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Hye-jin.

564
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,327
We work at Yoon Dental Clinic over there.

565
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,788
Stop by if your teeth ever ache.

566
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,458
Goodness. Are you the doctor
who'll be visiting the school tomorrow?

567
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,212
Yes. I am.

568
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,672
I teach at Cheongjin Elementary School.

569
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,924
What a small world.

570
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,467
I see.

571
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,426
I hope we get along.

572
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,137
Right. I hope we get along as well.

573
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,639
All right.

574
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,308
Hwajeong Raw Fish Restaurant?

575
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,560
All right.

576
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,771
Where should we sit?

577
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,731
You can sit by the window.

578
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,150
Are you sure this place sells tasty food?

579
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,236
Come on. I'm telling you.

580
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,905
All right. Pick what you want.

581
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,281
Sit down and pick with me.

582
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,367
No, I should take your order.

583
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:20,868
Sorry?

584
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,745
Is this your restaurant?

585
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,666
No, it's not. But since I'm here,
I might as well help out.

586
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,001
Can I just give you what I want?

587
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,129
-Sorry?
-I'll be back soon.

588
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,589
Wait… But…

589
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,510
That's some smooth touting.

590
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,097
Gosh.

591
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:53,442
Goodness, what big portions.
And these are some special mussels.

592
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,362
Most people from Seoul
think they're just regular mussels.

593
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,657
You see, I'm quite the gourmet.

594
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,284
I see.

595
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,206
How is this so soft?

596
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,417
Well, it's because they were fished.

597
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,962
Those caught in traps
harden due to stress.

598
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,884
-I want to introduce this on my show.
-Your show?

599
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,761
I get it. You did mention
that you took videos.

600
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,096
Actually, I'm…

601
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,056
-You must be a mukbang Youtuber.
-What?

602
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,142
If I'd known, I would've given you more.

603
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,143
No, I'm actually--

604
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,896
You have to work harder.

605
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,606
I watch a lot of mukbang shows,

606
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,108
but you don't look familiar.

607
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,359
-Really?
-Yes.

608
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,404
If you want to survive in that field,
you should stand out.

609
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,780
Go safe and you'll flop.

610
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,908
I do hear that often.

611
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,036
They say my shows are always the same
and want something new.

612
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,913
Of course. It's all about variety.

613
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,457
Come up with something new, okay?

614
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,833
I made this. Eat up.

615
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,048
That hit home.

616
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,258
Whatever.

617
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,977
You're so good at calligraphy.

618
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,938
What are you writing?

619
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,736
Hoe-ja-jeong-ri, Geo-ja-pil-ban.

620
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,781
"Those who meet must part,

621
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,242
and those who leave must return."

622
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,911
That's true.

623
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,374
I should check your school notice.

624
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,669
Do you have any homework?

625
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,462
No, I don't.

626
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,591
Dr. Yoon will be teaching you
how to prevent cavities tomorrow.

627
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,845
Right. Don't you have
a new homeroom teacher?

628
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,014
How is she?

629
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,226
I like her. She's pretty and kind.

630
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,604
Really? What's her name?

631
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,691
Yu Cho-hui.

632
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,443
Ms. Yu Cho-hui.

633
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:13,916
HOE-JA-JEONG-RI
GEO-JA-PIL-BAN

634
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,378
STUDENT INFORMATION

635
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,755
CHANG I-JUN

636
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,262
FATHER: CHANG YEONG-GUK
MOTHER: YEO HWA-JEONG

637
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,685
NEW MESSAGE

638
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,608
Cho-hui, this is Yeong-guk.

639
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,486
Are you free this weekend?

640
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,072
Would you like to have dinner together?

641
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,163
So? How do you like the food?

642
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,333
Overall, it's not bad.
The seasoning isn't bad either.

643
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,252
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

644
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:04,216
Right. Pardon my cold review.
It's because my work is related to food.

645
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,886
-It's good.
-I see.

646
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,388
How's the large halibut?
It was freshly caught at sea.

647
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,765
To be frank,

648
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,143
that dish disappointed me the most.

649
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,644
It did?

650
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,689
It's the breeding season
for halibut, so they're not as tasty.

651
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,610
And large-sized fish
are best eaten fermented than freshly raw.

652
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,197
Hold up. I agree with the former
since that's the law of nature,

653
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,698
but not the latter.

654
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,785
If you want to enjoy the freshness,
you should have it right away.

655
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,705
Hold on. I think you have
a misconception about fermenting.

656
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,458
Eating it raw means
you're having it right away.

657
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,502
If you slice it,
wrap it in a plastic wrap,

658
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,380
and put it in the fridge for 5 to 6 hours.
That's fermenting.

659
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,839
They're both fresh.

660
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,008
Then why would you refrigerate it?

661
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,843
That's the beauty of waiting.

662
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,845
-Unbelievable.
-It'll improve

663
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,013
the texture and taste.

664
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,265
That's enough. None of that is true.

665
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,061
I was born and raised by the seaside.

666
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,230
I had more fish
in my lifetime than you did.

667
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,315
You just ate them
because they were around,

668
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,193
but I searched far and wide
for good quality raw fish.

669
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,696
Then how about this?

670
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,824
Let's call and ask Baek Jong-won.

671
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,950
-Baek Jong-won?
-Yes.

672
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,744
You know him?

673
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,747
Yes. And very well, at that. Here.

674
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,124
BAEK JONG-WON

675
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,004
The person you have called is unavailable.

676
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,424
-Please try your call again later.
-Why isn't he picking up?

677
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,217
Maybe he blocked your number.

678
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,261
I didn't take you for a liar.

679
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,389
I'm not. He helped me out a lot.
I know him very well.

680
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,851
I do too. I could say hi in person
since I saw him on TV all the time.

681
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,270
-That's not it.
-That's enough. Forget it.

682
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,648
We may not have fermented fish,
but we do have fermented sikhye.

683
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,607
I'll bring some.

684
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,526
He must be a fraud.

685
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,195
Gosh, I…

686
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,865
I feel wrongfully accused.

687
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,451
Why isn't he picking up?

688
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,161
The phone has been turned off.

689
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,913
-You will be forwarded to voicemail.
-Did he really block me?

690
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:07,131
Now, we will rest our body and soul.

691
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:11,510
Put down everything
that has happened today.

692
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,516
Chief Hong. Do you like me?

693
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,311
Don't be absurd.

694
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:27,443
Keep your mind focused
and relax your body.

695
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,450
You and I have different social positions.

696
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,244
I'm a doctor.
I graduated from dental school.

697
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,079
Chief Hong is from
Seoul National University.

698
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,960
Breathe normally.

699
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,632
Inhale and exhale.

700
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,972
I pity myself, but I pity you too.

701
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,767
Don't be so calculating. Isn't it tiring?

702
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,336
Mi-seon, what are you doing?

703
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,004
Constipated again?

704
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,382
No, it's actually the opposite.

705
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,218
I'm a bit busy
going through both extremes.

706
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,845
-What did you have last night?
-Beer.

707
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,474
I was told to stay away from alcohol
due to the nature of my constitution.

708
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,685
You're ridiculous.

709
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:46,897
Hey, I'm sorry,
but you should go alone. I'm done for.

710
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,315
Are you serious?

711
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,402
How am I supposed to teach
for an hour without an assistant?

712
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,488
I've already found a substitute.

713
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,447
Who?

714
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,491
You'll see.

715
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,295
CHEONGJIN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

716
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,756
Ms. Dentist, over here.

717
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,511
Darn it. Mi-seon, you're dead meat.

718
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,439
Hey, Cho-hui.

719
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,399
Hey, Yeong-guk.

720
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,778
I actually texted you last night.

721
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:39,283
I know. But it was quite late
at night, so I didn't reply.

722
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,659
I see.

723
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,582
Feel free to text me
whenever you want. You can do that.

724
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:55,549
I'm here to sit in
on the cavity prevention class

725
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,344
since our town is hosting the program.

726
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,803
Really?

727
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,930
And you see,

728
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,434
-I have a son.
-Dad!

729
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,646
Hey! Come here. Goodness.

730
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,107
What is it?

731
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,072
Honey.

732
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,077
Mom, Dad. This is my homeroom teacher.

733
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,994
What?

734
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,872
Ms. Yu, my mom and dad.

735
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,166
Hello, I'm I-jun's mother.

736
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,918
Hello.

737
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,088
I'm Yu Cho-hui, his new homeroom teacher.

738
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,558
Hwa-jeong.

739
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,061
Goodness. Is she out?

740
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,314
Yes. Ms. Yeo is at I-jun's school.

741
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,857
Why?

742
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,528
She went to sit in on some special class
for kids on behalf of the parents.

743
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,366
Oh, dear. Has the war finally begun?

744
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,666
Sorry. I was walking too close
to a conservative girl like you, wasn't I?

745
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,167
Don't be ridiculous.

746
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:16,713
I just don't want my thoughtless actions
to cause any more misunderstanding,

747
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,425
such as you thinking I like you.

748
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,218
That's enough.

749
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,804
We sure live in a heartless world,

750
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,932
seeing how my small act of kindness
was misconstrued as interest.

751
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,100
I said stop.

752
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:31,353
Let me make this clear.
I didn't come here because I missed you.

753
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,648
I just accepted a part-time job.
That's all.

754
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,069
Gosh, you're teasing me
an awful lot for one small mistake.

755
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:44,533
That's right. I'm planning
to keep this up for a while.

756
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,996
By the way,
are you sure you can assist me properly?

757
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,542
Don't tell me
you even have a dental certificate.

758
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,918
Hurry up.

759
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:02,551
-I went to the dentist after eating
-I went to the dentist after eating

760
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,803

762

-I cried

763
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,395
Even a certificate in recreation?

764
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,732
-But I'm a brave kid
-But I'm a brave kid

765
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:20,277
-So I got my teeth fixed
-So I got my teeth fixed

766
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,406

00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,076

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,830

00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,666
-Three times a day

770
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,461
Once again. "My teeth hurt so much."

771
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:41,256
-Ouch, my teeth hurt
-Ouch, my teeth hurt

772
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,177
-I went to the dentist after eating
-I went to the dentist after eating

773
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,262
-A ton of candy

774
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,392
Guys, how do we get cavities?

775
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,270
Yes, I-jun?

776
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,608
The bacteria in your mouth
break down sugar or starch,

777
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,986
convert it into acid,
and erode your teeth.

778
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,739
Correct. Applaud.

779
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,742
Applause.

780
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,458
Now, let's learn how to brush our teeth.

781
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,001
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

782
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,711
How do you brush your teeth?

783
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:25,300
I slowly brush my teeth
up and down and on both sides like this.

784
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,137
Well… Wait. You shouldn't do it that way.

785
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,393
You should never do what he does.

786
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,312
Watch. Hold the toothbrush like so.

787
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,773
Imagine vibrating it.

788
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,150
-Brush gently.
-Like this?

789
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,277
-Right.
-Gently.

790
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,404
-This is how you do it.
-All right.

791
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,447
-Okay!
-Okay!

792
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,659
That'll be the end. Now, questions.

793
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,202
Any questions?

794
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,246
-Are you guys dating?
-What?

795
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,247
Did you kiss?

796
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,500
Kids, don't put her on the spot like that.

797
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,751
Are you getting married?

798
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,920
-Why do you like him?
-Are you in love?

799
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,843
Listen. I'll only answer
teeth-related questions.

800
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,054
Guys, my parents told me

801
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,640
that two nights ago,

802
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,185
Dr. Yoon and Chief Hong…

803
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,439
What was that for?

804
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,191
Stop putting her in an awkward position.

805
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,955
Where should we put these chairs?

806
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,874
Don't worry. I'll put them away.

807
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,418
Gosh, how will you carry such heavy…

808
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,839
It'll be too heavy for you. Let me.

809
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,008
-But…
-Unbelievable.

810
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,595
He never lifted a finger at home.

811
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,555
What is he trying to prove?

812
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,559
Come on, now.
I'm not trying to prove anything.

813
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,811
Ms. Yeo, shouldn't you leave?

814
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,689
What? Is that what you want?

815
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,234
When did I ever say that?

816
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,527
It was just a question.

817
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,740
I-jun's homeroom teacher
is my new next-door neighbor.

818
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:16,370
And I sense
a love triangle among those three.

819
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,498
It could even be produced into a movie.

820
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,501
Ms. Yeo. I mean, Hwa-jeong.

821
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:26,672
If you're free this weekend,
let's have a meal together.

822
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,048
What?

823
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,009
Wait. You're eating with her, not with me?

824
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,386
You're invited too.

825
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,596
Let's all have a meal together.

826
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,309
But aren't you busy this weekend?

827
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,603
No, I have time.

828
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,899
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

829
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,693
Are you not feeling well?

830
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,861
Ms. Yeo, what's going on? Are you in pain?

831
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,947
Gosh.

832
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,865
Do you have a toothache?

833
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,659
I think so.

834
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,077
Oh, dear.

835
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,954
Where's the nurse's office?

836
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,706
Yes. This way.

837
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,915
Walk slowly.

838
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,167
-Goodness.
-Is it very painful?

839
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,837
-Does this one hurt?
-No.

840
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,257
-What about this one?
-It's fine.

841
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,258
Really?

842
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,678
-How about--
-That hurts.

843
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,513
-It does?
-Yes.

844
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,598
-How about here?
-There too.

845
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,517
It hurts a lot.

846
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,518
I see.

847
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,814
Do you have a habit
of clenching your teeth?

848
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,942
I think so. I clench them in my sleep too.

849
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,778
I think it's myofascial pain syndrome.

850
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,113
Myofascial pain syndrome?

851
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,241
Yes. All the nerves close to your face

852
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,869
may make you mistake
pain caused around your head

853
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,455
for that in your molars.

854
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,664
Then what should I do?

855
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:47,085
Ice and heat the area alternately
for today and come to the clinic tomorrow.

856
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,172
If you're in too much pain,
you can take painkillers.

857
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,757
Thank you, Dr. Yoon.

858
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,509
The pain went on for a while,
so I thought I had cavities.

859
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,596
Most people automatically think
toothaches stem from the teeth.

860
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,264
But at times, that's not the case.

861
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,142
So it's important to find out

862
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,352
where the pain is coming from.

863
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,605
That way, you can receive
proper treatment.

864
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,649
Right.

865
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,448
Ma'am, I need anti-diarrheal medicine.

866
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,074
One minute.

867
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,041
Ms. Pyo.

868
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,544
Hello, what brings you here?

869
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,339
To get some dental floss.
You told me to floss every day.

870
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,882
Right, I did.

871
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,425
Are you feeling unwell?

872
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,346
Well, I have a slight headache.

873
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,807
Ma'am, did you say
anti-diarrheal medicine?

874
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,726
Is it serious? Watery?

875
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,607
Ms. Pyo.

876
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,817
Ms. Pyo!

877
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,113
If it's not that bad,
I advise you not to take the medicine.

878
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,951
Drink a lot of lukewarm water.
Sports drinks are good too.

879
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,744
It's better to let it flow out

880
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,996
than to force it to stop.

881
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,709
How can you talk about it
as if it's nothing?

882
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,796
Because I went through it as well.
It's nothing embarrassing.

883
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,382
Are you always this kind?

884
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:16,883
Sorry?

885
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,678
I've only dated bad guys.

886
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,764
I see.

887
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:27,644
What's your ideal type?
Is there a certain type you like?

888
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,192
My ideal type is

889
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,113
quite simple. Someone who's gentle
but strong on the inside.

890
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,699
Someone who's well-mannered
and soft-spoken.

891
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,368
Someone who exudes soft charisma.
I especially like women

892
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,245
who look good in hanbok.

893
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,038
I see.

894
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,792
I love watching historical dramas.

895
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,964
We're polar opposites.
This is never going to work.

896
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,050
Damn it.

897
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,949
What does this mean?

898
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,243
-Pay me.
-Pay you?

899
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,287
Ms. Pyo said you'd pay me for today.

900
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,957
That darn girl. I'm going
to take this out of her paycheck.

901
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,209
No wonder they say
the rich are the greediest.

902
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,878
She's your one and only friend.

903
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,463
I was just joking.

904
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,175
But I don't have cash.
I'll wire it to you later.

905
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,718
Buy me food then. I'm hungry.

906
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:50,060
What… What do you want to eat?

907
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,787
Why did we have to come
all the way here for a meal?

908
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,164
Too many prying eyes in Gongjin.

909
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,749
But not here, right?

910
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,835
Gosh. We might as well crawl
to the restaurant.

911
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,421
-Are we good?
-What?

912
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,923
Gosh.

913
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,716
I'm coming.

914
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,635
What should we have?

915
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,846
-Snow crab?
-No. Something else.

916
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,390
Then it's raw fish.

917
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,642
-Do you have right-eyed flounders?
-Yes.

918
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,228
Please slice one as it is
and season the other one.

919
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,397
Sure. I'll bring it over soon.

920
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,648
-Okay.
-Okay.

921
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,279
I'm sorry about the other day.

922
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,366
I was wrong.

923
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,788
You know, the "social position" talk.

924
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,041
Forget it. No need to be
sorry for your opinion.

925
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,418
Still…

926
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,337
By the way,

927
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,507
you're from Seoul National University?

928
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,550
How did you know?

929
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,176
You really studied engineering?

930
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,970
-What? You can't believe it?
-No.

931
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,223
What are you doing?

932
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:13,935
Solve this.

933
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,146
What is this?

934
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,605
A CSAT question.

935
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:20,608
Who knows? You could be lying.

936
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,452
Let's see.

937
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,090
Here. The answer is number five.

938
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,009
-Correct.
-Happy?

939
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,765
One more.

940
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,641
Unbelievable.

941
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,114
Gosh.

942
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,285
Then this one.

943
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,082
Negative 27.

944
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,752
-You even solved this?
-I did it in my head.

945
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,753
Last one.

946
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,671
-I promise.
-Come on.

947
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,807
Correct.

948
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,392
You got it right.

949
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,269
You know you're childish, right?

950
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,064
-Yes.
-Happy now?

951
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:44,109
Not at all. I'm even more frustrated now.

952
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,902
Why would you live like this?

953
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,195
Then how should I?

954
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,782
Live an honest life.
You should reap what you sow.

955
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,743
I'm realistic.

956
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,204
If there's an input,
there ought to be an output.

957
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,374
And if your definition of output
is money and success,

958
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:02,669
I must look like
an awfully inefficient individual.

959
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,254
I can't deny that.

960
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,965
-That's why you're a lost cause.
-What do you mean?

961
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,758
You're so narrow-minded.

962
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,638
Money and success aren't
the only valuable things in life.

963
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,559
Happiness, self-contentment,
world peace, love…

964
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,522
Anyway, life isn't
a mathematical equation.

965
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,192
It doesn't have a clear answer.
There's no right answer either.

966
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,904
You're just given a problem,
and it's up to you how you solve it.

967
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,783
Fine, I get it. You and your nagging.

968
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,453
All right. I'll give you
a question this time.

969
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,787
Let's see.

970
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,873
This will do.

971
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,586
Chief Hong, I was
the top student in my math class.

972
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,088
It's not easy to get into dental school.

973
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,300
Unbelievable. Give it.

974
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,935
-Shouldn't this be 5, not 2?
-It was a mistake.

975
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,647
I have a headache.

976
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,399
What's taking so long?

977
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,318
Hold on. Give me a minute.

978
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,072
My goodness.

979
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:17,202
Are you guys kids or something?
Why did you scribble on the table?

980
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:22,540
You've doodled from end to end
all over the table.

981
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,126
That looks delicious. I'm sorry.

982
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,545
You were saved by the bell.

983
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,257
Had she come a bit later,
I would've solved it. What a pity.

984
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,905
When did gray hair grow here?

985
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,919
They say time is fair for everyone,

986
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,046
but it seems like
I'm the only one who aged.

987
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,408
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

988
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,243
Hwa-jeong, it's Cho-hui.

989
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,120
Did you get treated well?

990
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:46,040
She's as kind to a fault as back then.

991
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,751
VILLAGE CHIEF CHANG YEONG-GUK

992
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,340
COME GET THE TRASH BAGS
FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

993
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,020
Wait. I-jun, your tooth is growing.

994
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:08,813
Really?

995
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:13,318
Yes. Soon, you'll have all adult teeth.

996
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,653
I hope it'll be soon.

997
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,155
Really?

998
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,699
Well, I don't.

999
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:21,618
Why not?

1000
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,369
Because I'm sad.

1001
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,331
I'm sad to see you grow up.

1002
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,710
I-jun, don't grow up too quickly, okay?

1003
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:35,715
It's here.

1004
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,717
It's growing.

1005
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,219
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1006
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,263
That was good.

1007
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,560
You have sauce on your lips.

1008
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,316
-No. To your right.
-Here?

1009
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,360
A bit up. Over there.

1010
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,533
I can do it myself.

1011
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,496
What? What's the problem?

1012
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,164
Let's go if you're done.

1013
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,041
What's with you?

1014
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,131
They didn't say
it was going to rain today.

1015
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,800
It's okay. I have an umbrella.

1016
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,428
I always carry one
in case it rains, you know.

1017
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,181
Hold on. Where did it go?

1018
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,433
Looking for this?

1019
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,520
Why do you have it?

1020
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,772
You left it that day.

1021
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,149
I see.

1022
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,112
Let's walk to the car together.

1023
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,887
Are you nuts? I'm all drenched!

1024
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,973
So? Don't you feel refreshed?

1025
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,643
No, I don't.
It feels uncomfortable and damp.

1026
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,980
So what?
Let your hair down and just feel it.

1027
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,692
You're bound to meet
unexpected situations in life.

1028
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,987
Even if you use an umbrella,
you'll end up getting drenched.

1029
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,157
Just put your hands up
and welcome the rain.

1030
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,327
Let's just play.

1031
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,832
-Stop that.
-Why? It's fun!

1032
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:33,916
Stop it.

1033
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,423
Wait!

1034
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,637
They're having a blast.

1035
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,476
Timeout.

1036
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:37,855
Let's call a truce. I'm exhausted.

1037
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,732
Agreed.

1038
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,777
So? Getting wet in the rain
isn't that bad, right?

1039
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,863
Who knows? I might catch a cold tomorrow.

1040
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,341
It's so hot.

1041
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,910
It's better now.

1042
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:09,447
You're not running a fever,
but let's stop here just in case.

1043
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,172
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

1044
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,507
About…

1045
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,427
that night…

1046
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,181
Are you sure nothing happened?

1047
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,977
Yes. Nothing happened.

1048
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,605
Really?

1049
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,483
Yes.

1050
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:12,593
Are you still having the same nightmare?

1051
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,138
Yes.

1052
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,113
Hye-jin, you're losing it.

1053
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,030
Is anything the matter?

1054
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,533
He obviously remembers
but is playing dumb.

1055
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,035
I'm only asking out of pure curiosity,

1056
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,703
but what do you think of Chief Hong?

1057
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,164
I get that being nosy is incurable,

1058
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,291
but I'd appreciate less of your concern.

1059
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,793
That really hurts my feelings.

1060
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,128
You have the wrong idea.

1061
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,006
Why does it have to be at my expense?

1062
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,926
It's upsetting and I'm offended.

1063
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,555
That drink sure was strong.

1064
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,056
You exhaust me.

1065
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,183
I don't care for the rumors.

1066
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,269
I'd like for you
to stop crossing the line.

1067
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:15,192
