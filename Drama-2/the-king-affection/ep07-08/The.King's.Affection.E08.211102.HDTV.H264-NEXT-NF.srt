THE KING'S AFFECTION

00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:07,853
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS
AN "EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT"

3
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:09,613
AND IS SUPPORTED BY MCST AND KOCCA

4
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:11,421
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,187
ACTUAL PEOPLE, INCIDENTS,
ASSOCIATIONS, OR LOCATIONS

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,291
You must not do this.
Your Royal Highness, no!

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,673
Oh, no. Your Royal Highness…

8
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:36,133
Your Royal Highness.

9
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:51,315
Gosh…

10
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:20,052
Why did you do it?

11
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:24,806
Why did you do such a thing?

12
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:29,853
I put my faith in you.

13
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,482
Yet, you disappointed me.

14
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,411
You did the right thing.

15
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,290
Your Royal Highness,

16
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:15,792
you did the right thing.

17
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:48,658
You are a brave, bold man
who can beat up the Chief Eunuch.

18
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,702
I'm sure you can handle this much.

19
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:53,455
That's enough.

20
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:56,958
Let me just treat your hand.

21
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:19,981
This might not be the right time
to bring this up,

22
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:24,903
but I know that you saw me
at the guesthouse.

23
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,616
I know I shouldn't have been there,
so I'm sorry if that disappointed you.

24
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,076
But I can promise you that

25
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,162
I didn't do anything to disgrace myself.

26
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:37,457
So in case you misread the situation--

27
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,209
I never did.

28
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:44,047
I know that

29
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:47,926
you are not the type of person
who would do such a thing.

30
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:51,680
Then…

31
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:56,393
why were you so distant toward me
during the banquet?

32
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,479
Well…

33
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:08,822
I didn't want you to be
in a tight spot because of me.

34
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:10,407
That's why.

35
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:15,036
I feel the same way.

36
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,748
So if you know how I feel,

37
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,002
please don't be distant toward me anymore.

38
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:31,469
There. It's all done.

39
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,404
EPISODE 8

40
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:19,392
I'm really fine, Your Royal Highness.

41
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:21,978
Your hand is hurt too.

42
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:24,856
I told you not to move.

43
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:35,575
How beautiful.

44
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,745
Your hair looks beautiful

45
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,207
even when it's short.

46
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:55,512
I have a chance to get my hair done by you
thanks to the Chief Eunuch.

47
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:59,349
This is truly a blessing.

48
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:09,651
Your Royal Highness.

49
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:19,160
The Chief Eunuch's subordinate is here.

50
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,830
He invited you,
the Vice Minister of Rites,

51
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:24,040
and Royal Tutor Jung for a drink.

52
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,376
He did?

53
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,130
Yes. Should I tell them
to station some royal guards?

54
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:36,803
That's all right. I can't afford
to use a cheap trick like that.

55
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:38,430
There can't be any more problems.

56
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,185
I will get going first.

57
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:47,564
Go and bring Royal Tutor Jung
to the guesthouse.

58
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:48,815
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

59
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:14,591
It seems the Vice Minister of Rites
hasn't arrived yet.

60
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:17,886
Men can resolve
this kind of matter over drinks.

61
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:20,972
There is no point
in bothering other people.

62
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,516
Please sit.

63
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,446
As a peace offering,

64
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,740
I thought I could show you
something interesting.

65
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:40,200
So I asked you to come.

66
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:41,534
What do you say?

67
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:46,790
Come on out.

68
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:19,489
From what I hear,

69
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:22,575
your bodyguard is
the best swordsman in Joseon.

70
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,206
Who do you think will win?

71
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:40,427
That doesn't interest me.

72
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,972
If this is why you asked to see me,
you can count me out.

73
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:46,099
I will head back now.

74
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,023
Let's go back.

75
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,834
Stop it! What do you think you're doing?

76
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,720
My guard is the best swordsman in Ming.

77
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:27,932
But he wasn't with me
when I was getting beaten to a pulp.

78
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:32,270
So I thought he deserved a chance
to show me he's worth his salary.

79
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:34,898
Stop this immediately!

80
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,817
Why? You were having fun
when you were beating me up.

81
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:40,862
But you don't want to see
your man getting beaten up?

82
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,473
I told you to stop!

83
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,978
Do you think you'll be able

84
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:17,148
to leave Joseon unscathed
if you leave a scratch on me?

85
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:25,990
Are you all right?

86
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,615
If you put a finger on the Crown Prince…

87
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:10,827
I will…

88
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,080
kill you.

89
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,250
With my own hands.

90
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,295
Royal Tutor Jung.

91
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:32,515
Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

92
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:36,185
Your Royal Highness!

93
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:40,273
Your Royal Highness. Goodness.

94
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:42,734
-Oh, no.
-What is going on here?

95
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,403
-Bring a physician.
-Yes, my lord!

96
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:47,989
Oh, no. Are you all right?

97
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:56,205
This is no fun.

98
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:09,177
How dare you pull out your sword
in front of His Royal Highness?

99
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,142
How dare you do this?

100
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,729
It wasn't my intention,
but the fight seems to have gotten heated.

101
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:24,025
If you are disgruntled,
take it up with me.

102
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:26,069
Leave the innocent alone.

103
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,988
How could I dare to do so?

104
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,866
Well, don't you keep them around,

105
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:33,910
so they can take your place in punishment

106
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,412
and do your dirty work for you?

107
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,749
Why are you doing this?

108
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,294
-What is it that you want?
-What do I want?

109
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,799
Right. There is one thing
I want from Joseon.

110
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:59,519
People like you who were born
with a silver spoon

111
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:02,563
are hypocrites who pretend
to care for the people.

112
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:05,566
And I want to destroy people like you.

113
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:15,201
I guess we will have to drink next time,
Your Royal Highness.

114
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:38,933
This way.

115
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:41,811
Put him down here.

116
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:49,318
Oh, no. What should we do?

117
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,070
Do you think he'll wake up?

118
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:53,573
Fortunately, he stopped bleeding.

119
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:57,201
But the cut is too deep.
We'll have to observe him for a while.

120
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:02,165
What on earth happened?

121
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:50,379
My lord. We have an urgent message
from the guesthouse.

122
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:54,091
The Crown Prince's bodyguard was
badly hurt by the Chief Eunuch's guard.

123
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:56,928
How is the Crown Prince?

124
00:15:57,011 --> 00:16:00,014
Yes. He returned to his quarters just now.

125
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:06,103
Is the Chief Eunuch at the guesthouse?

126
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,105
<i>What did you say?</i>

127
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:13,820
How dare you talk about her here?

128
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,990
Please hear me out. I just wanted to say
there's no reason to shed blood here.

129
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:20,576
For that poor girl's sake.

130
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:23,579
You cannot do this to me!

131
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,081
What did you say?

132
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,222
I will visit you tomorrow night.

133
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,057
So wait quietly.

134
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,019
Yes, my lord.

135
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,063
Goodness.

136
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:06,998
What brings you here this late at night?

137
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:11,586
I heard that your guard
badly hurt the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

138
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:16,048
Not only did you cut off the hair
of a court lady from his quarters,

139
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:17,967
but you also hurt his guard.

140
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,136
I would like to know why.

141
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:26,475
Why are you making such a fuss
over your subordinates?

142
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:31,439
Right. I heard a very interesting story.

143
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,818
Someone the Emperor trusts very dearly

144
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:38,571
has been stealing offerings
to the Emperor.

145
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:44,660
I heard this person in question is also
stealing the Emperor's private assets.

146
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,790
Don't you want to know who that person is?

147
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:54,170
Are you trying to threaten me

148
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,297
with that groundless rumor?

149
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,675
I hear that the Emperor
has high expectations for you.

150
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,511
The higher they are,
the harder they will fall.

151
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,806
Unless you want there to be a big scandal,

152
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,478
I advise you to behave
for the remainder of your trip here.

153
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:17,652
How ridiculous.

154
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:23,866
I don't see why
you would want to do this to me.

155
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,497
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

156
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:33,501
I have many reasons why I must.

157
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,529
<i>"It is why traitor Kang Hwa-gil
will hereby be executed by beheading."</i>

158
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,959
Don't move. Your wound is severe.

159
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,297
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

160
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,552
I have failed my duty to protect you.

161
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:27,763
Do not say that.

162
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,058
I have failed to protect you too.

163
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:39,859
What is it that infuriated
and saddened you this much?

164
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:44,447
To the point that
you were suffering even in your dream.

165
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,294
You still need to recover.

166
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,131
You shouldn't move. Just rest up here.

167
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:33,037
Hyun.

168
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,123
Is your bodyguard all right?

169
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,003
Yes. He passed a critical moment.

170
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:46,008
The people at my quarters
are suffering because of me.

171
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:48,427
And I feel burdened by that.

172
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,431
You're not to blame here.
The Chief Eunuch is at fault.

173
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,310
He's dangerous.

174
00:20:56,977 --> 00:21:01,524
So if there is a problem with him,
you should tell me right away.

175
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,115
If you're hurt, I'm hurt too.

176
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,993
So don't feel burdened.

177
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:15,412
You have me, Your Royal Highness.

178
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,209
Thank you, Hyun.

179
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:28,134
You saw someone suspicious
in the Chief Eunuch's chambers?

180
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:31,887
That brings me to my next point.
I need your help.

181
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,855
<i>Double our tribute?</i>

182
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,940
Did the Chief Eunuch demand this too?

183
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,322
-Let me talk with him.
-There is no need.

184
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,742
I'll take care of this.

185
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:58,497
You are not to get involved any further.
You can leave now.

186
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:00,040
I can't do that.

187
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,420
I will resolve this problem
between the Chief Eunuch and me.

188
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,049
Please put your faith in me one more time.

189
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:12,303
Please…

190
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:16,974
give me a chance, Father.

191
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:29,195
Why does the Chief Eunuch
keep causing trouble?

192
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:31,655
He ought to help us
since he's from Joseon.

193
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:35,284
Sometimes,
your own people can be even worse.

194
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,370
<i>What do I want?</i>

195
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:45,711
People like you who were born
with a silver spoon

196
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:48,631
are hypocrites who pretend
to care for the people.

197
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:51,383
And I want to destroy people like you.

198
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,347
Royal Tutor Jung is close
to the Vice Minister of Rites, right?

199
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,474
Yes. That's what I've heard.

200
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,810
I must look into the Chief Eunuch.

201
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:05,189
Goodness.

202
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,281
<i>Tail the Chief Eunuch tonight,</i>

203
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,450
<i>and you'll be able
to find out who that man is.</i>

204
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:32,466
Royal Tutor Jung wasn't
at the royal institute.

205
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,219
What business does he have
at the guesthouse?

206
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:38,597
Goodness. Your Royal Highness, over there.

207
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,610
-You stay here.
-What?

208
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,612
Wait. Your Royal Highness.

209
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:56,490
Gosh. What's going to happen this time?

210
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:25,811
I'll go alone from this point on.
You can wait here.

211
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:27,021
Yes, my lord.

212
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:04,975
Kill him!

213
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:00,322
-How did you…
-Be careful.

214
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:20,676
Goodness.

215
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:28,308
If you ever use her to blackmail me again,

216
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:31,270
I will cut off your head.

217
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:37,359
Of course. Don't worry.
You will never see me again.

218
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:02,342
We've been followed.
You must get out of here now.

219
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:03,427
What?

220
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:29,620
Are you all right?

221
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:38,003
Stop!

222
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,342
This way!

223
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:49,765
Arrest everyone who has caused
a disturbance here!

224
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:51,141
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

225
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,397
-Catch them! Stop them!
-Get them!

226
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,833
-Royal Tutor Jung.
-Let me pass. I must go.

227
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:20,045
-They already got away.
-I have to find out something.

228
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:21,880
Why are you so reckless?

229
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:31,348
The cut is deep.

230
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,101
We should get this treated first.

231
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm okay. Are you all right,
Your Royal Highness?

232
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:45,404
You have another cut?

233
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,282
And here too?

234
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:53,996
Where else? Are there any more wounds?

235
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:58,458
Your Royal Highness.

236
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:01,878
Why on earth did you do this?

237
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,465
You can lean on me.

238
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:09,428
-Pardon?
-How can you walk with those injured legs?

239
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:12,431
You can lean on me to walk.

240
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:18,520
Be careful.

241
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:33,160
What brings you here
in the middle of the night?

242
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:40,459
I wanted to visit a few places as
I haven't been in my hometown for so long.

243
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,003
-Is there anything wrong with that?
-I see.

244
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:49,468
Interestingly enough, we received a report
about suspicious movement around there.

245
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:52,596
I was concerned that
you might be the target of an assassin.

246
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:56,808
As I'm in charge of the reception,
I couldn't stop worrying about you.

247
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:01,063
But you have nothing to worry about.
Call off your men.

248
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:02,689
I can't do that.

249
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:06,485
I must make sure
that there won't be any more incidents.

250
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:09,780
So until the day you leave Joseon,

251
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:13,825
security at this guesthouse
will be strengthened.

252
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:46,108
I'm sure his secret ledger
must be somewhere around his quarters.

253
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:48,985
Watch his every movement.

254
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:50,362
Yes, my lord.

255
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:56,034
I heard that the Chief Eunuch met
with a suspicious man.

256
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:57,661
So I was tailing him.

257
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:00,163
The Chief Eunuch?

258
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:03,375
But still. This was reckless.

259
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:06,044
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

260
00:31:06,753 --> 00:31:08,839
I wanted to be of help.

261
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,801
Do the wounds still hurt?

262
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,180
No.

263
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,435
By the way,

264
00:31:22,602 --> 00:31:25,230
were you that worried about me?

265
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:34,656
I understand. If something happens to me,

266
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,285
you won't be able to find
a good replacement to take my position.

267
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:40,912
I get why you were concerned.

268
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,332
How can you joke right now?

269
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,086
Your Royal Highness. I'm really hurt.

270
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:52,924
Royal Tutor Jung. Are you all right?

271
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:54,801
Sorry.

272
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,767
Let's go.

273
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:21,703
Your Royal Highness.

274
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:27,250
Are you all right? Why are you…

275
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:28,960
Hyun, I can't believe you.

276
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,505
You didn't even tell me.

277
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:33,423
Well…

278
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,970
I…

279
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:42,015
So what is your plan now?

280
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,773
Let me join you.
I would like to be a part of this.

281
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,115
Why are you looking for this man?

282
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:03,119
Well, I like to collect rare objects.

283
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:07,123
And I hear
that his collection is very extensive.

284
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:09,584
I will pay you handsomely
for the introduction.

285
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:13,922
It's a very handsome sum of money, indeed.

286
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:18,426
He already left the items with me.

287
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,930
Then we'd like to buy them too.

288
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,390
I'll double the price.

289
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,479
Well, this is quite a large sum
you're talking about. How…

290
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:35,360
As you can see,
we're nothing without our good looks

291
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,530
and wealth.

292
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:48,957
Here.

293
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:53,044
He became quite a gambling addict.

294
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:56,965
He was arrogant because his daughter
became an imperial concubine in Ming.

295
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:59,801
So I definitely remember his face.

296
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:07,726
My goodness. This is quite a rarity.

297
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:12,272
I hear the Emperor adores your daughter.
I guess what I heard was true.

298
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:14,357
But you didn't believe me before.

299
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,444
Just get me a good price for that. Okay?

300
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:24,159
He got a large sum for the items
the Chief Eunuch gave him.

301
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:27,037
So he'll check this place out first.

302
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,420
<i>-Are you serious?
-Come on.</i>

303
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:37,464
<i>If we catch
the imperial concubine's father,</i>

304
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:41,051
<i>we'll be able to find out why
he threatened the Chief Eunuch.</i>

305
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:44,596
<i>And that will be
the Chief Eunuch's weakness.</i>

306
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:47,182
NINE, NINE

307
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:49,267
Come on.

308
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:56,650
My goodness. I feel awful
about taking all this money.

309
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:04,658
It looks like I won this round, brother.

310
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:08,870
Come on! You're ruining my day.

311
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:11,331
Hold on. Are you leaving?

312
00:35:11,414 --> 00:35:14,042
Can't you see that I lost all of my money?

313
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:17,420
Come on. I thought you knew better.

314
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:20,840
If you leave now,
we won't be able to play anymore. Right?

315
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:22,258
Exactly.

316
00:35:22,342 --> 00:35:24,886
Come on. Sit down.
I'll lend you some money.

317
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,263
I'm not a heartless person, you know?

318
00:35:28,765 --> 00:35:31,518
Gosh. Where did you get this rare item?

319
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:36,648
What? This is…

320
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:40,151
What? Do you know what it is?

321
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:41,945
It's really rare.

322
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:44,739
That's from Ming.

323
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:46,658
Of course, I know.

324
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:48,827
I sold this.

325
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,457
Gosh. Really?

326
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:57,127
Goodness.
I guess we were meant to cross paths.

327
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,380
I've been looking everywhere for you!

328
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:04,718
The soldiers are here!

329
00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:09,014
-The soldiers are here!
-The soldiers?

330
00:36:09,097 --> 00:36:10,849
That way!

331
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,523
I'm so sorry, my lord! Please forgive me.

332
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:21,317
I was trying to make money
to buy medicine for my sister.

333
00:36:27,907 --> 00:36:30,285
What? Who are you?

334
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,120
Well, that's none of your business.

335
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:36,541
I need you to come with me.

336
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:41,755
Don't come close.

337
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:47,093
Just drop the dagger.
You'll just end up getting hurt.

338
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,018
Hey, my arm hurts.
You're going to break my arm.

339
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,146
Goodness. This isn't even a tight hold.
Stop exaggerating.

340
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:00,148
How about now? Is that better?

341
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:01,566
Damn it.

342
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:07,322
-Don't follow me.
-Come on. We can talk it out.

343
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:10,033
Seriously. We can talk about it.

344
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:18,416
Come on, hurry. Go get him!

345
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,667
Go!

346
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:23,296
Take him with you. I'll handle them.

347
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:24,380
Are you sure?

348
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,008
Of course.

349
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:29,552
Go straight there. Don't lose him.

350
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:35,767
Wait. No.

351
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:31,941
Your Royal Highness.

352
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:52,016
Can you handle them alone?

353
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,518
Of course, Your Royal Highness.

354
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,520
Sorry, we're late.

355
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:57,105
No, you are right on time.

356
00:38:57,855 --> 00:39:01,067
Had you been a moment late,
I wouldn't have been all right.

357
00:39:04,153 --> 00:39:06,322
-Get on the horse.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

358
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:11,869
I appreciate it.

359
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:08,342
You never listen.

360
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,263
I told you not to get hurt.

361
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,059
I'm sorry.

362
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:25,651
You sure make it sound painful
when the wound is minor.

363
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,824
What? That's not true.

364
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:34,952
You saw my wound.

365
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:36,662
It hurt a lot.

366
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:39,999
Others would have made a fuss about it.

367
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:47,048
Thank you…

368
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:49,550
for enduring the pain.

369
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:51,719
And…

370
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:56,599
for helping me.

371
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:07,944
I would like to continue
to do so by your side.

372
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:17,829
That is only if you will allow it,
Your Royal Highness.

373
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,485
Oh, my goodness.

374
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:58,035
Please spare me.

375
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:00,788
All right. Tell me.

376
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:04,041
What is it
that the Chief Eunuch is hiding?

377
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,172
Well…

378
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:30,985
What's all this?

379
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:35,740
Why the long face?

380
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:37,742
Please take a seat.

381
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,750
We could have easily resolved
the matter over drinks.

382
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:48,419
Perhaps, I was too rigid.

383
00:42:57,595 --> 00:42:59,722
As a peace offering,

384
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:02,433
I would like to show you

385
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:05,895
something interesting as well.

386
00:43:08,105 --> 00:43:10,650
You are indeed audacious

387
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,819
to have coveted the Emperor's wealth.

388
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:25,456
Records of your management
of the Emperor's private assets

389
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:26,624
are in this ledger.

390
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:29,752
How did you get that?

391
00:43:33,506 --> 00:43:36,509
We will not be able to comply
with your tribute request.

392
00:43:37,176 --> 00:43:41,931
And if the Emperor were to find out,
you would be in a tight spot too.

393
00:43:42,014 --> 00:43:43,599
Wouldn't you?

394
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:51,524
Is this why you wanted

395
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:53,442
to see me?

396
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:54,694
Why?

397
00:43:57,154 --> 00:44:01,325
I guess there are more secrets
that you're hiding besides this one.

398
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,168
I will keep this safe.

399
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:15,047
You worked hard to build
your reputation away from home.

400
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:19,677
So it would be a shame
to destroy it so easily like this.

401
00:44:34,692 --> 00:44:38,946
So you told the Crown Prince everything.

402
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,115
He was going to kill me otherwise.

403
00:44:41,198 --> 00:44:42,867
What should we do now?

404
00:44:43,451 --> 00:44:45,411
If your relationship with her is revealed,

405
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:47,455
it will be the end for all of us.

406
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,004
Please help my daughter.
Take pity on her and protect her. Please?

407
00:44:57,882 --> 00:44:59,884
You threatened me with her life before.

408
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:01,552
Now, you're worried?

409
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:14,315
Goodness.

410
00:45:25,576 --> 00:45:28,662
I told him to leave quietly.

411
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:32,333
But he must have gone to see you.

412
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:34,210
What are you plotting?

413
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:39,423
You found something bigger than the book.
Why pretend you didn't?

414
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:40,925
I didn't pretend anything.

415
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:45,554
I didn't need to use
your heartbreaking love story.

416
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:49,141
I already had the ledger that proved
that you stole from the Emperor.

417
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:52,561
I just wasn't interested in your story.

418
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:54,772
Right.

419
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:59,819
I must say I was a bit surprised.

420
00:46:00,403 --> 00:46:04,323
Not only did the father
of a concubine sell off his own daughter,

421
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:08,702
but he also bargained over her life
while threatening to expose you for money.

422
00:46:08,786 --> 00:46:10,996
Despite that,
you were able to put up with him.

423
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:15,751
Is that how much you love her?

424
00:46:16,836 --> 00:46:18,254
A concubine of the Emperor?

425
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,841
Don't you dare talk about her.

426
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:24,510
If you ever go after her,

427
00:46:24,593 --> 00:46:26,762
I will make you pay for it!

428
00:46:26,846 --> 00:46:28,639
I will use everything I have

429
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:31,434
to take revenge on you and Joseon!

430
00:46:36,147 --> 00:46:37,440
Revenge?

431
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:44,488
I heard that your parents received

432
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:47,867
a mere bag of rice when they sold you off.

433
00:46:49,285 --> 00:46:53,122
By the time you crossed the border,
your feet had blisters and were chapped.

434
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:55,666
But because you were a foreigner,

435
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,294
you were probably beaten up.

436
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:02,840
And you probably spent
every single night of your entire life,

437
00:47:03,632 --> 00:47:06,093
resenting your parents for selling you off

438
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:09,138
and resenting Joseon
for giving away innocent people.

439
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:11,682
I get why you wanted to take revenge.

440
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:16,937
And you must have been disgusted
to see people trying to flatter you

441
00:47:17,021 --> 00:47:18,939
after what you achieved.

442
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:21,734
However,

443
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,904
you shouldn't have behaved that way.

444
00:47:25,488 --> 00:47:29,783
I doubt you went through all that trouble,
so you could be like one of them.

445
00:47:29,867 --> 00:47:31,410
Get off your high horse.

446
00:47:31,494 --> 00:47:32,828
To me,

447
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:35,748
you are just like them.

448
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:40,794
You are right.

449
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:44,882
I am no different from them.

450
00:47:45,508 --> 00:47:46,592
No.

451
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:51,514
You must resent me even more
as I'm the Crown Prince of Joseon

452
00:47:52,598 --> 00:47:54,517
that gave you away.

453
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,937
Shut your mouth.

454
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:01,315
I don't need your pity.

455
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:03,984
This isn't pity.

456
00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:06,403
I just wanted…

457
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:09,698
to apologize to you

458
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:12,660
as the Crown Prince of Joseon.

459
00:48:19,124 --> 00:48:20,501
A long time ago,

460
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:25,673
you were forced to leave
without proper clothes or food.

461
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,759
I apologize.

462
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:35,182
I will take your secret affair
to my grave as well.

463
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:42,690
You two must have gone through
a lot of pain to protect your love.

464
00:48:45,818 --> 00:48:47,111
I think…

465
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:51,657
I can somewhat relate to that.

466
00:49:07,673 --> 00:49:08,716
Feeling wronged?

467
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:12,511
-Don't look at me like that.
-You stole it, didn't you?

468
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:15,431
Answer me.
If you don't, I'll have you killed.

469
00:49:16,015 --> 00:49:18,851
Get lost. Just go back to your homeland.

470
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:21,895
Bastard.

471
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:35,868
Are you all right?

472
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:39,204
It hurts a lot, right?

473
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,251
Look at all this blood.

474
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:30,172
You don't know…

475
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:33,425
when you'll be back here.

476
00:50:33,509 --> 00:50:35,886
You should look around
a bit more before going back.

477
00:50:36,387 --> 00:50:38,681
After all, this is your homeland.

478
00:50:39,848 --> 00:50:41,600
Homeland, my foot.

479
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:17,636
I am indebted to both of you.

480
00:51:22,516 --> 00:51:25,227
You too. You were very helpful too.

481
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,771
Come and have a drink with us tonight.

482
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:32,901
Sit comfortably.

483
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:37,156
All right. Everyone, if you have a drink,

484
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:40,367
let's clink our glasses.
What do you say, Your Royal Highness?

485
00:51:43,162 --> 00:51:45,497
Cheers.

486
00:51:45,581 --> 00:51:46,415
Cheers.

487
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:02,890
Since when did you become
so loyal to His Royal Highness?

488
00:52:02,973 --> 00:52:04,725
You of all people.

489
00:52:05,434 --> 00:52:06,769
Well,

490
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:11,440
you know that
I'm nothing without my loyalty.

491
00:52:12,357 --> 00:52:13,776
Right, Your Royal Highness?

492
00:52:14,485 --> 00:52:15,611
Sure.

493
00:52:16,612 --> 00:52:19,490
Yes. I guess so.

494
00:52:23,202 --> 00:52:26,205
Your Royal Highness, are you serious?

495
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,290
You're really hurting my feelings.

496
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:34,254
I get it. Calm down.
I just have something to tell him.

497
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:39,301
Come on.
I must talk to His Royal Highness.

498
00:52:42,513 --> 00:52:45,098
Your Royal Highness.
How can you laugh now?

499
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:49,269
Your Royal Highness,
I cannot let this slide.

500
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:52,147
You are hurting my feelings right now.

501
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:56,276
Why don't you just sit down?

502
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,197
Come on, Lord Jaeun. Help me out.
Did you mean that, Your Royal Highness?

503
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:04,326
All right.

504
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,666
Your Royal Highness.

505
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:14,211
Why don't we have just one more drink?

506
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:16,338
Just one more.

507
00:53:18,257 --> 00:53:19,550
Come on, move.

508
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:22,719
I'm asking
if he wants to have one more drink.

509
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:25,764
Let's have one more drink.

510
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,808
Gosh.

511
00:53:28,642 --> 00:53:30,894
Can you escort Royal Tutor Jung?

512
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:32,479
I'll escort the Crown Prince.

513
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,524
Lord Jaeun. I'm not drunk.

514
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:38,944
Lord Jaeun. Your Royal Highness. Wait.

515
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:42,489
Can't we have one more drink?
Just one, please?

516
00:53:42,573 --> 00:53:45,492
My arm hurts. Can you hold on a moment?

517
00:53:45,576 --> 00:53:48,036
Wait. Please wait.

518
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,664
Hold on. My arm hurts.

519
00:53:50,747 --> 00:53:53,667
Listen. Hey.

520
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,294
I'm not drunk.

521
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:58,630
I told you I'm not drunk. Why are you so…

522
00:53:58,714 --> 00:54:02,092
Come on. Talk to me.

523
00:54:02,175 --> 00:54:03,302
Gosh.

524
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:11,602
Just one drink. Please?

525
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:15,731
Do you want
to have one more drink with me?

526
00:54:15,814 --> 00:54:21,069
I always felt that there was
a brotherly bond between us.

527
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:25,115
You felt it too. Right?

528
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:27,451
Not really.

529
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:37,836
Gosh. What a heartless man.

530
00:54:46,803 --> 00:54:48,931
I have to talk to him. Gosh.

531
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,766
Come on.

532
00:55:11,912 --> 00:55:14,081
Why can't I stop smiling?

533
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:20,128
I can't stop smiling?

534
00:55:20,212 --> 00:55:23,465
Why? Why can't I stop…

535
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,605
Your Royal Highness.

536
00:57:52,823 --> 00:57:54,241
Royal Tutor Jung.

537
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:01,706
What are you doing here all alone?

538
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,751
Well…

539
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,074
I was surprised.

540
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:23,913
That girl and I are
the only ones who know about this place.

541
00:58:25,998 --> 00:58:30,795
I see. Are you talking
about the court maid from before?

542
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:38,761
I saw fireflies and followed them.

543
00:58:38,844 --> 00:58:41,055
And I stumbled upon this place by chance.

544
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:43,933
The door… I found the door.

545
00:58:56,904 --> 00:58:59,991
Did you set this place up by yourself?

546
00:59:00,658 --> 00:59:03,202
This? Yes.

547
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:11,210
That's why you had
the flowers at the tavern.

548
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:16,090
But…

549
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:20,094
why do you have so much liquor here?

550
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:21,387
Well…

551
00:59:24,015 --> 00:59:25,641
I couldn't sleep.

552
00:59:29,604 --> 00:59:32,189
And everyone said no to more drinks.

553
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:36,068
I was just getting started, you know.

554
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:37,361
Is that why

555
00:59:37,987 --> 00:59:41,782
you are using the palace
as your private tavern?

556
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,951
Only sometimes…

557
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:54,378
I am. I can't deny that.

558
00:59:56,547 --> 00:59:59,884
That is typical of you.

559
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:10,686
Please don't smile like that.

560
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,440
-What?
-Pardon?

561
01:00:18,235 --> 01:00:23,282
I mean… Well, I meant to say…

562
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:27,787
Right. I wanted to ask you a question.

563
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:31,082
Did you not expose the Chief Eunuch

564
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:33,709
because you really believe
the imperial concubine lives

565
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,127
for the Chief Eunuch?

566
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:43,886
Their lives were determined
by other people's decisions.

567
01:00:44,512 --> 01:00:47,515
So they had to hide their love.

568
01:00:48,933 --> 01:00:50,976
And that broke my heart.

569
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:02,988
You intrigue me sometimes.

570
01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:07,410
When I first met you
at the courtesan house,

571
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,287
you were as cold as ice.

572
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:13,958
But deep down,
you seem to be tenderhearted.

573
01:01:37,892 --> 01:01:39,935
You should slow down.

574
01:01:40,025 --> 01:01:42,737
You already drank a lot earlier.

575
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:46,699
Well, I was thirsty.

576
01:03:04,988 --> 01:03:11,722

THE KING'S AFFECTION

578
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:25,840
<i>Someone I know got drunk</i>

579
01:03:25,923 --> 01:03:28,676
<i>and kissed the cheek
of the person next to him.</i>

580
01:03:28,759 --> 01:03:29,844
<i>Does he like that person?</i>

581
01:03:29,927 --> 01:03:32,513
<i>Sometimes, you see and hear things.</i>

582
01:03:32,596 --> 01:03:33,764
<i>You're lovesick!</i>

583
01:03:33,848 --> 01:03:35,307
<i>No! That can't be.</i>

584
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,268
<i>I deserve to die, Your Royal Highness.</i>

585
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,895
<i>You seem to be from a noble family.
Why are you here in the palace alone?</i>

586
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:41,021
<i>The selection of a princess?</i>

587
01:03:41,105 --> 01:03:44,483
<i>We must hold a royal marriage,
so he can produce an heir.</i>

588
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:46,110
The Crown Prince is getting married?

589
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:49,238
<i>Have you ever loved someone,
Your Royal Highness?</i>

590
01:03:49,321 --> 01:03:51,323
<i>I have a favor to ask,
Your Royal Highness.</i>

591
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:52,992
Please give me a hug.

592
01:03:54,454 --> 01:03:57,047
