THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SELECTED AS
AN "EXCELLENT BROADCAST CONTENT"

00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:09,613
AND IS SUPPORTED BY MCST AND KOCCA

4
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:11,421
THIS DRAMA IS PURELY FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,036
ACTUAL PEOPLE, INCIDENTS,
ASSOCIATIONS, OR LOCATIONS

6
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:17,163
PREVIOUSLY…

7
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:19,290
<i>Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?</i>

8
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:21,667
<i>Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un of the Crown Prince</i>

9
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,670
<i>is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?</i>

10
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,547
<i>-No.</i>
-Your Royal Highness!

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,176
<i>Why do you have this book?</i>

12
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:33,512
<i>That girl must have been someone
quite special to you.</i>

13
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:36,307
-She was my first love.
<i>-You have a big problem!</i>

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,560
<i>The Minister of Personnel
lodged an appeal for your resignation.</i>

15
00:00:39,644 --> 00:00:42,104
<i>For my resignation?
I'm in need of your help.</i>

16
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:44,357
You are the only person
who can help me now.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,192
<i>There is nothing I can do for you.</i>

18
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:48,152
<i>So I advise you to stop asking.</i>

19
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,613
<i>You could have punished just me
from the beginning.</i>

20
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:53,532
<i>Why are you torturing my innocent friends
and putting everyone in danger?</i>

21
00:00:53,616 --> 00:00:55,284
<i>Moreover, he deceived
me and the Crown Prince.</i>

22
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:57,245
<i>The degree of his crime is quite severe.</i>

23
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:00,039
<i>Who is going to get killed?</i>

24
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:04,252
<i>I order you as the Crown Prince.
Hand over the prisoners.</i>

25
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:09,131
<i>If you do, no one will shed
a drop of blood here tonight.</i>

26
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,682
Allow me…

27
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:21,811
to answer that question.

28
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:56,512
I was the one…

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,931
who moved the prisoners.

30
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:07,356
I was taught that prisons are where
prisoners receive punishment,

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,734
not where they are meant to die.

32
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,945
Despite that objective of His Majesty's,

33
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:16,407
their living conditions
have become horrendous

34
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,244
and have led to prisoners starving
or freezing to death.

35
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:25,458
It is why I seek forgiveness
regarding the unsanctioned transfer

36
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,543
of said prisoners.

37
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:35,509
You dare interrupt today's ruling

38
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:38,220
to notify me of this frivolous matter?

39
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:44,518
Your Majesty, I have urgent information

40
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:47,355
regarding the incidents at Samgaebang.

41
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:50,816
This is not a matter His Royal Highness
should involve himself in.

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,276
I'll allow it.

43
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,653
Speak.

44
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:03,120
Royal Tutor Jung never disobeyed
the custom of our class system.

45
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:05,581
Those who actually did…

46
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:08,959
are them.

47
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:16,217
Enter.

48
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,605
One is a herb gatherer

49
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:32,691
who supplied pharmacies within the capital

50
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,904
and one is the custodian
of Literary Licentiate Choi's storage.

51
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,659
Repeat to His Majesty what you told me.

52
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:47,998
The accusation that
the physician of Samgaebang

53
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:52,962
only prescribed pricey medicine
is a false one.

54
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:57,967
Literary Licentiate Choi over here
bought all the medicinal herbs

55
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,386
available from villages

56
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,139
and stocked them in the storage he owns.

57
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,850
Regardless of age,
people started dying left and right

58
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,977
due to a lack of medicine.

59
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,690
After learning the truth, Physician Jung
found herbs that provide similar remedies

60
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:14,525
and made them affordable.

61
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,528
It resulted in the price drop
of the herbs in storage

62
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:19,363
which prompted this accusation.

63
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,325
Is this all true?

64
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:26,871
Of course not, Chief State Councilor!
I'm being falsely accused.

65
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,956
No, we speak the truth!

66
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:32,501
I have a ledger that lists
all transactions of the herbs.

67
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:33,961
MEDICINAL HERB INVENTORY LEDGER

68
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:43,596
Unlike the rumors surrounding Samgaebang,

69
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:47,475
you are saying it was a place
that helped the unfortunate.

70
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,060
It never indulged in foul play either.

71
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:52,980
Yes, but I guess

72
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,570
that depends on what you view
as following the rules and being dutiful.

73
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:05,701
All I want to say is that it's a place
that didn't go against the justice

74
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,996
I wish to promote in this nation.

75
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:13,292
<i>And Royal Tutor Jung shares
the very same values.</i>

76
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:22,134
I also believe His Royal Highness' claims
to be true, Your Majesty.

77
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:24,929
But you were the one

78
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:28,432
who first raised questions
regarding this matter!

79
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:32,144
Please forgive me for acting rashly

80
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:36,690
without taking a deeper look
into the underlying truth, Your Majesty.

81
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:51,914
I hear you.
However, that was not the only issue.

82
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:55,167
Jung Ji-un became a royal tutor

83
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,461
without disclosing his prior operations.

84
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:07,680
If I dare say so, Royal Tutor Jung
never lied about his past endeavors.

85
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:13,227
I accepted his teaching
while aware of his past,

86
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:18,774
and I'm sure you remember
that I informed you of this matter.

87
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:25,406
But you chose not to listen to me.

88
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,324
In the end,

89
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:30,494
you were the one who moved forward
with appointing him as my tutor.

90
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,247
So if anyone's to blame,

91
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:37,876
it would be Your Majesty
and the high officials of the court

92
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,756
who did not properly conduct
a background check.

93
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:53,392
So us being negligent is to blame?

94
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,412
Do not forget.

95
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,373
The path I choose

96
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,960
will be your path.

97
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:23,422
And if you deviate from that path,

98
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:26,050
I will not forgive you,

99
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:29,136
no matter how much I adore you.

100
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:43,734
I wish to take

101
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:46,737
that path with you.

102
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:56,872
Aren't you curious

103
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:00,292
as to in what way…

104
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:03,796
I wish to follow your lead?

105
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:20,813
Is the Crown Prince ready
to fight his battle?

106
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:48,132
EPISODE 7

107
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,706
Thank you so much.

108
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,376
Your gratitude should be extended
to His Royal Highness, not me.

109
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,265
Your Royal Highness,

110
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:42,186
no words can possibly convey my gratitude.

111
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,690
There is no need to thank me.

112
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,151
I just could not sit idly by

113
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:52,112
when I knew the truth.

114
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:56,950
If you head to Seorin-bang,

115
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:01,330
you'll be able to reunite
with your assistants.

116
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:23,769
I had no idea you'd take action
in solving this issue.

117
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:27,523
Well…

118
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,692
He's your friend, isn't he?

119
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:33,153
And he's also…

120
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:36,031
my tutor.

121
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:48,752
JEONOKSEO

122
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,307
-Ji-un.
-Ji-un!

123
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:03,433
Ji-un.

124
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:13,527
You obtained the Crown Prince's trust
in a short amount of time.

125
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:18,365
I'd expect no less
from someone as prodigious as you.

126
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,828
If you ever harm them again--

127
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:24,246
I won't force you…

128
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:27,583
to find a place within the royal court.

129
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,920
But don't you dare think about
being a hack of a physician again.

130
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,466
For your sake
and your mother's especially.

131
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:42,431
Just remember that it isn't easy
to cope with your one and only son

132
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:45,142
being chewed out.

133
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,801
My lady!

134
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:23,013
My lady, the night is deep.

135
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:26,725
-My lady, where are you headed?
-Stop this. I can't take it anymore.

136
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,560
-My lady, it's dangerous.
-Let go!

137
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:30,312
-My lady.
-I won't let this slide.

138
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,981
-But it's dangerous.
-What could be so dangerous?

139
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,359
-Let go of me!
-My lady!

140
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:36,443
Let go.

141
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,743
-Those blabbermouths--
-I knew it.

142
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,830
I was wondering whose voice was so loud.

143
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,792
Ji-un!

144
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,836
Gosh. Are you all right? Are you?

145
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,380
Of course I am.

146
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,967
My lady, your shoes don't match.

147
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,095
You can give me those
and go about your business.

148
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,688
Did the ladies in Bukchon
speak ill of me again?

149
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,648
No, that's not it.

150
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:20,153
They once loved to pass around
the medicine you prescribed,

151
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:22,364
but now they're saying ridiculous things.

152
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:25,200
They're obviously jealous
that you became a royal tutor,

153
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:27,035
so how can I let them carry on?

154
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:33,583
That's feisty coming from
the inspector's better half.

155
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:38,338
From what I hear, you used to be
the most timid maiden in the village.

156
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:41,925
My one and only son made me
a salty woman, that's why.

157
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:49,474
Until when will you find shelter
elsewhere from home?

158
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:51,935
It's time you moved back in.

159
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:56,064
Your father is gravely worried about you.

160
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:02,738
I'm sorry.

161
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:09,453
Goodness, I repeated the same thing again.

162
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:14,041
Just come by whenever you want to.
Like today.

163
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:16,084
Your room is still as it was.

164
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:20,922
Success doesn't mean
finding work at the palace.

165
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:24,384
Doing what you love and being happy
is the definition of a successful life.

166
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:27,846
So don't let others intimidate you

167
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,765
and live your life as you wish.

168
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,559
Don't let others dictate your life.
Do you hear me?

169
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:05,342
What…

170
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:13,642
Weren't you going to leave the palace

171
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:16,520
once you saved your assistants?

172
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:21,149
How could I possibly leave
when you went through so much

173
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:22,692
to clear my name?

174
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:26,780
I decided to stay where my heart lies
for a while longer.

175
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:28,573
Your heart?

176
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:31,868
I seem to have had
the wrong idea about you.

177
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:34,955
I let your nicknames
Five Step Prince and Ice Prince

178
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,582
cloud my judgment

179
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:41,128
and assumed that
you were audacious and cold-hearted.

180
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:45,048
However, that wasn't the case.

181
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:51,138
Your generosity knows no limit,
Your Royal Highness.

182
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:55,809
You could have easily been written about
in this Confucian classic.

183
00:15:57,811 --> 00:15:59,729
<i>A cold-hearted soul</i>

184
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,774
who doesn't bat an eye
even at the sight of death?

185
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:07,070
No, that was only a preposterous rumor.

186
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:10,115
I'm living proof of it, don't you agree?

187
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:11,324
That being said,

188
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:16,496
why was His Royal Highness
given the nickname Ice Prince?

189
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,500
Because his heart
is icy cold all year round--

190
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:24,838
Ice is clear and sparkles under the sun.

191
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,924
It is more elegant than any other jewel.

192
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:30,010
And that is the origin

193
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,762
behind his nickname the Ice Prince!

194
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:46,776
Why does it feel like there's a chance
of him getting a promotion before me?

195
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,542
Your Royal Highness.

196
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:07,964
Your Royal Highness.

197
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,301
We have fine weather today.

198
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:30,946
Isn't it nice to enjoy
a lecture outside for a change?

199
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:33,990
You should watch where you're going.

200
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:37,202
Walking backward will surely
make you trip and fall into a pond.

201
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:41,498
I'm more sturdy and nimble
than people think

202
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:44,376
which is why I have never tripped before--

203
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:45,543
Goodness!

204
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:12,696
Your Royal Highness.

205
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,209
How cool.

206
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,216
Wait for me, Your Royal Highness!

207
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:45,937
THE WATER IS COLD AND THE NIGHT IS CHILLY

208
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,945
WITH WIND…

209
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,252
What have you been
taking your time writing?

210
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:36,196
<i>WELCOME RAIN ON A SPRING NIGHT</i>

211
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,032
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

212
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,455
"A good rain knows its seasons right."

213
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:50,543
I don't think
I properly expressed my gratitude

214
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:53,880
for the help I received.

215
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:59,094
Like the good rain
that falls when most needed,

216
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:03,473
I will be someone who you can count on.

217
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:09,896
Just like you were to me
when I needed you the most.

218
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,876
Goodness.

219
00:20:39,092 --> 00:20:40,635
It's raining, Your Royal Highness.

220
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,680
Perfect timing, don't you think?

221
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,667
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

222
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:17,213
Your Royal Highness, it's Bok-dong.

223
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:22,510
What is this about?

224
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:28,308
Oh, Court Lady Kim ordered me
to check if you're set for the night.

225
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,435
I see.

226
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:40,195
-By the way, Bok-dong.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

227
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:42,989
It's about Royal Tutor Jung.

228
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:47,744
Has he been getting along
with those at the royal institute?

229
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:51,748
You have no idea. Life at the palace
must be like second nature to him now

230
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:55,210
considering how he brings them alcohol
and gladly trades shifts.

231
00:21:55,293 --> 00:22:00,048
He is as amiable as they get
and is highly praised by the rest.

232
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,091
You can tell

233
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:05,595
that he's nothing like his father
from the way he acts toward you.

234
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,723
Why do you ask about him though?

235
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,644
What? No reason.

236
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:18,316
If you're done, dismiss yourself already.

237
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:21,778
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
I wish you a good night.

238
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:41,881
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

239
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:53,268
Since His Majesty is in poor health,

240
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,604
it might not be a bad idea
for the Crown Prince

241
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,565
to greet the envoys.

242
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:03,570
I'm well aware of your desire
to give more authority

243
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,197
to His Royal Highness.

244
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:09,576
Then I'll trust that

245
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:15,206
you will make a formal request
to His Majesty.

246
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,586
But I hope you don't think
that I will blindly act

247
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:21,629
according to your desires.

248
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:26,467
It's what I noticed with the incident
involving the royal tutor,

249
00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:30,263
but lately,

250
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:34,183
I haven't been pleased about you

251
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,561
overstepping your authority.

252
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:51,868
Overstepping my authority?

253
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:53,703
I…

254
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:58,416
vowed my allegiance to the former king

255
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:00,293
with blood on my lips.

256
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:04,088
How could you possibly say such a thing

257
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:07,842
when I put my life on the line
to help him take the throne?

258
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:10,386
I understand your fondness
for the Crown Prince,

259
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,140
but His Majesty is also
someone you must serve.

260
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:18,353
If you offend him in any way,
you will answer to me.

261
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:22,273
Your Highness, then wouldn't it
only be fair that you lead by example?

262
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,526
What?

263
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,615
More and more key officials
are being appointed in your favor.

264
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:34,160
You should never forget

265
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:39,749
that it is I who have been
considerate of your desire

266
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:42,126
to give your family power.

267
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:45,797
You dare threaten me?

268
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,674
Of course not, Your Highness.

269
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:50,259
All I want

270
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:53,346
is for those after
His Royal Highness' crown

271
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:56,099
to no longer be a threat.

272
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:01,020
That is all.

273
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:03,439
Therefore…

274
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:09,737
I suggest we refrain from
pointless squabbles, Your Highness.

275
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:11,215
A foot disorder?

276
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:15,553
-Has Father's foot disease returned?
-Yes.

277
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:19,807
His Majesty has been overwhelmed
with state affairs

278
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:21,768
and his prognosis isn't good.

279
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:35,573
Aside from Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong,

280
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:38,326
he's the first to protect you
from close proximity.

281
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,203
Hasn't it been uncomfortable?

282
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:43,456
I should learn to get used to it.

283
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:47,627
I cannot forever be served
by only Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong.

284
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,545
Right.

285
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,276
Your Majesty.

286
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,030
Leave the herbal tonic.

287
00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:31,003
Father.

288
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:34,632
It is I.

289
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:38,010
I see. What brings you by?

290
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:42,723
I would like to make a request.

291
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:54,652
Please let me be
in charge of receiving the envoys.

292
00:27:56,571 --> 00:28:00,533
Aren't you aware of
that being Prince Jaeun's responsibility?

293
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:03,870
Actually, I was hoping

294
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:08,291
to greet them in your place
when they arrive at the palace.

295
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,837
I'm aware that the same request
came from the Queen Dowager as well.

296
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,714
And who says that is what I want?

297
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,679
I will greet the envoys
according to custom.

298
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,890
You are dismissed.

299
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:29,896
Father,

300
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:34,650
do you still not have faith in me?

301
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:44,327
I am well aware that you were against
my installation as Crown Prince.

302
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,579
Was it…

303
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:50,291
because of my maternal grandfather?

304
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,251
Or…

305
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:55,463
was it…

306
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,674
because of Gyeom?

307
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,092
What is your reason…

308
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:03,721
for bringing that up after all this time?

309
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:08,851
I understand that
you find my grandfather to be difficult.

310
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,272
But this is what I want for myself.

311
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:18,861
I ask you

312
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,531
to put your faith in me this time.

313
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:24,617
I…

314
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:29,121
won't let you down.

315
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:10,871
He sure is adorable.

316
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:15,001
There is something
quite adorable about him.

317
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:21,507
How are preparations coming along
at the guesthouses for the envoys?

318
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:25,052
Have you heard from the governor who went
to Uiju to accompany the envoys?

319
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:29,223
You should pace yourself and take it easy.

320
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,309
I am taking His Majesty's place.

321
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:35,021
There can be no room for error.

322
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:41,277
Let your mind rest for now.
We have to be at the market soon.

323
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,155
I will first retrieve
the report sent by the governor.

324
00:30:57,877 --> 00:30:59,128
Your Royal Highness.

325
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:05,134
I hear lectures have been canceled
to focus on greeting the envoys.

326
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:09,055
Yes, I'm afraid I won't be able
to attend for the time being.

327
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:10,890
I see.

328
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:16,896
Since you're busy, I'll keep it short.

329
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:20,066
Not even the legendary physician Hua Tuo
has seen these pills

330
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,777
which were made
with a drop of dragon tears--

331
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,322
Do you have nothing to do?
Why don't I ask Royal Scholar Yang to--

332
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:29,241
Hardly. I actually have
urgent business to address.

333
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:36,540
Take some when you are having
a difficult time.

334
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,920
It will give you courage
and relieve you of anxiety.

335
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:45,091
Then…

336
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,219
Oh, right.

337
00:32:10,032 --> 00:32:12,785
Was it Royal Tutor Jung who just came by?

338
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:18,874
No one can match his anti-climactic ways.

339
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,937
They are all of good quality.

340
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,564
As if.

341
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:43,774
Let me take a look
since I know a thing or two.

342
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:52,575
I'll take this one.

343
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,625
Have them delivered to Samgaebang.

344
00:33:04,503 --> 00:33:05,796
This one right here.

345
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:09,341
And this as well as this.

346
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,264
-You know what? Just send them all.
-Yes, my lady.

347
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,857
They are all to be sent to Samgaebang?

348
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,943
Like I said, I owe them that much.

349
00:33:33,157 --> 00:33:34,325
What on earth?

350
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:46,670
You must be the type
to apologize with gifts rather than words.

351
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:51,300
Oh, well…

352
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,138
Wait, is that wrong?

353
00:33:56,847 --> 00:34:00,976
I'm apologizing for my wrongdoing
by buying them what they need the most.

354
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:04,688
I only do so because I can afford it.

355
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:10,361
I'm just saying.

356
00:34:12,738 --> 00:34:16,033
Anyway, why are you carrying around
that hand plow?

357
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:20,955
Oh, this? I'm looking
for some flowers to plant.

358
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,458
I can't afford to buy them
like someone I know,

359
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,502
so I must acquire them myself.

360
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:31,048
Wait.

361
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:37,471
Forgive me.

362
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,809
For putting you in a predicament, I mean.

363
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,853
I wanted to apologize in person,

364
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,232
but I couldn't muster up the courage.

365
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:54,196
Why are you laughing?

366
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,616
Well, because I was only joking.

367
00:34:58,617 --> 00:35:00,995
Besides, you shouldn't apologize.

368
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:04,915
It's not like you told lies
just to get me into trouble.

369
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:07,376
Never did I think

370
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,879
you'd be a fun person to tease.

371
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:34,194
Let's see.

372
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:49,376
Why do you wish to plant flowers
within the palace grounds though?

373
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,173
Well, they're pretty. That's why.

374
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:31,960
We should hang up more square lanterns
to light up the streets more.

375
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:33,837
-Will do, Your Royal Highness.
-Good.

376
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:36,173
And the decorations?

377
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:39,676
They should also be prepared accordingly.

378
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:53,023
What's the matter?

379
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,651
Oh.

380
00:36:57,236 --> 00:36:58,278
It's nothing.

381
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,477
Do you know them?

382
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:25,188
Yes, he is--

383
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,820
I mean, they are colleagues I work with.

384
00:37:31,903 --> 00:37:36,032
I see. Do you work
at the royal institute then?

385
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:38,952
Well, I guess.

386
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:40,162
I see.

387
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:42,873
May I ask who we're speaking to?

388
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:45,709
Oh, forgive my belated introduction.

389
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,210
I am Shin So-eun.

390
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:52,174
There are no other empty seats,

391
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:56,094
-so go ahead--
-Actually, since we ran into each other,

392
00:37:57,304 --> 00:37:59,055
why don't we sit down for a meal?

393
00:38:00,182 --> 00:38:01,892
Four bowls of soup with rice, please.

394
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,374
Didn't you say you were busy?

395
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:32,547
Never did I imagine you having
an affectionate side, Royal Tutor Jung.

396
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,510
Affectionate?

397
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:39,054
How pretty.

398
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:41,264
The flowers, I mean.

399
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:45,352
Oh, these.

400
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:49,314
He spared me a few.

401
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:54,152
Anyway, how do you two know each other?

402
00:38:55,278 --> 00:38:56,822
Well, that's…

403
00:38:56,905 --> 00:39:00,325
It's a very long story.

404
00:39:00,408 --> 00:39:01,827
Here's the food you ordered.

405
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,080
Goodness. We should eat first.

406
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:12,462
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

407
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:15,841
All right. Allow me to add a spoonful.

408
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:24,015
-Allow me.
-It's fine. I'll do it myself.

409
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:26,434
This is more of my specialty,
so let me do it.

410
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:28,061
I said it's fine!

411
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:42,200
Goodness. Are you all right?

412
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,002
I'll do it myself.

413
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:02,012
Lord Jung, your sleeves are also stained.

414
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:05,390
I'm… I'm fine, but…

415
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:33,710
GWANGHWAMUN

416
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:55,857
I guess it's been a while
since you set foot

417
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,526
in your homeland.

418
00:41:00,362 --> 00:41:01,905
Homeland? What a joke.

419
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:14,709
NOKUNGAK

420
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:58,169
We did our best
to make your stay here with us

421
00:41:58,253 --> 00:42:00,422
as comfortable as possible.

422
00:42:00,505 --> 00:42:03,925
I do hope everything is up to par.

423
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:06,344
We appreciate all you have done for us.

424
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:12,308
You can speak more at ease now
for we have prepared much as well.

425
00:42:18,356 --> 00:42:20,692
This ornamental knife
has accompanied us from Ming.

426
00:42:21,276 --> 00:42:23,028
It's a lucky one, don't you think?

427
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:24,988
I'd rather rest, so please leave us.

428
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,921
I'm sure you're aware that a new emperor
ascended to the throne a year ago.

429
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:46,426
From what I hear,
those two played a major role.

430
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,721
This way, please.

431
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:52,307
They await you.

432
00:43:02,484 --> 00:43:03,902
I'm glad you're here.

433
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:08,239
Why is Lord Sangheon meeting
with Royal Tutor Jung?

434
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,539
Royal Tutor Jung has
a history with the Vice Minister of Rites,

435
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:18,917
so he must be here to greet him.

436
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,336
Would you like to join them?

437
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:25,799
And say what at an uninvited event?

438
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:28,134
I'd only be interrupting them.

439
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:31,221
I heard I was urgently summoned.

440
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,765
Was it by you?

441
00:43:41,106 --> 00:43:43,233
I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.

442
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,401
I'm the one who had you summoned.

443
00:44:19,936 --> 00:44:21,312
Physician Jung!

444
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:26,943
It's been too long.

445
00:44:28,862 --> 00:44:29,904
What brings you here?

446
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:39,914
I couldn't locate you in Ming,
so I thought the Left State Councilor

447
00:44:39,998 --> 00:44:42,208
was pulling my leg
when he said he'd let me meet you.

448
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:44,502
Who knew we'd meet again like this?

449
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:48,840
Left State Councilor, I'm truly grateful.

450
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:53,344
To find out that one of my people
saved your life

451
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:56,181
was a great shock on my part.

452
00:44:56,264 --> 00:45:00,018
I guess this is what destiny looks like.

453
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,357
As if that even qualifies
as saving one's life.

454
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,735
That's a little dramatic.

455
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,242
I'm afraid I must apologize.

456
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:19,537
Duty calls at
the Office of the Inspector General.

457
00:45:51,903 --> 00:45:54,906
Physician Jung,
allow me to pour you a drink.

458
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:00,203
It truly has been too long.

459
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:02,664
I agree.

460
00:46:30,525 --> 00:46:33,152
So the rumors about
the Left State Councilor

461
00:46:33,236 --> 00:46:35,029
being the richest in Joseon were true.

462
00:46:37,282 --> 00:46:40,410
Then tell me. What is it that he wants?

463
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:45,206
He was hoping to be given permission
to develop the land in Yeoyeon.

464
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,374
Yeoyeon?

465
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:50,962
Barbarians constantly invade that land.
Why would he want to develop…

466
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:53,673
I see.

467
00:46:56,259 --> 00:46:59,262
He wishes to build an army under
the pretense of protecting the border.

468
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:00,638
How greedy of him.

469
00:47:02,348 --> 00:47:04,559
Let him know
that he does not need to worry.

470
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:46,184
Thank you for the warm welcome.

471
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:49,896
However, if you had focused
more of your energy

472
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:53,441
on the roads leading to Joseon,

473
00:47:54,275 --> 00:47:56,944
I wouldn't be so fatigued from the trip.

474
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,742
That means we'd be clearing a path
for the barbarians up north,

475
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:06,162
which is why we've been hesitant.

476
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:10,583
You still should have
cleared a road to Ming though.

477
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:15,213
Developing the land in Yeoyeon will make
trading with Ming less demanding.

478
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:17,632
That place is
a strategic point for our defense.

479
00:48:18,257 --> 00:48:20,343
Hasty decisions cannot be made.

480
00:48:20,426 --> 00:48:22,762
That's why I'm offering my assistance.

481
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:26,015
I will mention the issues
regarding Yeoyeon to the Emperor,

482
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:29,143
so all I suggest is that
you send a quick response.

483
00:49:37,128 --> 00:49:38,212
Goodness.

484
00:49:40,006 --> 00:49:41,507
Isn't she beautiful?

485
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:43,509
Especially the one in the second row.

486
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:56,022
Is there a girl who has caught your eye?

487
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:58,316
Please do not hesitate to tell me.

488
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:01,903
It can be ten or a hundred.
I'll make sure you receive them tonight.

489
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:07,533
I hear that girls sent as offerings
are quite adored.

490
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:11,037
One of them was blessed
into becoming an imperial concubine.

491
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:14,290
The girl to serve you tonight

492
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,834
will also be a lucky one.

493
00:50:19,337 --> 00:50:20,588
I see.

494
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:24,175
So I can have my pick of girls?

495
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:25,801
Your request is my command.

496
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,349
From what I hear,
your wife's beauty is blinding.

497
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,185
Could I take her back with me?

498
00:50:35,686 --> 00:50:36,729
Pardon?

499
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,649
Goodness. That was quite the jest.

500
00:50:44,904 --> 00:50:46,072
A jest?

501
00:50:48,658 --> 00:50:51,244
Then were you taunting me just now?

502
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,540
Being sent to Ming as an offering
is an honor

503
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:59,126
but not when it comes to your own family?

504
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,964
No, that is not what I meant.

505
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:15,059
What is the meaning of this?

506
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,398
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

507
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:24,902
It's just that this man
made promises to me that he can't keep.

508
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:30,992
I will punish him accordingly
once I gather all the facts,

509
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:32,910
so please let your anger subside.

510
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:36,581
Goodness. What is there
to investigate and find out?

511
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:37,915
If needed,

512
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,168
he can be executed on the spot.

513
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:43,629
Wait. But…

514
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:48,092
Please spare my life!

515
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:51,470
That is enough.

516
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,269
You are in the palace of Joseon.

517
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,814
His Majesty stated
that he'd get to the truth,

518
00:52:02,315 --> 00:52:04,066
so let our system take over.

519
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:09,280
Leave and await your ruling.

520
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:11,324
Yes, Your Royal Highness!

521
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:27,673
This isn't your place.

522
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:31,594
Allow me to greet you.

523
00:52:38,017 --> 00:52:40,519
I am Jung Ji-un,
a royal tutor at the royal institute.

524
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,731
You seem to be upset
at this festive banquet,

525
00:52:43,814 --> 00:52:45,191
so I'd like to serve you a drink.

526
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,652
Would you accept it?

527
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:58,037
Please don't be like that
and accept this drink.

528
00:52:59,538 --> 00:53:03,376
I'd consider it a great honor.

529
00:53:09,215 --> 00:53:11,717
You speak out of place
knowing that you are favored

530
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:13,219
by the Vice Minister of Rites.

531
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:28,437
Get lost.

532
00:53:34,568 --> 00:53:38,530
Because the drink was from you,

533
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:39,907
it was divine.

534
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:42,201
Is that so?

535
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,703
Then have some more.

536
00:53:47,331 --> 00:53:48,582
That's about enough.

537
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:53,003
Do you not realize
that you're dishonoring the Emperor

538
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:54,505
by not showing courtesy?

539
00:53:57,883 --> 00:53:59,718
Yes, that is enough.

540
00:54:50,602 --> 00:54:52,437
So this is where you were,
Your Royal Highness.

541
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:06,368
Did you have to make me feel uneasy
by doing what I didn't order you to do?

542
00:55:08,662 --> 00:55:10,872
It was an important banquet.

543
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:13,792
I was only worried
that things would escalate.

544
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:17,087
It is not your job to worry about me.

545
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:21,550
Pretend you didn't see anything

546
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:24,011
or hear anything from now on.

547
00:55:25,262 --> 00:55:26,471
That is how you will be.

548
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:16,772
Wait. There's another child.
Go and get him.

549
00:56:16,855 --> 00:56:18,106
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

550
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:20,734
Sit down.

551
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:22,235
I said sit down.

552
00:57:26,508 --> 00:57:30,387
It is not your job to worry about me.

553
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:35,559
Is this what you serve as food?

554
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:39,479
Is there a problem?

555
00:57:39,563 --> 00:57:41,106
That'd be my question to you.

556
00:57:42,649 --> 00:57:45,444
What you served is nothing but waste.

557
00:57:45,527 --> 00:57:47,320
What is one supposed to eat?

558
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,078
Forgive me.

559
00:57:55,162 --> 00:57:58,373
I had the kitchen prepare what you enjoy,

560
00:57:58,457 --> 00:58:00,417
but they must not suit your palate.

561
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:03,086
Prepare the food again.

562
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,046
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

563
00:58:11,386 --> 00:58:16,016
Has a decision been made regarding
the man who taunted me last night?

564
00:58:17,225 --> 00:58:19,436
His mouth should have been
ripped at the corners

565
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,646
to stop him from spewing nonsense.

566
00:58:22,939 --> 00:58:25,567
The Office of the Inspector General
is reviewing the case.

567
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,987
He will be severely punished
once they come to a ruling,

568
00:58:29,654 --> 00:58:31,156
so please let your anger subside.

569
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:34,284
How about you just
let me deal with him instead?

570
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:38,455
Executing the punishment myself
means less work for you.

571
00:58:38,538 --> 00:58:42,834
Even a man guilty of treason
is punished by law and custom.

572
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:44,795
So I suggest…

573
00:58:45,879 --> 00:58:47,839
you drop this.

574
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:54,179
Acting tough, are we?

575
00:58:58,141 --> 00:58:59,309
What…

576
00:59:00,894 --> 00:59:02,479
did you just say?

577
00:59:02,562 --> 00:59:03,438
What do you mean?

578
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,866
What was that?

579
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:19,996
You dare treat me with disdain?

580
00:59:20,872 --> 00:59:24,876
How dare you communicate
in code in my presence!

581
00:59:26,294 --> 00:59:29,548
That… That is not true, my lord.

582
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:31,967
Communicating in code?
That is hardly true.

583
00:59:33,093 --> 00:59:35,178
I will have the food served again.

584
00:59:35,762 --> 00:59:36,972
Follow me.

585
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,733
How dare you follow him out.

586
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:52,195
Damned wench, you just
don't know your place, do you?

587
00:59:53,738 --> 00:59:54,990
Court Lady Kim!

588
00:59:57,242 --> 00:59:59,327
What are you doing?

589
01:00:02,622 --> 01:00:05,208
As you can see,
I'm teaching her some manners.

590
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:08,086
Why? Does this require
proper procedure too?

591
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:14,676
Do you know what I despise the most?

592
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:18,346
Words or actions of disrespect
which you just showed.

593
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:20,891
Today, you will be taught some manners.

594
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,452
Court Lady Kim!

595
01:00:40,535 --> 01:00:41,870
Court Lady Kim…

596
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:43,121
Oh, no.

597
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:44,998
My gosh.

598
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:54,966
Court Lady Kim…

599
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,011
Your Royal Highness…

600
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,971
Your Royal Highness…

601
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:12,150
- Your Royal Highness, you must not!
- Your Royal Highness, you must not!

602
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:32,253
You must not do this.
Your Royal Highness, no!

603
01:01:37,968 --> 01:01:40,845
Oh, no. Your Royal Highness…

604
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:34,419

THE KING'S AFFECTION

606
01:02:46,703 --> 01:02:49,456
<i>Your Royal Highness,
you did the right thing.</i>

607
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:51,916
<i>If you are disgruntled,
take it up with me.</i>

608
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,585
<i>Leave the innocent alone.</i>

609
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:56,546
<i>People like you are hypocrites
who pretend to care for the people.</i>

610
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:58,923
<i>And I want to destroy people like you.</i>

611
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:01,092
<i>You saw someone suspicious
in the Chief Eunuch's chambers?</i>

612
01:03:01,176 --> 01:03:03,428
<i>I must look into the Chief Eunuch.</i>

613
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:05,388
<i>Until the day you leave Joseon,</i>

614
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:07,891
<i>security at this guesthouse
will be strengthened.</i>

615
01:03:07,974 --> 01:03:11,269
<i>If you ever go after her,
I will make you pay for it!</i>

616
01:03:11,352 --> 01:03:13,480
<i>Thank you for helping me.</i>

617
01:03:13,563 --> 01:03:16,483
<i>I would like to continue to do so
by your side.</i>

618
01:03:16,983 --> 01:03:19,444
<i>That is only if you will allow it,
Your Royal Highness.</i>
