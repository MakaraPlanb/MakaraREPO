My Dear Brothers
EP11

2
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,080
You haven't eaten for 200 years,

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
and you ate stinky tofu for the first time.

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,120
Are you okay?

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,680
Hou Chi

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,120
Hou Chi

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,200
It's spicy, right?

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,000
Have some water.

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,800
He ate such spicy food,

10
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
and you give him hot water.

11
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Doesn't it work?

12
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,840
Of course.

13
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,720
Go get some ice. Hurry up.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,720
Come on.

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,680
Okay.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
Listen to me, you two.

17
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
It's okay to be in the same room.

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
But there are some rules.

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,280
Firstly,

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
no sharing a bed.

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,360
Secondly,

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
no physical contact.

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,520
Thirdly,

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
sleeping with the window open.

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,600
Open the window?

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Why?

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,920
I noticed that

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,520
the window of your room

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,120
is facing the window of my room.

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,360
Keep the window open.

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,320
And if this guy is up to something,

32
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
you shout aloud and I'll hear you.

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,360
What?

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,040
Loser.

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
Do you want to fight again?

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,320
I think I need to say it again,

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,920
Shi Xia's brother is me.

38
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,560
How we get along

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
is none of your business.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,640
What can he do

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,040
since you've made such spicy food for him?

42
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,040
I should warn him,

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,760
what if he wants to...

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,280
what if he has unkind thoughts to you?

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,240
Bro

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,600
What are you looking at?

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll look at it with you.

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,960
Time flies.

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,360
What can we do?

50
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
I think Miss Shi Xia

51
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,120
is very nice.

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,360
What do you mean?

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,520
Do you think I have a crush on her?

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,320
There's no shame in that.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,880
Even if Shi Xia is the disciple of Yuhua Sect,

56
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,560
but what does it matter?

57
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,360
We're from Devil Sect.

58
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,920
There's no need to follow the pedantic rules.

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,920
Me,

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
the great Devil Lord.

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah.

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,320
You are the Devil Lord.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you not worthy of a disciple
of Yuhua Sect?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,680
No, No.

65
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,320
Now, it's Hou Chi and her.

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,880
Do you forget?

67
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,120
You've already beaten Hou Chi.

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,200
Why are you worried about him?

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
If Hou Chi had any sense,

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,080
he wouldn't have stopped his sister
from dating you.

71
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I can't explain it to you.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,800
It doesn't matter if you can't explain.

73
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,440
Our old rules.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,520
Scrambling.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
We Devil Sect have so many ways to do.

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,920
Even ten more girls,

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
let alone Shi Xia,

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,000
are a piece of cake.

79
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,760
Scrambling.

80
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,920
They are coming.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,280
You are up?

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,000
You are up?

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,280
Did you have a sound sleep?

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,080
Did you?

85
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,080
What are you going to do now?

86
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
Yesterday I was rude.

87
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
I apologize to you both today.

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,080
Hosted by the Devil Sect,

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
we would like to invite you
to visit the Otherworld Town.

90
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,920
Food, drink and fun are all on us.

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,160
No need.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,160
Listen, if you don't want to go,

93
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
it doesn't mean Miss Shi Xia doesn't want to.

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,120
Yeah.

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,200
Miss Shi Xia

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have been sniffing around.

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,440
There are so many delicious food

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,760
and fun things in the Otherworld Town.

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,440
Husppy

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,000
Do a good introduction.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,640
Okay.

102
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
As is known to all,

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
the Otherworld Town has a history
of more than 2000 years.

104
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,360
But this year the Otherworld Town is particularly bustling.

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,000
Look.

106
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
And listen.

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,200
Shouting.

108
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,760
Why?

109
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,600
Why?

110
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
Because of His Majesty.

111
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
For 2000 years, we Devil Sect never take

112
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,600
the test for the head of the Immortals Alliance.

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,480
It's the first time ever.

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,640
The first time?

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
Here comes the Devil Lord.

116
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,360
He is gorgeous, elegant, rich...

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,000
Rich but young.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Rich but young.

119
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,240
Get to the point.

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,160
There is a restaurant named the Great Hotel.

121
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,880
They launched a blessing feast

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,720
specially for the test of the head of the Alliance.

123
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,560
Therefore,

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
I wonder if you would

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,360
do me the honor of tasting it?

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,360
There are 108 dishes,

127
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,320
bringing together the featured food of Immortals Alliance.

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
Hou Chi

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,520
You don't have to eat,

130
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,480
but you can't starve your sister.

131
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I don't want a blessing feast.

132
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,280
Now I get it.

133
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,960
Sister shows duplicity again.

134
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,520
Okay. Let's go to the Great Hotel.

135
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,120
-Let's go.  -Very good.

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,720
Come on.

137
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,320
One small step forward,

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,920
one giant leap in life.

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,720
Come on.

140
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,880
Let me lead the way.

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,600
Come on.

142
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,480
Come on, sister.

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,800
It hurts so much.

144
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,080
Sister

145
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,760
Sister, don't cry.

146
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Do not cry.

147
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm holding your hand.

148
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
You won't get lost.

149
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,240
Let's go.

150
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
No, what are you doing?

151
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,240
It's safer to hold sister's hand.

152
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Wait a minute.

153
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,880
You two have such a touching relationship.

154
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,840
Count me in.

155
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
Come on, let's go our separate ways.

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,240
Welcome, Devil Lord.

157
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
I booked the whole place today.

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,320
Help yourself please.

159
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,800
Just be my guest.

160
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,160
Come on, come on in, come on in, please.

161
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,320
Here we are.

162
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,200
Husppy

163
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm here.

164
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
Go ahead and make the arrangements.

165
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,920
No problem.

166
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,680
The Great Hotel is famous for its featured food.

167
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,400
I heard the food here is very strange,

168
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,360
including man-eating plants that can swallow a sheep,

169
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
and flying thorn melons.

170
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
I want to check it out, too.

171
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
What is the purpose

172
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
of the Devil Lord's invitation today?

173
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,280
Well, you can tell.

174
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
An old saying goes,

175
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
It's often your opponents who know you best.

176
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,120
Tell you honestly,

177
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
I have one lifelong regret.

178
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
A year ago,

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,080
I lost my sister.

180
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,400
I looked around,

181
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
I've been all over the world,

182
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,520
but I still couldn't find my sister.

183
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,880
Shi Xia

184
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,680
I mean Shi Xia and my sister look alike.

185
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,560
I almost thought she was my sister.

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,280
Do you understand?

187
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,680
No wonder you hit it off with Shi Xia.

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
(Of course.)

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
(Shi Xia has been my sister for 19 years.)

190
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,560
But Shi Xia is my sister.

191
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,280
You lost your sister

192
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,880
and you should focus on your sister, not mine.

193
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
(Shi Xia is clearly my sister.)

194
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
(You're the one who focused on my sister.)

195
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
You're right.

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,200
Your sister's back.

197
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
My sister's gone.

198
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,440
You should know

199
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
what it's like to lose my sister,

200
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,600
right?

201
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,600
Even if it's only half a day away from my sister,

202
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm tortured inside.

203
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,280
(Don't say that in front of her real brother.)

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
The Otherworld Town is my last hope.

205
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
If I can't

206
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,840
find my sister here,

207
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,840
I might as well give up.

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
You can't just give up.

209
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
If you want to find her,

210
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,840
I will do everything in my power to help you.

211
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,560
Thank you.

212
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,760
Sir

213
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,080
I need you to find me some girls later.

214
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,440
The best kind of girls.

215
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,600
What? Find some girls?

216
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Yeah.

217
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
We don't do that at the Great Hotel.

218
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,240
You're looking in the wrong place.

219
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,040
Get out.

220
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
You got me wrong.

221
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,560
I want to find a girl as a sister.

222
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,920
Understand?

223
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,560
Not really.

224
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,680
Fine.

225
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,240
I want you to know this for sure today.

226
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Do you understand?

227
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,000
Sure, sure.

228
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,400
Hou Chi of Yuhua Sect is as good-looking as Pan An.

229
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,480
He is tall, gentle, and handsome.

230
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Devil Lord Qiu Ping is as good-looking as
Song Yu.

231
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,640
He is young and rich.

232
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,120
This is good.

233
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
No.

234
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,800
This is good.

235
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,480
Everybody

236
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,680
Hou Chi of Yuhua Sect and Devil Lord Qiu Ping

237
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,000
are eating at our restaurant today.

238
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,960
Any girls who want to see them?

239
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,120
Here, here.

240
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,960
Once every ten immortal coins.

241
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,160
Only ten immortal coins.

242
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
Even 20 immortal coins are acceptable.

243
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,440
Aren't we here for a big meal?

244
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,920
What is this?

245
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,760
Contest for sister selecting.

246
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,680
Contest for sister selecting?

247
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,040
It is.

248
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
What sister selecting?

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
For whom?

250
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,520
Come on, sit down, please.

251
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,400
It's about to start.

252
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,400
I'm helping you test your step-brother.

253
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,080
Don't worry. It's fine.

254
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
The first one.

255
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,040
The first one.

256
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,200
She is beautiful with fair skin and long legs.

257
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,320
Is she beautiful?

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
What do you think of her?

259
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,720
She is pretty,

260
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,840
and as elegant as hibiscus.

261
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,200
I think she is good.

262
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
Shi Xia, what do you think?

263
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,480
She is plain looking without charm.

264
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,160
Score.

265
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,760
You are out.

266
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,440
The second one.

267
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,160
The second one.

268
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,320
She looks like a flower.

269
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,160
Actually, she's got more on her mind
than you do.

270
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,760
She's both dignified and graceful,

271
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
like a bright peony.

272
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,880
I think she's good.

273
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,960
Peony?

274
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,520
You compare her to a peony

275
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,880
with a face like that?

276
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,240
Hou Chi

277
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,240
You don't have a good taste in selecting sister.

278
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,040
Score.

279
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,640
The third one.

280
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
The third, the third.

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,560
God.

282
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,760
Although the lady is not very beautiful,

283
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,360
she has a good figure.

284
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,480
All right, time's up.

285
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,280
You may be excused.

286
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,760
Gosh.

287
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll give you 20 more immortal coins.

288
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,720
I'll watch them a little longer.

289
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,400
Come on. Watch me. Come on.

290
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,240
You?

291
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,240
Go away.

292
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,680
Watch me.

293
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,720
Next...

294
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,960
My turn?

295
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,520
As for this girl,

296
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,120
do you also think she's good?

297
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,240
This girl has a round face

298
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,160
and big eyes.

299
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,160
I think she is worth considering.

300
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
So in your opinion

301
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,960
anyone with a round face and big eyes

302
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,920
can be your sister, right?

303
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,880
What's wrong with that?

304
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,720
Of course.

305
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,760
There were 153 girls today,

306
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,120
and you approved 153 times.

307
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,320
Did the Devil Lord think

308
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,880
that none of the 153 girls

309
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,480
could be a sister?

310
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Of course not.

311
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
Do you think it is a joke?

312
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
As long as it's a girl, you think she's good.

313
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,920
I gotta go.

314
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,480
It's not done yet.

315
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Distinguished guests, here's your food.

316
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,240
The dish is called Birds Pay Homage to the Phoenix.

317
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,359
It's is the specialty of our restaurant.

318
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,720
It looks like

319
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
superficially,

320
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,520
the phoenix accepts the worship of the birds.

321
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,800
But in fact,

322
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,280
the birds are for the phoenix's selection .

323
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,600
Cut it out.

324
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
Get rid of this dish. It's not good.

325
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,960
Yeah.

326
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,280
Wait a minute.

327
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,720
This is a good dish.

328
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,200
We just have to choose one out of a hundred.

329
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,120
Hou Chi, what do you think?

330
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,720
Exactly.

331
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,760
You.

332
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
Here comes the dish.

333
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,520
This dish is called Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl.

334
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,080
The pearl

335
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,000
is a dragon's favorite.

336
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,960
Two dragons like the pearl at the same time,

337
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,440
and fight for it.

338
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,080
It's a good dish.

339
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,200
The script is very realistic.

340
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,920
It shows the heart of the dragons.

341
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,800
Fight for what?

342
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,760
Did the two dragons ask the opinion of the pearl?

343
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,080
Another dish.

344
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,280
This dish is called the Leaping Carp.

345
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,400
Thousands of carp

346
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
tried to leap and survive.

347
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,000
But only one succeeded.

348
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,160
This dish is the grand finale dish

349
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,200
of the blessing feast,

350
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,400
which has a special meaning.

351
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,680
All right, you're hopeless.

352
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,920
There is only one who can leap over and survive,

353
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,400
and that must be me.

354
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,240
Enjoy your meal.

355
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,720
But don't give up.

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,760
Wait for another 200 years,

357
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,240
and I will not fight with you for the next head of the Alliance.

358
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,800
I have made an agreement with my sister

359
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,800
that I must be the head of the Alliance.

360
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,920
On the field, I never give in.

361
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,600
Give in?

362
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,320
I want you to be clear.

363
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,960
Did you give it to me last time?

364
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,680
I did it on my own merits,

365
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,200
the halo of the hero,

366
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,320
and the belief of the Chosen One.

367
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,360
It's different this time.

368
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,680
I have the Heart of Guardian.

369
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,760
Didn't you just get a sister?

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
Can you promise that your sister won't leave?

371
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,160
Come out with me.

372
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,320
She means you.

373
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,440
You.

374
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,640
I need to talk to you.

375
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,000
Go ahead.

376
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,600
What?

377
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,320
It's not your first day being my brother.

378
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,880
You've been so secretive all day.

379
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
What's wrong with you?

380
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
You've really wronged me this time.

381
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,560
Did I?

382
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,720
Have I ever wronged you?

383
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,040
You did it more than once.

384
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,760
Since my childhood,

385
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,520
you've driven away every male in my life.

386
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,920
I'm your real brother.

387
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,760
I have an obligation to protect my innocent sister.

388
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,520
I'm not innocent.

389
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,320
I have acute eyesight.

390
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,520
I saw clearly.

391
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,520
It was safer to hold sister's hand.

392
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,880
I signed a brother-sister contract with Hou Chi.

393
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,720
You think I want to be

394
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,120
the sister of that idiot.

395
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,240
Good. You don't want to be his sister.

396
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,760
And you are not the must for your idiot step-brother, either.

397
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,520
What did you say?

398
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,640
You can't tell

399
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,200
after the whole day?

400
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,520
I can tell.

401
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,920
I can tell you are not with kindness.

402
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,720
You are really stupid.

403
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
It totally proved that

404
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
Hou Chi is a bad brother.

405
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,040
Anyone can be his sister.

406
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,760
Think back today's contest.

407
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,800
Hou Chi gave every girl a pass.

408
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,800
What does that mean?

409
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,520
It means that in his mind

410
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,360
any woman can be his sister.

411
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,640
He grew up in the Yuhua Sect.

412
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,960
He is very simple.

413
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,520
He probably didn't want to

414
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,960
hurt the self-esteem of girls.

415
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,520
Simple.

416
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,960
You really hit the nail on the head.

417
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,400
Hou Chi lives in the mountains all his life

418
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,320
and never sees the world.

419
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,320
He never meets other women

420
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,040
except you.

421
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Suddenly he has come into the real world,

422
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,120
and seen all kinds of

423
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,960
attractive girls.

424
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,640
He has plenty of choices.

425
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,640
Yeah.

426
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
He recognized a sister for practicing and being the head of the Alliance.

427
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,600
It's the same with anyone.

428
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,520
There is no condition

429
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,320
for an elder brother to be nice to his sister,

430
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,480
regardless of her figure or temper.

431
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,920
What we care about

432
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,000
is unbreakable blood ties.

433
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
Believe it or not,

434
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm more reliable than your step-brother.

435
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,120
You'll see.

436
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,000
Nature.

437
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,640
Master, take your time.

438
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,600
How beautiful.

439
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Hurry up.

440
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,000
I can't hold on.

441
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,760
Sit down and take a break.

442
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,840
Sit down and have a rest.

443
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,360
Are you stalling for time?

444
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm not.

445
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,400
If you don't believe me,

446
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
you can just go.

447
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,720
Anyway, if Hou Chi doesn't listen to you,

448
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,600
don't come to me.

449
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,680
The umbrella has gone for so long.

450
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,920
I don't know if Hou Chi is ready.

451
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,200
Master

452
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,600
You all sit down and rest for a while.

453
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,560
Have a rest.

454
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,000
It hurts.

455
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,800
It hurts.

456
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,840
It hurts.

457
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,800
-Who are you?  -It hurts.

458
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,240
Qing Feng, pick that one for me.

459
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,920
Okay.

460
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,360
You...

461
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,800
You wanna die?

462
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,800
What are you doing?

463
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,720
My elder brother Zhen Shanhu...

464
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,240
What are you doing?

465
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,240
W... What are you doing?

466
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
What did you give me to eat?

467
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,560
What did you...

468
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Amazing.

469
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,600
It stops hurting.

470
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,320
What a skillful doctor.

471
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,640
A highly skilled doctor.

472
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,640
Guys

473
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
Throw a banquet in the base

474
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,680
to thank our skillful doctor

475
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,560
and his friends.

476
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,360
It's fine.

477
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,720
It's a piece of cake for me.

478
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,000
But Zhen Shanhu,

479
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
you and your brothers are supposed

480
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,920
to be bandits?

481
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,360
You...

482
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,160
What do you mean?

483
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,440
You should stay where bandits are supposed to be.

484
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,480
I...

485
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,480
Send them to court.

486
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,160
Don't you really want to take a detour and send them to court?

487
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
It is the duty of a fairy family to punish the evil and promote the good. Master.

488
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,480
I don't care.

489
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,720
I'll go first later.

490
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,000
Master Lord, please do not worry too much.

491
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,440
After all,

492
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Yi Yaogua is always with him.

493
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,880
Yaogua follows

494
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,840
the lead of him.

495
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,360
Nothing serious will happen.

496
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,720
Sir, I'm sorry.

497
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
I just missed a dish.

498
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,320
This dish is called Hang by a Thread.

499
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,800
It is a collection of eggs laid by 21 kinds of birds

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
from the nearby Sacred Mountain.

501
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,040
Hang by A Thread.

502
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,600
I need to help Devil Lord choose his sister quickly,

503
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,920
before he sets his sights on Shi Xia again.

504
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,640
Let's start.

505
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
Sister was right.

506
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,360
This should be done quickly.

507
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,680
Yeah, we do it quickly.

508
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,960
Don't call me sister from now on.

509
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,600
It's fine.

510
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Just pick a sister.

511
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
Hang by a thread.

512
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,640
Sister seems to be angry again.

513
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,040
As a real brother, I can't recognize my sister aboveboard,

514
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,440
I won't let the step-brother off.

515
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,440
Husppy

516
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,480
Please welcome contestant No. 154.

517
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,520
This sister is a master.

518
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,840
Although the girl does not show her real face,

519
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
her dancing is better than anything.

520
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,840
She is as quiet as a shy flower,

521
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,120
as dynamic as the weak willow in the wind,

522
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,040
as beautiful as a peach in spring,

523
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,560
as clear as a chrysanthemum in autumn.

524
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,600
I think she's great.

525
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,840
Don't you just want a new sister?

526
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,120
Let me help you.

527
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,120
Brother.

528
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,840
Brother?!
