My Dear Brothers
EP14

2
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
Devil Lord must still have poison inside his body.

3
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,080
It's a good time to revenge.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,120
Qing Feng

5
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
What does this mean?

6
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,560
She knows what she did.

7
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,400
It's a mistake.

8
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,840
She must be here for me.

9
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,600
Qi Lingling

10
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,760
Qi Lingling

11
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
She is Shi Xia's friend.

12
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
Don't do that.

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,760
Let's go.

14
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,760
You are the killing machine's

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,720
sister.

16
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,240
Why did you save me?

17
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,280
No. I'm not.

18
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
No. He's not.

19
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,520
He didn't kill anyone.

20
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,600
That Devil Lord who killed people is not him.

21
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,160
I can't explain this right now.

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,200
But whatever,

23
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,080
you are always my best friend.

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,680
The best friend in this world.

25
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
I know.

26
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,560
You and he is different.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
Even if you are the Devil Lord's sister,

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,960
you are still

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
my friend.

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,440
Thank you. Qing Feng.

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,960
I will let him make things up

32
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,840
and change his image.

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,440
But not everything can be restarted.

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,280
Restart?

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
I mean,

36
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,199
if one day,

37
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,920
he really had done everything bad,

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,640
then our friendship

39
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,400
will be ended.

40
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,800
Don't worry. It won't happen.

41
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,199
That will never happen.

42
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,640
Ok. I have to go back now.

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,600
Master Lord doesn't allow the apprentices
of Yuhua Sect to get close to Devil Sect.

44
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,200
Qing Feng

45
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,560
Can you take words to Hou Chi for me?

46
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,920
Tell him the Devil Lord wants to meet him.

47
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,280
The time will be at noon at clinic.

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
At noon, clinic.

49
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,199
Ok. I remember.

50
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,960
Your Majesty

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
The cure has been sent to Lingxiu Sect.

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,560
The apprentices of Immortal Sect
are almost free from the poison.

53
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,240
Where is Shi Xia?

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,400
Why can't I see her after I'm awake?

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,080
Shi Xia dressed up and went to see Hou Chi.

56
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,320
She said she wanted to
turn hostility into friendship,

57
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,760
and stop your battle.

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Did she really say that?

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
I dare not to lie.

60
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,600
Immortal Aunt was right.

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,320
If another chance given to Shi Xia,

62
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,520
she would choose Hou Chi.

63
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,880
Your Majesty, you lost.

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,720
Who said I lost?

65
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,920
I will never lose.

66
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,480
What is that umbrella?

67
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,360
It doesn't seem from the Devil Sect.

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,920
This is the umbrella from Yuhua Sect to send messages.

69
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,920
Send messages?

70
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,360
Can you use that?

71
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
I can give a shot.

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Hurry up.

73
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,120
Don't waste such a good thing.

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,920
Sister

75
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
Why are you here?

76
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,960
Actually, it was me who asked you to come.

77
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
I have words with you.

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,680
Are you here for the Devil Lord?

79
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
You afraid I will hurt him?

80
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
No.

81
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,320
Let's talk inside.

82
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,120
I have a secret to tell you.

83
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,760
A secret?

84
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,200
I keep hiding something from you.

85
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
But I didn't do that on purpose.

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,480
Actually, the Devil Lord is my brother.

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,480
Indeed.

88
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,480
So, you knew it?

89
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,680
But how?

90
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,480
After that day you went with him.

91
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,080
I knew I lost.

92
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,920
You recognized him as your brother.

93
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,280
That means I'm not as good as him.

94
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,920
But sister,

95
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,080
trust me.

96
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
I will be a good brother.

97
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,200
So can you come back

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,760
and be my sister again?

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,640
Do you think I left with the Devil Lord

100
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,240
because I recognized him as my brother?

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,560
You are half right.

102
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,520
But he is my biological brother.

103
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
Biological brother?

104
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,120
Do you remember

105
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,760
I have a brother in my hometown?

106
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,320
He is the Devil Lord?

107
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,800
Yes.

108
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,480
He went missing a year ago.

109
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,279
I didn't expect that he was here

110
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,840
and became the Devil Lord.

111
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,240
I swear to God,

112
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
I knew the whole thing
after I was off the mountain.

113
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
No need to swear.

114
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
I trust you.

115
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,480
That is to say,

116
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,440
the Devil Lord is not from here, either.

117
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,640
Or, in another word, he isn't from this time.

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,720
Right.

119
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,760
He is not real Devil Lord Qiu Ping.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,160
He replaced him

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,400
after he came.

122
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
He is not a bad guy.

123
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,440
Then congratulations.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
Finally, you find your brother.

125
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,560
Then,

126
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,400
I'll leave.

127
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,280
Wait. I'm here

128
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,080
to explain to you.

129
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,840
You've made it clear.

130
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:40,960
I understand.

131
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,159
I mean, I am the Devil Lord's
biological sister,

132
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,760
not his lover.

133
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,920
Which means you don't love him.

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Of course not.

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
Who will love him?

136
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,960
Then you don't recognize him as your brother?

137
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,400
And I am still your brother?

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,240
I told you my secret just because

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,240
I don't want you to misunderstand that.

140
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,720
After all, tomorrow is the selection
of the head of the Alliance.

141
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,440
Do it well. Be the head of the Alliance.

142
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,480
Did you remember that I take you
to enjoy the moonlight?

143
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Yeah.

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,400
No matter when,

145
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,200
our agreement will not change.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,160
You have to remember that.

147
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,760
Ok.

148
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,080
Wait for me.

149
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,440
I have a surprise for you.

150
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,640
Devil Lord, I will kill you today.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Shi Xia

152
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,320
It was her who wanted to see Master Hou Chi.

153
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,440
Why are you again?

154
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,800
What a coincidence.

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,680
Stop tailing me.

156
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,520
Get away.

157
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,320
How dare you be that rude?

158
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,040
Stop there!

159
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,680
Hi,

160
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm here to get the tree I ordered early this morning.

161
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Why did you come so late?

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,760
Did you sell it to others?

163
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,480
No. No. No.

164
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,720
I saved it for you.

165
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,720
Here.

166
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,120
This tree is so special.

167
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,320
(Admit to Hou Chi that you are a spy)

168
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,800
(of the Devil Sect before midnight.)

169
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,720
(Have him drop the idea.)

170
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
(Otherwise, just take the Devil Lord's dead body.)

171
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,160
Shi... Where's the Devil Lord?

172
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,240
He went for you.

173
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,160
Why are you so late, Shi Xia?

174
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,800
Yeah.

175
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,920
The Bamboo Dragonfly dropped this off on the way.

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,760
What's that?

177
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,360
What is that, Qi Lingling?

178
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,280
Your Majesty is in danger.

179
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,560
What?

180
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,160
Oh my god.

181
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Brother

182
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,000
Is it

183
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,840
kidnapping?

184
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,800
What should we do, Shi Xia?

185
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,760
Will he be safe back?

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,320
Immortal Aunt

187
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Shi Xia

188
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,240
Calm down.

189
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
Think about it.

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,840
Is there any clue about the one

191
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,360
who kidnap Your Majesty?

192
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,800
Yuhua Sect

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,880
Yuhua Sect

194
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,000
That makes sense.

195
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
The one who want to cut off you

196
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
and Hou Chi

197
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
must be Yuhua Sect.

198
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
It must be because I went to see Hou Chi secretly,

199
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,160
they kidnapped the Devil Lord.

200
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,760
It's all my fault.

201
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,360
I'll figure something out.

202
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
Shi Xia

203
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,800
You are back.

204
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
You must wait for a long time.

205
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,000
Doesn't matter.

206
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,360
Where's the gift?

207
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,880
Gift?

208
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Look at me.

209
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,360
Sorry, I broke it.

210
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
I have to ask you something first.

211
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,040
Dose Master Yuan Gui really hate

212
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
the Devil Lord that much?

213
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,760
Master Yuan Gui's temper is bad, indeed.

214
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,600
Qiu Ping likes to annoy him.

215
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,440
They are real butt heads.

216
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,040
Just give me a second.

217
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
(If you dare to ask for Hou Chi's help,)

218
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,080
(I'll let Devil Lord die.)

219
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
(The umbrella.)

220
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,400
(I only see this instrument in Yuhua Sect.)

221
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,800
(It's the solid evidence.)

222
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,320
(It is done by Yuhua Sect.)

223
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,520
Sister

224
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,400
Chick, you alone?

225
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,720
Brother

226
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,200
There is no condition for brother-sister relationship.

227
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
We're related by blood.

228
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,000
But I can't go with you.

229
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,240
I have to follow Hou Chi.

230
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,560
In your heart,

231
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,640
I am always a useless brother,

232
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,400
right?

233
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
What's on your mind?

234
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,520
I'm thinking that

235
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,160
the backyard of the Great Hotel is really elegant.

236
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,800
That's worth that
I taught the owner my best dishes,

237
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,360
and asked him to borrow us this place.

238
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,600
Taste that.

239
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
The food you made must be nice.

240
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,760
Hou Chi, toast to you.

241
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,640
Hope you will rank the top tomorrow.

242
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,520
Are you drinking alcohol?

243
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,760
What's wrong?

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,840
You almost got into trouble last time you drank.

245
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
Xia, you can't drink this.

246
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,440
You don't understand.

247
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,920
Alcohol is the best thing in the world.

248
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,160
Leading Master said that

249
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,640
alcohol is forbidden.

250
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Your master

251
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,640
Your master is the fakest person in the world.

252
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,120
Alcohol will lift the spirits,
smooth the sorrows

253
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,920
and screw the courage.

254
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,160
Do you still remember the story

255
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,320
about the Little Prince that I told you?

256
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:32,239
The one who lives alone

257
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,120
like me?

258
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:37,600
Did he find his rose in the end?

259
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,320
He met a drunkard later.

260
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
He asked the drunkard,

261
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,040
why you let yourself drunk every day?

262
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
The drunkard said that

263
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,840
he wanted to forget about those sad things.

264
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
Then the little prince continued,

265
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
what kind of thing made you sad?

266
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,040
The drunkard said, drunk every day.

267
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,080
Isn't it funny?

268
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,440
Not really.

269
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
But I want to taste.

270
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
You can't.

271
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,760
Why?

272
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,760
Because

273
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,480
it's only me who can put up the conditions.

274
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,560
You smiled.

275
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,120
Look.

276
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,600
The moonlight can really make people soft.

277
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,440
Moon,

278
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,880
can you never fall down?

279
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,880
The moon dims or shines.

280
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,960
Everything is rarely perfect.

281
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,320
Yes.

282
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,040
Men have sorrow and joy; they part or meet again.

283
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,000
Actually,

284
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,160
-I am...  -I'm so happy

285
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
you are by my side.

286
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,880
You can feel happy now?

287
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
It deserves to be celebrated.

288
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,680
I

289
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,760
I

290
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,760
I have to drink more.

291
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,800
What's this?

292
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,760
Bamboo dragonfly.

293
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
In our hometown,

294
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,880
if we have troubles,

295
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,600
we fly this.

296
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
It's like your trouble will also be taken away.

297
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,480
Shi Xia, I don't want you to be upset.

298
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,840
I want you to be happy.

299
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,320
The last time I flew one

300
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,920
was my parents had left me.

301
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,560
I hoped they would be back.

302
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,920
Even if they would give me a good beating
for being naughty.

303
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,000
But they would never know

304
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,800
whether I beat the test

305
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,320
or played truant.

306
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,280
Sister

307
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,200
Now you have me.

308
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,640
The weather is so dry,

309
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,280
take care not to catch the fire!

310
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,280
I

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,040
Why are you at a loss for words?

312
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,240
I lied to you.

313
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,360
Lied to me?

314
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,080
Yes.

315
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,480
I lied to you.

316
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,160
I retreated in order to advance.

317
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,320
Tricked you into recognizing I was your sister.

318
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,040
I had known that this

319
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,320
has no good to improve your practice.

320
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
That was a trap the Devil Lord set to you.

321
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,360
I don't care.

322
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,840
All I know is

323
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,400
I have recognized you as my sister.

324
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,400
But I'm the spy of the Devil Sect.

325
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
So what?

326
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,160
I mean,

327
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,240
everything I have done is all for

328
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,400
my biological brother, the Devil Lord.

329
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
I am here with you

330
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,320
is to let you break your rules

331
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,520
and drive a wedge
between you and your master.

332
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,520
This is all because I don't want you
to be the head of the Alliance.

333
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,120
But you just recognized me as your brother.

334
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,960
That was also a lie.

335
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,400
I only have one brother.

336
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,600
He is the Devil Lord.

337
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,160
Since you want to lie,

338
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,840
why don't you keep that lie?

339
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,320
Why do you tell me now?

340
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,520
Because I can't do that anymore.

341
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,920
You are so ridiculous.

342
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,480
How dare you trust me?

343
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
Your Master was right.

344
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
Women are bad omen.

345
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,520
I am the worst woman

346
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,920
in this world.

347
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,040
Stop drinking.

348
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,320
You'll get drunk.

349
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,880
Since our relationship is fake,

350
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,000
don't bother to care about me.

351
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,400
As long as you say

352
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,360
you still want to be my sister,

353
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,520
then I will guard you

354
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,280
and protect you

355
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,760
as always.

356
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,120
No way.

357
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,600
I'm from the Devil Sect.

358
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,760
We are enemies.

359
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,160
Do you really think I can do nothing to you?

360
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,640
Yes.

361
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,800
You, the Immortal Venerable.

362
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,560
How will you dispute this

363
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,200
to a girl without Holy Power like me?

364
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,040
And I have lied to you

365
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,320
for one more thing.

366
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,440
Cotton candy.

367
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,360
It can't be eaten casually.

368
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,480
You can only eat it with your lover.

369
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,480
So in the future,

370
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,040
be careful when you eat cotton candy.

371
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
The Immortal Venerable, Hou Chi

372
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,120
Wait.

373
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,840
One more question.

374
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,640
These days,

375
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,280
do you ever think of me as your brother

376
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,600
in your heart?

377
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,440
Never.

378
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,280
For you.

379
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,400
For me?

380
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,040
Is this the first time

381
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,560
you receive a present from others?

382
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
Does it look like the Holy Tree in your mind?

383
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,560
No matter when,

384
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,440
our arrangement won't change.

385
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,560
You must remember this.

386
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,920
Dad

387
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,680
Dad

388
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,200
Sister

389
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,120
Mom

390
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,360
Mom

391
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,440
Sister, let's release the last bamboo dragonfly

392
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,760
for our parents.
