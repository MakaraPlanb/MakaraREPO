My Dear Brothers
EP10

2
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Hou Chi, surprise

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,680
It seems no one lives here.

4
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,560
It seems Hou Chi is slower than me.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,160
I arrived earlier.

6
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,120
Do you think it's appropriate for me to come to him?

7
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,680
It's troublesome enough to have one brother.

8
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,960
Now I have two.

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,320
And they're enemies.

10
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,400
Shi Xia is my sister!

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
She's my sister!

12
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
First come, first served!

13
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,560
There's no need to argue.

14
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,360
So the negotiation is off the table.

15
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,120
No! No!

16
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,160
I won't let this happen!

17
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,640
Stop fighting!

18
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,160
If I interfere, it is nothing less than suicide!

19
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
What should I do?

20
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,720
No matter how,

21
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,800
I should find Hou Chi first.

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,680
When Shi Dong is not around, I'll explain it to him.

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,840
I don't belong to Devil Sect.

24
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,080
Then it works!

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,720
But what if he doesn't trust me?

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,120
He would hate me if I do that!

27
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,160
Nope.

28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,680
Why should I care if he hates me or not?

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,800
Tell me, should I look for Hou Chi or not?

30
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,280
If you point towards the north,

31
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,079
I'll go out to look for Hou Chi right now.

32
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,520
Good!

33
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
You're indeed pointing towards the north.

34
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,079
I accept your advice!

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,480
Good news! Good news!

36
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,840
I've fished for the information.

37
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,360
There's no one reporting for duty in Yuhua Sect.

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,240
So she lives alone!

39
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,640
She lives alone!

40
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,120
Then I'm relieved.

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Pass my order.

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,320
Ask guardians to guard the room of Yuhua Sect more strictly.

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,640
Did you hear him?

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,440
Keep an eye on it!

45
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,880
Yes!

46
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,000
If there's any man who tries to get in, beat him!

47
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,320
Beat him to death. Cripple him.

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,040
Wait.

49
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Do you want us to cripple him or beat him to death?

50
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
Depending on my mood.

51
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
Hou Chi, right?

52
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,440
How dare you share one room with Shi Xia?

53
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,920
Devil Lord rescued her himself.

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,400
It seems that Shi Xia is not an ordinary person.

55
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,360
Shi Xia even has no Holy Root.

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,600
How come she is not ordinary?

57
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
I think there must be a misunderstanding.

58
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,760
A misunderstanding?

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,880
Can it explain why she broke into the ward of Mount Yuhua?

60
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,160
Can it explain why she approached Hou Chi on purpose?

61
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,040
Can it explain why Devil Lord rescued her himself?

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
What I worry most is that

63
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
Devil Lord did so to prevent Hou Chi from election.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
For the Immortals Alliance election,

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,720
there must be a plan made by Devil Sect.

66
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,720
No need to talk.

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,680
I'll go downhill now.

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
I'll kill the devil girl to assist Hou Chi!

69
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
The fact hasn't been figured out yet.

70
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,880
Is Yuhua Sect killing the innocent?

71
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
Even though we cannot kill the innocent,

72
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
I won't allow Hou Chi to take the risk by himself.

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm willing to follow him to the Otherworld Town.

74
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm also willing to go.

75
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,200
Me too.

76
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,159
He's willing to give up the exam

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
to protect Shi Xia from danger.

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,280
In the world, I'm afraid that only I'm able to

79
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,960
be a good friend with Shi Xia,

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,760
talk for both sides,

81
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,280
and mediate between them

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,160
at the same time.

83
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,800
You can go.

84
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,160
But don't expect that you can protect Shi Xia.

85
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
In your journey,

86
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
remember the purpose of going downhill.

87
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Hou Chi

88
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,120
must be in the election.

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,120
Yes!

90
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,920
Yes!

91
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,520
It's of high quality!

92
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,320
Miss, Miss. Come here.

93
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,960
Did you see a handsome Immortal with a poker face?

94
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,000
No.

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,200
Hello. Did you see a tall,

96
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,280
slim, and handsome Immortal with a poker face?

97
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,680
No. No.

98
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,520
Dolls! Adorable dolls!

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Handmade dolls!

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,200
Of high quality!

101
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,840
Sir. Would you like a doll?

102
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,440
I never expect dolls can be so pretty.

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,360
How's that, Sir?

104
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,200
You really have a good taste!

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,160
This one is the bestseller.

106
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,600
Buy one.

107
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,560
Did you see a

108
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
handsome Immortal with a poker face?

109
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,880
No.

110
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,120
Sir.

111
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
See you next time, Sir.

112
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,600
Dolls! Adorable dolls!

113
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,360
Miss, Miss.

114
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,040
Look at dolls and see if there's anything you like.

115
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
I don't buy dolls.

116
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
Did you see a

117
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,080
handsome Immortal with a poker face?

118
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,360
He's about that height.

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
His eyes are just like these.

120
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Are you looking for that Immortal?

121
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,440
Miss!

122
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
Miss! Your Majesty is looking for you.

123
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,040
Where have you been early this morning?

124
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Your Majesty cannot find you!

125
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,040
Let me go!

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,720
No, I won't!

127
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,400
You're the only one whom Your Majesty likes.

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,680
Be good.

129
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
Go back.

130
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,320
Let me go.

131
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,280
I'll ask Your Majesty to order you to commit suicide!

132
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,680
No wonder you're chosen by Your Majesty.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
You have the same temper as him does!

134
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,040
Devil Lord Qiu Ping versus Hou Chi from Yuhua Sect.

135
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,920
Do not miss out on this!

136
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
Bravo!

137
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,760
Hou Chi. I've won already.

138
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,720
Just quit.

139
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,960
How come?

140
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,960
I, Hou Chi, as the best potential

141
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,600
successor of the leader of alliance in the celestial,

142
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
can never lose to you, who is

143
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
such a handsome, talented,

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
extraordinary, and well-known Devil Lord!

145
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,000
Sister

146
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,760
Sister

147
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,840
Sister

148
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
The Immortal Venerable. Look for others at other places.

149
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,560
Don't interrupt me to watch the show!

150
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,400
Are you watching the show?

151
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
Of course! Or are we watching you?

152
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,320
Go, go, go! Leave here!

153
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,480
My sister also likes to watch a show.

154
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,400
Where is my sister?

155
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,840
Where are you pointing at?

156
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,520
If you cannot find her, why would we use you?

157
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,640
Sorry I didn't finish the task.

158
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
You... you just order me to commit suicide!

159
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,880
That's it. That's it!

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,840
Forget it. Forget it!

161
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,680
She has the same temper as me.

162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,040
I didn't expect you to deal with it.

163
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,680
Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

164
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,320
Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

165
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Why... why don't you act according to the script?

166
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:12,480
Hou Chi! Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

167
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
The one who plays Hou Chi acts really well.

168
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,800
What crap are you talking about?

169
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,920
Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

170
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Beat him, Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

171
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,840
What an idiot you are!

172
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,760
It's you!

173
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,200
It's you!

174
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Who is he?

175
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
Oh lord! He is Hou Chi for real!

176
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,960
Tell me.

177
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Where is my sister?

178
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
How dare you ask me?

179
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,200
You caused my sister to be locked in the dark room.

180
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,520
How did you protect my sister?

181
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
The real Devil Lord

182
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,400
versus Hou Chi from Yuhua Sect!

183
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,800
It's coming!

184
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,200
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

185
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,760
Beat him!

186
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,120
Your Majesty

187
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,800
Good legs!

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,920
Give me a hand!

189
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,800
Beat him!

190
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,720
Get down!

191
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,960
Beat him! Beat him!

192
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,520
Hold on!

193
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
I don't come here to fight with you.

194
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,520
I come here to look for my sister.

195
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,440
Looking for your sister? Bah!

196
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,160
I must give you a warning today.

197
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Never meddle with others' belonging!

198
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,000
What did I meddle with?

199
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,440
You know what you have done!

200
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,880
Young man, you have no martial ethics.

201
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,680
You raid.

202
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,560
Come on.

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,040
Look how precisely I shoot!

204
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,560
Brother!

205
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,360
Who is she?

206
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,040
Sister

207
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,720
He knows her.

208
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,680
Why did they stop fighting?

209
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,160
What are they doing?

210
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,960
Thinking for a long time,

211
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,000
I still can't avoid the worst situation.

212
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,440
I hope the heaven

213
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,080
will bless me with wisdom and eloquence.

214
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,480
Didn't Devil Lord just say

215
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,240
never mess up with others' belonging?

216
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,560
Well,

217
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,720
Devil Lord is not vicious.

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,480
If he didn't bring me to the Otherworld Town,

219
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I wouldn't find you.

220
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,240
You...

221
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,320
I know you must feel strange and wonder

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
why did Devil Lord rescue me

223
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
from Yuhua Sect?

224
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
I didn't expect it myself.

225
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,080
But I'm not a spy from Devil Sect.

226
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,080
I have nothing to do with Devil Sect.

227
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Do you believe me?

228
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Of course I believe what you said.

229
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
I started to doubt myself.

230
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
But don't you doubt me at all?

231
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,840
You're my sister.

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,280
Wait me for a while.

233
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
The most difficult task for me

234
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
is finished in this way!

235
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
Pay attention to your standpoint!

236
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,080
I know.

237
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
Blood is thicker than water.

238
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,520
The Immortal Venerable acted so well!

239
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,560
This is your reward.

240
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,520
Follow me.

241
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,560
So rude!

242
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
The doll is handmade.

243
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,320
Have a look.

244
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Sir, I want this one.

245
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
I kept it for you.

246
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
I knew the Immortal Venerable would come and buy it.

247
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
Here you are.

248
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,520
The Immortal Venerable bought the doll

249
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,920
to send this lady as a gift.

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
The person that she was looking for is the Immortal Venerable.

251
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,520
What a coincidence!

252
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,520
Why did you rob my doll?

253
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
It's just a doll.

254
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,440
So annoying!

255
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,040
Immortal coins.

256
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,360
Sir

257
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
I'll buy all the dolls you have.

258
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,960
For my...

259
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,160
For myself.

260
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,400
Devil Lord needs so many dolls.

261
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,920
Are you victimized by severe insomnia?

262
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,240
Has the ward of your bedroom been canceled?

263
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,640
Not yet.

264
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
It's said that the ward is set by Shang Feng.

265
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,040
Shang Feng has been cultivating for more than 2,000 years.

266
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,280
How can I cancel his ward?

267
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,920
Since you came here to take part in the exam,

268
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
you should adhere to the rules.

269
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Why do you make the owner in a pickle?

270
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,640
Stupid!

271
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,480
If I didn't make him in a pickle, you will share...

272
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,120
the same room with your sister.

273
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Sister and I

274
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
have been living together in Yuhua Sect.

275
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,400
Any problem?

276
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,839
No. No.

277
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,280
Usually, my brother practices mediation outside,

278
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,800
and I sleep in my room. Right?

279
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,960
Right.

280
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,319
My sister is sleepless and afraid of dark.

281
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,040
I tell stories for her every night

282
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,160
to comfort her to sleep and then I leave.

283
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,760
Waiter! Come out!

284
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,560
I'll meet your boss.

285
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,360
Do you think it's easy for you

286
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,680
to see Shen Guan?

287
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,760
Devil Lord. May I have a word with you?

288
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,080
Let's go.

289
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
Hou Chi is as dumb as a piece of wood.

290
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
I share the same room with him.

291
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,360
It's you who takes the advantage.

292
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,600
What's your logic?

293
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,440
I...

294
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,960
Getting along with him in Yuhua Sect for such a long time,

295
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,720
I am also a spy around him.

296
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,520
I can help you to inquire information from him.

297
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,320
After all, blood is thicker than water.

298
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,520
Why do I think you are hoaxing me?

299
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,640
Why don't you believe your own sister?

300
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,600
Okay.

301
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
It's not a big deal to deny our relationship.

302
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,600
Tell everyone that we're siblings.

303
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,720
To let the world know that you're not Devil Lord Qiu Ping.

304
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,400
Husppy

305
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,560
Send Devil Lord to the room.

306
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,440
Take him away!

307
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,800
You wanna repel?

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,600
Hands...

309
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,480
Hands off me!

310
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,800
Or I'll order you to commit suicide!

311
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,480
If you miss the exam,

312
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,960
Immortal Aunt will also order us to commit suicide.

313
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,840
Let go of me! How dare you!

314
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on the room of Yuhua Sect?

315
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,160
Why does Hou Chi show himself in front of me

316
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
safe and sound?

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,680
I did intercept

318
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
an apprentice of Yuhua Sect,

319
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,000
and according to your order,

320
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,160
I crippled him.

321
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,360
Yes.

322
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,280
At first, one of his hands was crippled,

323
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,040
and then we broke one of his legs.

324
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
See?

325
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,680
Did I accidentally injure others?

326
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,040
I'll go to the Otherworld Inn.

327
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
No! No!

328
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
You should rest for over three months if your bones are broken.

329
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,720
You should at least rest for one month for your injured legs.

330
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Just live here as long as you can.

331
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,560
Junior Master is so young.

332
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,880
If you go outside alone,

333
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,640
what should you do if you're hoaxed by bad guys?

334
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,160
I've found Shi Xia.

335
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,200
Everything's okay. Don't worry.

336
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,920
Master Yuan Gui is ready to bring me downhill.

337
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm afraid it's not good for Shi Xia. Deal with it soon.

338
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,640
How long will it take for Master to pack up?

339
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,080
It's been almost six hours!

340
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Bi Hong. Hurry up! We should go now.

341
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,520
Let's go.

342
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,600
Master

343
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
We went downhill to perform a task.

344
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,400
But you're dressed like this.

345
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,800
That's a little bit too ostentatious.

346
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,160
I don't think so.

347
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
Doesn't my outfit fit

348
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,200
the style of our Immortal, which is the first Sect of all?

349
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,320
Lin Kui

350
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,160
You're right. Let's go!

351
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,600
Master

352
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,280
Wait for me.

353
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,200
Hurry up!

354
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,840
Hurry up!

355
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Okay.

356
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,080
Well, the room is a little bit tiny.

357
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,440
Is it?

358
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,760
It's the same size as my cottage.

359
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,080
You should look at the per capita area.

360
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,920
I live alone in your cottage.

361
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,640
But now we share one.

362
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,800
Look how tiny the room is.

363
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
When I yawn, I almost hit you.

364
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,760
Sister has never practiced Kung Fu.

365
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,520
You cannot hit me.

366
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,400
I...

367
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,680
I mean,

368
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,440
it's so inconvenient!

369
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,800
Please feel free to tell me why you feel inconvenient.

370
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
How dumb he is!

371
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,600
He knows nothing about the taboo between men and women.

372
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,520
Here you are.

373
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,160
My new doll.

374
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,560
I have always been wanting it.

375
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,640
What...

376
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,120
are you going to do?

377
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,880
This doll is ugly. Dump it.

378
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,280
Why are you so cruel?

379
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,720
The doll is made by yourself.

380
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,160
It has been accompanied with me for so long.

381
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,960
It's not its fault to be ugly.

382
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,480
It's innocent!

383
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,920
You two

384
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,720
should get along well with each other.

385
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
You're right.

386
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
I should be responsible for it.

387
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
Calm down, Shi Xia.

388
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,520
We just share one room. No need to panic!

389
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,720
What are you doing?

390
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,080
The clothes are worn out.

391
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,720
Right.

392
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,080
You really had a fierce fight with Devil Lord today.

393
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,000
Nope.

394
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,000
Even though they share one room,

395
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,120
I won't allow Hou Chi to be so comfortable.

396
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,640
Hot-chilly pot.

397
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,160
Hot chilly crayfish.

398
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,000
Does it smell good?

399
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,840
Good. So good!

400
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,280
So good!

401
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:18,760
Sister

402
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,000
Why do you look so strange today?

403
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,680
Do I?

404
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,440
Maybe I'm like you,

405
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,320
who is used to staying uphill for so long.

406
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,160
I'm not used to seeing so many people after going downhill.

407
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,560
Sister is lack of experience in the sword society.

408
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,440
Experience in the sword society?

409
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
Then tell me about it.

410
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,240
Rule number one:

411
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,560
Ask less, observe more.

412
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,840
Rule number two:

413
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,800
A golden key can open any door.

414
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
Is it also realistic for the celestial?

415
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,560
Where did you learn all of these from?

416
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm on the way looking for the entrance of Devil Sect.

417
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,320
Looking for the entrance of Devil Sect?

418
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,680
Didn't you come to the Otherworld Town to take the exam?

419
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
Why do you look for the entrance of Devil Sect?

420
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,080
I heard that Devil Lord took you way.

421
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,400
I wanted to rescue you.

422
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,800
It's a misunderstanding.

423
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
Devil Lord is also kind.

424
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
When he found that I missed you,

425
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,120
he brought me to the Otherworld Town.

426
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
You missed me?

427
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,560
What does miss mean?

428
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,080
Missing...

429
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,840
Missing means when you're separated with someone,

430
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,840
you're always thinking about the one.

431
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,560
You will feel time passes so slowly,

432
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,960
and every day you wish to meet him soon.

433
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,480
Just like when I missed my brother before.

434
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,360
Sister

435
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
I miss you too.

436
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,680
It's late snack time.

437
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
Rabbit heads. Hot-spicy pot.

438
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,920
Hot and spicy crayfish.

439
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,960
Don't miss the delicacies!

440
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,440
What... what are you doing?

441
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,320
I thought you would like to eat some marshmallow.

442
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,400
I... I want to eat stinky tofu!

443
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,200
This one. This one.

444
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,920
Delicious!

445
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,360
Have more of it.

446
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,440
The hot-spicy pot is so good!

447
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,280
So yummy!

448
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,240
It's not spicy enough.

449
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,280
Remember to add more peppers in it.

450
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,080
It's so easy to get yeet hay if it's so spicy.

451
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,880
I asked the cook to add less peppers in it.

452
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,480
Or you would shout again if you get pimples tomorrow.

453
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
It's been a long time since last time I ate spicy food.

454
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,120
If you don't allow me to eat what I want,

455
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll shout at you right now!

456
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,440
Sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.

457
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
This is my specialty.

458
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Stinky tofu.

459
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,840
It smells so stinky.

460
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,520
It must be poisonous.

461
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,640
I think you're the one who is poisonous.

462
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,800
You're poisonous!

463
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,080
It's called stinky tofu.

464
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
It smells stinky, but tastes good.

465
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,000
I'll taste it for you.

466
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
How's that?

467
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,640
The stinky tofu is amazing!

468
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
Husppy. Good for you!

469
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,760
Why... why are you in a daze?

470
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,560
Here. Have one.

471
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,920
Help yourself!

472
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,120
Here. Have one.

473
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,920
Help yourself!
