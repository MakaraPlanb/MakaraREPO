My Dear Brothers
EP03

2
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,280
I have something to ask you.

3
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,800
Oh God, is he gonna tell me how he feels?

4
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,400
Can I be your...

5
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,880
Guru

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,120
I know you're great,

7
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,400
and I respect you.

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
But I don't want a relationship yet.

9
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
... be your brother!

10
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,360
Brother?

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,160
There's such an intimate atmosphere,

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
but he just wanna be my brother?

13
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,520
What do you think?

14
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,360
No.

15
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,760
Why?

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,760
I have a brother.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
What your brother did or not,

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,760
I've done for you.

19
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Well, I have to thank you for that?

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,480
Thank you for not killing me

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,560
when you amuse yourself these days?

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,440
Why do you say that?

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,600
First you made me some awful food,

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
then you told ghost stories to scare me.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Just now you acted like going Bungee Jumping on the ferris wheel,

26
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,400
letting loose buckles.

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,760
I'm lucky to be alive for now.

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,440
Well,

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,600
how can I be a good brother to you?

30
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,560
Why do you want a sister?

31
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
In order to improve my force.

32
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,280
You...

33
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,400
I thought Yuhua Sect

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,640
is noble and decent.

35
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,160
How can there be such nonsense?

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,920
You just need to know that

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,960
brother will protect sister.

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,640
Oh great,

39
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't learn enchantments here,

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,400
but you intend to use me to enhance your force.

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,800
You want a sister? Ok.

42
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,880
But you have to promise me one thing.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,520
What?

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Send me to the academy to learn Enchantments.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,640
No.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
Then there's no need to discuss.

47
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,800
Each one minds his own business.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,200
Bye.

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
You look so upset.

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,280
Let me guess,

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
did you have a quarrel with sister?

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,120
No fight,

53
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,520
and no sister.

54
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,520
Let me tell you.

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,320
I have a friend,

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,560
who hasn't had a sister for many, many years.

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,600
Recently, he met one,

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,200
and he asked me for advice on many things.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,080
It goes well now.

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Senior, let me ask you.

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,040
If the younger sister doesn't want an elder brother,

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,240
what to do?

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,120
You were rejected?

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,920
Then you would be in the resurrection.

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,680
The most important thing in resurrection

66
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
is to find what she needs.

67
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
If she needs money,

68
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,480
give her money.

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,159
If she needs enthusiasm,

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,560
be enthusiastic.

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,760
If she needs tenderness,

72
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,640
be tender.

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
What does this sister need?

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,880
Senior

75
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,640
I recently encounter a talented man,

76
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,680
and I want to recommend him to the academy.

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,920
I wonder if you can help me.

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,320
Hello,

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,360
how do I look?

80
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,440
Thank you.

81
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,360
By the way,

82
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
Why didn't you recommend me in person?

83
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,640
Senior often goes outside the mountain.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,760
It makes sense for you to know him.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,400
What's this?

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,840
My smell is on this instrument,

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
and it can cover up your feminine scent.

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,000
Keep it with you.

89
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,560
It looks exactly the same as you!

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Even the expression!

91
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,000
What's its name?

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Instrument is instrument,

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
it has no name.

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll give it one.

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,640
How about "the doll pin"?

96
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,160
Remember, don't...

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't be found that I'm a girl.

98
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
Otherwise, I'll be whipped.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,920
Got it.

100
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,440
How can I use it?

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
If you are in danger,

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
it'll inform me.

103
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,640
You are the pretty... boy

104
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,960
who met my Junior

105
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,480
by chance?

106
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
You really look so pretty.

107
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,800
Uncle Master

108
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,400
Am I that old?

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,920
Since you are a peer of my junior,

110
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,880
how about call me Senior?

111
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,920
Senior

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,320
The hierarchy is wrong.

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We feel like old friends at the first meeting,

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,960
with our mutual agreement,

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,080
why not?

116
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,680
Let's go, take the kid to school.

117
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm not a kid.

118
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,000
My junior and I are 200 years old.

119
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,360
In our eyes,

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
you're a kid.

121
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,880
Let's go.

122
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,480
Master Uncle

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,240
Master Uncle

124
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,720
Here he is.

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,920
Is he the talented man recommended by Bi Hong?

126
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm Shi Xia,

127
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,480
live in Lotus Village down the mountain.

128
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,320
Please allow me to enter

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
Yuhua Sect.

130
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,760
Lotus Village?

131
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,840
Never heard of any talented man

132
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
with immortal perception there.

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,640
Right.

134
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,679
He has no immortal perception.

135
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,880
Nonsense!

136
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,720
How can one cultivate without immortal perceptions.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,680
When is there a rule in Yuhua Sect that

138
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,800
one can't cultivate without immortal perceptions?

139
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
Even there isn't a rule,

140
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
you should know it.

141
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,120
If one has no immortal perception but forcibly do that,

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
it's like a drop in the ocean,

143
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
comparing eternity with sun and moon.

144
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,120
Every man has his destiny. Don't delay him.

145
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,280
Yeah,

146
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,360
I've been doing nothing all day,

147
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
just fool around with birds and flowers.

148
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
More importantly,

149
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
I have no immortal perception, too.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,680
What a pity,

151
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,600
I live for 200 years.

152
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,800
Interesting, isn't it?

153
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,560
Even if you live for a thousand years,

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
you're not equal to one

155
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
with immortal perception.

156
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,800
Don't get angry.

157
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,680
You finally tell the truth.

158
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,920
Anyway, in your eyes,

159
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm nothing.

160
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Stop talking,

161
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
take him back.

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,960
May I say something?

163
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,600
The Immortal Venerable said, every man has his destiny.

164
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,680
Then if a creature was

165
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,920
born to be evil,

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,440
he is doomed to be evil,

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
and there's no need to change him?

168
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
In my hometown,

169
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,920
there's a saying,

170
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,480
I am the master of my own fate.

171
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,600
Why bother?

172
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,240
Let him audit for a month as usual,

173
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,840
and he can become a full member if he gets the signatures of all the elders.

174
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,600
Otherwise, stop pestering.

175
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,840
I agree.

176
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Do as you say.

177
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes!

178
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,800
Yes!

179
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,360
In such a big place,

180
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
he just sits in the corner,

181
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,200
maybe he is a study slacker who sleeps in the class.

182
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,840
Excuse me,

183
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,200
hello, I'm new here.

184
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,840
You must be the bold external student

185
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,440
who has no immortal perception and not from any famous family

186
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,360
and want to cultivate.

187
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,600
I have to ask, the one who

188
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,880
gangs others up,

189
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,920
and with pompous manners,

190
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,200
and puts cultivation secondary,

191
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,400
gossip first,

192
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,360
who are you?

193
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,320
The owner of this seat.

194
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,120
So, it's you who messed with me!

195
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,040
There's no seating chart,

196
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
why do you say it's yours?

197
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,720
Go and ask around.

198
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Our big brother, Yi Yaogua,

199
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,600
the only son of the Baling Yi family.

200
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,880
The instruments made by his family

201
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,160
are the most sophisticated and powerful in the whole immortal world.

202
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,520
All the sects scramble for that.

203
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,720
Every instrument is hard to get.

204
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,560
It turns out you are a son of immortals.

205
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,920
You!

206
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,920
Qing Feng

207
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,200
Nice dress today.

208
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,920
Take it off!

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Take it off!

210
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,560
What are you doing?

211
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,480
He is wearing the same style as Uncle Master,

212
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
and he's not qualified to wear it.

213
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,080
Aren't all blue clothes the same?

214
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,080
So are you.

215
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah.

216
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,680
I say he can't, then he can't.

217
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Let me go!

218
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,720
Now you beg for mercy,

219
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,800
too late!

220
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,200
You just can't wear the same style!

221
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,640
Big brother, now it's not the same.

222
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,720
Why is it so abnormally quiet today?

223
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,280
Not even a bird or a worm chirping.

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,320
I heard that it's a nice room for two.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
Except for a new roommate,

226
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,400
it's just like being with Guru.

227
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,280
Hello? Anyone here?

228
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:15,920
Who's there?

229
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,800
Sorry,

230
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,320
I don't know someone was here.

231
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,600
Don't come over!

232
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,560
Ok, I'll go.

233
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,720
We're all men, what are you afraid of?

234
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,320
I...

235
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I warn you,

236
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,520
I'll teach you a lesson if you come closer.

237
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,079
I found your secret.

238
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,400
What secret do I have?

239
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,440
If you come closer,

240
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,119
I'll be unkind.

241
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
You?

242
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,200
The skin,

243
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,600
the body,

244
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,280
and the chest wrap,

245
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,560
do you think I'm blind that I can't tell you're a girl?

246
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,240
What do you want?

247
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,440
What do I want?

248
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,880
It depends on you.

249
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,880
If you make public, don't blame me for being rude.

250
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
Let me go,

251
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,080
I'm kidding.

252
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,280
I'm not kidding.

253
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,600
The doll pin is not with sister?

254
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,200
What a coincidence!

255
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
It's like

256
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,240
Hua Mulan meets Zhu Yingtai.

257
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,240
It's really a coincidence.

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
But yours is a very advanced instrument.

259
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
No wonder your smell

260
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
was covered up so completely.

261
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
What about you?

262
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,960
How do you cover up yours?

263
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,320
This is Black-Sun Elixir,

264
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,120
which can replenish the male smell

265
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,400
to cover up female one.

266
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
But I have to take it

267
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,560
every four hours.

268
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,800
This is great!

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
If I lose the doll pin someday,

270
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,760
I can borrow yours.

271
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,600
You'd better not.

272
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
As a girl,

273
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,360
taking it will damage your body.

274
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,040
You can't stand it.

275
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,560
You come to Yuhua Sect for study

276
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,320
despite the harm to your body.

277
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,560
You don't

278
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,200
come for idol

279
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,520
as Yi Yaogua does, do you?

280
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,160
Of course not.

281
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,720
I want to practice the enchantments well, it's useful for me.

282
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,080
Tell me about you.

283
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
Why do you come here?

284
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,040
I...

285
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,400
... want to learn the enchantment of breaking the virtual space.

286
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,880
I've never heard of that before.

287
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
Is there anyone who might know?

288
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,240
Master Yuan Ye.

289
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,720
He's very knowledgeable.

290
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,200
If you can get on his good side,

291
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,320
I think you can get some clues.

292
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,920
How?

293
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,720
How is your painting skill?

294
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
After a fashion.

295
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,280
That's what I drew.

296
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,680
What, people...

297
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,680
It's not important, go on.

298
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,120
Master Yuan Ye

299
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,000
probably will test History of Immortals tomorrow.

300
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,080
I heard that there was a senior student

301
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,000
who drew an illustration during the exam.

302
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,120
The picture and its accompanying essay were both excellent.

303
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,200
Master Yuan Ye was very satisfied.

304
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,360
History of Immortals...

305
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,720
Where's my textbook?

306
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,560
Junior Master

307
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,040
Please bless me to be like you,

308
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,920
to be the most famous star in the immoral world,

309
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,560
to be a great hope of a sect.

310
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,640
It was your fame that brought me to Yuhua Sect.

311
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,680
Hopefully in the near future,

312
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,880
I can see you again.

313
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,800
We have a test today,

314
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,200
and the content is

315
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,680
the science of holy beast.

316
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,200
Wasn't it History of Immortals?

317
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,600
Yeah, why changed?

318
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,840
Each one draws a holy beast,

319
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,520
not limited to textbook.

320
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,760
You can start.

321
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,720
It's over.

322
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,760
I forgot bringing the textbook.

323
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,120
I don't even have things to copy.

324
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,840
Shi Xia

325
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
Where did you get your school supplies?

326
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,480
A friend gave them to me.

327
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
This is a sketch pen,

328
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,360
you can speed up

329
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
100 times by using it.

330
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,600
This is the erasure paper,

331
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,400
it can be reused 100,000 times.

332
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,200
You have a very thoughtful friend.

333
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,480
So amazing.

334
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,360
Master Yuan Ye, excuse me.

335
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,720
I met Junior Master when patrolling the mountain,

336
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,960
he said he was looking for a student

337
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,240
called Shi...

338
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,240
Yes, it's me, it's me, it's me!

339
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,360
It's me, it's me!

340
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,680
You...

341
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,560
Others go on.

342
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,240
Junior Master

343
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Junior Master

344
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,760
Junior Master, Junior Master

345
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,720
Why are you here?

346
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,760
I'm Yi Yaogua,

347
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,560
the most excellent student of this year.

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,080
What can I do for you?

349
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,840
Junior Master truly deserves his reputation,

350
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,640
handsome and charming,

351
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,680
graceful and gentle.

352
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What classes are you taking these days?

353
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,800
It's no more than the Histories of Immortals,

354
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,400
an introduction to noble families,

355
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,520
a general history of fairy arts,

356
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
the science of charms, instruments and holy beasts,

357
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,280
and spirit maintenance.

358
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,240
Some practicing experience of mine.

359
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,320
God, it's, it's, it's

360
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,960
Junior Master's note!

361
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,480
Take it back and study with your classmates.

362
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,720
Junior Master is really a prodigy.

363
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,920
If you could teach us for a few days,

364
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,360
I'd die without regret.

365
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,440
Even if you do as Master Yuan Ye,

366
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,920
who said test the History of Immortals,

367
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,360
but changed to the science of holy beast,

368
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
I'm willing to take your class!

369
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,560
Change the subject at the last minute?

370
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,520
Don't worry,

371
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,040
I'm knowledgeable,

372
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,320
and I have your note.

373
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,240
It doesn't matter.

374
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,640
I only pity those study slackers.

375
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,120
Study slackers...

376
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,320
Cobras?

377
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,800
Alligators?

378
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,160
Zombies?

379
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,040
May I come in?

380
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,880
Have a seat.

381
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,720
The test is over.

382
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,720
Any volunteer can

383
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,800
show his painting to us?

384
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,680
Master Yuan Ye, I'll go first.

385
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,720
What I drew is called Yong.

386
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,640
It's a bird with a human face,

387
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,520
four eyes

388
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,880
and ears.

389
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,880
Your stroke is exquisite.

390
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,560
The four eyes are just in the right size and arrangement.

391
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,640
So it can...

392
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,680
It can scatter cloud.

393
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,520
So where it is,

394
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,120
there is a great drought.

395
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,640
Great, it's not in the textbook.

396
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,560
Your knowledge is very good.

397
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,200
Others,

398
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,160
You all have to learn from Yi Yaogua,

399
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
not limited to the textbook.

400
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,800
Next,

401
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,480
everyone show the holy beast you have drawn in turn.

402
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
I drew a phoenix bird.

403
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,280
Good.

404
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,280
Baize.

405
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,880
Not bad.

406
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,360
The one who is new here,

407
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
what did you draw?

408
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,200
This is a human baby?

409
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,600
This kind of holy beast

410
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,280
is also called "Four-legged gold-spending beast" in my hometown.

411
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,440
It's the most powerful beast in my hometown.

412
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,720
You don't have to take this class anymore.

413
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,000
Please don't, Master!

414
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,720
I need the approval of the elders,

415
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
could you give me another chance?

416
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,760
If you can draw one,

417
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,280
I'll eat it.

418
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,120
That's what you said.

419
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,320
Master Yuan Ye temporarily changed test.

420
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,360
I'm afraid sister that has not prepared for it.

421
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,840
Master

422
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,680
You want to go outside?

423
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,320
Master

424
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
I have something that I don't understand

425
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,400
to ask you.

426
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,480
Go ahead.

427
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,720
As the old saying goes,

428
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,320
it is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books.

429
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,920
Whether it's time for me

430
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,160
to travel outside?

431
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,560
I appreciate that

432
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,280
you can think so.

433
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,120
But it is not the right time to go outside.

434
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,400
When you are the Lord of Immortals Alliance,

435
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,800
you'll have many chances to experience the world.

436
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,040
I see.

437
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,800
The new student,

438
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,280
how is your painting?

439
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,920
Big brother, what's that?

440
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,920
This beast is called Sun Wukong.

441
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,120
It is not what you paint carelessly, is it?

442
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,280
Nonsense!

443
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,080
This is a very rare ancient beast.

444
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,920
Master must know it.

445
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,960
The ancient beast is...

446
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,400
Master Yuan Ye

447
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,920
I have been reading extensively since childhood.

448
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,880
Why haven't I seen such a holy beast?

449
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,920
Yi Yaogua

450
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,400
You read extensively?

451
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,640
For Master, that's teaching fish to swim.

452
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,560
There is one or not, Master will make decision on his own.

453
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,360
Well...

454
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,120
Let me help you recall.

455
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,760
Sun Wukong is different from ordinary holy beasts.

456
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,280
It's intelligent but stubborn and obstreperous.

457
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,040
First it got Golden cudgel at the dragon's palace.

458
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,280
Then it drew on the death book in the hell.

459
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,720
After that, the heaven assigned it to be an official.

460
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,720
Then it made havoc in heaven,

461
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,240
fighting with 100 thousand of soldiers.

462
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,600
But it was still defeated by the Tathagata,

463
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,280
and was pressed under five fingers mountain for 500 years.

464
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,640
Yeah, right, I remember.

465
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,160
In the early years,

466
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,920
I used to have it,

467
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,920
which was particular about food and very hard to feed.

468
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,440
It's just a holy beast from unofficial history.

469
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,560
No wonder you didn't obey the basic drawing method

470
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,320
of holy beasts.

471
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,240
I didn't

472
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,040
because it's presented differently.

473
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,600
Master, please wait.

474
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,480
Qing Feng

475
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,520
Please hand me my pen and notebook.

476
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,880
I've never seen painting moving before!

477
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,120
Awesome!

478
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,680
Great! Great!

479
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,640
Shi Xia, you really took me by surprise.

480
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Good, very good!

481
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Go ahead, eat it.

482
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,840
The whole book is yours.

483
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,720
This new student is really good.

484
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,960
Yeah, I've never seen

485
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
this drawing method before.

486
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,760
Little one

487
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,120
Which book did you know Sun Wukong from?

488
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,760
Give it to me!

489
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,040
Give it to you? Ok.

490
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,560
Maybe your big brother didn't have enough to eat.

491
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,200
You!

492
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,800
Don't put shame on your face!

493
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,160
Come on,

494
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,880
face is given by others,

495
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
but shame is caused by himself.

496
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,600
Let's go.

497
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,760
Stop!

498
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,760
You made a fool of me
in front of so many people.

499
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,920
I won't just let you go!

500
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,760
My instrument!

501
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,520
Master Yuan Ye

502
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,480
Master Yuan...

503
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,320
We've been tricked. Go for them!

504
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,160
Run!

505
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,720
There they are! Go!

506
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,520
Big brother

507
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,960
What?

508
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,720
Isn't this Black-Sun Elixir?

509
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,920
Someone dressed as men!

510
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,240
There's actually something so crazy in Yuhua Sect.

511
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,280
This is a butterfly instrument,

512
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,880
which loves to follow women's scent.

513
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,920
Let's go!

514
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,120
What about Little One?

515
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,320
Are you stupid?

516
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,800
Little One

517
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,480
is not crazier than dressing as men!

518
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,840
Butterfly, go!

519
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,600
What's wrong?

520
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
God, I lost my Black-Sun Elixir!

521
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,840
It's too late. Let run away first.

522
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,880
Qing Feng, are you all right?

523
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,960
Shi Xia, go.

524
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,040
The potency of medicine is about to wear off.

525
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,200
They'll catch me soon enough.

526
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,400
No, you're hurt.

527
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,120
I can't leave you!

528
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,240
I'll get you in trouble,

529
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,960
go!

530
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,120
You can use this.

531
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,560
Shi Xia

532
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,560
Shi Xia

533
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,880
Master won't agree with

534
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,800
me going outside now.

535
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,360
What are you doing?

536
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,320
-Get out of my way!  -Go!

537
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,480
See where she can go!

538
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,240
Go away! Stop chasing me!

539
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,040
Go away!

540
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,680
Go!
