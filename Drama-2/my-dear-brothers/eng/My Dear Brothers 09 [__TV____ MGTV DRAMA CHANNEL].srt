My Dear Brothers
EP09

2
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,080
Seriously?

3
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,080
It's quite dark.

4
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,360
Why do you bring me here?

5
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,440
To get home quickly.

6
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,920
So you come the farthest way round?

7
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,760
It's so weird.

8
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,440
Ouch, I've got a tummy ache.

9
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,520
Just wait for me here.

10
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,400
Again?

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,200
Three minutes.

12
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, Shi Dong, you liar.

13
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,680
Why do you leave me...

14
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,320
Shi Dong

15
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,040
Shi Dong

16
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,960
Shi Dong

17
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,920
Shi Dong

18
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,840
Shi Xia

19
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,840
Shi Dong

20
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,960
Where are you?

21
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Shi Dong

22
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,680
Sorry,

23
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,080
I couldn't be with you on your birthday.

24
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,680
That's okay.

25
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm used to the fact that

26
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
you are unreliable.

27
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,840
So, Shi Dong didn't leave me on purpose.

28
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
He's also here.

29
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Your Majesty

30
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,880
Here to visit your Majesty.

31
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,560
Your Majesty?

32
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
How dare you!

33
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Why not kneel down

34
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
at the sight of the Devil Lord?

35
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Kneel!

36
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,560
Devil Lord Qiu Ping?

37
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,240
How dare she address the Lord by name?

38
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,680
Deserve a beating.

39
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,480
How dare you?

40
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
Stay away from her, or you will die miserably.

41
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,440
From now on,

42
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,200
you should call Shi Xia your Devil Lady.

43
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,280
You should respect her

44
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,440
as you respect me.

45
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,400
Got it?

46
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,160
Wait, your Majesty.

47
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,520
Just order me as you like, Devil Lady.

48
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Gosh, Shi Dong is the Devil Lord.

49
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Now I'm a spy of Devil Sect in their eyes.

50
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,400
Are you sick? Why take so many medicines?

51
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,040
Are you looking me down?

52
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,360
Don't you know Dragon Ball?

53
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
Today I'll widen your horizon.

54
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,840
This is the Ark,

55
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,920
a means of transport invented by me.

56
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,800
Do you like it?

57
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,240
Come on.

58
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,520
Follow me, Erha.

59
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,080
Do you like it?

60
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,880
Have a look.

61
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,680
Look at this,

62
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,120
it's the driver's cab.

63
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,040
Look at that horse.

64
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,760
Great, right?

65
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
Come here.

66
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Come on.

67
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,000
Bubble tea.

68
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,120
I've never expected I could drink it in this world.

69
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,760
You've scared me!

70
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,920
Remember to shake it before drinking,

71
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,600
or you'll miss its essence.

72
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,160
There wasn't such thing before,

73
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,200
but I invented it.

74
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,200
I remember that Bubble tea is your favorite drink.

75
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,560
Just a sip.

76
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,360
You've drunk so much!

77
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,200
You didn't say how much a sip could be.

78
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,120
You can drink like I do.

79
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
Shi Dong

80
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Come on.

81
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,200
Shi Dong

82
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Do you like it?

83
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,040
Just so so.

84
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,280
I haven't had milk tea for long

85
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,520
so I can bear this now.

86
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,880
What?

87
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,560
Get lose.

88
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,160
You heard that? Leave here.

89
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Don't stand in the way.

90
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,040
I mean you.

91
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,200
Devil Lady, huh?

92
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,440
The days that Immortal Aunt isn't here...

93
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,000
Get out!

94
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,560
are numbered!

95
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
Don't hinder us from

96
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
talking about the old days.

97
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
The Yuhua Sect is so mean.

98
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
The dress is too plain.

99
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,200
When we return to Devil Sect,

100
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,960
I will make you a set of advanced custom clothing.

101
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
I'm here for you now.

102
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,760
It's on my schedule.

103
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,440
Here for me?

104
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,120
Stop boasting.

105
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,400
Now I know

106
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,160
you were enjoying life here the year you disappeared.

107
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
You don't understand.

108
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,280
Thanks to the past year,

109
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,200
I could grow into

110
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,920
the hero in an adventure novel.

111
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,200
What do you mean?

112
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,840
I've jumped into the sea, jumped off the cliff

113
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,400
and been struck by the lightning.

114
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,680
But I can't go back to our world no matter what I've done.

115
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
Then I figured out a question,

116
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,760
why I can't die as I wish.

117
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,560
Have you read time travel novels?

118
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,840
Why the hero in an adventure novel

119
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,080
be able to achieve in unfavorable circumstances?

120
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,800
Look at me,

121
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
I've been the Devil Lord within one year.

122
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,960
This only shows

123
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,720
I am destined to be the hero in an adventure novel.

124
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,840
You've lost your mind.

125
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,960
Don't believe me?

126
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
I'll show you.

127
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,560
Junior Master has never gone downhill and is unfamiliar with the road.

128
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,120
This trip is a good opportunity

129
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,200
to get closer to him.

130
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,160
Hope to discuss

131
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,760
the practice experience with him within three days.

132
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,720
This way, Master.

133
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,920
I've arranged everything for you,

134
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,840
the inn, restaurant,

135
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
tea house, and rest place along the way.

136
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,320
Just rest assured to follow me on the road.

137
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,400
Shi Xia has been captured by Devil Lord Qiu Ping.

138
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,720
Please rescue her quickly.

139
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
There are many bandits

140
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,480
in these places circled by red.

141
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,120
There are some liars who sell fake medicines

142
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,840
in the places circled by green.

143
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
So I suspect that

144
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
there are strongholds of Devil Sect

145
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,920
near these circled places.

146
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,120
Master, the Fairy-demon Town isn't in that direction.

147
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,280
Junior Master, where are you going?

148
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,880
Devil Sect.

149
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,080
The owner asked you to go to the Fairy-demon Town

150
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
to participate in the preliminary contest of the alliance election,

151
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,040
but you are going to the Demon Sect.

152
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,200
Just because of Shi Xia?

153
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,960
Shi Xia was captured by the Devil Lord.

154
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,680
She is the Devil Lord's friend.

155
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,560
He didn't capture her, but rescued her.

156
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,560
You can rest assured.

157
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
Shi Xia isn't a spy.

158
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,800
Do you know how to go to the Devil Sect?

159
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,280
Devil Sect has stayed away from the world for a long time.

160
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,760
For more than two thousand years,

161
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,080
no one has got the entrance.

162
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
How can I know it?

163
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,560
Junior Master is really obsessed.

164
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,520
If he continues like this,

165
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,880
he will only go further on a wrong path.

166
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,440
No, I can't

167
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,400
allow him to do this.

168
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,080
I should help him find the witch

169
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,440
and question her to make him give up completely.

170
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
Wait for me in the Fairy-demon Town.

171
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,440
I will meet you again

172
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,240
when I rescue her.

173
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,240
No, I have to go with you.

174
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,680
You see, you've never gone downhill

175
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
and you don't know the dark side of the world,

176
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,920
but I am different.

177
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,200
Let's welcome the Devil Lady.

178
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,000
Long live the Devil Lord!

179
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,760
Long live the Devil Lord!

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,360
How about this?

181
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,280
How about this?

182
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,280
Long live the Devil Lord!

183
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,920
Okay.

184
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,800
Long live the Devil Lord!

185
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,160
Erha

186
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,360
Hey,

187
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
is this the slogan I asked you to chant this morning?

188
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
Don't you remember?

189
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,480
Listen to my direction, okay?

190
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Morning, friends in Devil Sect.

191
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,520
Morning, your Majesty.

192
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
Our slogan is...

193
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,480
The road to become immortal is long,

194
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,760
and milk tea will always be with you.

195
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,920
Sugar, milk and ice,

196
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,600
Devil Sect will help you go ahead.

197
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah, help you go ahead.

198
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,840
I can sell 600 more immortal coins of holy power.

199
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,520
Can holy power be bought and sold here?

200
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
In my place,

201
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,840
as long as you are diligent and wise,

202
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
you can win immortal coins.

203
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
Holy power can be bought by immortal coins,

204
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,080
and immortal coins can be bought by holy power.

205
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,720
In this way,

206
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,720
you can live a decent life

207
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,120
as a person with Immortal perception.

208
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,640
Besides,

209
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,680
those holy power will be of great use someday.

210
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,800
Good job.

211
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,840
See,

212
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,680
you can't deny that I'm capable.

213
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,240
I'll be the head of Immortals Alliance.

214
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
You also want to run for the leader of Immortals Alliance?

215
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,760
What does it mean?

216
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm destined to be the leader of Immortals Alliance.

217
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,800
The ending of my hero's script is,

218
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I'll become the leader

219
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
and lead Devil Sect to the top.

220
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,560
You, go here and search.

221
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:06,840
Yes, boss.

222
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,040
You two,

223
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,480
go there and search.

224
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,239
Yes, sir.

225
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
Master, I've sent out the mission.

226
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,400
We just need to wait for the result.

227
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,160
What is this?

228
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,000
This is immortal coin, or money.

229
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,960
Why do they take it and work for you?

230
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,080
This is the first experience you have to learn.

231
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,840
Money makes the mare go.

232
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
We need money for everything

233
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,480
after going downhill.

234
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,760
Good, you have a lot of money.

235
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,880
Master

236
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
I will make you the symbol of

237
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,400
Yuhua Sect again.

238
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,280
You will definitely not be able to accept

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,160
such a large amount of information at once,

240
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,960
or take a sip of milk tea to recollect your thoughts.

241
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,480
Come on, take a sip.

242
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,400
How do you become the Devil Lord?

243
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,080
Where is the original one?

244
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,120
The last Devil Lord Qiu Ping is tyrannical.

245
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,360
Nobody can find him now.

246
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,440
Only I can take on

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
this important task at present.

248
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,280
So you are

249
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,360
an impostor?

250
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Not so serious.

251
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,080
Just borrow his identity temporarily.

252
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,000
What's more, no one knows Qiu Ping's face.

253
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,040
What if you are found out

254
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,720
that you are not the real Devil Lord Qiu Ping

255
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,960
one day?

256
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,360
Don't worry.

257
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,120
This kind of small probability event

258
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,160
is unlikely to happen to the hero.

259
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,680
All right.

260
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,280
Up to you.

261
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,480
Take me to the preliminary contest of the alliance election.

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
Why?

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,560
Is it because of Hou Chi?

264
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
That's not true.

265
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,880
How can I miss

266
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
the glorious moment

267
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
when my brother

268
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,880
is elected as the leader?

269
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,560
What if we meet Hou Chi?

270
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Come on,

271
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm his little sister now.

272
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,480
No way, since you've found your true brother,

273
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,840
you have to sever ties with him.

274
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,520
Got it?

275
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't be childish.

276
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,240
We can't let others know our relationship.

277
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,080
We both need an identity in this world.

278
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,520
You are Devil Lord Qiu Ping,

279
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
and I'm Hou Chi's sister.

280
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,120
I don't agree.

281
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
As your brother, I can't agree.

282
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Somebody help!

283
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,040
Okay, I'll take you there.

284
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
That's a deal.

285
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,080
Go and change your clothes first.

286
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,760
Master

287
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,200
Where did you get this map?

288
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,960
The drawing is twisted and hard to read.

289
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,920
This is certainly not from a professional.

290
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,200
Most important of all,

291
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
all the places circled by purple

292
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,240
have been searched,

293
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,920
and none of them is true.

294
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,720
I should have known that Senior is unreliable.

295
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,640
I guess Master Bi Hong just believe the hearsay.

296
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,800
After all, in the past two thousand years,

297
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,040
no one has ever found the entrance of Devil Sect.

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,800
Who are you?

299
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,600
How stupid you are!

300
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,440
You're robbed.

301
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,040
How dare you!

302
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
Don't you know who we are?

303
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,400
Listen, I'm Yi Yaogua,

304
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
from Yuhua Sect.

305
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,240
-Yi Yaogua. -And this one is...

306
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,800
We are looking for you.

307
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,720
I've heard you are generous

308
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
and you are looking for the entrance of Devil Sect.

309
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,560
Hurry up.

310
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,880
I have a method to

311
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,160
find the entrance of Devil Sect.

312
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,120
Listen,

313
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,280
Devil Lord has gone to the Fairy-demon Town.

314
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,320
Do you have the guts to go to him and ask?

315
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,920
Please wait for me, Master.

316
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,680
How dare this group of villains look down on our Yuhua Sect.

317
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
I'll teach them a lesson.

318
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,120
Boss!

319
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,760
Good for you.

320
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,720
But no matter how good you are,

321
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,840
you are alone.

322
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,000
You're not our rival.

323
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,960
Master, well done.

324
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,680
You've got the second experience of the world,

325
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,760
escape if you can't beat others,

326
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,120
before I tell you.

327
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,360
Hit him!

328
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,240
Arrogant.

329
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,400
Can you be arrogant now?

330
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,920
Look, what is that?

331
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,560
What's that?

332
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,760
Louder applause.

333
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,080
It can be much louder.

334
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,200
Isn't the Fairy-demon Inn designated by

335
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,120
Immortals Alliance?

336
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,160
Why are the candidates?

337
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,440
I guess everyone knows that your Majesty is here,

338
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,840
so they returned home.

339
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,240
You're right.

340
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
If this is the truth,

341
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,640
the blessing from gods is too much.

342
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,640
Come on, take a look of the inside.

343
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,840
Okay.

344
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,800
Okay, come on.

345
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,160
Let's go.

346
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,560
Devil Sect hasn't shown in the selection for many years,

347
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,040
but we can still be placed in the center.

348
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,920
Yeah.

349
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,840
Erha

350
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,080
Good public relation. You'll get awards.

351
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,680
Don't flatter me.

352
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,000
What's public relation?

353
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,040
It means to be a big spender.

354
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,000
Why do you call me a pig?

355
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
I mean this.

356
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh, this.

357
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,400
Waiter

358
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,120
Waiter

359
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,840
Candidates from Devil Sect arrive.

360
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,160
A candidate from Yuhua Sect arrives.

361
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,000
Fantastic, this inn is fully automatic.

362
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,160
Well, we are all from Devil Sect.

363
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,880
Yeah.

364
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,680
Where is the apprentice of Yuhua Sect?

365
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,360
Where is he?

366
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,800
Are you the betrayal?

367
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,600
How dare I do that?

368
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
Though I want to be.

369
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,680
Not me nor you.

370
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,000
Who would he be?

371
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,560
How can you be an apprentice of Yuhua Sect?

372
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
You're my...

373
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,560
follower.

374
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,720
You can be an apprentice of Yuhua Sect,

375
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,840
but you must live with us.

376
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,720
Right.

377
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,760
Let's go.

378
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,800
Okay, go.

379
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,480
Here we are.

380
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,960
Devil Sect.

381
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,640
Wow, that's awesome.

382
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:00,880
Good.

383
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,560
What's wrong?

384
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,080
What happened?

385
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,760
All candidates must stay in their own rooms,

386
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,320
and those who break into the room of other sects

387
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,760
will be disqualified from this competition.

388
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,120
Who set this rule?

389
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,280
Erha

390
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,120
Break the ward.

391
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,840
Okay.

392
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,600
It doesn't work.

393
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,920
Vandals will be disqualified from this competition.

394
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,840
Who is it?

395
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,760
Come out!

396
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,920
Your Majesty, don't make your own future

397
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,360
ruined because of me.

398
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,880
Just a trifle.

399
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,920
It's not worthy.

400
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,880
Come in.

401
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm Shi Xia, an apprentice of Yuhua Sect.

402
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,560
I'll go back to my room.

403
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Your Majesty, calm down.

404
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,240
Don't make troubles, okay?

405
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,720
Vandals will be disqualified

406
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,280
from the competition.

407
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,920
We should make great achievements,

408
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,040
right?

409
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,880
Erha

410
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,640
I order you to find

411
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
the person who spoke before it's dark.

412
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
I must beat him up.

413
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,760
No need for your order.

414
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,120
I want to beat him up, too.

415
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,280
Have you ever thought of this, Hou Chi?
