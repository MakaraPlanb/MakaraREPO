My Dear Brothers
EP10

2
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,240
Hou Chi, surprise

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800
It seems no one lives here.

4
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,680
It seems Hou Chi is slower than me.

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
I arrived earlier.

6
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,240
Do you think it's appropriate for me to come to him?

7
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,800
It's troublesome enough to have one brother.

8
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
Now I have two.

9
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,440
And they're enemies.

10
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,520
Shi Xia is my sister!

11
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,760
She's my sister!

12
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,360
First come, first served!

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,680
There's no need to argue.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,480
So the negotiation is off the table.

15
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,240
No! No!

16
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,280
I won't let this happen!

17
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,760
Stop fighting!

18
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,280
If I interfere, it is nothing more than suicide!

19
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
What should I do?

20
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,840
No matter how,

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,920
I should find Hou Chi first.

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
When Shi Dong is not around, I'll explain it to him.

23
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,960
I don't belong to Devil Sect.

24
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,200
Then it works!

25
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
But what if he doesn't trust me?

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,240
He would hate me if I do that!

27
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,280
Nope.

28
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,800
Why should I care if he hates me or not?

29
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,920
Tell me, should I look for Hou Chi or not?

30
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,400
If you point towards the north,

31
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,200
I'll go out to look for Hou Chi right now.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,640
Good!

33
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
You're indeed pointing towards the north.

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
I accept your advice!

35
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Good news! Good news!

36
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,959
I've fished for the information.

37
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,479
There's no one reporting for duty in Yuhua Sect.

38
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,360
So she lives alone!

39
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,760
She lives alone!

40
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
Then I'm relieved.

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,360
Pass my order.

42
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,440
Ask guardians to guard the room of Yuhua Sect more strictly.

43
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,760
Did you hear him?

44
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Keep an eye on it!

45
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes!

46
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
If there's any man who tries to get in, beat him!

47
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,440
Beat him to death. Cripple him.

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Wait.

49
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,480
Do you want us to cripple him or beat him to death?

50
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Depending on my mood.

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,840
Hou Chi, right?

52
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,560
How dare you share one room with Shi Xia?

53
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,040
Devil Lord rescued her himself.

54
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,520
It seems that Shi Xia is not an ordinary person.

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,480
Shi Xia even has no Holy Root.

56
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,720
How come she is not ordinary?

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
I think there must be a misunderstanding.

58
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,880
A misunderstanding?

59
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,000
Can it explain why she broke into the ward of Mount Yuhua?

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,280
Can it explain why she approached Hou Chi on purpose?

61
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,160
Can it explain why Devil Lord rescued her himself?

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,960
What I worry most is that

63
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,960
Devil Lord did so to prevent Hou Chi from election.

64
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,520
For the Immortals Alliance election,

65
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,840
there must be a plan made by Devil Sect.

66
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,840
No need to talk.

67
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,800
I'll go downhill now.

68
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,440
I'll kill the devil girl to assist Hou Chi!

69
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,760
The fact hasn't been figured out yet.

70
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,000
Is Yuhua Sect killing the innocent?

71
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,640
Even though we cannot kill the innocent,

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,920
I won't allow Hou Chi to take the risk by himself.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm willing to follow him to the Fairy-demon Town.

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm also willing to go.

75
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,320
Me too.

76
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
He's willing to give up the exam

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
to protect Shi Xia from danger.

78
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
In the world, I'm afraid that only I'm able to

79
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
be a good friend with Shi Xia,

80
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
talk for both sides,

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
and mediate between them

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,280
at the same time.

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,920
You can go.

84
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,280
But don't expect that you can protect Shi Xia.

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
In your journey,

86
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,360
remember the purpose of going downhill.

87
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,160
Hou Chi

88
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
must be in the election.

89
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,240
Yes!

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,040
Yes!

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,640
It's high quality!

92
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,440
Miss, Miss. Come here.

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,080
Did you see a handsome Immortal with a poker face?

94
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,120
No.

95
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,320
Hello. Did you see a tall,

96
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,400
slim, and handsome Immortal with a poker face?

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,800
No. No.

98
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
Dolls! Adorable dolls!

99
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Handmade dolls!

100
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,320
Of high quality!

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,960
Sir. Would you like a doll?

102
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,560
I never expect dolls can be so pretty.

103
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,480
How's that, Sir?

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,320
You really have a good taste!

105
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,280
This one is the bestseller.

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,720
Buy one.

107
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,680
Did you see a

108
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
handsome Immortal with a poker face?

109
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,000
No.

110
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,240
Sir.

111
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,200
See you next time, Sir.

112
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,720
Dolls! Adorable dolls!

113
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,480
Miss, Miss.

114
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,160
Look at dolls and see if there's anything you like.

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,680
I don't buy dolls.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,960
Did you see a

117
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,200
handsome Immortal with a poker face?

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,480
He's about that height.

119
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,080
His eyes are just like these.

120
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Are you looking for that Immortal?

121
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,560
Miss!

122
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
Miss! Your Majesty is looking for you.

123
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,160
Where have you been early this morning?

124
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Your Majesty cannot find you!

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,160
Let me go!

126
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,840
No, I won't!

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,520
You're the only one whom Your Majesty likes.

128
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,800
Be good.

129
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,760
Go back.

130
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,440
Let me go.

131
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
I'll ask Your Majesty to order you to commit suicide!

132
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,800
No wonder you're chosen by Your Majesty.

133
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
You have the same temper as him does!

134
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,160
Devil Lord Qiu Ping versus Hou Chi from Yuhua Sect.

135
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,040
Do not miss out on this!

136
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,840
Bravo!

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Hou Chi. I've won already.

138
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,839
Just quit.

139
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,080
How come?

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
I, Hou Chi, as the best potential

141
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
successor of the leader of alliance in the celestial,

142
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,400
can never lose to you, who is

143
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
such a handsome, talented,

144
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,120
extraordinary, and well-known Devil Lord!

145
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,120
Sister

146
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,880
Sister

147
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,960
Sister

148
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,280
The Immortal Venerable. Look for others at other places.

149
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,680
Don't interrupt me to watch the show!

150
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,520
Are you watching the show?

151
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,000
Of course! Or are we watching you?

152
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
Go, go, go! Leave here!

153
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,600
My sister also likes to watch a show.

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,520
Where is my sister?

155
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,960
Where are you pointing at?

156
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,640
If you cannot find her, why would we use you?

157
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Sorry I didn't finish the task.

158
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
You... you just order me to commit suicide!

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
That's it. That's it!

160
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,960
Forget it. Forget it!

161
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
She has the same temper as me.

162
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,160
I didn't expect you to deal with it.

163
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,800
Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,440
Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

165
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Why... why don't you act according to the script?

166
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:20,600
Hou Chi! Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

167
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,560
The one who plays Hou Chi acts really well.

168
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,920
What crap are you talking about?

169
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,040
Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

170
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
Beat him, Hou Chi! Hou Chi!

171
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,960
What an idiot you are!

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,880
It's you!

173
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,320
It's you!

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,640
Who is he?

175
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,160
Oh lord! He is Hou Chi for real!

176
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,080
Tell me.

177
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Where is my sister?

178
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,400
How dare you ask me?

179
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,320
You caused my sister to be locked in the dark room.

180
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,640
How did you protect my sister?

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,120
The real Devil Lord

182
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,520
versus Hou Chi from Yuhua Sect!

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,920
It's coming!

184
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,320
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

185
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,880
Beat him!

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,240
Your Majesty

187
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,920
Good legs!

188
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,040
Give me a hand!

189
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,920
Beat him!

190
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,840
Get down!

191
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,080
Beat him! Beat him!

192
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,640
Hold on!

193
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,720
I'm not come here to fight you.

194
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,640
I come here to look for my sister.

195
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,560
Looking for your sister? Bah!

196
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,280
I must give you a warning today.

197
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Never meddle with others' belonging!

198
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
What did I meddle with?

199
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
You know what you have done!

200
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,000
Young man, you have no martial ethics.

201
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,800
You raid.

202
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,680
Come on.

203
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,160
Look how precisely I shoot!

204
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,680
Brother!

205
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,480
Who is she?

206
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,160
Sister

207
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,840
He knows her.

208
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,800
Why did they stop fighting?

209
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,280
What are they doing?

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,080
Thinking for a long time,

211
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,120
I still can't avoid the worst situation.

212
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,560
I hope the heaven

213
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,200
will bless me with wisdom and eloquence.

214
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,600
Didn't Devil Lord just say

215
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,360
never mess up with others' belonging?

216
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,680
Well,

217
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,840
Devil Lord is not vicious.

218
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,600
If he didn't bring me to the Fairy-demon Town,

219
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
I wouldn't find you.

220
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,360
You...

221
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,440
I know you must feel strange and wonder

222
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,920
why did Devil Lord rescue me

223
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,040
from Yuhua Sect?

224
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,840
I didn't expect it myself.

225
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,200
But I'm not a spy from Devil Sect.

226
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,200
I have nothing to do with Devil Sect.

227
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Do you believe me?

228
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Of course I believe what you said.

229
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,640
I started to doubt myself.

230
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,320
But don't you doubt me at all?

231
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,960
You're my sister.

232
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Wait me for a while.

233
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,920
The most difficult task for me

234
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,720
is finished in this way!

235
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,040
Pay attention to your standpoint!

236
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,200
I know.

237
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,880
Blood is thicker than water.

238
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,640
The Immortal Venerable acted so well!

239
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,680
This is your reward.

240
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,640
Follow me.

241
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,680
So rude!

242
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,480
The doll is handmade.

243
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,440
Have a look.

244
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Sir, I want this one.

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
I kept it for you.

246
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,360
I knew the Immortal Venerable would come and buy it.

247
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,240
Here you are.

248
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,640
The Immortal Venerable bought the doll

249
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,040
to send this lady as a gift.

250
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
The person that she was looking for is the Immortal Venerable.

251
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,640
What a coincidence!

252
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,640
Why did you take my doll?

253
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
It's just a doll.

254
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,560
So annoying!

255
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,160
Immortal coins.

256
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,480
Sir

257
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,320
I'll buy all the dolls you have.

258
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,080
For my...

259
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
For myself.

260
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,520
Devil Lord needs so many dolls.

261
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,040
Are you victimized by severe insomnia?

262
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
Has the ward of your bedroom been canceled?

263
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,760
Not yet.

264
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,680
It's said that the ward is set by Shang Feng.

265
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,160
Shang Feng has been cultivating for more than 2,000 years.

266
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
How can I cancel his ward?

267
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,040
Since you came here to take part in the exam,

268
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
you should adhere to the rules.

269
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Why do you make the owner in a pickle?

270
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,760
Stupid!

271
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
If I didn't make him in a pickle, you will share...

272
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,240
the same room with your sister.

273
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Sister and I

274
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,040
have been living together in Yuhua Sect.

275
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
Any problem?

276
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,960
No. No.

277
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,399
Usually, my brother practices mediation outside,

278
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,920
and I sleep in my room. Right?

279
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,080
Right.

280
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,440
My sister is sleepless and afraid of dark.

281
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,160
I tell stories for her every night

282
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,280
to comfort her to sleep and then I leave.

283
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,880
Waiter! Come out!

284
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,680
I'll meet your boss.

285
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,480
Do you think it's easy for you

286
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,800
to see Shen Guan?

287
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
Devil Lord. May I have a word with you?

288
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,200
Let's go.

289
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,200
Hou Chi is as dumb as a piece of wood.

290
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I share the same room with him.

291
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,480
It's you who takes the advantage.

292
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,720
What's your logic?

293
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,560
I...

294
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,080
Getting along with him in Yuhua Sect for such a long time,

295
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,840
I am also a spy around him.

296
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,640
I can help you to inquire information from him.

297
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,440
After all, blood is thicker than water.

298
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,640
Why do I think you are hoaxing me?

299
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,760
Why don't you believe your own sister?

300
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,720
Okay.

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not a big deal to deny our relationship.

302
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,720
Tell everyone that we're siblings.

303
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,840
To let the world know that you're not Devil Lord Qiu Ping.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,520
Erha

305
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,680
Send Devil Lord to the room.

306
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,560
Take him away!

307
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,920
You wanna repel?

308
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Hands...

309
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,600
Hands off me!

310
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,920
Or I'll order you to commit suicide!

311
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,600
If you miss the exam,

312
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,080
Immortal Aunt will also order us to commit suicide.

313
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,960
Let go of me! How dare you!

314
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,280
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on the room of Yuhua Sect?

315
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,280
Why does Hou Chi show himself in front of me

316
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
safe and sound?

317
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,800
I did intercept

318
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,760
an apprentice of Yuhua Sect,

319
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,120
and according to your order,

320
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,280
I crippled him.

321
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,480
Yes.

322
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,400
At first, one of his hands was crippled,

323
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,160
and then we broke one of his legs.

324
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,120
See?

325
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,800
Did I accidentally injure others?

326
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,160
I'll go to the Fairy-demon Inn.

327
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
No! No!

328
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,920
You should rest for over three months if your bones are broken.

329
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,840
You should at least rest for one month for your injured legs.

330
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Just live here as long as you can.

331
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,680
Junior Master is so young.

332
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,000
If you go outside alone,

333
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,760
what should you do if you're hoaxed by bad guys?

334
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,280
I've found Shi Xia.

335
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,320
Everything's okay. Don't worry.

336
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,040
Master Yuan Gui is ready to bring me downhill.

337
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,760
I'm afraid it's not good for Shi Xia. Deal with it soon.

338
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,760
How long will it take for Master to pack up?

339
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
It's been almost six hours!

340
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Bi Hong. Hurry up! We should go now.

341
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,640
Let's go.

342
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,720
Master

343
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,080
We went downhill to perform a task.

344
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,520
But you're dressed like this.

345
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,920
That's a little bit too ostentatious.

346
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,280
I don't think so.

347
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,880
Doesn't my outfit fit

348
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,320
the style of our Immortal, which is the first Sect of all?

349
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,440
Lin Kui

350
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
You're right. Let's go!

351
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,720
Master

352
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,400
Wait for me.

353
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,320
Hurry up!

354
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,960
Hurry up!

355
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,880
Okay.

356
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,200
Well, the room is a little bit tiny.

357
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,560
Is it?

358
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,880
It's the same size as my cottage.

359
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,200
You should look at the area for per person.

360
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,040
I live alone in your cottage.

361
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,760
But now we share one.

362
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,920
Look how tiny the room is.

363
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,480
When I yawn, I almost hit you.

364
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,880
Sister has never practiced Kung Fu.

365
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,640
You cannot hit me.

366
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,520
I...

367
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,800
I mean,

368
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,560
it's so inconvenient!

369
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,920
Please feel free to tell me why you feel inconvenient.

370
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
How dumb he is!

371
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,720
He knows nothing about the taboo between men and women.

372
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
Here you are.

373
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,280
My new doll.

374
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,680
I have always been wanting it.

375
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,760
What...

376
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,240
are you going to do?

377
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,000
This doll is ugly. Dump it.

378
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Why are you so cruel?

379
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,840
The doll is made by yourself.

380
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,280
It has been accompanied with me for so long.

381
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
It's not its fault to be ugly.

382
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,600
It's innocent!

383
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,040
You two

384
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,840
should get along well with each other.

385
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
You're right.

386
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
I should be responsible for it.

387
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,120
Calm down, Shi Xia.

388
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,640
We just share one room. No need to panic!

389
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,840
What are you doing?

390
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,200
The clothes are worn out.

391
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,840
Right.

392
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,200
You really had a fierce fight with Devil Lord today.

393
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,120
Nope.

394
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,120
Even though they share one room,

395
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,240
I won't allow Hou Chi to be so comfortable.

396
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,760
Hot-chilly pot.

397
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,280
Hot chilly crayfish.

398
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,120
Does it smell good?

399
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,960
Good. So good!

400
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,400
So good!

401
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:26,880
Sister

402
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,120
Why do you look so strange today?

403
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,800
Do I?

404
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,560
Maybe I'm like you,

405
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,440
who is used to staying uphill for so long.

406
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,280
I'm not used to seeing so many people after going downhill.

407
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,680
Sister is lack of experience in the society.

408
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,560
Experience in the society?

409
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,920
Then tell me about it.

410
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,360
Rule number one:

411
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,680
Ask less, observe more.

412
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,960
Rule number two:

413
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,920
A golden key can open any door.

414
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,640
Is it also realistic for the celestial?

415
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
Where did you learn all of these from?

416
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,800
I'm on the way looking for the entrance of Devil Sect.

417
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
Looking for the entrance of Devil Sect?

418
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,800
Didn't you come to the Fairy-demon Town to take the exam?

419
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,520
Why do you look for the entrance of Devil Sect?

420
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,200
I heard that Devil Lord took you way.

421
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,520
I wanted to rescue you.

422
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,920
It's a misunderstanding.

423
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,800
Devil Lord is also kind.

424
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
When he found that I missed you,

425
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,240
he brought me to the Fairy-demon Town.

426
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
You missed me?

427
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,680
What does miss mean?

428
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Missing...

429
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,960
Missing means when you're separated with someone,

430
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,960
you're always thinking about the one.

431
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,680
You will feel time passes so slowly,

432
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,080
and every day you wish to meet him soon.

433
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,600
Just like when I missed my brother before.

434
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,480
Sister

435
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,360
I miss you too.

436
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,800
It's midnight snack time.

437
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,080
Rabbit heads. Hot-spicy pot.

438
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,040
Hot and spicy crayfish.

439
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,080
Don't miss the delicacies!

440
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,560
What... what are you doing?

441
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,440
I thought you would like to eat some marshmallow.

442
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,520
I... I want to eat stinky tofu!

443
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,320
This one. This one.

444
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,040
Delicious!

445
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,480
Have more of it.

446
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,560
The hot-spicy pot is so good!

447
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,400
So yummy!

448
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,360
It's not spicy enough.

449
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,400
Remember to add more peppers in it.

450
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
It's so easy to get yeet hay if it's so spicy.

451
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,000
I asked the cook to add less peppers in it.

452
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
Or you would shout again if you get pimples tomorrow.

453
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,160
It's been a long time since last time I ate spicy food.

454
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,240
If you don't allow me to eat what I want,

455
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,120
I'll shout at you right now!

456
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,560
Sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.

457
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,640
This is my specialty.

458
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Stinky tofu.

459
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,960
It smells so stinky.

460
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,640
It must be poisonous.

461
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,760
I think you're the one who is poisonous.

462
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,920
You're poisonous!

463
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,200
It's called stinky tofu.

464
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,560
It smells stinky, but tastes good.

465
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,120
I'll taste it for you.

466
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
How's that?

467
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,760
The stinky tofu is amazing!

468
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
Erha. Good for you!

469
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Why... why are you in a daze?

470
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,680
Here. Have one.

471
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,040
Help yourself!

472
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,240
Here. Have one.

473
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,040
Help yourself!
