My Dear Brothers
EP04

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,840
Stop following me.

3
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,880
Go away.

4
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,280
Get lost.

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,360
Master Hou Chi

6
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,840
Master Hou Chi

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,960
Did you see anyone suspicious

8
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,000
fled this way?

9
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,280
No.

10
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
Don't you see I'm in the middle of practice?

11
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,760
Get out of here.

12
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,760
Master Hou Chi

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,079
I lost the doll's head by accident.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,120
I'll find it for you.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Never mind.

17
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,120
If you're caught leaving,

18
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
we'll be in trouble.

19
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,120
Big news.

20
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Master Hou Chi has walked out of the door.

21
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,640
Alright, take care of yourself.

22
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,640
I have never seen him before.

23
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,520
So is he the legendary Master Hou Chi?

24
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,720
So cool.

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,640
Why is he here?

26
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,040
I have no idea he's so popular.

27
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,200
Hou Chi, you had never walked out of the door

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
since you established the "elixir pill" at fifteen.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,960
Is there any special reason

30
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,960
for going out?

31
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,880
I...

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,960
I...

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Hemming and hawing.

34
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,079
Is there any personal thoughts

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
distracting you?

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,400
Be careful of being possessed by the devil.

37
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,640
It's the critical juncture for your practice.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Don't risk your efforts in the last two hundred years.

39
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
Go back now.

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,440
It's rare to see Master Hou Chi go downhill.

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,960
Must he leave so soon?

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
What a shame.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,079
If only Master Hou Chi could

44
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,440
take up teaching in the academy.

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,520
With his instructions,

46
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,440
we'll certainly improve soon.

47
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,560
Master

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,920
May I have a word?

49
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,800
It's him again.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,120
He's everywhere.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
Master

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,000
There's a saying in my hometown.

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
Among all the methods of learning,

54
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,120
the least efficient one is to learn by rote,

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,920
the better one is to learn by understanding,

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
and the best is to teach others.

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
In one test,

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
two groups of people were told to read the same article.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
One of them were asked to

60
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,159
tell it to others,

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
and this group had remembered

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,159
much more information than the other one.

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,680
This suggests that

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,000
if one has the intention to teach others

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
he would force himself to learn more and faster.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,520
Quite true.

67
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,240
I remembered to see this story

68
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,720
in an ancient book.

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,040
So may I suggest

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,680
Master Hou Chi to

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,080
give a few lectures in the academy?

72
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,120
It will do him good to run for the leader of the alliance.

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
What do you think?

74
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,480
It's worth trying.

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,200
Then let's start tomorrow.

76
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,800
Yes, Master.

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,080
Master Hou Chi is going to teach us.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,760
I'm on top of the world.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now I'm giving a deodorant feather

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,240
to each of you.

81
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,400
Make sure you have it with you.

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,040
Don't disturb Master Hou Chi

83
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
with your body smell.

84
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,240
Let's welcome Master Hou Chi.

85
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,200
It seems that he's not in meditation.

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,640
What is he doing, siting still?

87
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
Just do as you're told.

88
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,320
It'll be fine.

89
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you, Master.

90
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,760
A signature of mine is not enough.

91
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,120
Keep working.

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,440
I wish you can get the signatures

93
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,800
of Master Yuan Zhao and Yuan Gui.

94
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,120
Only in this way can you be in the safe side.

95
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,920
Since Master has recognized my potential

96
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,520
through this signature,

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
I will certainly work harder.

98
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,720
Great.

99
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,120
Your Master Hou Chi's class has begun.

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,840
Go to class now.

101
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,680
I still have one more question, Your Master.

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
What is it?

103
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,400
Do you know the enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

104
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,440
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

105
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
How dare you!

106
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,120
Who sent you here?

107
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,280
I know it by hearsay only.

108
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,040
I hope so.

109
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,720
But remember,

110
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,480
don't mention it again.

111
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
Or you'll be thrown out of here

112
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,760
in one month.

113
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Well, go ahead.

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,280
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space.

115
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,160
May...

116
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,520
May I come in?

117
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
Sorry,

118
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,680
I'm late.

119
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,880
The class is finally about to begin.

120
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,120
Shi Xia

121
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,400
The destroyer of

122
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,520
the class discipline.

123
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,560
He deserves to be punished!

124
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,280
You sit in the front.

125
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
Why ask him to sit in the front?

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Why him?

127
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,960
May I take my desk mate with me?

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,320
His feet were injured.

129
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,480
Is anyone willing to help him?

130
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,280
I just want Shi Xia to be with me.

131
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
An Introduction to the Regulations of the Sect

132
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,720
How brilliant he is.

133
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,240
Cultivate from correcting our mind.

134
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
Life Force Management

135
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,960
He's really brilliant.

136
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,880
The body is the capital of cultivation

137
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,480
Shi Xia

138
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,520
I'm here.

139
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
What do you want to learn in my class?

140
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Why him again?

141
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,680
I...

142
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,280
Don't mention the enchantment of breaking the virtual space ever again.

143
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,760
Or you'll be thrown out of here

144
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,200
in one month.

145
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
As a junior,

146
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,120
I can't think of anything for now.

147
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,040
Well, do you have any requirements?

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,440
Requirements?

149
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,480
I'd like to have a double-day vacation.

150
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
A couple cultivating?

151
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Seriously?

152
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,440
A couple cultivating?

153
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,880
A couple cultivating with whom?

154
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
Isn't it supposed to be all of us?

155
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,800
Is he out of his mind?

156
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,680
If I have to appoint someone,

157
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,360
I want to have it with Qing Feng.

158
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,920
And it's better to have it in the dorm.

159
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Shame on him.

160
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,240
No, no.

161
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,560
How do you know about it

162
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,480
at such a tender age?

163
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,040
It's a birthright.

164
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,640
Every student deserves that

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,400
no matter how young they are.

166
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,440
I've read the History of Immortals

167
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
It says that it was a common thing in the past.

168
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,400
It was in the age of chaos,

169
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,480
the primitive time.

170
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,120
Don't mention it again.

171
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
So shameless.

172
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,320
How did it

173
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,400
turn into this?

174
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,200
The little one.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,480
Boss, I think Master Hou Chi

176
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,920
has regarded Shi Xia

177
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
with special attention.

178
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,880
Don't start a rumor.

179
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Then why ask him to sit in the front?

180
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,240
He... he's short.

181
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,440
Short?

182
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,640
What about asking questions?

183
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,720
He's at the bottom of the class.

184
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,760
I'm warning you.

185
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,600
Master Hou Chi is pure and noble as the jade.

186
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,760
Don't bad mouth him.

187
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,560
I see.

188
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,080
It's all The Little One's fault.

189
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,120
Keep a close watch

190
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,920
on Shi Xia.

191
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,400
Okay.

192
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
Qing Feng, why didn't you wait for me?

193
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,640
Leave me alone.

194
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
What's wrong?

195
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,800
You're way out of the line in the class.

196
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,920
It was he who asked for my requirements.

197
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,800
And it was also he who got mad at me

198
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,640
for no reason.

199
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,720
Got mad at you?

200
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,800
You were lucky you didn't be kicked out.

201
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,680
Is that requirement too much?

202
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,680
A couple cultivating is...

203
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,320
What?

204
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,880
It was a misunderstanding.

205
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,280
A completely misunderstanding.

206
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,760
What I mean is a double-day vacation.

207
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,760
Now we have only one day off on the first and the fifteenth day of every lunar month.

208
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,120
I read from the History of Immortals that

209
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,800
there were two days off in the past.

210
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,400
I was trying

211
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
to get more resting time

212
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
for our classmates.

213
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,080
I see.

214
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,800
Is it too late to explain?

215
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,800
For now,

216
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm afraid all the people in Mount Yuhua

217
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,120
have known you are here for couple cultivating.

218
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,040
I'm screwed.

219
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,040
Senior, is there anything I can help?

220
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,880
I'm here to pass on a message from Master Hou Chi.

221
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,440
Disciple Shi Xia

222
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,520
Move immediately to the residence of Master Hou Chi behind the hill.

223
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,720
Without any delay.

224
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,840
Why?

225
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,960
Go ask him yourself.

226
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
What's wrong?

227
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm being forced.

228
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,360
Shi Xia

229
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,720
Move back here.

230
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,080
I won't.

231
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,040
Why not?

232
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,040
Tell me.

233
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,960
Does Qing Feng have something to do with the doll head's missing?

234
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,960
What if I say yes?

235
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Has he found your true identity?

236
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,160
Not yet.

237
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,400
I said I'd be careful.

238
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,520
Could you just let it go?

239
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,720
I also said I'd send you home.

240
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,120
Why don't you believe me?

241
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
It's conditional.

242
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,680
You need a girl to improve your force

243
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
and I'm just your tool.

244
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,680
What if the tool

245
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,920
gets broken one day?

246
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,760
Every word I said carries weight.

247
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,840
I promised to protect you,

248
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,040
I won't break it.

249
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,200
No one would always protect me.

250
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
Even my biological brother would leave me.

251
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,440
Equivalent exchange is the rule of the world.

252
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,640
I won't hand all my hope

253
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,520
to others.

254
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,080
What are you doing?

255
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't need this.

256
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,400
And I don't need an elder brother either.

257
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,200
Shi Xia

258
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,920
Shi Xia

259
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,119
Qing Feng, can I have one Black-Sun Elixir?

260
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,800
Fortunately it's dark outside.

261
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,800
No one noticed you.

262
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,520
What are we gonna do in the future?

263
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,600
We don't have enough Black-Sun Elixir, do we?

264
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,040
Last time we lost one bottle.

265
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,120
It'll run out soon

266
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,920
if we both take it.

267
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,880
How about this? I ask for a leave

268
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,840
to go downhill and get some.

269
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,760
I'm sorry to get you into this.

270
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,400
Stop saying that.

271
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
It was me to get you into troubles.

272
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,720
But it'll delay your study.

273
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,200
Is there any other way?

274
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,240
Any other way...

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,960
We can get all the herbs from Master Bihong.

276
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,160
But

277
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,240
I have never been familiar with him.

278
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,120
What's more, once he knows the prescription,

279
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,840
our true identities would be exposed.

280
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,840
I have an idea.

281
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,960
Add some irrelevant herbs into it

282
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,320
to obfuscate.

283
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm gonna go beg Senior Bihong for help.

284
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,360
This is it, I suppose.

285
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Senior Bihong

286
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,160
He seems to be at the critical juncture

287
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,600
of the cultivating.

288
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,880
I'd better come here later.

289
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,120
Oops.

290
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,760
Is he possessed by the devil

291
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,680
because of me?

292
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,360
Senior Bihong

293
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,320
Senior Bihong

294
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,120
Stay back.

295
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm fine.

296
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,040
Senior Bihong, what's wrong with you?

297
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,320
Inhale.

298
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,040
It's camellia. It can relieve the pain.

299
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,600
Senior Bihong, you're finally awake.

300
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,680
Junior Shi Xia

301
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,520
Thanks for staying with me for the whole night yesterday.

302
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,160
It was all my fault.

303
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,800
No.

304
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,120
It was me.

305
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
I wanted to try a new pill

306
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,520
and never expected to end like this.

307
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,520
Senior Bihong

308
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,320
You've been working on the pills every night, right?

309
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,960
You must have been

310
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,920
suffering from great pain

311
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,760
for the last 200 years.

312
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,440
Only in this way can you live 200 years with a mortal body.

313
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,040
Junior Shi Xia, you are too young

314
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,480
to experience the softness and

315
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,800
the fragrance of the beauty.

316
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,600
When you have it for the first time,

317
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,840
you'll know what I'm doing every night.

318
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,960
Stop lying to me.

319
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,240
I noticed your rough fingers,

320
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,920
which shows you work hard day and night.

321
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
And there are darker shadows under your eyes.

322
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,080
Others say you are idle in the daytime,

323
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,680
then you must work hard at night.

324
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,960
You know, in my hometown,

325
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
there are also kids just like you.

326
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,840
In the daytime, they sleep and play around,

327
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,440
and when they get home, they pull late nights.

328
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,800
All they want is to surprise everyone

329
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,320
when they got the first place.

330
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
Insecure as they are,

331
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,600
they just disguise themselves by idleness.

332
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,440
Seems like you won't lose if you never possess.

333
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
Won't lose if you never possess.

334
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,840
I can't believe the only one

335
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,560
who knows me

336
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,840
is this girl I just know for less than two days.

337
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,120
Senior Bihong

338
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,000
You've lived for 200 years with your own efforts.

339
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
You are the master of your destiny.

340
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,800
I am the master of my own destiny.

341
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Of course you are.

342
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,640
What if you speak out

343
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,560
my secret by accident?

344
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,080
Of course I won't.

345
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,280
I never gossip about others.

346
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,160
What about

347
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,320
using one of your secrets as an exchange?

348
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,200
I have no secrets.

349
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,320
Really?

350
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,080
So what's your relationship with Hou Chi?

351
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,520
It was just a tale of chance

352
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,080
that we had become real...

353
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,280
friends of different parents.

354
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,360
Well, I believe your word.

355
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,560
By the way,

356
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,240
Why did you come to me last night?

357
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,840
Oh right, this.

358
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,640
Could you make up the prescription for me?

359
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,120
Senior Bihong, I said there's no need.

360
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
I also said that

361
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,440
no matter what you need,

362
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
just come to me.

363
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,680
Well, I do need a favor.

364
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,280
Just say it.

365
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,120
Do you know the enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

366
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
Never heard of that before.

367
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,040
But from now on,

368
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,800
I can ask about it for you.

369
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,520
Thanks a lot.

370
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,360
It's conditional.

371
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,560
You need a younger sister to enhance your force.

372
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm nothing but a tool.

373
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,160
I don't need this.

374
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
And I don't need any elder brother.

375
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,040
Shi Xia

376
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,120
The instrument

377
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
takes your whole life to learn.

378
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,960
There must be a

379
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,320
solid foundation.

380
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,440
Hurry up everybody.

381
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,800
You got another fifteen minutes.

382
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,480
Master Hou Chi

383
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,640
I'm surprised to see you here.

384
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,120
Master Hou Chi

385
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,880
Hou Chi

386
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,520
Didn't you say you won't be here today?

387
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm not a good teacher.

388
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,320
So today I'm here to learn some experiences.

389
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,320
Master Hou Chi

390
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
Please allow me to show you

391
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,680
my instrument.

392
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,040
Wait a second.

393
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,720
I'd like to have a look at others'.

394
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,480
Take mine.

395
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,800
Mine.

396
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,320
Shi Xia

397
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,200
Here is my instrument.

398
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,280
What sort of instrument is that?

399
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,920
Could it even be called as instrument?

400
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,000
Even though you can't make it,

401
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,520
there's no need to trick us

402
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,320
with a bamboo stick.

403
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,760
Right.

404
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,760
Well, I'll show you

405
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,960
to blow your mind.

406
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,320
Show me.

407
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,160
I've never seen this ward.

408
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,680
It's hard to believe that it can create a ward.

409
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,520
Showy.

410
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,840
Awesome.

411
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,080
Qing Feng

412
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,120
A ward in this shape?

413
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,760
It must be a first-class instrument.

414
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,360
What's this with various colors?

415
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,720
What is this now?

416
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,960
It's a heart's shape.

417
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,360
In my hometown,

418
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,640
it means love.

419
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,920
It means being attached to each other.

420
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,200
A world in a bubble

421
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,280
and a life in a leaf.

422
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,720
What a fine talk.

423
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,080
A kid with no talent

424
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,400
can think of such a fantasy.

425
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,600
It's really hard to come by.

426
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,600
Right.

427
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,800
How did he make it?

428
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,800
So good.

429
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,040
Master Hou Chi

430
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,920
You haven't seen mine.

431
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,080
Shi Xia

432
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,240
Could I exchange my Damour Red Armillary Sash

433
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,000
with your instrument?

434
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,360
What about mine?

435
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Line up.

436
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,840
Let me pick first.

437
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,680
This looks great.

438
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,040
Qing Feng must like it.

439
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,160
Are you sure it's the enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

440
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
Boss, just wait.

441
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,560
The weed lines on the map

442
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,480
are supposed to be the brambles.

443
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,200
Behind the brambles, there would be a huge rock.

444
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,840
Knock three times on the rock, then you got the access to the forbidden area.

445
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,200
Boss, if you can get

446
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
the enchantment of breaking the virtual space,

447
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
you will not just rank second in the Yuhua Sect.

448
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,360
You're right. Let's go get it tomorrow night.

449
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,560
This should be the back mountain

450
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,920
mentioned by Yi Yaogua.

451
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,120
I remembered he said to go through brambles.

452
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,040
Where is it?

453
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,040
Behind the brambles, there would be a huge rock.

454
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,440
Knock three times on the rock, then you got the access to the forbidden area.

455
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,200
They had me fooled.

456
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,200
Is anybody there?

457
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,840
Somebody help.

458
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,480
My brother, where are you?

459
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,960
Why are you never around

460
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,760
when I need you?

461
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,880
Why did you hold that tree?

462
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,960
Because

463
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,360
trees only stick to one place

464
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,840
to rooting and sprouting.

465
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,760
They never leave,

466
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,600
and never move.

467
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,240
Never leave just as me?

468
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,120
I've been treating you so bad.

469
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,000
People would get away from me if he is treated this way.

470
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,440
Why did you come to me?

471
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,280
I promised to protect you and I won't break it.
