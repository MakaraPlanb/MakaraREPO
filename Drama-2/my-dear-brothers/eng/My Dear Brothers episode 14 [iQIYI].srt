My Dear Brothers
EP14

2
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,240
Devil Lord must still have poison inside his body.

3
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
It's a good time to revenge.

4
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,000
Qing Feng

5
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,240
What does this mean?

6
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,440
She knows what she did.

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,280
It's a mistake.

8
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,720
She must be here for me.

9
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
Qi Lingling

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
Qi Lingling

11
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
She is Shi Xia's friend.

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,280
Don't do that.

13
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,640
Let's go.

14
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,640
You are the killing machine's

15
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,600
sister.

16
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,120
Why did you save me?

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,160
No. I'm not.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
No. He's not.

19
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,400
He didn't kill anyone.

20
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,480
That Devil Lord who killed people is not him.

21
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,040
I can't explain this right now.

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,080
But whatever,

23
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,960
you are always my best friend.

24
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
The best friend in this world.

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,280
I know.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,440
You and he is different.

27
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,240
Even if you are the Devil Lord's sister,

28
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,840
you are still

29
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
my friend.

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,320
Thank you. Qing Feng.

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,840
I will let him make things up

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,720
and change his image.

33
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
But not everything can be restarted.

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,160
Restart?

35
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800
I mean,

36
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,079
if one day,

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,800
he really had done everything bad,

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
then our friendship

39
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,280
will be ended.

40
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't worry. It won't happen.

41
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,079
That will never happen.

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,520
Ok. I have to go back now.

43
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,480
Master Lord doesn't allow the apprentices
of Yuhua Sect to get close to Devil Sect.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,080
Qing Feng

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,440
Can you take words to Hou Chi for me?

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,800
Tell him the Devil Lord wants to meet him.

47
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,160
The time will be at noon at clinic.

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,880
At noon, clinic.

49
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,079
Ok. I remember.

50
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,840
Your Majesty

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,320
The cure has been sent to Lingxiu Sect.

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,440
The apprentices of Immortal Sect
are almost free from the poison.

53
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,120
Where is Shi Xia?

54
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,280
Why can't I see her after I'm awake?

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,960
Shi Xia dressed up and went to see Hou Chi.

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,200
She said she wanted to
turn hostility into friendship,

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,640
and stop your battle.

58
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
Did she really say that?

59
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,880
I dare not to lie.

60
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,480
Immortal Aunt was right.

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,200
If another chance given to Shi Xia,

62
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,400
she would choose Hou Chi.

63
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,760
Your Majesty, you lost.

64
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,600
Who said I lost?

65
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,800
I will never lose.

66
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,360
What is that umbrella?

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,240
It doesn't seem from the Devil Sect.

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,800
This is the umbrella from Yuhua Sect to send messages.

69
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,800
Send messages?

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
Can you use that?

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
I can give a shot.

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Hurry up.

73
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't waste such a good thing.

74
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,800
Sister

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,720
Why are you here?

76
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,840
Actually, it was me who asked you to come.

77
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
I have words with you.

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Are you here for the Devil Lord?

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
You afraid I will hurt him?

80
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,880
No.

81
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,200
Let's talk inside.

82
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,000
I have a secret to tell you.

83
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,640
A secret?

84
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,080
I keep hiding something from you.

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
But I didn't do that on purpose.

86
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,360
Actually, the Devil Lord is my brother.

87
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,360
Indeed.

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,360
So, you knew it?

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
But how?

90
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,360
After that day you went with him.

91
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,960
I knew I lost.

92
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,800
You recognized him as your brother.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
That means I'm not as good as him.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
But sister,

95
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,960
trust me.

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
I will be a good brother.

97
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
So can you come back

98
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,640
and be my sister again?

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,520
Do you think I left with the Devil Lord

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
because I recognized him as my brother?

101
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
You are half right.

102
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,400
But he is my biological brother.

103
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,000
Biological brother?

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you remember

105
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,640
I have a brother in my hometown?

106
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,200
He is the Devil Lord?

107
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,680
Yes.

108
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,360
He went missing a year ago.

109
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,159
I didn't expect that he was here

110
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,720
and became the Devil Lord.

111
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,120
I swear to God,

112
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,400
I knew the whole thing
after I was off the mountain.

113
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,240
No need to swear.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,880
I trust you.

115
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,360
That is to say,

116
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,320
the Devil Lord is not from here, either.

117
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,520
Or, in another word, he isn't from this time.

118
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,600
Right.

119
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,640
He is not real Devil Lord Qiu Ping.

120
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,040
He replaced him

121
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,280
after he came.

122
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,400
He is not a bad guy.

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,320
Then congratulations.

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,320
Finally, you find your brother.

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,440
Then,

126
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,280
I'll leave.

127
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,160
Wait. I'm here

128
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,960
to explain to you.

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
You've made it clear.

130
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,840
I understand.

131
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,039
I mean, I am the Devil Lord's
biological sister,

132
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
not his lover.

133
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Which means you don't love him.

134
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Of course not.

135
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,040
Who will love him?

136
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,840
Then you don't recognize him as your brother?

137
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,280
And I am still your brother?

138
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,120
I told you my secret just because

139
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
I don't want you to misunderstand that.

140
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,600
After all, tomorrow is the selection
of the head of the Alliance.

141
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,320
Do it well. Be the head of the Alliance.

142
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,360
Did you remember that I take you
to enjoy the moonlight?

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Yeah.

144
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
No matter when,

145
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,080
our agreement will not change.

146
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
You have to remember that.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,640
Ok.

148
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,960
Wait for me.

149
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,320
I have a surprise for you.

150
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,520
Devil Lord, I will kill you today.

151
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
Shi Xia

152
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,200
It was her who wanted to see Master Hou Chi.

153
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,320
Why are you again?

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,680
What a coincidence.

155
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,560
Stop tailing me.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,400
Get away.

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
How dare you be that rude?

158
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,920
Stop there!

159
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,560
Hi,

160
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm here to get the tree I ordered early this morning.

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,880
Why did you come so late?

162
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,640
Did you sell it to others?

163
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,360
No. No. No.

164
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,600
I saved it for you.

165
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,600
Here.

166
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
This tree is so special.

167
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,200
(Admit to Hou Chi that you are a spy)

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,680
(of the Devil Sect before midnight.)

169
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,600
(Have him drop the idea.)

170
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,600
(Otherwise, just take the Devil Lord's dead body.)

171
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,040
Shi... Where's the Devil Lord?

172
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
He went for you.

173
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
Why are you so late, Shi Xia?

174
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,680
Yeah.

175
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,800
The Bamboo Dragonfly dropped this off on the way.

176
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,640
What's that?

177
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,240
What is that, Qi Lingling?

178
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,160
Your Majesty is in danger.

179
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,440
What?

180
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,040
Oh my god.

181
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
Brother

182
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,880
Is it

183
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,720
kidnapping?

184
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,680
What should we do, Shi Xia?

185
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,640
Will he be safe back?

186
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,200
Immortal Aunt

187
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,000
Shi Xia

188
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,120
Calm down.

189
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,040
Think about it.

190
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,720
Is there any clue about the one

191
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,240
who kidnap Your Majesty?

192
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,680
Yuhua Sect

193
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,760
Yuhua Sect

194
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,880
That makes sense.

195
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,960
The one who want to cut off you

196
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,480
and Hou Chi

197
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,360
must be Yuhua Sect.

198
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
It must be because I went to see Hou Chi secretly,

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
they kidnapped the Devil Lord.

200
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,640
It's all my fault.

201
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,240
I'll figure something out.

202
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,080
Shi Xia

203
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,680
You are back.

204
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,280
You must wait for a long time.

205
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,880
Doesn't matter.

206
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,240
Where's the gift?

207
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,760
Gift?

208
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Look at me.

209
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,240
Sorry, I broke it.

210
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
I have to ask you something first.

211
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,920
Dose Master Yuan Gui really hate

212
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
the Devil Lord that much?

213
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,640
Master Yuan Gui's temper is bad, indeed.

214
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,480
Qiu Ping likes to annoy him.

215
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,320
They are real butt heads.

216
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,920
Just give me a second.

217
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,520
(If you dare to ask for Hou Chi's help,)

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,960
(I'll let Devil Lord die.)

219
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,440
(The umbrella.)

220
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,280
(I only see this instrument in Yuhua Sect.)

221
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,680
(It's the solid evidence.)

222
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,200
(It is done by Yuhua Sect.)

223
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,400
Sister

224
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,280
Chick, you alone?

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Brother

226
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,080
There is no condition for brother-sister relationship.

227
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,480
We're related by blood.

228
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
But I can't go with you.

229
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,120
I have to follow Hou Chi.

230
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
In your heart,

231
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,520
I am always a useless brother,

232
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,280
right?

233
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,680
What's on your mind?

234
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm thinking that

235
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,040
the backyard of the Great Hotel is really elegant.

236
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,680
That's worth that
I taught the owner my best dishes,

237
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,240
and asked him to borrow us this place.

238
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,480
Taste that.

239
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
The food you made must be nice.

240
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,640
Hou Chi, toast to you.

241
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,520
Hope you will rank the top tomorrow.

242
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,400
Are you drinking alcohol?

243
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,640
What's wrong?

244
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,720
You almost got into trouble last time you drank.

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,880
Xia, you can't drink this.

246
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,320
You don't understand.

247
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,800
Alcohol is the best thing in the world.

248
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,040
Leading Master said that

249
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,520
alcohol is forbidden.

250
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,360
Your master

251
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,520
Your master is the fakest person in the world.

252
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,000
Alcohol will lift the spirits,
smooth the sorrows

253
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,800
and screw the courage.

254
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,040
Do you still remember the story

255
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,200
about the Little Prince that I told you?

256
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,119
The one who lives alone

257
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,000
like me?

258
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,480
Did he find his rose in the end?

259
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,200
He met a drunkard later.

260
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,600
He asked the drunkard,

261
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,920
why you let yourself drunk every day?

262
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
The drunkard said that

263
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,720
he wanted to forget about those sad things.

264
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,800
Then the little prince continued,

265
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
what kind of thing made you sad?

266
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,920
The drunkard said, drunk every day.

267
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,960
Isn't it funny?

268
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,320
Not really.

269
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
But I want to taste.

270
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,360
You can't.

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,640
Why?

272
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,640
Because

273
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,360
it's only me who can put up the conditions.

274
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,440
You smiled.

275
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,000
Look.

276
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,480
The moonlight can really make people soft.

277
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,320
Moon,

278
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,760
can you never fall down?

279
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,760
The moon dims or shines.

280
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,840
Everything is rarely perfect.

281
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,200
Yes.

282
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,920
Men have sorrow and joy; they part or meet again.

283
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,880
Actually,

284
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,040
-I am...  -I'm so happy

285
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
you are by my side.

286
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,760
You can feel happy now?

287
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,440
It deserves to be celebrated.

288
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,560
I

289
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,640
I

290
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,640
I have to drink more.

291
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
What's this?

292
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,640
Bamboo dragonfly.

293
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
In our hometown,

294
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,760
if we have troubles,

295
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,480
we fly this.

296
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,800
It's like your trouble will also be taken away.

297
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,360
Shi Xia, I don't want you to be upset.

298
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,720
I want you to be happy.

299
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,200
The last time I flew one

300
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,800
was my parents had left me.

301
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,440
I hoped they would be back.

302
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,800
Even if they would give me a good beating
for being naughty.

303
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
But they would never know

304
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,680
whether I beat the test

305
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,200
or played truant.

306
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,160
Sister

307
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,080
Now you have me.

308
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
The weather is so dry,

309
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
take care not to catch the fire!

310
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,160
I

311
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,920
Why are you at a loss for words?

312
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,120
I lied to you.

313
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,240
Lied to me?

314
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,960
Yes.

315
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,360
I lied to you.

316
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,040
I retreated in order to advance.

317
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,200
Tricked you into recognizing I was your sister.

318
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,920
I had known that this

319
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,200
has no good to improve your practice.

320
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,560
That was a trap the Devil Lord set to you.

321
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,240
I don't care.

322
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,720
All I know is

323
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,280
I have recognized you as my sister.

324
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,280
But I'm the spy of the Devil Sect.

325
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
So what?

326
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,040
I mean,

327
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,120
everything I have done is all for

328
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,280
my biological brother, the Devil Lord.

329
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,680
I am here with you

330
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,200
is to let you break your rules

331
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
and drive a wedge
between you and your master.

332
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,400
This is all because I don't want you
to be the head of the Alliance.

333
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,000
But you just recognized me as your brother.

334
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,840
That was also a lie.

335
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,280
I only have one brother.

336
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,480
He is the Devil Lord.

337
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,040
Since you want to lie,

338
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,720
why don't you keep that lie?

339
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,200
Why do you tell me now?

340
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,400
Because I can't do that anymore.

341
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,800
You are so ridiculous.

342
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,360
How dare you trust me?

343
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,480
Your Master was right.

344
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,440
Women are bad omen.

345
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,400
I am the worst woman

346
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
in this world.

347
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Stop drinking.

348
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,200
You'll get drunk.

349
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,760
Since our relationship is fake,

350
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,880
don't bother to care about me.

351
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,280
As long as you say

352
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,240
you still want to be my sister,

353
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,400
then I will guard you

354
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,160
and protect you

355
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
as always.

356
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,000
No way.

357
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm from the Devil Sect.

358
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,640
We are enemies.

359
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,040
Do you really think I can do nothing to you?

360
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,520
Yes.

361
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
You, the Immortal Venerable.

362
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,440
How will you dispute this

363
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,080
to a girl without Holy Power like me?

364
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,920
And I have lied to you

365
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,200
for one more thing.

366
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,320
Cotton candy.

367
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,240
It can't be eaten casually.

368
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,360
You can only eat it with your lover.

369
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,360
So in the future,

370
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,920
be careful when you eat cotton candy.

371
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
The Immortal Venerable, Hou Chi

372
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,000
Wait.

373
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,720
One more question.

374
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,520
These days,

375
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,160
do you ever think of me as your brother

376
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,480
in your heart?

377
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,320
Never.

378
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,160
For you.

379
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,280
For me?

380
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,920
Is this the first time

381
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,440
you receive a present from others?

382
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,280
Does it look like the Holy Tree in your mind?

383
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,440
No matter when,

384
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,320
our arrangement won't change.

385
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,440
You must remember this.

386
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,800
Dad

387
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,560
Dad

388
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Sister

389
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,000
Mom

390
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,240
Mom

391
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,320
Sister, let's release the last bamboo dragonfly

392
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,640
for our parents.
