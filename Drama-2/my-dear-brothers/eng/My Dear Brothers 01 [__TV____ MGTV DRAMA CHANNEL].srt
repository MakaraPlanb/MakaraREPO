00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:38,019
My Dear Brothers
EP01

2
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,400
Devil Lord, it's over.

3
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,880
You can go.

4
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,040
Wait,

5
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,280
I didn't lose the fight.

6
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,160
It's not over yet.

7
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,760
I just went easy on you.

8
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,280
Otherwise,

9
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,720
you wouldn't have stood here talking.

10
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,880
Hou Chi

11
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
You cultivated essential nature
at the age of 12,

12
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,880
and established the "elixir pill"
at the age of 15.

13
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,240
You also awoke the "inner thunder"
one hundred years after that.

14
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,400
However,

15
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,680
do you know why

16
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,320
you still can't reach the peak yet?

17
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,680
My Master said that I don't have to.

18
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,280
My mission is to become
the leader of the Immortals Alliance,

19
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,560
and protect all kinds of creatures.

20
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Bah.

21
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
You even don't know
what the Heart of Guardian is.

22
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,520
How come for you to protect all kinds of creatures?

23
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,480
The Heart of Guardian

24
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,120
means the commitment to protect and guard.

25
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,640
Stop it.

26
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,400
Reciting makes no difference.

27
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
Tell me who you have protected if you are so good.

28
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
Tell me even one.

29
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,480
I would admit you won.

30
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,520
How about you?

31
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,880
Devil Lord, have you ever protected anyone?

32
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,160
Of course,

33
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,800
I have protected my sister.

34
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,840
Your sister?

35
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,000
My sister is the cutest

36
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,320
and kindest little girl in this world.

37
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,960
She has a round face,

38
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,120
which is soft and plump when I touch it.

39
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,760
Always follow my heart and never give up.

40
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,640
That's my motto.

41
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
Be diligent and work hard.

42
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
That's my guideline.

43
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,720
In the vast space and infinite time...

44
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,360
Study hard and work hard

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
for the development of the forestry

46
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
and the ecology of our country.

47
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,120
You're the next one.

48
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,440
Do your best.

49
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,440
If you wanna get the national scholarship,

50
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,720
just do it well.

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,800
Go for it.

52
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,520
Hello, I'm Shi Xia,

53
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,480
a sophomore majoring in forestry.

54
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,960
The theme of my speech is...

55
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Hello? Who is it?

56
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
You're Shi Xia, right?

57
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,520
I heard about your elder brother, Shi Dong.

58
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,280
Where is my brother?

59
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,840
You should go to Huan Xi internet bar now.

60
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,160
I will tell you after you give me money.

61
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
But I'm busy now.

62
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
I will go to find you after I finish this.

63
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,080
Is that okay?

64
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,680
I can only wait half an hour.
I won't be there after that.

65
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,760
Hello?

66
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,560
Hello?

67
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,280
-Hello?  -Thanks.

68
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,400
Good job.

69
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
Shi Xia, what are you doing here?

70
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
It's your turn. Hurry up.

71
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,080
Come on.

72
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,720
I can only wait half an hour.
I won't be there after that.

73
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,000
Shi Xia?

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
It's Lucian.

75
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,200
I can't use the Fast Pace.

76
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
Little girl, you're punctual.

77
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,360
Where is my brother?

78
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,880
Be patient.

79
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Come on.

80
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,520
Scan it.

81
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Why should I trust you?

82
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,840
Since Shi Dong has disappeared one year ago,

83
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,080
I have received 73 fraudulent phone calls.

84
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Your trick has no big difference from theirs.

85
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,400
Look at this bar.

86
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,400
Do you remember?

87
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,880
Shi Dong was a bar waiter here.

88
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
(He's right.)

89
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,640
(Two thousand yuan.)

90
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,040
(Just use the money to buy a glimmer of hope.)

91
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,880
Tell me.

92
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,240
Come on. Have a look.

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,160
The Ferris wheel.

94
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,639
The amusement park will be closed
at five in the afternoon.

95
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,480
Time is short.

96
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Shi Dong, you idiot.

97
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
You have disappeared for one year.

98
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Now you appear again,
but it costs my scholarship.

99
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,480
I must not spare you after you come back.

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Shi Dong

101
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,240
Shi Dong

102
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,960
Shi Dong

103
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,880
Shi Dong

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,840
Shi Dong

105
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,280
Shi Dong

106
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,560
Shi Dong

107
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,840
Shi Dong

108
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Shi Dong

109
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,560
Shi Dong

110
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,400
Shi...

111
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,640
My sister is the most important person in my life.

112
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I must protect her with my life.

113
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,080
You will never know the meaning of such protection.

114
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,240
Why should I know?

115
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,680
You don't know what protection means,

116
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,000
but talk about protecting all kinds of creatures all the time.

117
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,920
Hou Chi

118
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
No one is more hypocritical than you in this world.

119
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
You're a man of no feelings,

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
but of deceptive nature.

121
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,960
You're not qualified to be the leader of the Immortals Alliance.

122
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,400
You...

123
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,680
I will teach you a lesson today.

124
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
I can defeat you with no other help

125
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,720
but my heart of guardian to my sister.

126
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,400
The leader of the Immortals Alliance

127
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
should be me.

128
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,800
Sister? What does sister mean?

129
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,040
Devil Lord said without a sister,

130
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,160
I can't get the Heart of Guardian.

131
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,520
Sister, wake up.

132
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,440
Sister, sister, wake up.

133
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,840
Sister, wake up.

134
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,800
Who are you?

135
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Why are you here?

136
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,320
Yeah.

137
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,600
Why?

138
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,160
What is this place?

139
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,280
Why am I here?

140
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,840
You have trespassed on Yuhua Sect.

141
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,280
How dare you ask me?

142
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,360
(This man is so weird.)

143
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,600
(His words are strange too.)

144
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,160
(Is he filming?)

145
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,240
(There is no camera but only him alone.)

146
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,600
(Is he a fraud?)

147
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,480
(He is somehow handsome. It's a pity for him to be a fraud.)

148
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,160
Quirky expressions and uncertain intentions.

149
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,080
Tell me.

150
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Are you a spy of Devil Sect?

151
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Look at the prop,

152
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,680
and the clothes.

153
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,440
The fraud also does well in filming.

154
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,240
But a fraud must have flaws.

155
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,640
For example, your hair...

156
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,560
Master Chi

157
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,480
We heard strange noises.

158
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,600
Any intruders?

159
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,160
It's just a red-crowned crane.

160
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,560
Don't overreact.

161
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,320
Before Master Yuan Zhao went for training,
he had ordered us

162
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,720
to guard you well.

163
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,080
I don't need guards here.

164
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,200
Please leave me alone.

165
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,640
Yes.

166
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,600
You...

167
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Indeed, you're not a good person.

168
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,560
You...

169
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
This person has no Holy Power at all.

170
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,160
But why could she break the protection ward of Yuhua Sect?

171
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,280
Great.

172
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,439
It was just a nightmare.

173
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,360
Where am I again?

174
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,520
The amusement park will be closed in ten minutes.

175
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,960
It's not too late yet.

176
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,080
What's going on?

177
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,120
Is it that guy...

178
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,440
Kidnap?

179
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,800
My phone.

180
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,080
Where is my phone?

181
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm screwed.

182
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,120
Shi Xia, Shi Xia.

183
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,640
Calm down.

184
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,920
Why is there no response?

185
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,080
SOS?

186
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,760
Help?

187
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,360
Police?

188
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Let's see who will help you.

189
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,440
I'm doomed.

190
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,280
I'm still young.

191
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,880
Will I die here today?

192
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
It's 4:50.

193
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,280
It should be a long time,

194
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,440
but it is still 4:50.

195
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,680
I see.

196
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,360
It's a dream.

197
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,360
As a big movie fan,

198
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,760
I won't be trapped in this.

199
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,600
I have watched Inception three times.

200
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,080
It's okay. It's just a dream.

201
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,240
It doesn't hurt.

202
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,960
No, I don't believe that

203
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,320
I can't wake up.

204
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,360
(Delicate face and soft skin.)

205
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,760
(Long and beautiful hair.)

206
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,400
(According to the definition in books,
she should be)

207
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,880
a woman.

208
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
Hooligan, let go of me.

209
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
Can't you hear me?

210
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,760
I said let go of me.

211
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,720
Let go of me.

212
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Let go of me.

213
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,080
Let go of me.

214
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
According to the definition in books,

215
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
you're really a woman.

216
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,000
Brutal and impolite.

217
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,280
You should be a hellcat.

218
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,840
I...

219
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,000
You are a fraud with a wire.

220
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,080
What do you want from me here?

221
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,520
Incoherent

222
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
and nonsense.

223
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,000
What is the wire?

224
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,280
And why did you sneak into my yard?

225
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,640
You fraud, how dare you ask me?

226
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,680
No.

227
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,240
I shouldn't argue with a person in my dream.

228
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,920
I must be imposing.

229
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,800
You can't bully me in my dream.

230
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
My Master said the woman likes throwing things.

231
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,160
The woman is emotional,

232
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,480
and likes screaming.

233
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,080
They also like pulling men's hair.

234
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,840
It's right.

235
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
What a real dream.

236
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,560
Who are you?

237
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,400
What is this place?

238
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm Hou Chi, the disciple of Yuhua Sect.

239
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,560
This is the backyard of Yuhua Sect,

240
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,480
where I live and cultivate.

241
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,920
Spells, flying, sect, and cultivation.

242
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,680
It's not a dream.

243
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,120
If it's not a dream,

244
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,880
who helped me change the clothes?

245
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
No wonder it hurts to when I fell.

246
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,000
It's not a dream.

247
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,600
Woman

248
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,320
You have no Holy Power,

249
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,680
how did you
break the protection ward of Yuhua Sect?

250
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,680
(Yuhua Sect.)

251
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
(It sounds like a noble sect.)

252
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,360
(This man is also powerful,)

253
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,680
(and they called him Master.)

254
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,440
(But he doesn't)

255
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,040
(look so smart.)

256
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,720
If I tell you

257
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,800
how to break the ward,

258
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,800
you will let me go, right?

259
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,560
As long as you are not a spy of Devil Sect,

260
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
I won't imprison you.

261
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,480
Deal.

262
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,520
I will tell you.

263
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,720
I have no Holy Power,

264
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,040
but I have Holy Pills.

265
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,240
My Holy Pills are not the same
as the ordinary pills.

266
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,480
You can't swallow it.

267
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,840
You need to chew it thoroughly.

268
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,800
Only in this way can it work.

269
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,240
After it works,

270
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,240
you can break all kinds of wards.

271
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,040
Try it.

272
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,280
Do as I do.

273
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,600
Chew it.

274
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,840
Come on.

275
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,400
Come on. Have a seat.

276
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,920
After you take the pill,

277
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,240
you must close your eyes and meditate.

278
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,760
No matter what happens,

279
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,920
you can't stop.

280
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,200
What a liar.

281
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,880
It's not a elixir.

282
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,240
Master

283
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,960
I didn't mean to lie to you.

284
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
I also don't know how I came here.

285
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,280
I just dropped in a pool.

286
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,840
Then swoosh.

287
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,640
Here I am.

288
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,080
So,

289
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,480
you admit that you have broken the ward at the bottom of the pool?

290
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,200
That's right.

291
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
I came here through the bottom of the pool.

292
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Who sent you here?

293
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Nobody.

294
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,880
I came here alone.

295
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,040
That's impossible.

296
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,240
You have no Holy Power,

297
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,760
so you can't break the ward.

298
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,400
Why is it impossible?

299
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,040
According to the books,
women are good at telling lies.

300
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,800
You have committed a crime
of trespassing on Yuhua Sect.

301
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
You are a woman,
making the crime more serious.

302
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
Is this really a noble sect?

303
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,720
You can't get my point,

304
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,240
and even discriminate against my gender.

305
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,480
Don't try to sidetrack me.

306
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,520
Tell me. Who sent you here?

307
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,240
Why can't you understand?

308
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
I was about to give a speech

309
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,960
on the meeting of national scholarship.

310
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,440
Then I received a phone call

311
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,680
and someone said he knew where my elder brother was.

312
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,680
I am his sister.

313
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,400
I had to go there and have a look.

314
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,120
Wait.

315
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,080
What did you say?

316
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,840
What?

317
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,400
You said you're

318
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,320
a sister?

319
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,840
My sister

320
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,040
is the most important person for me all my life.

321
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,960
I must protect her with my life.

322
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,560
You will never know the meaning of such protection.

323
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,640
Are you really a sister?

324
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,080
Why should I lie to you?

325
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,560
My sister looks cute,

326
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,440
but you'd better never irritate her.

327
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,880
Do you want to be angry with me?

328
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,520
Please be angry with me.

329
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,680
It's the first time that I have ever been requested like this.

330
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,000
Do you think you're great?

331
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,240
It's me who comes to your world.

332
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,960
If you came to mine,

333
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,440
I would send you to the biology museum,

334
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
science museum, technology institution, and the zoo.

335
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,840
You will be studied by a lot of people.

336
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,200
They would preserve you in formalin.

337
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,520
Then you would live forever,

338
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
and never die...

339
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,440
My sister

340
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,000
She has a round face,

341
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,280
which is soft when I squeeze it.

342
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,280
Is there any discipline in your world?

343
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
My sister is a cute foodie.

344
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,960
Whenever she sees the food,

345
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,320
her eyes will become bright.

346
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,720
Do you want to eat something?

347
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,720
Since you have mentioned this matter,

348
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,600
I feel hungry now.

349
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,720
What do you want to eat?

350
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,040
I wanna eat

351
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
cheesecake, Bubble tea,

352
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,040
durian pizza, fried chicken,

353
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
chocolate, ice cream...

354
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,080
Forget it.

355
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,760
Everything is okay.

356
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:51,920
Senior

357
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Would you please send me some food?

358
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,840
What a handsome man!

359
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,760
When's my turn?

360
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,520
I can't wait.

361
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,400
Miss Wang has made progress in playing the Pipa.

362
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,760
Immortal Venerable Bihong,
you think she does well in playing the Pipa,

363
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,040
so you don't care about my cricket anymore.

364
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,840
I have fed it for three months.

365
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,400
Miss Lin is so famous in this town for

366
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,520
your ability to raise insects.

367
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,760
The Tiger General you have raised

368
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,800
sings brightly and loud.

369
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,520
It's the best cricket in this world.

370
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
Its voice matches well with the music from Miss Wang,

371
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,920
which is the most beautiful music in this world.

372
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,360
Thanks to you, who cured my hand,

373
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,080
so that I can raise a cricket like this.

374
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,080
If you like it,

375
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,640
I will keep all the greatest insects in my shop

376
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,680
for you.

377
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
The two of you have just recovered from the illness.

378
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,320
So you should not be resent or angry.

379
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,120
He's so gentle.

380
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,960
Yeah.

381
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
He's so considerate.

382
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:49,960
Senior

383
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,640
Could you please send me some food?

384
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,360
Dr. Yu

385
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,440
Could I cook in your kitchen?

386
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
Junior, you have kept dieting
since you were a child.

387
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,560
Now you even don't need to eat food.

388
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,280
What's wrong with you today?

389
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,720
A new cultivation method.

390
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,080
What?

391
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,960
I didn't speak to you.

392
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
(He didn't speak to me,)

393
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,440
(so he spoke to a ghost?)

394
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,440
Junior, who are you talking to?

395
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,680
I'm talking to myself.

396
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,080
No worries.

397
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,480
Junior, I'm coming back this afternoon.

398
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,800
Then I will go to see you.

399
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,160
Senior, please don't come to see me today.

400
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,480
I'm really busy.

401
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
(He's insane, or I am.)

402
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,280
(I'd better find a way to go home
as soon as possible.)

403
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
Is there really no way out?

404
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,680
Devil Lord said

405
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,920
a sister can help me get the Heart of Guardian.

406
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,960
But according to the doctrine,

407
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,720
women can't stay in Mount Yuhua.

408
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,840
A sister must be a woman,

409
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,600
so how can I solve this problem?

410
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,560
Immortal Venerable Bihong

411
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,160
Immortal Venerable Bihong

412
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,640
It is said that your Junior, Hou Chi,
was defeated by Devil Lord.

413
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,760
Is it true?

414
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,240
Really?

415
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,480
Junior

416
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,040
Hou Chi

417
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,360
Senior

418
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,520
What do you want?

419
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,320
I heard that

420
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,480
you were defeated by Devil Lord.

421
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,320
What a ridiculous rumor.

422
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,520
Senior

423
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,720
What's wrong?

424
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
I was defeated.

425
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,440
What?

426
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,760
You were really defeated by Devil Lord?

427
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,080
He must have defeated you with a sneak attack.

428
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,840
As far as I know,

429
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,760
no one can be more powerful than you.

430
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,600
That's true.

431
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,160
Devil Lord's moves were so weird.

432
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,120
He could even break the ward of Yuhua Sect,

433
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,880
and he used odd weapons.

434
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,280
He even told me something so absurd.

435
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,840
I was defeated.

436
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,960
But the Leading Master will finish his cultivation soon.

437
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
What if he knows...

438
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,960
I have started a new cultivation method.

439
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,240
Can you give me some medicines for colds?

440
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,280
Medicines for colds?

441
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,880
That's your new cultivation method?

442
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,720
That's it.

443
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,760
You have been so weird
in these two hundred years.

444
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,520
Thank you, Senior.

445
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,840
Senior

446
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,920
What's the matter?

447
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,600
Do you have a sister?

448
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,520
Girl?

449
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,080
I do.

450
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,760
You have a sister, too?

451
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,960
Too?

452
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,480
Of course.

453
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,760
Speaking of a girl,

454
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,800
as long as you are sincere,

455
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,520
you will certainly have one.

456
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,040
It seems that everyone has a sister.

457
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,120
It must be helpful for cultivation.

458
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,120
He looks so strange recently.

459
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,800
He must have a secret.

460
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,120
It's bitter.

461
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,240
It's not bitter.

462
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,960
It's bitter.

463
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,600
The useful medicine is always bitter.

464
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,600
Why am I still here?

465
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,720
Did you save me?

466
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,320
Never mind.

467
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,440
What happened yesterday made me realize that

468
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
you're a mortal,

469
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,320
a woman.

470
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
You need to eat when you're hungry,

471
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,080
and take medicine when you're ill.

472
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,960
Though you're a little troublesome,

473
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,480
I can endure it.

474
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,000
So?

475
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,240
So I allow you to stay with me.
