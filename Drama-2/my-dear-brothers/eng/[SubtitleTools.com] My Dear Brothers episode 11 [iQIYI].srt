My Dear Brothers
EP11

2
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
You haven't eaten for 200 years,

3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,840
and you ate stinky tofu for the first time.

4
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,240
Are you okay?

5
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,800
Hou Chi

6
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Hou Chi

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,320
It's spicy, right?

8
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Have some water.

9
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,920
He ate such spicy food,

10
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,240
and you give him hot water.

11
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,040
Doesn't it work?

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,960
Of course.

13
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Go get some ice. Hurry up.

14
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,840
Come on.

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,800
Okay.

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
Listen to me, you two.

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,960
It's okay to be in the same room.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
But there are some rules.

19
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,400
Firstly,

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
no sharing a bed.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,480
Secondly,

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
no physical contact.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,640
Thirdly,

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,040
sleeping with the window open.

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,720
Open the window?

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,920
Why?

27
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,040
I noticed that

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,640
the window of your room

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
is facing the window of my room.

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Keep the window open.

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,440
And if this guy is up to something,

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,760
you shout aloud and I'll hear you.

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
What?

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,160
Loser.

35
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,960
Do you want to fight again?

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
I think I need to say it again,

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
Shi Xia's brother is me.

38
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,680
How we get along

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,400
is none of your business.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,760
What can he do

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,160
since you've made such spicy food for him?

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,160
I should warn him,

43
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,880
what if he wants to...

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,400
what if he has unkind thoughts to you?

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,360
Bro

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,720
What are you looking at?

47
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,120
I'll look at it with you.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,080
Time flies.

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,480
What can we do?

50
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,120
I think Miss Shi Xia

51
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,240
is very nice.

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,480
What do you mean?

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,640
Do you think I have a crush on her?

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
There's no shame in that.

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,000
Even if Shi Xia is the disciple of Yuhua Sect,

56
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,680
but what does it matter?

57
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,480
We're from Devil Sect.

58
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
There's no need to follow the pedantic rules.

59
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,040
Me,

60
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,440
the great Devil Lord.

61
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,960
Yeah.

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,440
You are the Devil Lord.

63
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
Are you not worthy of a disciple
of Yuhua Sect?

64
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,800
No, No.

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,440
Now, it's Hou Chi and her.

66
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you forget?

67
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,240
You've already beaten Hou Chi.

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,320
Why are you worried about him?

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,160
If Hou Chi had any sense,

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,200
he wouldn't have stopped his sister
from dating you.

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
I can't explain it to you.

72
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,920
It doesn't matter if you can't explain.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,560
Our old rules.

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,640
Scrambling.

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,360
We Devil Sect have so many ways to do.

76
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,040
Even ten more girls,

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,560
let alone Shi Xia,

78
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,120
are a piece of cake.

79
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
Scrambling.

80
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
They are coming.

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
You are up?

82
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,120
You are up?

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
Did you have a sound sleep?

84
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,200
Did you?

85
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
What are you going to do now?

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
Yesterday I was rude.

87
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,400
I apologize to you both today.

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,200
Hosted by the Devil Sect,

89
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
we would like to invite you
to visit the Otherworld Town.

90
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,040
Food, drink and fun are all on us.

91
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,280
No need.

92
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,280
Listen, if you don't want to go,

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,200
it doesn't mean Miss Shi Xia doesn't want to.

94
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah.

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,320
Miss Shi Xia

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
I have been sniffing around.

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,560
There are so many delicious food

98
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
and fun things in the Otherworld Town.

99
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,560
Husppy

100
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,120
Do a good introduction.

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,760
Okay.

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
As is known to all,

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,440
the Otherworld Town has a history
of more than 2000 years.

104
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,480
But this year the Otherworld Town is particularly bustling.

105
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,120
Look.

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
And listen.

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,320
Shouting.

108
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Why?

109
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,720
Why?

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
Because of His Majesty.

111
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,840
For 2000 years, we Devil Sect never take

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,720
the test for the head of the Immortals Alliance.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
It's the first time ever.

114
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,760
The first time?

115
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,520
Here comes the Devil Lord.

116
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,480
He is gorgeous, elegant, rich...

117
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,120
Rich but young.

118
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,640
Rich but young.

119
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,360
Get to the point.

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,280
There is a restaurant named the Great Hotel.

121
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,000
They launched a blessing feast

122
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,840
specially for the test of the head of the Alliance.

123
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,680
Therefore,

124
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,040
I wonder if you would

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
do me the honor of tasting it?

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,480
There are 108 dishes,

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,440
bringing together the featured food of Immortals Alliance.

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
Hou Chi

129
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,640
You don't have to eat,

130
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,600
but you can't starve your sister.

131
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I don't want a blessing feast.

132
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
Now I get it.

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,080
Sister shows duplicity again.

134
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,640
Okay. Let's go to the Great Hotel.

135
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,240
-Let's go.  -Very good.

136
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,840
Come on.

137
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,440
One small step forward,

138
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,040
one giant leap in life.

139
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,840
Come on.

140
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,000
Let me lead the way.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,720
Come on.

142
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,600
Come on, sister.

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
It hurts so much.

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,200
Sister

145
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,880
Sister, don't cry.

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,800
Do not cry.

147
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm holding your hand.

148
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,120
You won't get lost.

149
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,360
Let's go.

150
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,360
No, what are you doing?

151
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
It's safer to hold sister's hand.

152
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,200
Wait a minute.

153
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,000
You two have such a touching relationship.

154
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,960
Count me in.

155
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,080
Come on, let's go our separate ways.

156
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,360
Welcome, Devil Lord.

157
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,920
I booked the whole place today.

158
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,440
Help yourself please.

159
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Just be my guest.

160
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,280
Come on, come on in, come on in, please.

161
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,440
Here we are.

162
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,320
Husppy

163
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm here.

164
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,160
Go ahead and make the arrangements.

165
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,040
No problem.

166
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,800
The Great Hotel is famous for its featured food.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,520
I heard the food here is very strange,

168
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,480
including man-eating plants that can swallow a sheep,

169
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,480
and flying thorn melons.

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
I want to check it out, too.

171
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,040
What is the purpose

172
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
of the Devil Lord's invitation today?

173
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
Well, you can tell.

174
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
An old saying goes,

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,880
It's often your opponents who know you best.

176
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,240
Tell you honestly,

177
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,000
I have one lifelong regret.

178
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,240
A year ago,

179
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,200
I lost my sister.

180
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,520
I looked around,

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,120
I've been all over the world,

182
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,640
but I still couldn't find my sister.

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Shi Xia

184
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,800
I mean Shi Xia and my sister look alike.

185
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,680
I almost thought she was my sister.

186
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,400
Do you understand?

187
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
No wonder you hit it off with Shi Xia.

188
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,680
(Of course.)

189
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
(Shi Xia has been my sister for 19 years.)

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,680
But Shi Xia is my sister.

191
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,400
You lost your sister

192
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,000
and you should focus on your sister, not mine.

193
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
(Shi Xia is clearly my sister.)

194
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,880
(You're the one who focused on my sister.)

195
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
You're right.

196
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Your sister's back.

197
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,000
My sister's gone.

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,560
You should know

199
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
what it's like to lose my sister,

200
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,720
right?

201
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,720
Even if it's only half a day away from my sister,

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,640
I'm tortured inside.

203
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,400
(Don't say that in front of her real brother.)

204
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,440
The Otherworld Town is my last hope.

205
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,600
If I can't

206
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
find my sister here,

207
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,960
I might as well give up.

208
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
You can't just give up.

209
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,680
If you want to find her,

210
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,960
I will do everything in my power to help you.

211
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,680
Thank you.

212
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,880
Sir

213
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,200
I need you to find me some girls later.

214
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,560
The best kind of girls.

215
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,720
What? Find some girls?

216
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Yeah.

217
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,160
We don't do that at the Great Hotel.

218
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,360
You're looking in the wrong place.

219
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,160
Get out.

220
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,360
You got me wrong.

221
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,680
I want to find a girl as a sister.

222
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,040
Understand?

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,680
Not really.

224
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Fine.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,360
I want you to know this for sure today.

226
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Do you understand?

227
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
Sure, sure.

228
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Hou Chi of Yuhua Sect is as good-looking as Pan An.

229
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,600
He is tall, gentle, and handsome.

230
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,240
Devil Lord Qiu Ping is as good-looking as
Song Yu.

231
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,760
He is young and rich.

232
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,240
This is good.

233
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,360
No.

234
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,920
This is good.

235
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,600
Everybody

236
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,800
Hou Chi of Yuhua Sect and Devil Lord Qiu Ping

237
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,120
are eating at our restaurant today.

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,080
Any girls who want to see them?

239
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,240
Here, here.

240
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,080
Once every ten immortal coins.

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,280
Only ten immortal coins.

242
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,680
Even 20 immortal coins are acceptable.

243
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,560
Aren't we here for a big meal?

244
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,040
What is this?

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,880
Contest for sister selecting.

246
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Contest for sister selecting?

247
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,160
It is.

248
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,320
What sister selecting?

249
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,160
For whom?

250
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,640
Come on, sit down, please.

251
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,520
It's about to start.

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,520
I'm helping you test your step-brother.

253
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,200
Don't worry. It's fine.

254
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
The first one.

255
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,160
The first one.

256
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,320
She is beautiful with fair skin and long legs.

257
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
Is she beautiful?

258
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
What do you think of her?

259
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,840
She is pretty,

260
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,960
and as elegant as hibiscus.

261
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
I think she is good.

262
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,520
Shi Xia, what do you think?

263
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,600
She is plain looking without charm.

264
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,280
Score.

265
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,880
You are out.

266
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,560
The second one.

267
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,280
The second one.

268
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,440
She looks like a flower.

269
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,280
Actually, she's got more on her mind
than you do.

270
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,880
She's both dignified and graceful,

271
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
like a bright peony.

272
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
I think she's good.

273
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,080
Peony?

274
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,640
You compare her to a peony

275
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,000
with a face like that?

276
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,360
Hou Chi

277
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,360
You don't have a good taste in selecting sister.

278
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,160
Score.

279
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
The third one.

280
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
The third, the third.

281
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,680
God.

282
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,880
Although the lady is not very beautiful,

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,480
she has a good figure.

284
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,600
All right, time's up.

285
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,400
You may be excused.

286
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,880
Gosh.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
I'll give you 20 more immortal coins.

288
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,840
I'll watch them a little longer.

289
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,520
Come on. Watch me. Come on.

290
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,360
You?

291
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,360
Go away.

292
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,800
Watch me.

293
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,840
Next...

294
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,080
My turn?

295
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
As for this girl,

296
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,240
do you also think she's good?

297
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,360
This girl has a round face

298
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,280
and big eyes.

299
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
I think she is worth considering.

300
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
So in your opinion

301
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
anyone with a round face and big eyes

302
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,040
can be your sister, right?

303
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,000
What's wrong with that?

304
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,840
Of course.

305
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,880
There were 153 girls today,

306
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
and you approved 153 times.

307
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,440
Did the Devil Lord think

308
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,000
that none of the 153 girls

309
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,600
could be a sister?

310
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Of course not.

311
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,160
Do you think it is a joke?

312
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,440
As long as it's a girl, you think she's good.

313
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,040
I gotta go.

314
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,600
It's not done yet.

315
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Distinguished guests, here's your food.

316
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,360
The dish is called Birds Pay Homage to the Phoenix.

317
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,479
It's is the specialty of our restaurant.

318
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,840
It looks like

319
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
superficially,

320
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
the phoenix accepts the worship of the birds.

321
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,920
But in fact,

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
the birds are for the phoenix's selection .

323
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,720
Cut it out.

324
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,440
Get rid of this dish. It's not good.

325
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah.

326
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,400
Wait a minute.

327
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,840
This is a good dish.

328
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,320
We just have to choose one out of a hundred.

329
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,240
Hou Chi, what do you think?

330
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,840
Exactly.

331
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,880
You.

332
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,840
Here comes the dish.

333
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,640
This dish is called Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl.

334
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,200
The pearl

335
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,120
is a dragon's favorite.

336
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,080
Two dragons like the pearl at the same time,

337
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,560
and fight for it.

338
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,200
It's a good dish.

339
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,320
The script is very realistic.

340
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,040
It shows the heart of the dragons.

341
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Fight for what?

342
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,880
Did the two dragons ask the opinion of the pearl?

343
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,200
Another dish.

344
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
This dish is called the Leaping Carp.

345
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Thousands of carp

346
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,800
tried to leap and survive.

347
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,120
But only one succeeded.

348
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,280
This dish is the grand finale dish

349
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,320
of the blessing feast,

350
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,520
which has a special meaning.

351
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,800
All right, you're hopeless.

352
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,040
There is only one who can leap over and survive,

353
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,520
and that must be me.

354
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,360
Enjoy your meal.

355
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,840
But don't give up.

356
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,880
Wait for another 200 years,

357
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,360
and I will not fight with you for the next head of the Alliance.

358
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,920
I have made an agreement with my sister

359
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
that I must be the head of the Alliance.

360
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,040
On the field, I never give in.

361
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,720
Give in?

362
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,440
I want you to be clear.

363
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,080
Did you give it to me last time?

364
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,800
I did it on my own merits,

365
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,320
the halo of the hero,

366
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
and the belief of the Chosen One.

367
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,480
It's different this time.

368
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,800
I have the Heart of Guardian.

369
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,880
Didn't you just get a sister?

370
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,720
Can you promise that your sister won't leave?

371
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,280
Come out with me.

372
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,440
She means you.

373
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,560
You.

374
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,760
I need to talk to you.

375
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,120
Go ahead.

376
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,720
What?

377
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,440
It's not your first day being my brother.

378
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,000
You've been so secretive all day.

379
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,720
What's wrong with you?

380
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
You've really wronged me this time.

381
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,680
Did I?

382
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,840
Have I ever wronged you?

383
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,160
You did it more than once.

384
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,880
Since my childhood,

385
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,640
you've driven away every male in my life.

386
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,040
I'm your real brother.

387
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
I have an obligation to protect my innocent sister.

388
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm not innocent.

389
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,440
I have acute eyesight.

390
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,640
I saw clearly.

391
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,640
It was safer to hold sister's hand.

392
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,000
I signed a brother-sister contract with Hou Chi.

393
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,840
You think I want to be

394
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,240
the sister of that idiot.

395
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,360
Good. You don't want to be his sister.

396
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,880
And you are not the must for your idiot step-brother, either.

397
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,640
What did you say?

398
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,760
You can't tell

399
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
after the whole day?

400
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,640
I can tell.

401
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,040
I can tell you are not with kindness.

402
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,840
You are really stupid.

403
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
It totally proved that

404
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,080
Hou Chi is a bad brother.

405
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,160
Anyone can be his sister.

406
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,880
Think back today's contest.

407
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,920
Hou Chi gave every girl a pass.

408
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,920
What does that mean?

409
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
It means that in his mind

410
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,480
any woman can be his sister.

411
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
He grew up in the Yuhua Sect.

412
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,080
He is very simple.

413
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
He probably didn't want to

414
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,080
hurt the self-esteem of girls.

415
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,640
Simple.

416
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,080
You really hit the nail on the head.

417
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,520
Hou Chi lives in the mountains all his life

418
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,440
and never sees the world.

419
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,440
He never meets other women

420
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
except you.

421
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Suddenly he has come into the real world,

422
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,240
and seen all kinds of

423
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,080
attractive girls.

424
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,760
He has plenty of choices.

425
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,760
Yeah.

426
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,880
He recognized a sister for practicing and being the head of the Alliance.

427
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
It's the same with anyone.

428
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,640
There is no condition

429
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,440
for an elder brother to be nice to his sister,

430
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,600
regardless of her figure or temper.

431
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,040
What we care about

432
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,120
is unbreakable blood ties.

433
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,920
Believe it or not,

434
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm more reliable than your step-brother.

435
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,240
You'll see.

436
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,120
Nature.

437
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,760
Master, take your time.

438
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,720
How beautiful.

439
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Hurry up.

440
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,120
I can't hold on.

441
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,880
Sit down and take a break.

442
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,960
Sit down and have a rest.

443
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,480
Are you stalling for time?

444
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm not.

445
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,520
If you don't believe me,

446
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
you can just go.

447
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,840
Anyway, if Hou Chi doesn't listen to you,

448
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,720
don't come to me.

449
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,800
The umbrella has gone for so long.

450
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,040
I don't know if Hou Chi is ready.

451
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,320
Master

452
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,720
You all sit down and rest for a while.

453
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,680
Have a rest.

454
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,120
It hurts.

455
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,920
It hurts.

456
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,960
It hurts.

457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,920
-Who are you?  -It hurts.

458
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,360
Qing Feng, pick that one for me.

459
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,040
Okay.

460
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,480
You...

461
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,920
You wanna die?

462
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,920
What are you doing?

463
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,840
My elder brother Zhen Shanhu...

464
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,360
What are you doing?

465
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,360
W... What are you doing?

466
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
What did you give me to eat?

467
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,680
What did you...

468
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Amazing.

469
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,720
It stops hurting.

470
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,440
What a skillful doctor.

471
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
A highly skilled doctor.

472
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,760
Guys

473
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,080
Throw a banquet in the base

474
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,800
to thank our skillful doctor

475
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,680
and his friends.

476
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,480
It's fine.

477
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,840
It's a piece of cake for me.

478
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,120
But Zhen Shanhu,

479
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,720
you and your brothers are supposed

480
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,040
to be bandits?

481
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,480
You...

482
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,280
What do you mean?

483
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,560
You should stay where bandits are supposed to be.

484
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,600
I...

485
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,600
Send them to court.

486
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,280
Don't you really want to take a detour and send them to court?

487
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,160
It is the duty of a fairy family to punish the evil and promote the good. Master.

488
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,600
I don't care.

489
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,840
I'll go first later.

490
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,120
Master Lord, please do not worry too much.

491
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,560
After all,

492
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,160
Yi Yaogua is always with him.

493
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Yaogua follows

494
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,960
the lead of him.

495
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,480
Nothing serious will happen.

496
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Sir, I'm sorry.

497
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,320
I just missed a dish.

498
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,440
This dish is called Hang by a Thread.

499
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,920
It is a collection of eggs laid by 21 kinds of birds

500
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,520
from the nearby Sacred Mountain.

501
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,160
Hang by A Thread.

502
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,720
I need to help Devil Lord choose his sister quickly,

503
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,040
before he sets his sights on Shi Xia again.

504
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,760
Let's start.

505
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,320
Sister was right.

506
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,480
This should be done quickly.

507
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,800
Yeah, we do it quickly.

508
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,080
Don't call me sister from now on.

509
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,720
It's fine.

510
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Just pick a sister.

511
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,720
Hang by a thread.

512
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,760
Sister seems to be angry again.

513
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,160
As a real brother, I can't recognize my sister aboveboard,

514
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,560
I won't let the step-brother off.

515
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,560
Husppy

516
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,600
Please welcome contestant No. 154.

517
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,640
This sister is a master.

518
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,960
Although the girl does not show her real face,

519
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
her dancing is better than anything.

520
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,960
She is as quiet as a shy flower,

521
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
as dynamic as the weak willow in the wind,

522
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,160
as beautiful as a peach in spring,

523
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,680
as clear as a chrysanthemum in autumn.

524
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,720
I think she's great.

525
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
Don't you just want a new sister?

526
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,240
Let me help you.

527
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,240
Brother.

528
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,960
Brother?!
