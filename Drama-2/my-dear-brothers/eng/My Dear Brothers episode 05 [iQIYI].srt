00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,880
My Dear Brothers
EP05

2
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,759
So I will be gentle.

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,039
Doesn't matter.

4
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
Why were you at the forbidden place at the foot of the mountain?

5
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,680
I wanted to go home.

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
You still want to find your brother.

7
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
However,

8
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,600
what's the relationship between
the forbidden place and going home?

9
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
I heard that I could learn the enchantment of breaking the virtual space there.

10
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,960
Nonsense.

11
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,000
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space

12
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,480
is the privilege of the leader of Immortals Alliance.

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,840
You never asked.

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Then I won't be able to go home forever.

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,400
Where exactly is your home?

17
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,640
My home is at a place very far away.

18
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
To be exact, it's not far.

19
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,800
It's another alternate universe.

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,520
Compared with your ancient times,

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,360
we call it modern times.

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,040
Ancient and modern.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,240
We don't have so many people seeking immortality.

24
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,680
And we don’t judge people by immortal perception.

25
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,800
The main difference between people

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,160
is intelligence,

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
And the fortune of their fathers.

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,560
They are all mortals.

29
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,560
Isn't life hard there?

30
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,920
It's not that boring.

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
You can learn to ride on clouds.

32
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,280
But we have airplanes.

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,040
You can transmit messages over thousands of miles.

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,360
But we invented phones.

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,600
You can learn to have a photographic memory.

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,200
But I have computers.

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,960
If so, I would like to see that.

38
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,160
Welcome. If you can come,

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,360
I would take you to taste assorted pea noodles, hot pot,

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
lama ravioli,

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
and my favorite, bubble tea.

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Almost forget, you don't eat.

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,480
Maybe I can try.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
I see.

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,240
We are not from the same world.

46
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
You are so smart.

47
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,279
So you have to break the virtual space

48
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,360
and go back to modern times.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,760
Then, you can find your brother.

50
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,160
Yes.

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,240
I didn't believe in parallel space.

52
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Until that day,

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,760
I came to your pond.

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,880
Fine.

55
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
When I become the leader,

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
I can send you back.

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,640
However,

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
I have to be your sister before I go back.

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,040
How do you know?

60
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,720
Stubborn.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
How can you firmly believe

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,640
that a sister can help you improve the ability?

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,360
An opponent said that.

64
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Was he trying to bluff you?

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,800
You don't have to worry about that.

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,880
I need a sister to help me practice
the Heart of Guardian.

67
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,880
Are you willing to do this?

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
(He can't lie.)

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,320
(He was just taken in by his opponent.)

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,320
(Since we have talked through this,)

71
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
(there's nothing bad about being his sister.)

72
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,480
Seeing your good will in inviting me

73
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,080
as your sister,

74
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,880
I accept it.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,840
So you agreed.

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,360
Yes, but on one condition.

77
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,040
My word is as good as my bond.

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
No need for written evidence.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm afraid I'd change my mind.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
What's more, I need to add some rules.

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
It's ok.

82
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,760
Just give me your hand.

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,640
Write in my hand.

84
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,000
I can seal it. Is that better?

85
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,000
So high class.

86
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,360
First one,

87
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
no inappropriate body contact.

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,240
What is inappropriate body contact?

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,920
Just like kisses and hugs.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,040
Can you show me?

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,080
Otherwise, It’s hard for me to follow.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
I'd rather not.

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,320
I will tell you if you break it.

94
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,960
Ok.

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,720
Then.

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,400
Rule No. 2,

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,280
don't ask me to call you brother.

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,360
Not for this one.

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
What's wrong with this?

100
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,320
We are already brother and sister.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,200
And I will respect and love you like that.

102
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,000
Why bother with a title?

103
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,320
If I agree with this,

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
you have to agree to one of my conditions.

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,880
You have to company me to
practice for an hour daily.

106
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,640
But I have to go to school.

107
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,520
Then once a week.

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,160
Fine.

109
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,880
I thought you never signed a contract.

110
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,680
Why are you bargaining?

111
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,000
I learnt from you.

112
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,920
Rule No. 3.

113
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,920
Except for me,

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,280
you can't make conditions.

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,720
If so, I'll seal it as brother and sister.

116
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,240
Bro, the seal

117
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
is so ugly.

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,920
This squiggly triangle

119
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,520
and this one.

120
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
What are these?

121
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,880
This is me.

122
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
This is you.

123
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
I'll behave myself like this contract symbol.

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,640
I'll protect you forever.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,040
I don't bear any similarity to your potato

126
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,520
Can you learn some basics of drawing?

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,800
Are you going to change your mind?

128
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
Just change a bit.

129
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
The contract can't be changed.

130
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
What are you doing in the morning?

131
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,840
Practice with me.

132
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm not awake.

133
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,520
Leave me alone.

134
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,280
According to the contract,
you should practice with me.

135
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Then I'll add one more rule.

136
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,880
You can't enter this room
without my permission.

137
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,400
Dear lord.

138
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,960
How could I sleep if some doesn't want you to?

139
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,800
Have you improved?

140
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,520
Not yet.

141
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
So how can I help you?

142
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,680
Be quiet.

143
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,560
Last question.

144
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,400
How long will you take to improve yourself?

145
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,000
No idea.

146
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,520
So how long can I go home?

147
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,040
Sister, what's wrong with you?

148
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,960
You just practice first.

149
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,960
I'll take a bath to wake myself up.

150
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,600
An empty basin.

151
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,200
Why am I here?

152
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,640
Not bad.

153
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,480
Finally, I can

154
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,760
take a warm bath comfortably.

155
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,760
It would be perfect with some rose petals

156
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,080
and an essential oil bath gel.

157
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,720
What's wrong?

158
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,720
Nothing.

159
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,040
It just reminds me that

160
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,160
when I was little,

161
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
my brother will put ducks in the bathtub

162
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,440
to let me take a bath.

163
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,800
How cute.

164
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,520
But I mean rubber ducks.

165
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,560
Not real ducks.

166
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,200
You don't like it?

167
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,120
Don't let it go.

168
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,120
Look how cute it is.

169
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,320
Keep it.

170
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,360
Whatever.

171
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,760
I'll do some business outside.

172
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,800
You two.

173
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,320
Do you realize your fault?

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,320
I really have no idea.

175
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,680
Please tell me directly.

176
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,520
Yes, we did nothing.

177
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,000
We were just chatting.

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,680
Rule No. 134.

179
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,400
The one who harm fellow disciples

180
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,800
shall be severely punished.

181
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,840
Rule No. 212.

182
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,400
No harmful lies.

183
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
The violators shall be severely punished.

184
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Rule No. 250.

185
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,040
Knowing and admitting a mistake
can be punished at discretion.

186
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,800
You heard him.

187
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,200
If you admit the mistakes,

188
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,960
you still have the chance for a light punishment.

189
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,000
It's our fault.

190
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Master Hou Chi, we admit.

191
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,320
I am wrong.

192
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,400
Junior, what punishment

193
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,400
will you give?

194
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,000
What about

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,680
following the old rules of Master Yuanye?

196
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,920
Hou chi

197
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,800
Master

198
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,960
The owner asks you to go over now.

199
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,600
The punishment can follow the old rules.

200
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,200
Old rules.

201
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,760
Boss, be careful.

202
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,520
Forget about

203
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,480
the places you can't reach.

204
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,440
Is this Boss Yi?

205
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,480
Look what he is doing now.

206
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,560
Don't only clean that place.

207
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,280
Here. Here.

208
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,320
Clean it up.

209
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,760
What are you doing?

210
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,680
Master Hou Chi forbids us
from using charms.

211
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,640
Secretly, we'll not be found out.

212
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Using enchantments without permission,
double punishment.

213
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,440
Shi Xia

214
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
Why do even the Master
and Junior give him protection?

215
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,120
Is the little master have something
to do with him?

216
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,000
What kind of symbol of Yuhua Sect?

217
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,280
Don't humiliate my idol.

218
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,800
He is the symbol of the Yuhua Sect.

219
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,920
It's all the Little One's fault.

220
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,800
Master

221
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,040
Your ability is the same as always.

222
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Not wasted.

223
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,200
I can rest now.

224
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,840
I won't get slack.

225
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,880
Teaching in the school for you

226
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,400
is to improve your ability.

227
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,080
It's for the greater good.

228
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
But if you are distracted by this,

229
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,120
it's not good for you.

230
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,440
Are you clear?

231
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,240
I know.

232
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,520
Don't forget.

233
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
The first test for the leader is getting closer.

234
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,080
Ugly doll, did you realize that Hou chi

235
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,960
was not in a good mood since he was back?

236
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,200
Probably because of the practice.

237
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,840
How can I help him?

238
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,440
Right.

239
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,319
That's what they do on TV.

240
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,880
What are you doing?

241
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm helping you practice.

242
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,200
Don't touch me again when I am practicing.

243
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,040
Remember it.

244
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,080
Sorry.

245
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,720
Then,

246
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,400
how can I help you?

247
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,680
You signed the contract with me

248
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
to improve your ability.

249
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,040
Then I can't do nothing, right?

250
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,400
Don't worry.

251
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,920
But you have to promise me

252
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
that you won't do that again.

253
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

254
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,480
Just like the Holy Tree.

255
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,600
Holy Tree?

256
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,320
That's it.

257
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,680
It's a dead tree.

258
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,680
Why did you call it the holy tree?

259
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,880
It is

260
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,560
because of me.

261
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
I started practicing under it when I was little.

262
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,440
It was sound

263
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,080
and lively.

264
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,360
I remember it would grow
seven-colour leaves,

265
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,840
Shining.

266
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,040
Using the spirit of this tree,

267
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
I was improving fast.

268
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
But with me growing stronger,

269
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,680
the tree slowly withered.

270
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,480
So,

271
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
the tree's spirit was transferred into you.

272
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,240
Master said that

273
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,600
the tree had an ancient holy root

274
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
that contained the nimbus of the universe.

275
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,440
It was the holy pulse of the Yuhua Sect.

276
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Maybe we share a similar fate.

277
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,640
That why Master picked me up at the root

278
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
of the mountain when I was abandoned.

279
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,720
This tree was the symbol of the Yuhua Sect.

280
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,360
Now, I can't improve my ability.

281
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,680
This tree

282
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,960
must be disappointed too.

283
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,440
You are so stubborn.

284
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,120
The tree won't be that weak.

285
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,520
I heard that in the tree's world,

286
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,440
each of them has their destiny.

287
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,320
They will guard one person.

288
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,640
Brother

289
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,120
Brother, where are you?

290
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,680
Brother, where are you?

291
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,680
Brother, where are you?

292
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,520
When you are at your worst,

293
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,240
your tree will show up

294
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
and guard you.

295
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,400
Little sister, wake up.

296
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,840
Why are you sleeping here?

297
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
Where are your parents?

298
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,640
Tell me.

299
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,400
I'll let them pick you home.

300
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,560
So,

301
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,000
trees are the toughest ones in the world.

302
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,520
It won't be dead so easily.

303
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,880
Hold it like me.

304
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
It will give you peace and patience.

305
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,360
It will guard you.

306
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,440
Come on.

307
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,200
Now I have a sister.

308
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,680
As long as you are with me,

309
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,640
I believe

310
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,760
my ability will break through eventually.

311
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,320
It seems that he really treats me as his sister.

312
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,640
If I leave in the future,

313
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,600
what will happen to him?

314
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
What am I thinking?

315
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,560
Just do it.

316
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,840
Just think of doing something good
for him before I leave.

317
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
He saved me.

318
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,080
I can't fail him.

319
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,280
When I leave, he will lose a sister.

320
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,920
But at least, he has a Holy Tree.

321
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,960
We owe each other nothing.

322
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Senior

323
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,480
Senior, are you there?

324
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Senior Bihong

325
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,720
Senior, are you there?

326
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,240
Junior

327
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,800
Why are you here?

328
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,280
Senior, did you grow all these

329
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
flowers and grasses by yourself?

330
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
Of course.

331
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,040
Come on, let me show you around.

332
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,680
Senior

333
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,160
You can keep yourself
in such a young situation

334
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,080
and keep all these so lively.

335
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,920
I am wondering you must
have some experience about growing trees.

336
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,720
Growing trees?

337
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,440
That depends on what kind of trees

338
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,360
you are asking.

339
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,200
Mount Yuhua has

340
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,360
pines, cypresses, poplars, willows,

341
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,280
lime trees, fir trees,

342
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,080
peach trees, pear trees

343
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,400
and

344
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,200
Holy Trees.

345
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,160
I won't hide.

346
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,760
I am asking about the Holy Trees.

347
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,040
So, do you know that

348
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,440
hundred years ago,

349
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,680
all the people in Yuhua Sect used

350
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,520
so many ways to save the holy tree.

351
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,560
But none of them worked.

352
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,920
I know.

353
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,440
So do you know that

354
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
The owner ordered that

355
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,640
anyone who touched the Holy Tree
would be abandoned by the Sect.

356
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Yes.

357
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,200
Since you knew it, how dare you?

358
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,400
I said in the hall that

359
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,680
I won't

360
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,360
follow my fate,

361
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,920
but to fight it.

362
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,000
Senior, just borrow me the tools,

363
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,480
and make plans for me.

364
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,440
I'll take all the responsibilities.

365
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,320
You are a... alone.

366
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,680
Can you do heavy works like these?

367
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,800
Of course.

368
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,800
I majored in forestry in my hometown.

369
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,920
There are still people learning this?

370
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,280
How about this?

371
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,280
If you can prove that you can save the Holy Tree,

372
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,240
by yourself,

373
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,000
I can lend my tools.

374
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,080
It's easy.

375
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,200
What are you looking for?

376
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,080
You will know it soon.

377
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,080
What are you doing?

378
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,600
Wait and see.

379
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,560
You can use enchantments?

380
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,920
No. No. No.

381
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,800
Hydrangeas change their colour
because of their PH.

382
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,280
I added lye to it.

383
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,160
The blue hydrangea turns pink.

384
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,320
I'm professional.

385
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,720
Do you believe me now?

386
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,080
Bravo.

387
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,440
I'll keep my word.

388
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,080
Take whatever you want.

389
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,000
Thanks.

390
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
As a reward,

391
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,120
you can take this pink hydrangea.

392
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,760
It's already mine.

393
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,720
It's different.

394
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,080
The flower meaning of blue hydrangea
is betrayal.

395
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,600
But pink is forever.

396
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,120
Do flowers have their meaning?

397
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
It's my first time to hear that.

398
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
Of course.

399
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,080
In my hometown,

400
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,960
each of the flowers has its own words.

401
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,400
Rose represents love.

402
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,040
Mimosa stands for inferiority.

403
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,520
Daisy means hope.

404
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,240
Setaria represents unrequited love.

405
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,680
Interesting.

406
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,440
Ok. Take the tools.

407
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,120
Ok.

408
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,440
Wait.

409
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,520
I have to remind you something.

410
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,400
Go ahead.

411
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,920
You have to avoid Hou Chi
when growing the Holy Tree.

412
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,320
Why?

413
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,960
Hou Chi has such marvelous ability.

414
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,440
When you are growing the Holy Tree,

415
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,760
if you use too much holy power,

416
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,160
you will be found about by owner.

417
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,000
I got it.

418
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,040
I'll take the tools.

419
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
I have to eat the Cotton Candy today.

420
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,680
Cotton Candy, remember?

421
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Wait.

422
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,360
Cotton Candy?

423
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,760
Can you say that again?

424
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
What does it look like?

425
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,400
Sweet, soft.

426
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,480
Something that melts in your mouth.

427
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,560
Hurry up.

428
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,920
Anyway,

429
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,000
if you can't find it before tonight,

430
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,680
don't come back.

431
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,120
Be careful.

432
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,320
Hold it tight, Senior.

433
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,840
Ok.

434
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,480
Senior, harder.

435
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,320
Go.

436
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,360
Go.

437
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,400
Boss.

438
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,360
Are you sure the Little One is inside?

439
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,960
Indeed.

440
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,120
I followed him yesterday.

441
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
He lives with the Junior Master.

442
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,840
I have to go up and see.

443
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,560
Come on.

444
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,720
Come here.

445
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,680
Shi Xia

446
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,440
Why tie so many straw ropes?

447
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,000
To keep the water in it.

448
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,320
Ok.

449
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,600
Ok.

450
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,360
Look how tired you are.

451
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,200
It seems that my Junior is back.

452
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,000
Hou Chi

453
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,480
Why are you back so early?

454
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,560
The cotton and candy you want.

455
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,960
Soft, and

456
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,840
sweet.
