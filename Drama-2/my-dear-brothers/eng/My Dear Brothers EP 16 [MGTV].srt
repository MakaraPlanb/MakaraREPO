1
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,920
Senior brother

2
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,440
Why are you here

3
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a good thing I caught up with you

4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,720
Going to the shrine is such a fun thing

5
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,280
Can you still not call a senior brother

6
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,200
Senior brother

7
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,840
You'd better go back the same way

8
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,320
In case something bad happens to you

9
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280
That's what I did

10
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
I won't feel at ease in this life and the next

11
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,320
You can still remember me in the next life

12
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,840
It's worth it

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,840
Senior brother

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,960
I know your name is Yi Yao. Take the test

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,760
Is also trying to help me

16
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,480
Or do you know me best

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,480
It seems that I didn't recognize you as a bosom friend for nothing

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
It's a brother who is beautiful and kind-hearted

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Otherwise, I won't become friends with Houchi

20
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
What a good friend

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,960
Senior brother

22
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Actually, I've been curious about one thing

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,280
You and Houchi are so different in character

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,560
How did you become friends

25
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,280
Remember that time

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I just learned that I have no spiritual roots

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,600
Bi Hong

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,000
You have no spiritual roots

29
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,520
You can't learn

30
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,880
Chi Er

31
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,440
Bi Hong, is this your instrument

32
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,960
Head Childe

33
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,240
What a big shelf

34
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,040
Don't be too cruel

35
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,160
Show me your instruments

36
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,400
We'll let you go

37
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Show and show

38
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
Bi Hong

39
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
Bi Hong, he really jumped

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,520
Bi Hong Bi Hong Bi Hong

41
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,760
Bi Hong

42
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,480
Go and tell the master quickly

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,080
Good

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Brother, brother, where are you

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Posterior cistern

46
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,680
Brother, brother, where are you

47
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm here

48
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,760
If you see the fairy umbrella hold your breath

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,280
Convey your heart to it

50
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,600
I-I can't

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Don't go

52
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,000
Back pool, I'm under the cliff of the back mountain

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,440
Back pool, I'm under the cliff of the back mountain

54
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,720
Back pool, I'm under the cliff of the back mountain

55
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
Brother, brother

56
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,640
Did you arraign me with a fairy umbrella

57
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,080
I can also control the fairy umbrella

58
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,880
It's really the back pool. He told me

59
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,680
There is a difference between having spiritual roots and not having spiritual roots

60
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
He also told me

61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,920
It seems that there is no spiritual root

62
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,320
It's not that bad

63
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,240
I can't think of this wood in the back pool

64
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,280
I was a warm man when I was a child

65
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,520
But

66
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,080
The fairy umbrella he gave me

67
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,960
I lost it a few days ago

68
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
It hasn't been found yet

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,920
Lost

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,600
Yeah, I lost it in Xianmo Town

71
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,040
How come you've seen it

72
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,400
No

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,800
I

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,560
Senior brother

75
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,440
Time and summer

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,760
Senior brother

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
Don't be afraid in summer

78
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
Stay where you are, brother. Come to see you

79
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,400
I can't find the entrance now

80
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
How did you take the way

81
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,960
How did you take the way

82
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
How did you take the way

83
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,120
Report to your Majesty

84
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,200
The dark forest seems to have an enchantment

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,520
Subordinates have not cracked

86
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,120
I'll go by myself

87
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,400
Brother

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,520
Dark forests are dangerous

89
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,920
You can't go alone

90
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,280
Brother

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,280
You wait for me

92
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
Your Majesty, pay attention to safety

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,040
Senior brother

94
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,920
Time and summer

95
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,960
Posterior cistern

96
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,680
Why are you here

97
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,840
When did you come

98
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,960
Are you awake from the wine

99
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,960
Sister, I'm fine

100
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,600
You still think of me as a sister

101
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,200
Of course

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,440
It was you from beginning to end

103
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Actually

104
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,000
I said that the other day for a reason. I

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,760
Sister

106
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,120
No need to explain

107
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
But my words hurt so much

108
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
You must have broken your heart

109
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
It doesn't hurt. I'm not sad

110
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,560
Really

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,520
That's good

112
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,680
Let's go and find the senior brother together

113
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Don't

114
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,960
Why

115
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,880
I just want to be with you

116
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,720
We have to find the brother quickly

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,920
Just walk out of the dark forest together

118
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,560
Why rush for a while

119
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,080
Why is there no hurry

120
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,840
We still have to talk to the Lord God

121
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,040
I'll give you the qualification for re-examination

122
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,760
You don't even know

123
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,440
Your master is going to eat me alive

124
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,560
Master is also good at exams

125
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
It's not as important as you

126
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,280
I just want to be with you

127
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,000
Every minute and every second

128
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,600
There is no outside interference

129
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,320
There is no dispute between immortals and demons

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
Just the two of us

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,800
It's a spirit tree

132
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
The spirit tree has come back to life again

133
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,880
Sister

134
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,760
I want to be with you

135
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,360
Be with you forever

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,760
But we shouldn't do this

137
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
Why shouldn't things in the world be

138
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,640
Come with me in summer

139
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,640
What about the leader exam

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
Do not participate

141
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,680
What about the brother-sister contract

142
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
It was agreed that you would take the leader exam

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,520
And take me home

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,080
Cancellation of contract

145
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,720
Don't leave me

146
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Time and summer

147
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
You're not the back pool

148
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,880
Houchi can't ignore the brother-sister contract

149
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,960
No desire, no error

150
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
If there is nothing wrong, there is no intention

151
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,400
I see

152
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,160
The dark forest stirs up people's delusions

153
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
You can't get out of the dark forest if you can't get out of your delusions

154
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,720
Senior brother

155
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,880
Senior brother

156
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,480
Senior brother

157
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,440
You wake up

158
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,560
You don't care what you see

159
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
That's all your delusion

160
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,560
We're in a dark forest

161
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,840
Brother, let's go over there and have a look

162
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,840
Good or not

163
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,960
Good

164
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,840
Brother, we will live here

165
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't care about other people's fingers anymore

166
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,720
Isn't it good

167
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,800
Brother, you are going to fall off the cliff

168
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,480
Senior brother

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,360
You wake up

170
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
You're about to fall off a cliff

171
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,840
Man lives all his life

172
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,280
Why pursue those things that you can't ask for

173
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,280
Isn't it enough to have me by your side

174
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,760
Go

175
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,640
Brother, brother

176
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,320
Seek such happiness

177
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,160
I am willing to die

178
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,360
Senior brother

179
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,240
I'm tired

180
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
I know I have no spiritual roots

181
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,200
But I never gave up

182
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
My father has been pushing me for 200 years

183
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,720
Let me be a mortal

184
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,400
Go to the days of ordinary people

185
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,960
But I just stubborn don't want to give up cultivation

186
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,120
But I just found out today

187
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,960
You can only be happy if you accept your fate

188
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,320
Senior brother

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,920
Do you remember

190
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,240
My life is up to me, not up to heaven

191
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,680
My life is up to me, not up to heaven

192
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,800
Yeah

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,560
We are going to see the Lord God now

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,840
I don't just have to ask Houchi for a make-up exam qualification

195
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,520
I also want to ask for one for brother

196
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,480
No

197
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
I don't have a spiritual root

198
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,000
So what

199
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,840
Dreams are still necessary

200
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,920
Senior brother

201
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,720
Summer I

202
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,640
What happened to me just now

203
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
You just lost your mind

204
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,640
I know now

205
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,000
The horrors of the dark forest

206
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,680
It will trap people in their own delusions

207
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,040
The so-called mind magic is hard to get rid of

208
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,160
People will be tortured to death like this

209
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,720
Delusion

210
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,520
My delusions

211
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,480
Time and summer

212
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,800
Time and summer

213
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,840
Time and summer

214
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Time and summer

215
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,560
Chi, how are you feeling now

216
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,680
What's wrong with me

217
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,520
You passed out on the first floor

218
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,760
All Dharma Immortals can't wake you up

219
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,440
What the hell happened to you

220
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,360
Wan Xian Meng exam

221
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,760
Stop

222
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,000
You have missed the leader's choice

223
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,080
Two hundred years of cultivation were all in vain

224
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,880
Disciples are guilty of their teachers

225
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
Ask Master to punish

226
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,360
This is the end of the matter

227
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,080
It is useless to say more for teachers

228
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,920
Let's take a long-term view of everything

229
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,960
You can't watch me

230
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,720
How come it's three people

231
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,680
I don't know who is the God official

232
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,920
I don't think any of these three are alike

233
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,840
Lord God should not be

234
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,600
The immortal leader of the seventies and eighties

235
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,560
How can you be so young

236
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,600
Go

237
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,840
I'll type this

238
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,600
I won

239
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,720
You win again, you cheat

240
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,600
Forget it, forget it

241
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,720
Willing to admit defeat

242
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,520
The outcome has been divided

243
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,840
It's up to me today

244
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,520
Turns out the three of them

245
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,880
They are all the doppelganger's adult

246
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,800
You guys come up

247
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,120
See Lord God

248
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,480
You came to see me for the sake of the leader

249
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,280
Yes

250
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,880
We want to be Yuhua Houchi

251
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,960
Seek a make-up exam qualification

252
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,280
Lord God

253
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,280
Disciple Yuhua Bi Hong

254
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,920
Please give Houchi a chance to make up the exam

255
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,640
Time and summer

256
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,920
I heard that the magic statue also lost the exam qualification

257
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,360
Yes

258
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,400
All right

259
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,360
We promise to make up the qualification of magic statue

260
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,480
What about the back pool

261
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
He can run for the next leader

262
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
If there is another one

263
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,360
It is unfair

264
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,600
Time and summer

265
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,480
What is fair or not

266
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
Make-up qualification

267
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Who do we like

268
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,240
Give it to whom

269
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,520
Time and summer

270
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,320
Can you be so willful when you are a God official

271
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,320
Of course

272
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,520
This is the power of the divine officer

273
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,600
But if you have so much power,

274
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,320
Why don't you just give the magic statue and the back pool

275
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
One person, one make-up exam qualification is good

276
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,800
Posterior cistern posterior cistern

277
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
You're not tired of talking, and we're tired of listening

278
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,800
How about this

279
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,160
You go and help us send the order first

280
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,120
I want to summon the magic statue

281
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,520
Tell you

282
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,240
Lord God has never been out of the shrine

283
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,640
You want to summon the magic statue

284
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,320
Then go and see yourself

285
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,840
Why bother others

286
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
If it is inconvenient for God's Lord to get out of the palace,

287
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,960
I am willing to do it for you

288
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,880
But in our hometown

289
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
It takes some errands to ask for help

290
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,920
You know what I mean

291
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,800
Dare to talk about conditions when you see our seat

292
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,640
Little girl has a lot of courage

293
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,320
Time and summer

294
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,400
Lord God

295
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,880
Hour

296
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,280
I guess for thousands of years

297
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
No one has ever entered the Palace of Innocence

298
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,040
Lord God can't get out at all

299
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,920
Right

300
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,440
My sister can only play by herself even pushing Pai Jiu

301
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,120
It must be lonely

302
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,760
I underestimated you

303
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
Don't you just want to help Houchi

304
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,120
Strive for the make-up exam qualification

305
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,680
If we promise you, it will be

306
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,120
The sister

307
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,320
I want to ask for one for brother Bi Hong, too

308
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,320
Time and summer

309
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,320
Greed

310
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,560
I finally met my fairy sister once

311
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,520
I may have made a little more wishes

312
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,280
I'm sorry

313
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,920
Good

314
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,840
We promise you

315
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,160
Thank you, Lord God

316
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,240
Brother

317
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,320
Do you have to go in alone

318
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,200
Qiu Li will go with you

319
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,320
Lacquer Ling Ling

320
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,120
In

321
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,320
Keep an eye on the holy aunt

322
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,040
Erha

323
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,280
Let's go find Shi Xia

324
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,760
Good

325
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,400
Go

326
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,520
Brother

327
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,640
It's really you

328
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,560
Isn't that true

329
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,040
This

330
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,240
Are you all right

331
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,400
It's okay

332
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,840
Sister Shixia, you're not hurt, are you

333
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,720
Am I not good here

334
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,280
They say to go to the dark forest

335
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,680
You will lose one important thing

336
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,320
Brother Bi Hong and I have lost nothing

337
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,120
You see

338
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,720
What did I say

339
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,280
It's still my big man's halo

340
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Big male master

341
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,160
You have another aura

342
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
Lord God wants to see you by name

343
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,960
I

344
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,200
Really

345
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,720
You wanted to see me

346
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,960
You

347
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Is the magic statue

348
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,720
I never expected it

349
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,960
The big male script also has benefits in this direction

350
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,120
Lord God, you have something to say

351
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,120
You can't take advantage of your status as a divine officer

352
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,040
Those who use their hands and feet on candidates

353
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,200
Shut up

354
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,760
Continue

355
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,200
You didn't

356
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,680
I do

357
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,000
Have everything you should have

358
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,600
You have no spiritual roots

359
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,440
Spiritual root

360
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,480
That doesn't

361
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,000
You summoned me for Linggen

362
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,200
Spirit should be passed down by blood

363
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Why does the magic statue have no spiritual root

364
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,120
The holy garment still has induction

365
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,480
Five senior brothers' blood is not broken

366
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,520
The real magic statue should still hide in the magic school

367
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Lord God

368
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,320
You can't keep your word

369
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,040
Right

370
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,480
What did she say

371
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,200
Go ahead

372
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,520
Pass the word of this seat

373
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
Two thousand years ago

374
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,120
The fairy magic array has been laid out

375
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,440
Tomorrow, six of our brothers and sisters will launch an array together

376
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,240
You can stabilize the world and do it firmly

377
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,120
In this world, the stars and the moon will never be reversed again

378
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,280
Vanity disorder

379
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,960
Shi Ji

380
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,760
Tomorrow, after the brothers join the battle,

381
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
You have to guard the battle for three days and three nights

382
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
Never leave

383
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,920
Yes

384
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,920
I will definitely wait until the brothers come back

385
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,000
To be a brother means to say

386
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,160
Whether we come out or not

387
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,360
You must keep a good array of immortals and demons

388
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,160
It's not good

389
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,480
Five senior brothers left a letter and went down the mountain

390
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,360
The fifth teacher brother ran away

391
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,520
Master Brother, what should I do

392
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm going down the mountain now

393
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,360
Go and get Qiu Baiyan back

394
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,320
It's too late

395
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,480
I really ran out of money for the deployment

396
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,400
There are only three days left

397
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,280
Master Elder Martial Brother

398
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,480
The hour has come

399
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,920
Enter the array

400
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,920
Five senior brothers

401
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,760
Your magic pie finally showed up

402
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,360
This time

403
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,000
I will definitely find the spiritual root of heaven

404
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,280
Completely stabilize the fairy magic array

405
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,960
Two thousand years

406
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,600
I have been guarding the fairy magic array for two thousand years

407
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,400
This day is finally coming
