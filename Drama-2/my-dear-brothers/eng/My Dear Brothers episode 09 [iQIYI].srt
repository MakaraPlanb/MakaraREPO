My Dear Brothers
EP09

2
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,960
Seriously?

3
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,960
It's quite dark.

4
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,240
Why do you bring me here?

5
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,320
To get home quickly.

6
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,800
So you come the farthest way round?

7
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,640
It's so weird.

8
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,320
Ouch, I've got a tummy ache.

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,400
Just wait for me here.

10
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,280
Again?

11
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,080
Three minutes.

12
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,880
Hey, you liar.

13
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,560
Why do you leave me...

14
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,200
Shi Dong

15
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
Shi Dong

16
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,840
Shi Dong

17
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,800
Shi Dong

18
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,720
Shi Xia

19
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
Shi Dong

20
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,840
Where are you?

21
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Shi Dong

22
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,560
Sorry,

23
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
I couldn't be with you on your birthday.

24
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,560
That's okay.

25
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm used to the fact that

26
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
you are unreliable.

27
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,720
So, Shi Dong didn't leave me on purpose.

28
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
He's also here.

29
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,280
Your Majesty

30
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,760
Here to visit your Majesty.

31
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,440
Your Majesty?

32
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,520
How dare you!

33
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,880
Why not kneel down

34
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
at the sight of the Devil Lord?

35
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,400
Kneel!

36
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,440
Devil Lord Qiu Ping?

37
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,120
How dare she address the Lord by name?

38
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,560
Deserve a beating.

39
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,360
How dare you?

40
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,840
Stay away from her, or you will die miserably.

41
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,320
From now on,

42
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,080
you should call Shi Xia your Devil Lady.

43
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,160
You should respect her

44
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,320
as you respect me.

45
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,280
Got it?

46
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,040
Wait, your Majesty.

47
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,400
Just order me as you like, Devil Lady.

48
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
Gosh, Shi Dong is the Devil Lord.

49
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Now I'm a spy of Devil Sect in their eyes.

50
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,280
Are you sick? Why take so many medicines?

51
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,920
Are you looking me down?

52
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,240
Don't you know Dragon Ball?

53
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
Today I'll widen your horizon.

54
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,720
This is the Ark,

55
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
a means of transport invented by me.

56
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,680
Do you like it?

57
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Come on.

58
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Follow me, Husppy.

59
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,960
Do you like it?

60
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,760
Have a look.

61
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,559
Look at this,

62
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
it's the driver's cab.

63
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,919
Look at that horse.

64
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,640
Great, right?

65
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Come here.

66
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,920
Come on.

67
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,880
Bubble tea.

68
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
I've never expected I could drink it in this world.

69
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,640
You've scared me!

70
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,800
Remember to shake it before drinking,

71
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
or you'll miss its essence.

72
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,040
There wasn't such thing before,

73
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,080
but I invented it.

74
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,080
I remember that Bubble tea is your favorite drink.

75
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,440
Just a sip.

76
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,240
You've drunk so much!

77
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
You didn't say how much a sip could be.

78
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,000
You can drink like I do.

79
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Shi Dong

80
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,760
Come on.

81
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,080
Shi Dong

82
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,960
Do you like it?

83
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
Just so so.

84
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
I haven't had milk tea for long

85
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,400
so I can bear this now.

86
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,760
What?

87
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,440
Leave here.

88
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,040
You heard that? Leave here.

89
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Don't stand in the way.

90
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,920
I mean you.

91
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,080
Devil Lady, huh?

92
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
The days that Immortal Aunt isn't here...

93
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,880
Get out!

94
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,440
are numbered!

95
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,680
Don't hinder us from

96
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,880
talking about the old days.

97
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,520
The Yuhua Sect is so mean.

98
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,040
The dress is too plain.

99
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,080
When we return to Devil Sect,

100
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,840
I will make you a set of advanced custom clothing.

101
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm here for you now.

102
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,640
It's on my schedule.

103
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Here for me?

104
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,000
Stop boasting.

105
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,280
Now I know

106
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,040
you were enjoying life here the year you disappeared.

107
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,360
You don't understand.

108
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
Thanks to the past year,

109
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,080
I could grow into

110
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,800
the hero in an adventure novel.

111
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,080
What do you mean?

112
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,720
I've jumped into the sea, jumped off the cliff

113
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,280
and been struck by the lightning.

114
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
But I can't go back to our world no matter what I've done.

115
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
Then I figured out a question,

116
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,640
why I can't die as I wish.

117
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,440
Have you read time travel novels?

118
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,720
Why the hero in an adventure novel

119
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,960
be able to achieve in unfavorable circumstances?

120
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,680
Look at me,

121
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,880
I've been the Devil Lord within one year.

122
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,840
This only shows

123
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,600
I am destined to be the hero in an adventure novel.

124
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,720
You've lost your mind.

125
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,840
Don't believe me?

126
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
I'll show you.

127
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,440
Junior Master has never gone downhill and is unfamiliar with the road.

128
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
This trip is a good opportunity

129
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
to get closer to him.

130
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,040
Hope to discuss

131
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,640
the practice experience with him within three days.

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
This way, Master.

133
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,800
I've arranged everything for you,

134
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,720
the inn, restaurant,

135
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,680
tea house, and rest place along the way.

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Just rest assured to follow me on the road.

137
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,280
Shi Xia has been captured by Devil Lord Qiu Ping.

138
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
Please rescue her quickly.

139
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
There are many bandits

140
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,360
in these places circled by red.

141
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,000
There are some liars who sell fake medicines

142
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
in the places circled by green.

143
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
So I suspect that

144
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,600
there are strongholds of Devil Sect

145
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
near these circled places.

146
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,000
Master, the Otherworld Town isn't in that direction.

147
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,160
Junior Master, where are you going?

148
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,760
Devil Sect.

149
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,960
The owner asked you to go to the Otherworld Town

150
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,880
to participate in the preliminary contest of the alliance election,

151
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,920
but you are going to the Demon Sect.

152
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,080
Just because of Shi Xia?

153
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,840
Shi Xia was captured by the Devil Lord.

154
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,560
She is the Devil Lord's friend.

155
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,440
He didn't capture her, but rescued her.

156
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,440
You can rest assured.

157
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,920
Shi Xia isn't a spy.

158
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,680
Do you know how to go to the Devil Sect?

159
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
Devil Sect has stayed away from the world for a long time.

160
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,640
For more than two thousand years,

161
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,960
no one has got the entrance.

162
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
How can I know it?

163
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
Junior Master is really obsessed.

164
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,400
If he continues like this,

165
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
he will only go further on a wrong path.

166
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,320
No, I can't

167
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,280
allow him to do this.

168
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
I should help him find the witch

169
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,320
and question her to make him give up completely.

170
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,280
Wait for me in the Otherworld Town.

171
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,320
I will meet you again

172
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,120
when I rescue her.

173
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
No, I have to go with you.

174
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,560
You see, you've never gone downhill

175
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
and you don't know the dark side of the world,

176
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,800
but I am different.

177
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,080
Let's welcome the Devil Lady.

178
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,880
Long live the Devil Lord!

179
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,640
Long live the Devil Lord!

180
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,240
How about this?

181
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,160
How about this?

182
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,160
Long live the Devil Lord!

183
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,800
Okay.

184
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,680
Long live the Devil Lord!

185
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,040
Husppy

186
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Hey,

187
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
is this the slogan I asked you to chant this morning?

188
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,600
Don't you remember?

189
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
Listen to my direction, okay?

190
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,880
Morning, friends in Devil Sect.

191
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
Morning, your Majesty.

192
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
Our slogan is...

193
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,360
The road to become immortal is long,

194
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,640
and milk tea will always be with you.

195
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
Sugar, milk and ice,

196
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,480
Devil Sect will help you go ahead.

197
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,080
Yeah, help you go ahead.

198
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,720
I can sell 600 more immortal coins of holy power.

199
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,400
Can holy power be bought and sold here?

200
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
In my place,

201
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
as long as you are diligent and wise,

202
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,120
you can win immortal coins.

203
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
Holy power can be bought by immortal coins,

204
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,960
and immortal coins can be bought by holy power.

205
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,600
In this way,

206
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
you can live a decent life

207
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,000
as a person with Immortal perception.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,520
Besides,

209
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,560
those holy power will be of great use someday.

210
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,680
Good job.

211
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,720
See,

212
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
you can't deny that I'm capable.

213
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,120
I'll be the head of Immortals Alliance.

214
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
You also want to run for the leader of Immortals Alliance?

215
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,640
What does it mean?

216
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm destined to be the leader of Immortals Alliance.

217
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,680
The ending of my hero's script is,

218
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
I'll become the leader

219
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
and lead Devil Sect to the top.

220
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,440
You, go here and search.

221
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,720
Yes, boss.

222
00:16:59,520 --> 00:16:59,920
You two,

223
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,359
go there and search.

224
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,119
Yes, sir.

225
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,520
Master, I've sent out the mission.

226
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,280
We just need to wait for the result.

227
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,040
What is this?

228
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,880
This is immortal coin, or money.

229
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,839
Why do they take it and work for you?

230
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,960
This is the first experience you have to learn.

231
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,720
Money makes the mare go.

232
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,480
We need money for everything

233
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,360
after going downhill.

234
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,640
Good, you have a lot of money.

235
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,760
Master

236
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,640
I will make you the symbol of

237
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,280
Yuhua Sect again.

238
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,160
You will definitely not be able to accept

239
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
such a large amount of information at once,

240
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,840
or take a sip of milk tea to recollect your thoughts.

241
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,360
Come on, take a sip.

242
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,280
How do you become the Devil Lord?

243
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,960
Where is the original one?

244
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,000
The last Devil Lord Qiu Ping is tyrannical.

245
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,240
Nobody can find him now.

246
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,320
Only I can take on

247
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,480
this important task at present.

248
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,160
So you are

249
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,240
an impostor?

250
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Not so serious.

251
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,960
Just borrow his identity temporarily.

252
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,880
What's more, no one knows Qiu Ping's face.

253
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,920
What if you are found out

254
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
that you are not the real Devil Lord Qiu Ping

255
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,840
one day?

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
Don't worry.

257
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,000
This kind of small probability event

258
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,040
is unlikely to happen to the hero.

259
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,560
All right.

260
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,160
Up to you.

261
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,360
Take me to the preliminary contest of the alliance election.

262
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,600
Why?

263
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,440
Is it because of Hou Chi?

264
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,760
That's not true.

265
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,760
How can I miss

266
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,520
the glorious moment

267
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,560
when my brother

268
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,760
is elected as the leader?

269
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,440
What if we meet Hou Chi?

270
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Come on,

271
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,680
I'm his little sister now.

272
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,360
No way, since you've found your true brother,

273
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
you have to sever ties with him.

274
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,400
Got it?

275
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
Don't be childish.

276
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,120
We can't let others know our relationship.

277
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,960
We both need an identity in this world.

278
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,400
You are Devil Lord Qiu Ping,

279
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,280
and I'm Hou Chi's sister.

280
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't agree.

281
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,520
As your brother, I can't admit it.

282
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,680
Somebody help!

283
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,920
Okay, I'll take you there.

284
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
That's a deal.

285
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,960
Go and change your clothes first.

286
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,640
Master

287
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,080
Where did you get this map?

288
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,840
The drawing is twisted and hard to read.

289
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,800
This is certainly not from a professional.

290
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,080
Most important of all,

291
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,240
all the places circled by purple

292
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,120
have been searched,

293
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
and none of them is true.

294
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
I should have known that Senior is unreliable.

295
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,520
I guess Master Bi Hong just believe the hearsay.

296
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,680
After all, in the past two thousand years,

297
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,920
no one has ever found the entrance of Devil Sect.

298
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
Who are you?

299
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
How stupid you are!

300
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,320
You're robbed.

301
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,920
How dare you!

302
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,120
Don't you know who we are?

303
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,280
Listen, I'm Yi Yaogua,

304
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,360
from Yuhua Sect.

305
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,120
-Yi Yaogua. -And this one is...

306
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,680
We are looking for you.

307
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,600
I've heard you are generous

308
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,320
and you are looking for the entrance of Devil Sect.

309
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,440
Hurry up.

310
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,760
I have a method to

311
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,040
find the entrance of Devil Sect.

312
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Listen,

313
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,160
Devil Lord has gone to the Otherworld Town.

314
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,200
Do you have the guts to go to him and ask?

315
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,800
Please wait for me, Master.

316
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,560
How dare this group of villains look down on our Yuhua Sect.

317
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
I'll teach them a lesson.

318
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,000
Boss!

319
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,640
Good for you.

320
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,600
But no matter how good you are,

321
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
you are alone.

322
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,880
You're not our rival.

323
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,840
Master, well done.

324
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,560
You've got the second experience of the world,

325
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,640
escape if you can't beat others,

326
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,000
before I tell you.

327
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,240
Hit him!

328
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,120
Arrogant.

329
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,280
Can you be arrogant now?

330
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,800
Look, what is that?

331
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,440
What's that?

332
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,640
Louder applause.

333
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,960
It can be much louder.

334
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,080
Isn't the Otherworld Inn designated by

335
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,000
Immortals Alliance?

336
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,040
Why are the candidates?

337
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,320
I guess everyone knows that your Majesty is here,

338
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
so they returned home.

339
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,120
You're right.

340
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
If this is the truth,

341
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
the blessing from gods is too much.

342
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,520
Come on, take a look of the inside.

343
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,720
Okay.

344
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,680
Okay, come on.

345
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,040
Let's go.

346
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,440
Devil Sect hasn't shown in the selection for many years,

347
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,920
but we can still be placed in the center.

348
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,800
Yeah.

349
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,720
Husppy

350
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,960
Good public relation. You'll get awards.

351
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,560
Don't flatter me.

352
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,880
What's public relation?

353
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,920
It means to be a big spender.

354
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,880
Why do you call me a pig?

355
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,120
I mean this.

356
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,880
Oh, this.

357
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,280
Waiter

358
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,000
Waiter

359
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
Candidates from Devil Sect arrive.

360
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,040
A candidate from Yuhua Sect arrives.

361
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,880
Fantastic, this inn is fully automatic.

362
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,040
Well, we are all from Devil Sect.

363
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,760
Yeah.

364
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,560
Where is the apprentice of Yuhua Sect?

365
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,240
Where is he?

366
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,680
Are you the betrayal?

367
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,480
How dare I do that?

368
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,240
Though I want to be.

369
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,560
Not me nor you.

370
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
Who would he be?

371
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
How can you be an apprentice of Yuhua Sect?

372
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,320
You're my...

373
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,440
follower.

374
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,600
You can be an apprentice of Yuhua Sect,

375
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,720
but you must live with us.

376
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,600
Right.

377
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,640
Let's go.

378
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,680
Okay, go.

379
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,360
Here we are.

380
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,840
Devil Sect.

381
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
Wow, that's awesome.

382
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,760
Good.

383
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,440
What's wrong?

384
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,960
What happened?

385
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,640
All candidates must stay in their own rooms,

386
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,200
and those who break into the room of other sects

387
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,640
will be disqualified from this competition.

388
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
Who set this rule?

389
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,160
Husppy

390
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,000
Break the ward.

391
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,720
Okay.

392
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,480
It doesn't work.

393
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,800
Vandals will be disqualified from this competition.

394
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,720
Who is it?

395
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,640
Come out!

396
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,800
Your Majesty, don't make your own future

397
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,240
ruined because of me.

398
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,760
Just a trifle.

399
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,800
It's not worthy.

400
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,760
Come in.

401
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,840
I'm Shi Xia, an apprentice of Yuhua Sect.

402
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,440
I'll go back to my room.

403
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Your Majesty, calm down.

404
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,120
Don't make troubles, okay?

405
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,600
Vandals will be disqualified

406
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,160
from the competition.

407
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,800
We should make great achievements,

408
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,920
right?

409
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,760
Husppy

410
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,520
I order you to find

411
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,600
the person who spoke before it's dark.

412
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,520
I must beat him up.

413
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,640
No need for your order.

414
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,000
I want to beat him up, too.

415
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,160
Have you ever thought of this, Hou Chi?
