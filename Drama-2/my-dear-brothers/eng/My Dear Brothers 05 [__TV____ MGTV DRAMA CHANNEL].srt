00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:38,009
My Dear Brothers
EP05

2
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,880
I will be gentle.

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,160
It's OK.

4
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,120
Why were you at the forbidden place at the foot of the mountain?

5
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,800
I wanted to go home.

6
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,400
You still want to find your brother.

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,120
However,

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
what's the relationship between
the forbidden place and going home?

9
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,800
I heard that I could learn the enchantment of breaking the virtual space there.

10
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,080
Nonsense.

11
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space

12
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,600
is the privilege of the leader of Immortals Alliance.

13
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

14
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,960
You never asked.

15
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,760
Then I won't be able to go home forever.

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,520
Where exactly is your home?

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,760
My home is at a place very far away.

18
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,880
To be exact, it's not far.

19
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,920
It's another alternate universe.

20
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,640
Compared with your ancient times,

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
we call it modern times.

22
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,160
Ancient and modern.

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
We don't have so many people seeking immortality.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,800
And we don’t judge people by immortal perception.

25
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,920
The main difference between people

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
is intelligence,

27
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
And the fortune of their fathers.

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
They are all mortals.

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
Isn't life hard there?

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
It's not that boring.

31
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,120
You can learn to ride on clouds.

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
But we have airplanes.

33
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
You can transmit messages over thousands of miles.

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
But we invented phones.

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,720
You can learn to have a photographic memory.

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
But I have computers.

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,080
If so, I would like to see that.

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
Welcome. If you can come,

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,480
I would take you to taste assorted pea noodles, hot pot,

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,600
lama ravioli,

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,680
and my favorite, bubble tea.

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Almost forget, you don't eat.

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,600
Maybe I can try.

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,360
I see.

45
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,360
We are not from the same world.

46
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,680
You are so smart.

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,400
So you have to break the virtual space

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
and go back to modern times.

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,880
Then, you can find your brother.

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,280
Yes.

51
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,360
I didn't believe in parallel space.

52
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Until that day,

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
I came to your pond.

54
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,000
Fine.

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
When I become the leader,

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
I can send you back.

57
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,760
However,

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,200
I have to be your sister before I go back.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,160
How do you know?

60
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,840
Stubborn.

61
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,160
How can you firmly believe

62
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
that a sister can help you improve the ability?

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,480
An opponent said that.

64
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Was he trying to bluff you?

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
You don't have to worry about that.

66
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,000
I need a sister to help me practice
the Heart of Guardian.

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you willing to do this?

68
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,400
(He can't lie.)

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
(He was just taken in by his opponent.)

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,440
(Since we have talked through this,)

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,120
(there's nothing bad about being his sister.)

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
Seeing your good will in inviting me

73
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
as your sister,

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,000
I accept it.

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,960
So you agreed.

76
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,480
Yes, but on one condition.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,160
My word is as good as my bond.

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
No need for written evidence.

79
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm afraid I'd change my mind.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
What's more, I need to add some rules.

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
It's ok.

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,880
Just give me your hand.

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,760
Write in my hand.

84
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,120
I can seal it. Is that better?

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,120
So high class.

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
First one,

87
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,560
no inappropriate body contact.

88
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,360
What is inappropriate body contact?

89
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,040
Just like kisses and hugs.

90
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
Can you show me?

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,200
Otherwise, It’s hard for me to follow.

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,120
I'd rather not.

93
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,440
I will tell you if you break it.

94
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,080
Ok.

95
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,840
Then.

96
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,520
Rule No. 2,

97
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,400
don't ask me to call you brother.

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,480
Not for this one.

99
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
What's wrong with this?

100
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
We are already brother and sister.

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,320
And I will respect and love you like that.

102
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
Why bother with a title?

103
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,440
If I agree with this,

104
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,520
you have to agree to one of my conditions.

105
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,000
You have to company me to
practice for an hour daily.

106
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,760
But I have to go to school.

107
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,640
Then once a week.

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,280
Fine.

109
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
I thought you never signed a contract.

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Why are you bargaining?

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,120
I learnt from you.

112
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,040
Rule No. 3.

113
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,040
Except for me,

114
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,400
you can't make conditions.

115
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,840
If so, I'll seal it as brother and sister.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,360
Bro, the seal

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,800
is so ugly.

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,040
This squiggly triangle

119
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,640
and this one.

120
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
What are these?

121
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,000
This is me.

122
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
This is you.

123
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
I'll behave myself like this contract symbol.

124
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,760
I'll protect you forever.

125
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,160
I don't bear any similarity to your potato

126
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,640
Can you learn some basics of drawing?

127
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,920
Are you going to change your mind?

128
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,680
Just change a bit.

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
The contract can't be changed.

130
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,440
What are you doing in the morning?

131
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,960
Practice with me.

132
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm not awake.

133
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,640
Leave me alone.

134
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,400
According to the contract,
you should practice with me.

135
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,440
Then I'll add one more rule.

136
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,000
You can't enter this room
without my permission.

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
Dear lord.

138
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,080
How could I sleep if someone standing there?

139
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
Have you improved?

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,640
Not yet.

141
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
So how can I help you?

142
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,800
Be quiet.

143
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,680
Last question.

144
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,520
How long will you take to improve yourself?

145
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,120
No idea.

146
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,640
So how long can I go home?

147
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,160
Sister, what's wrong with you?

148
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,080
You just practice first.

149
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,080
I'll take a bath to wake myself up.

150
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
An empty basin.

151
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,320
Why am I here?

152
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
Not bad.

153
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Finally, I can

154
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,880
take a warm bath comfortably.

155
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,880
It would be perfect with some rose petals

156
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,200
and an essential oil bath gel.

157
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,840
What's wrong?

158
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,840
Nothing.

159
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,160
It just reminds me that

160
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,280
when I was little,

161
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,680
my brother will put ducks in the bathtub

162
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,560
to let me take a bath.

163
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,920
How cute.

164
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,640
But I mean rubber ducks.

165
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,680
Not real ducks.

166
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,320
You don't like it?

167
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
Don't let it go.

168
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,240
Look how cute it is.

169
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,440
Keep it.

170
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Whatever.

171
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,880
I'll do some business outside.

172
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,920
You two.

173
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,440
Do you realize your fault?

174
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,440
I really have no idea.

175
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,800
Please tell me directly.

176
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,640
Yes, we did nothing.

177
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,120
We were just chatting.

178
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
Rule No. 134.

179
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,520
The one who harm fellow disciples

180
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,920
shall be severely punished.

181
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,960
Rule No. 212.

182
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,520
No harmful lies.

183
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
The violators shall be severely punished.

184
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,920
Rule No. 250.

185
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,160
Knowing and admitting a mistake can be punished at discretion.

186
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,920
You heard him.

187
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,320
If you admit the mistakes,

188
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,080
you still have the chance for a light punishment.

189
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,120
It's our fault.

190
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,720
Master Hou Chi, we admit.

191
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
I am wrong.

192
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,520
Junior, what punishment

193
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,520
will you give?

194
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,120
What about

195
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
following the old rules of Master Yuan Ye?

196
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,040
Hou Chi

197
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,920
Master

198
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,080
The owner asks you to go over now.

199
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
The punishment can follow the old rules.

200
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,320
Old rules.

201
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,880
Boss, be careful.

202
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,640
Forget about

203
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,600
the places you can't reach.

204
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,560
Is this Boss Yi?

205
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,600
Look what he is doing now.

206
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,680
Don't only clean that place.

207
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,400
Here. Here.

208
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,440
Clean it up.

209
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,880
What are you doing?

210
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Master Hou Chi forbids us from using charms.

211
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,760
Secretly, we'll not be found out.

212
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,520
Using enchantments without permission,
double punishment.

213
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Shi Xia

214
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,600
Why do even the Master and Junior give him protection?

215
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,240
Is the little master have something to do with him?

216
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,120
What kind of symbol of Yuhua Sect?

217
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,400
Don't humiliate my idol.

218
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,920
He is the symbol of the Yuhua Sect.

219
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,040
It's all the Little One's fault.

220
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,920
Master

221
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,160
Your ability is the same as always.

222
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Not wasted.

223
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
I can rest now.

224
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,960
I won't get slack.

225
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,000
Teaching in the school for you

226
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,520
is to improve your ability.

227
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,200
It's for the greater good.

228
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,480
But if you are distracted by this,

229
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,240
it's not good for you.

230
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,560
Are you clear?

231
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,360
I know.

232
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,640
Don't forget.

233
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,160
The first test for the leader is getting closer.

234
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,200
Ugly doll, did you realize that Hou Chi

235
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,080
was not in a good mood since he was back?

236
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
Probably because of the practice.

237
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,960
How can I help him?

238
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,560
Right.

239
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,440
That's what they do on TV.

240
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,000
What are you doing?

241
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm helping you practice.

242
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,320
Don't touch me again when I am practicing.

243
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,160
Remember it.

244
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,200
Sorry.

245
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,840
Then,

246
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,520
how can I help you?

247
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,800
You signed the contract with me

248
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
to improve your ability.

249
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,160
Then I can't do nothing, right?

250
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,520
Don't worry.

251
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,040
But you have to promise me

252
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,560
that you won't do that again.

253
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,880
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

254
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,600
Just like the Holy Tree.

255
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,720
Holy Tree?

256
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,440
That's it.

257
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,800
It's a dead tree.

258
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,800
Why did you call it the holy tree?

259
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,000
It is

260
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,680
because of me.

261
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,600
I started practicing under it when I was little.

262
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,560
It was sound

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
and lively.

264
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,480
I remember it would grow seven-color leaves,

265
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,960
Shining.

266
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,160
Using the spirit of this tree,

267
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,120
I was improving fast.

268
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,640
But with me growing stronger,

269
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,800
the tree slowly withered.

270
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
So,

271
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,040
the tree's spirit was transferred into you.

272
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,360
Master said that

273
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,720
the tree had an ancient holy root

274
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,400
that contained the nimbus of the universe.

275
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,560
It was the holy pulse of the Yuhua Sect.

276
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Maybe we share a similar fate.

277
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,760
That why Master picked me up at the root

278
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,720
of the mountain when I was abandoned.

279
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,840
This tree was the symbol of the Yuhua Sect.

280
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
Now, I can't improve my ability.

281
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,800
This tree

282
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,080
must be disappointed too.

283
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,560
You are so stubborn.

284
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,240
The tree won't be that weak.

285
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
I heard that in the tree's world,

286
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,560
each of them has their destiny.

287
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,440
They will guard one person.

288
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,760
Brother

289
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,240
Brother, where are you?

290
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,800
Brother, where are you?

291
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,800
Brother, where are you?

292
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,640
When you are at your worst,

293
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,360
your tree will show up

294
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,080
and guard you.

295
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,520
Little sister, wake up.

296
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
Why are you sleeping here?

297
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,600
Where are your parents?

298
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,760
Tell me.

299
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,520
I'll let them pick you home.

300
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,680
So,

301
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,120
trees are the toughest creatures in the world.

302
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,640
It won't be dead so easily.

303
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,000
Hold it like me.

304
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,920
It will give you peace and patience.

305
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,480
It will guard you.

306
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,560
Come on.

307
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,320
Now I have a sister.

308
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,800
As long as you are with me,

309
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,760
I believe

310
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,880
my ability will break through eventually.

311
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,440
It seems that he really treats me as his sister.

312
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,760
If I leave in the future,

313
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,720
what will happen to him?

314
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,440
What am I thinking?

315
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,680
Just do it.

316
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
Just think of doing something good for him before I leave.

317
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
He saved me.

318
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,200
I can't fail him.

319
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,400
When I leave, he will lose a sister.

320
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,040
But at least, he has a Holy Tree.

321
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
We owe each other nothing.

322
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Senior

323
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
Senior, are you there?

324
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Senior Bihong

325
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,840
Senior, are you there?

326
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,360
Junior

327
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,920
Why are you here?

328
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,400
Senior, did you grow all these

329
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
flowers and grasses by yourself?

330
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,840
Of course.

331
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,160
Come on, let me show you around.

332
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,800
Senior

333
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,280
You can keep yourself in such a young situation

334
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,200
and keep all these so lively.

335
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,040
I am wondering you must
have some experience about growing trees.

336
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,840
Growing trees?

337
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,560
That depends on what kind of trees

338
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,480
you are asking.

339
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,320
Mount Yuhua has

340
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,480
pines, cypresses, poplars, willows,

341
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,400
lime trees, fir trees,

342
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,200
peach trees, pear trees

343
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
and

344
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,320
Holy Trees.

345
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,280
I won't hide.

346
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
I am asking about the Holy Trees.

347
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,160
So, do you know that

348
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,560
hundred years ago,

349
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,800
all the people in Yuhua Sect used

350
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,640
so many ways to save the holy tree.

351
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,680
But none of them worked.

352
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,040
I know.

353
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,560
So do you know that

354
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,080
The owner ordered that

355
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,760
anyone who touched the Holy Tree
would be abandoned by the Sect.

356
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Yes.

357
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,320
Since you knew it, how dare you?

358
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,520
I said in the hall that

359
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,800
I won't

360
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,480
follow my fate,

361
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,040
but to fight it.

362
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,120
Senior, just borrow me the tools,

363
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,600
and make plans for me.

364
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,560
I'll take all the responsibilities.

365
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,440
You are a... alone.

366
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,800
Can you do heavy works like these?

367
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,920
Of course.

368
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,920
I majored in forestry in my hometown.

369
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,040
There are still people learning this?

370
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,400
How about this?

371
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,400
If you can prove that you can save the Holy Tree,

372
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,360
by yourself,

373
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,120
I can lend my tools.

374
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
It's easy.

375
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,320
What are you looking for?

376
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,200
You will know it soon.

377
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,200
What are you doing?

378
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,720
Wait and see.

379
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,680
You can use enchantments?

380
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,040
No. No. No.

381
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,920
Hydrangeas change their colour
because of their PH.

382
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,400
I added alkali to it.

383
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,280
The blue hydrangea turns pink.

384
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm professional.

385
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,840
Do you believe me now?

386
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,200
Bravo.

387
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,560
I'll keep my word.

388
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Take whatever you want.

389
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,120
Thanks.

390
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,160
As a reward,

391
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,240
you can take this pink hydrangea.

392
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,880
It's already mine.

393
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,840
It's different.

394
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,200
The flower meaning of blue hydrangea is betrayal.

395
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,720
But pink is forever.

396
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,240
Do flowers have their meaning?

397
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,520
It's my first time to hear that.

398
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,600
Of course.

399
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,200
In my hometown,

400
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,080
each of the flowers has its own words.

401
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,520
Rose represents love.

402
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,160
Mimosa stands for inferiority.

403
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,640
Daisy means hope.

404
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,360
Setaria represents unrequited love.

405
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,800
Interesting.

406
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Ok. Take the tools.

407
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,240
Ok.

408
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,560
Wait.

409
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,640
I have to remind you something.

410
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,520
Go ahead.

411
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,040
You have to avoid Hou Chi when growing the Holy Tree.

412
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,440
Why?

413
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
Hou Chi has such marvelous ability.

414
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,560
When you are growing the Holy Tree,

415
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,880
if you use too much holy power,

416
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,280
you will be found about by the owner.

417
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,120
I got it.

418
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,160
I'll take the tools.

419
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,360
I have to eat the Cotton Candy today.

420
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,800
Cotton Candy, remember?

421
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,320
Wait.

422
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,480
Cotton Candy?

423
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,880
Can you say that again?

424
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,840
What does it look like?

425
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,520
Sweet, soft.

426
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,600
Something that melts in your mouth.

427
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,680
Hurry up.

428
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,040
Anyway,

429
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,120
if you can't find it before tonight,

430
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,800
don't come back.

431
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,240
Be careful.

432
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,440
Hold it tight, Senior.

433
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:44,960
Ok.

434
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,600
Senior, harder.

435
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,440
Go.

436
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,480
Go.

437
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,520
Boss.

438
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,480
Are you sure the Little One is inside?

439
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,080
Indeed.

440
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
I followed him yesterday.

441
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,200
He lives with the Junior Master.

442
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,960
I have to go up and see.

443
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,680
Come on.

444
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,840
Come here.

445
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,800
Shi Xia

446
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,560
Why tie so many straw ropes?

447
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,120
To keep the water in it.

448
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,440
Ok.

449
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,720
Ok.

450
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,480
Look how tired you are.

451
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,320
It seems that my Junior is back.

452
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,120
Hou Chi

453
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,600
Why are you back so early?

454
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,680
The cotton and candy you want.

455
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,080
Soft, and

456
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,960
sweet.
