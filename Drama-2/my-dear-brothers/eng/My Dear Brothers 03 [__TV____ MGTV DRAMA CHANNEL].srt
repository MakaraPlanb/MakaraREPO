My Dear Brothers
EP03

2
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,400
I have something to ask you.

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,920
Oh God, is he gonna confess to me?

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,520
Can I be your...

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Immortal

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,240
I know you're great,

7
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
and I respect you.

8
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,720
But I don't want a relationship yet.

9
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,480
... be your brother!

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,480
Brother?

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,280
There's such an intimate atmosphere,

12
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,480
but he just wanna be my brother?

13
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
What do you think?

14
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,480
No.

15
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,880
Why?

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,880
I have a brother.

17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,280
What your brother did or not,

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
I've done for you.

19
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Well, I have to thank you for that?

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
Thank you for not killing me

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,680
when you amuse yourself these days?

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Why do you say that?

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,720
First you made me some awful food,

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,280
then you told ghost stories to scare me.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Just now you acted like going Bungee Jumping for the Ferris wheel,

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,520
letting loose buckles.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,880
I'm lucky to be alive for now.

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,560
Well,

29
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
how can I be a good brother to you?

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,680
Why do you want a sister?

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,960
In order to improve my force.

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,400
You...

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,520
I thought Yuhua Sect

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,760
is noble and decent.

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,280
How can there be such nonsense?

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
You just need to know that

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,080
brother will protect sister.

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
Oh great,

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,120
I can't learn enchantments here,

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,520
but you intend to use me to enhance your force.

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
You want a sister? OK.

42
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
But you have to promise me one thing.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,640
What?

44
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
Send me to the academy to learn Enchantments.

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,760
No.

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,480
Then there's no need to discuss.

47
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
Each one minds his own business.

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,320
Bye.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,760
You look so upset.

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
Let me guess,

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,120
did you have a quarrel with girl?

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,240
No fight,

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,640
and no sister.

54
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,640
Let me tell you.

55
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,439
I have a friend,

56
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,680
who hasn't had a girl for many, many years.

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,720
Recently, he met one,

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
and he asked me for advice on many things.

59
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,200
It goes well now.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Senior, let me ask you.

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,160
If the younger sister doesn't want an elder brother,

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,360
what to do?

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,240
You were rejected?

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,040
Then you would be in the resurrection.

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,800
The most important thing in resurrection

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,240
is to find what she needs.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,480
If she needs money,

68
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,600
give her money.

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
If she needs enthusiasm,

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,680
be enthusiastic.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,880
If she needs tenderness,

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,760
be tender.

73
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
What does this girl need?

74
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Senior

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,760
I recently encounter a talented man,

76
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,800
and I want to recommend him to the academy.

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,040
I wonder if you can help me.

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Hello,

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,480
how do I look?

80
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
Thank you.

81
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,480
By the way,

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,400
Why didn't you recommend me in person?

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
Senior often goes outside the mountain.

84
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,880
It makes sense for you to know him.

85
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,520
What's this?

86
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,960
My smell is on this magic item,

87
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,680
and it can cover up your feminine scent.

88
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Keep it with you.

89
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,680
It looks exactly the same as you!

90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,160
Even the expression!

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
What's its name?

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
Magic item is just magic item,

93
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
it has no name.

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
I'll give it one.

95
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,760
How about "the doll head"?

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,280
Remember, don't...

97
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
Don't be found that I'm a girl.

98
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
Otherwise, I'll be whipped.

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,040
Got it.

100
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,560
How can I use it?

101
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
If you are in danger,

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,120
it'll inform me.

103
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,760
You are the pretty... boy

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,080
who met my Junior

105
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,600
by chance?

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,120
You really look so pretty.

107
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,920
Uncle Master

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Am I that old?

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,040
Since you are a peer of my junior,

110
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,000
how about call me Senior?

111
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,040
Senior

112
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,440
The hierarchy is wrong.

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
We feel like old friends at the first meeting,

114
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,080
with our mutual agreement,

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,200
why not?

116
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,800
Let's go, take the kid to school.

117
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm not a kid.

118
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,120
My junior and I are 200 years old.

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,480
In our eyes,

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
you're a kid.

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,600
Master Uncle

123
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,360
Master Uncle

124
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,840
Here he is.

125
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,040
Is he the talented man recommended by Bi Hong?

126
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm Shi Xia,

127
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
live in Lotus Village down the mountain.

128
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,439
Please allow me to enter

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,920
Yuhua Sect.

130
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
Lotus Village?

131
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
Never heard of any talented man

132
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,480
with immortal perception there.

133
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,760
Right.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
He has no immortal perception.

135
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,000
Nonsense!

136
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,840
How can one cultivate without immortal perceptions.

137
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,800
When is there a rule in Yuhua Sect that

138
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,920
one can't cultivate without immortal perceptions?

139
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,320
Even there isn't a rule,

140
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
you should know it.

141
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
If one has no immortal perception but forcibly do that,

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,800
it's like a drop in the ocean,

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
comparing eternity with sun and moon.

144
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,240
Every man has his destiny. Don't delay him.

145
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah,

146
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,480
I've been doing nothing all day,

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
just fool around with birds and flowers.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
More importantly,

149
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,000
I have no immortal perception, too.

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,800
What a pity,

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,720
I live for 200 years.

152
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,920
Interesting, isn't it?

153
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,680
Even if you live for a thousand years,

154
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
you're not equal to one

155
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,720
with immortal perception.

156
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,920
Don't get angry.

157
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,800
You finally tell the truth.

158
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,040
Anyway, in your eyes,

159
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
I'm nothing.

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Stop talking,

161
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,760
take him back.

162
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,080
May I say something?

163
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,720
The Immortal Venerable said, every man has his destiny.

164
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,800
Then if a creature was

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,040
born to be evil,

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,560
he is doomed to be evil,

167
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,640
and there's no need to change him?

168
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,000
In my hometown,

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,040
there's a saying,

170
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
I am the master of my own fate.

171
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,720
Why bother?

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,360
Let him audit for a month as usual,

173
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,960
and he can become a full member if he gets the signatures of all the elders.

174
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,720
Otherwise, stop pestering.

175
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,960
I agree.

176
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,120
Do as you say.

177
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,120
Yes!

178
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,920
Yes!

179
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,480
In such a big place,

180
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,840
he just sits in the corner,

181
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
maybe he is a study slacker who sleeps in the class.

182
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,960
Excuse me,

183
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,320
hello, I'm new here.

184
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,960
You must be the bold external student

185
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,560
who has no immortal perception and not from any famous family

186
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,480
and want to cultivate.

187
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,720
I have to ask, the one who

188
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,000
gangs others up,

189
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,040
and with pompous manners,

190
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
and puts cultivation secondary,

191
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,520
gossip first,

192
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
who are you?

193
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,440
The owner of this seat.

194
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
So, it's you who messed with me!

195
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,160
There's no seating chart,

196
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
why do you say it's yours?

197
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840
Go and ask around.

198
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Our big brother, Yi Yaogua,

199
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,720
the only son of the Baling Yi family.

200
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
The magic items made by his family

201
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,280
are the most sophisticated and powerful in the whole immortal world.

202
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,640
All the sects scramble for that.

203
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,840
Every instrument is hard to get.

204
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,680
It turns out you are a son of immortals.

205
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,040
You!

206
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,040
Qing Feng

207
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,320
Nice dress today.

208
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,040
Take it off!

209
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,800
Take it off!

210
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,680
What are you doing?

211
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,600
He is wearing the same style as Uncle Master,

212
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,000
and he's not qualified to wear it.

213
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,200
Aren't all blue clothes the same?

214
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,200
So are you.

215
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,200
Yeah.

216
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,800
I say he can't, then he can't.

217
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,480
Let me go!

218
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,840
Now you beg for mercy,

219
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,920
too late!

220
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,320
You just can't wear the same style!

221
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,760
Big brother, now it's not the same.

222
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
Why is it so abnormally quiet today?

223
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,400
Not even a bird or a worm chirping.

224
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
I heard that it's a nice room for two.

225
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,480
Except for a new roommate,

226
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,520
it's just like being with the immortal.

227
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,400
Hello? Anyone here?

228
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,040
Who's there?

229
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,920
Sorry,

230
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,440
I don't know someone was here.

231
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,720
Don't come over!

232
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,680
Ok, I'll go.

233
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,840
We're all men, what are you afraid of?

234
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,440
I...

235
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I warn you,

236
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,640
I'll teach you a lesson if you come closer.

237
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,200
I found your secret.

238
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,519
What secret do I have?

239
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,560
If you come closer,

240
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,239
I'll be unkind.

241
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,759
You?

242
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,320
The skin,

243
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,720
the body,

244
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
and the chest wrap,

245
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,680
do you think I'm blind that I can't tell you're a girl?

246
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,360
What do you want?

247
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,560
What do I want?

248
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
It depends on you.

249
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,000
If you make public, don't blame me for being rude.

250
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,600
Let me go,

251
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm kidding.

252
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm not kidding.

253
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,720
The doll head is not with sister?

254
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,320
What a coincidence!

255
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,920
It's like

256
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,360
Hua Mulan meets Zhu Yingtai.

257
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,360
It's really a coincidence.

258
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,000
But yours is a very advanced magic item.

259
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,640
No wonder your smell

260
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,240
was covered up so completely.

261
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What about you?

262
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,080
How do you cover up yours?

263
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,440
This is Black-Sun Elixir,

264
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
which can replenish the male smell

265
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,520
to cover up female one.

266
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
But I have to take it

267
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,680
every four hours.

268
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
This is great!

269
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,320
If I lose the doll head someday,

270
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,880
I can borrow yours.

271
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,720
You'd better not.

272
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,880
As a girl,

273
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
taking it will damage your body.

274
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,160
You can't stand it.

275
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,680
You come to Yuhua Sect for study

276
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,440
despite the harm to your body.

277
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,680
You don't

278
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,320
come for idol

279
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,640
as Yi Yaogua does, do you?

280
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
Of course not.

281
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,840
I want to practice the enchantments well, it's useful for me.

282
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,200
Tell me about you.

283
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Why do you come here?

284
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,160
I...

285
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,520
... want to learn the enchantment of breaking the virtual space.

286
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,000
I've never heard of that before.

287
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,560
Is there anyone who might know?

288
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,360
Master Yuan Ye.

289
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,840
He's very knowledgeable.

290
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,320
If you can get on his good side,

291
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,440
I think you can get some clues.

292
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,040
How?

293
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,840
How is your painting skill?

294
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
After a fashion.

295
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
That's what I drew.

296
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,800
What, people...

297
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
It's not important, go on.

298
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,240
Master Yuan Ye

299
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,120
probably will test History of Immortals tomorrow.

300
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
I heard that there was a senior student

301
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
who drew an illustration during the exam.

302
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
The picture and its accompanying essay were both excellent.

303
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,320
Master Yuan Ye was very satisfied.

304
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,480
History of Immortals...

305
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,840
Where's my textbook?

306
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,680
Junior Master

307
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,160
Please bless me to be like you,

308
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,040
to be the most famous star in the immoral world,

309
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,680
to be a great hope of a sect.

310
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,760
It was your fame that brought me to Yuhua Sect.

311
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,800
Hopefully in the near future,

312
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,000
I can see you again.

313
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,920
We have a test today,

314
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,320
and the content is

315
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,800
the science of holy beast.

316
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
Wasn't it History of Immortals?

317
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,720
Yeah, why changed?

318
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,960
Each one draws a holy beast,

319
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,640
not limited to textbook.

320
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,880
You can start.

321
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,840
It's over.

322
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
I forgot bringing the textbook.

323
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,240
I don't even have things to copy.

324
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,960
Shi Xia

325
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
Where did you get your school supplies?

326
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,600
A friend gave them to me.

327
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,000
This is a sketch pen,

328
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,480
you can speed up

329
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,760
100 times by using it.

330
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
This is the erasure paper,

331
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,520
it can be reused 100,000 times.

332
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,320
You have a very thoughtful friend.

333
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,600
So amazing.

334
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,480
Master Yuan Ye, excuse me.

335
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,840
I met Junior Master when patrolling the mountain,

336
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,080
he said he was looking for a student

337
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,360
called Shi...

338
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,360
Yes, it's me, it's me, it's me!

339
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,480
It's me, it's me!

340
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,800
You...

341
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,680
Others go on.

342
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,360
Junior Master

343
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Junior Master

344
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,880
Junior Master, Junior Master

345
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,840
Why are you here?

346
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm Yi Yaogua,

347
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,680
the most excellent student of this year.

348
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,200
What can I do for you?

349
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,960
Junior Master truly deserves his reputation,

350
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,760
handsome and charming,

351
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,800
graceful and gentle.

352
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
What classes are you taking these days?

353
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,920
It's no more than the Histories of Immortals,

354
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,520
an introduction to noble families,

355
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,640
a general history of fairy arts,

356
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
the science of charms, instruments and holy beasts,

357
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,400
and spirit maintenance.

358
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,360
Some practicing experience of mine.

359
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,440
God, it's, it's, it's

360
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,080
Junior Master's note!

361
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,600
Take it back and study with your classmates.

362
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
Junior Master is really a prodigy.

363
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,040
If you could teach us for a few days,

364
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,480
I'd die without regret.

365
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,560
Even if you do as Master Yuan Ye,

366
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,040
who said test the History of Immortals,

367
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
but changed to the science of holy beast,

368
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm willing to take your class!

369
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,680
Change the subject at the last minute?

370
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,640
Don't worry,

371
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm knowledgeable,

372
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,440
and I have your note.

373
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,360
It doesn't matter.

374
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,760
I only pity those study slackers.

375
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,240
Study slackers...

376
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,440
Cobras?

377
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,920
Alligators?

378
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,280
Zombies?

379
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,160
May I come in?

380
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,000
Have a seat.

381
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,840
The test is over.

382
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,840
Any volunteer can

383
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,920
show his painting to us?

384
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,800
Master Yuan Ye, I'll go first.

385
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,840
What I drew is called Yong.

386
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,760
It's a bird with a human face,

387
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,640
four eyes

388
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,000
and ears.

389
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,000
Your stroke is exquisite.

390
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,680
The four eyes are just in the right size and arrangement.

391
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,760
So it can...

392
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,800
It can scatter cloud.

393
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,640
So where it is,

394
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
there is a great drought.

395
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,760
Great, it's not in the textbook.

396
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,680
Your knowledge is very good.

397
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,320
Others,

398
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,280
You all have to learn from Yi Yaogua,

399
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,600
not limited to the textbook.

400
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,920
Next,

401
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,600
everyone show the holy beast you have drawn in turn.

402
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,560
I drew a phoenix bird.

403
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,400
Good.

404
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,400
Baize.

405
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,000
Not bad.

406
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,480
The one who is new here,

407
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
what did you draw?

408
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,320
This is a human baby?

409
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,720
This kind of holy beast

410
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,400
is also called "Four-legged gold-spending beast" in my hometown.

411
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,560
It's the most powerful beast in my hometown.

412
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,840
You don't have to take this class anymore.

413
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,120
Please don't, Master!

414
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,840
I need the approval of the elders,

415
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,520
could you give me another chance?

416
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,880
If you can draw one,

417
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,400
I'll eat it.

418
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,240
That's what you said.

419
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,440
Master Yuan Ye temporarily changed test.

420
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
I'm afraid sister that has not prepared for it.

421
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,960
Master

422
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,800
You want to go outside?

423
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,440
Master

424
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,920
I have something that I don't understand

425
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,520
to ask you.

426
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,600
Go ahead.

427
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,840
As the old saying goes,

428
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,440
it is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books.

429
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,040
Whether it's time for me

430
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,280
to travel outside?

431
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,680
I appreciate that

432
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,400
you can think so.

433
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,240
But it is not the right time to go outside.

434
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,520
When you are the Lord of Immortals Alliance,

435
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,920
you'll have many chances to experience the world.

436
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,160
I see.

437
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,920
The new student,

438
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,400
how is your painting?

439
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,040
Big brother, what's that?

440
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,040
This beast is called Sun Wukong.

441
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,240
It is not what you paint carelessly, is it?

442
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,400
Nonsense!

443
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,200
This is a very rare ancient beast.

444
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,040
Master must know it.

445
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,080
The ancient beast is...

446
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,520
Master Yuan Ye

447
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,040
I have been reading extensively since childhood.

448
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,000
Why haven't I seen such a holy beast?

449
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,040
Yi Yaogua

450
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,520
You read extensively?

451
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,760
For Master, that's teaching fish to swim.

452
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,680
There is one or not, Master will make decision on his own.

453
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,480
Well...

454
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,240
Let me help you recall.

455
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,880
Sun Wukong is different from ordinary holy beasts.

456
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,400
It's intelligent but stubborn and obstreperous.

457
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,160
First it got Golden cudgel at the dragon's palace.

458
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,400
Then it drew on the death book in the hell.

459
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
After that, the heaven assigned it to be an official.

460
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
Then it made havoc in heaven,

461
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,360
fighting with 100 thousand of soldiers.

462
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,720
But it was still defeated by the Tathagata,

463
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
and was pressed under five fingers mountain for 500 years.

464
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,760
Yeah, right, I remember.

465
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,280
In the early years,

466
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,040
I used to have it,

467
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,040
which was particular about food and very hard to feed.

468
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,560
It's just a holy beast from unofficial history.

469
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,680
No wonder you didn't obey the basic drawing method

470
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,440
of holy beasts.

471
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,360
I didn't

472
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,160
because it's presented differently.

473
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,720
Master, please wait.

474
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,600
Qing Feng

475
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,640
Please hand me my pen and notebook.

476
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,000
I've never seen painting moving before!

477
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,240
Awesome!

478
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,800
Great! Great!

479
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,760
Shi Xia, you really took me by surprise.

480
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Good, very good!

481
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,160
Go ahead, eat it.

482
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
The whole book is yours.

483
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,840
This new student is really good.

484
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,080
Yeah, I've never seen

485
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,960
this drawing method before.

486
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,880
Little one

487
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,240
Which book did you know Sun Wukong from?

488
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:06,880
Give it to me!

489
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,160
Give it to you? Ok.

490
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,680
Maybe your big brother didn't have enough to eat.

491
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,320
You!

492
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,920
Don't put shame on your face!

493
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,280
Come on,

494
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,000
face is given by others,

495
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,480
but shame is caused by himself.

496
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,720
Let's go.

497
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,880
Stop!

498
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,880
You made a fool of me
in front of so many people.

499
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,040
I won't just let you go!

500
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,880
Feel the power of my magic item!

501
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,640
Master Yuan Ye

502
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,600
Master Yuan...

503
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,440
We've been tricked. Go for them!

504
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,280
Run!

505
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,840
There they are! Go!

506
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,640
Big brother

507
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,080
What?

508
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,840
Isn't this Black-Sun Elixir?

509
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,040
Someone dressed as men!

510
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,360
There's actually something so crazy in Yuhua Sect.

511
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,400
This is a magic butterfly,

512
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,000
which loves to follow women's scent.

513
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,040
Let's go!

514
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,240
What about Little One?

515
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,440
Are you stupid?

516
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,920
Little One

517
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,600
is not crazier than dressing as men!

518
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,960
Butterfly, go!

519
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,720
What's wrong?

520
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,600
God, I lost my Black-Sun Elixir!

521
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,960
It's too late. Let run away first.

522
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,000
Qing Feng, are you all right?

523
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
Shi Xia, go.

524
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,160
The potency of medicine is about to wear off.

525
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,320
They'll catch me soon enough.

526
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,520
No, you're hurt.

527
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,240
I can't leave you!

528
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,360
I'll get you in trouble,

529
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,080
go!

530
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,240
You can use this.

531
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,680
Shi Xia

532
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,680
Shi Xia

533
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,000
Master won't agree with

534
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,920
me going outside now.

535
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,480
What are you doing?

536
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,440
-Get out of my way!  -Go!

537
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
See where she can go!

538
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,360
Go away! Stop chasing me!

539
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,160
Go away!

540
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Go!
