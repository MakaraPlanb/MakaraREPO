00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,000
My Dear Brothers
EP30

2
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,360
Shi Xia

3
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,880
Little did I expect

4
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,440
the one that ended up taking her life

5
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
is you.

6
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,000
A life for a life.

7
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
That's only fair.

8
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
A life for a life?

9
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Then it should have been my life instead.

10
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,680
All mark my words.

11
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,600
I

12
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,760
was the murderer of elder Yuan Gui.

13
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,680
What? It was him.

14
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,520
He was the murderer.

15
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,160
No way.

16
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,640
What's going on?

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,640
That's impossible.

18
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,480
Exactly.

19
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,240
Evidence and witnesses
all proved against his words.

20
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Take none of his nonsense.

21
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
Evidence could be forged,

22
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
and the witnesses are free to lie.

23
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
If you don't believe me,

24
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
I shall show you the truth.

25
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,800
Qiu Li

26
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't make me do it.

27
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,080
Get away.

28
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,120
-It really was him.  -Yeah.

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,200
He was the one who killed elder Yuan Gui.

30
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,280
How could it be?

31
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,480
That image

32
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,600
was forged by this devil woman.

33
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,839
She's trying to fool us.

34
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,800
That was what elder Yuan Gui saw in person.

35
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,480
Nobody can make a counterfeit.

36
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Why is there

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,160
elder Yuan Gui's memory in your eyes?

38
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
You asked me once

39
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,880
how I recovered my sight.

40
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,040
In fact, these new eyes of mine

41
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,080
belonged to Master Yuan Gui.

42
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,880
So, what you saw just now

43
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,480
was the sheer truth.

44
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,560
That is to say,

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,520
elder Yuan Gui was already killed
when he was in Devil Sect.

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,280
Yuan Zhao

47
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
To cover up for your illegitimate son,

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,440
you signed us all up for dirty business.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,320
Such a disregard for justice

50
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
would even be disdained by a devil.

51
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,280
Illegitimate son?

52
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,760
Bi Hong is not an ordinary illegitimate son.

53
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,360
He is my true brother.

54
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,040
Our mother

55
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,840
is the former Immortal Aunt
of the Devil Sect,

56
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Qiu Ya.

57
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
Is he really the son of
that Immortal Aunt of the Devil Sect?

58
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
Really?

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,240
That's impossible.

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
Each one of you here

61
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,640
did your part in hurting Devil Lord.

62
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,960
None of you will walk out of here alive.

63
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,760
Immortal Aunt

64
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,240
Yuan Zhao

65
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
You might have stopped me this time,

66
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
but you can't be there to stop me every time.

67
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
You have my words.

68
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,400
All of you here

69
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,680
will die on my hands

70
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,040
in agony one after another.

71
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,520
Let's go.

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,720
You can't leave yet.

73
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,280
Senior

74
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,120
How dare you stop me?

75
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,640
If you leave here today,

76
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,960
you will have no way back.

77
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,480
You have no right to stop me.

78
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Hou Chi

79
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,120
My greatest regret for life

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,320
was my mercy on you,

81
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,400
which had Shi Xia killed for nothing.

82
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,520
Starting today,

83
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
our friendship

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,280
is just like this umbrella.

85
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
Broken beyond repair.

86
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
I have the blood of devil in me,

87
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,320
so I'm bound to return to Devil Sect.

88
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,440
If anyone stands in my way again,

89
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,039
I will have the world know

90
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
every one of his secrets.

91
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,000
As for what you took from me

92
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,000
and who you gave them to,

93
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,000
you know better than anyone else.

94
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,160
Master

95
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,080
Let's go.

96
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Hold up, Master Yuan.

97
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,480
Yuan Zhao

98
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,080
Today, you and your disciple

99
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,800
have done such a disgraceful deed.

100
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
It shamed us so much in front of Devil Sect.

101
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
If you can't make it up to us,

102
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
we won't let you go.

103
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,520
Master had his fault,

104
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,880
but it was me who did the killing.

105
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,120
If you have to hold a grudge,

106
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,120
it should all be towards me.

107
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Please don't blame my Master.

108
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,800
Well,

109
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,680
how do you want me to repay you?

110
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,480
You had words in secret with Devil Sect.

111
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
That head of the Alliance you trained

112
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,160
no longer fits for his position, then.

113
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,720
The Alliance won't follow such a man.

114
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,080
So, Hou Chi should give up
the seal of the head of the Alliance.

115
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,200
Then we will find someone truly qualified
to take the place.

116
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,320
I should be the only one to blame

117
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
for what happened today.

118
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
I have ruined the reputation
of the Immortal Sect.

119
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,760
I also feel ashamed to carry
the title of the Yuhua Sect owner.

120
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,840
I am willing to give up my position

121
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,400
to make things just.

122
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,440
However,

123
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,520
all matters about the head of the Alliance
should refer to Shen Guan.

124
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,120
We have to report to Shen Guan,

125
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,880
and wait for her decision.

126
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,480
I believe Lord Shen Guan

127
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,640
will make the right decision.

128
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm aware of what happened today.

129
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,520
Hou Chi's position as the head
was what meant to be.

130
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,920
It has nothing to do with sect conflicts.

131
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,320
So Hou Chi should still
be the head of Immortals Alliance.

132
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,240
I'll hear no further discussions.

133
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,600
Hou Chi

134
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
Report to the Celestial Palace
to take up your position tomorrow.

135
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Make no mistakes.

136
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,720
Yes.

137
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,720
I have sent my words back to Yuhua Sect.

138
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,800
The owner of the sect

139
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,440
will be Senior Yuan Ye.

140
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
From now on,

141
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,280
he will be in charge of

142
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,880
everything in Yuhua Sect.

143
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,880
Qing Feng and Yi Yaogua

144
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,240
After I leave,

145
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
the two of you

146
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,040
shall escort Hou Chi to the Celestial Palace

147
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,800
and help him take up his position.

148
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,760
Master, please allow me to quit Yuhua Sect.

149
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,120
Qing Feng

150
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,240
It was just Master's mad word

151
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,120
that he was to expel you.

152
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,120
Don't let it go to your head.

153
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
But I took them seriously.

154
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,280
Many things happened these days.

155
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,600
Some of them troubled me with confusion.

156
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,360
As for the conflict between the Immortals and Devils,
and the gap between right from wrong.

157
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,400
I was confused.

158
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,560
So from now on,

159
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,560
I just wish to go my own way,

160
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
and do my own deed.

161
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,640
Please allow me to quit Yuhua Sect.

162
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,880
In that case,

163
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,080
Master, please allow me

164
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
to follow Qing Feng.

165
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
I am not the owner anymore,

166
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,440
so I have no right to stop you.

167
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,640
You should

168
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,280
make this decision yourselves.

169
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,320
Master, I bid you farewell.

170
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,200
Master Hou Chi, I bid you farewell.

171
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,280
Master, I bid you farewell.

172
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,880
Master Hou Chi

173
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,920
Farewell.

174
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,400
Chi

175
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,480
Master

176
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,720
I must have

177
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,520
let you down.

178
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,360
As your disciple, I'm in no position

179
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,160
to judge your past.

180
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,720
But I have been following your words
ever since I was young.

181
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,480
I believe that

182
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,760
there must be sound reasons behind all your actions.

183
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,120
It will please me much

184
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,000
if Bi Hong gets to be
half as bright as you are.

185
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,160
Senior is kind by nature.

186
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
He was seduced by that devil woman.

187
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,080
That's why he lost himself for the moment.

188
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,520
After I take up my position,

189
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,320
I will help you get him back.

190
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,080
If he is unwilling to return,

191
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,040
just let him be.

192
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
Every one of us had our own path written

193
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,400
when we were born.

194
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,680
And we must go down these paths

195
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,440
throughout our life.

196
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,640
Bi Hong

197
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,880
is destined to be a mortal.

198
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,600
And you are bound to have a high position,

199
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,920
and bring honor to Yuhua Sect.

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,880
It's your Succession Ceremony tomorrow.

201
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,280
I can't be publicly present,

202
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,000
but I'll be there in the shadows.

203
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,720
Chi

204
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,120
No matter what will happens tomorrow,

205
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,640
you must get to the Celestial Palace.

206
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Do not turn back.

207
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,760
Qing Feng

208
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
Why didn't you wait for me?

209
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,960
We are not fellows in the same sect anymore.

210
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,480
So we have no connections at all.

211
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
We're bound to part ways.

212
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,480
Quit dragging along.

213
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,360
You used to kiss me,

214
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,040
we do have connections now.

215
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,760
From now on,

216
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,720
you are my woman.

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,920
We shall hold each other's hands

218
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,360
till death tear us apart.

219
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Shameless fool.

220
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,840
Who would ever stay with you?

221
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,160
Qing Feng

222
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,640
I know the mishaps of your family.

223
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,240
I also know that's why you feel homeless.

224
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,800
But my family has got sufficient wealth.

225
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Wherever you wish to be,

226
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,960
we can go and settle their together.

227
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,520
I don't want your money or houses.

228
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,720
That's not what I meant.

229
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,400
I...

230
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,720
I know you're not a fan of any of that.

231
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
I just want to make you a home.

232
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,119
A warm place for two.

233
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,440
Did I say something wrong again?

234
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
If you dare to kiss me
without consent again,

235
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,760
I will break your legs.

236
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,360
Alright.

237
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,800
I won't kiss you without your consent again.

238
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,200
Only you can kiss me at will.

239
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
So is that a yes?

240
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,560
We've got a long way ahead.

241
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,840
Where should we start?

242
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,600
I want to go to the bottom of the cliff

243
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,680
to find the bodies of Shi Xia and Shi Dong.

244
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,680
They deserved a proper funeral.

245
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
Master Hou Chi

246
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,440
Why did you keep calling him Master?

247
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,120
Hou Chi, since you killed Shi Xia,

248
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,760
I will never forgive you.

249
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,680
Were you looking for Shi Xia?

250
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,760
Follow me.

251
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,160
Shi Xia, Devil Lord

252
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,320
Are they...

253
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,560
Shi Dong is fine.

254
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,440
They are just asleep.

255
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,480
So you have figured a way out for them
since the beginning.

256
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,720
Trapped by the Evil Aura,

257
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,480
I'm no longer that powerful.

258
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,520
If Shi Xia gets into trouble one day,

259
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,400
I might not be there in time.

260
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,560
I hope this ring

261
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
can protect Shi Xia for me.

262
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,120
I'll have to ask you for a favor.

263
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,960
Please hide them well
and take good care of them.

264
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,280
Please don't tell them what happened
while they're asleep.

265
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,600
And please don't tell them that

266
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,280
it was me who saved them.

267
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,560
Since you still love Shi Xia,

268
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,000
why don't you tell her the truth?

269
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,400
Yeah, why not?

270
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,320
Shi Xia loves you so.

271
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,280
You care for each other.

272
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,600
Why do you have to be strangers?

273
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Only if I never meet Shi Xia again

274
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,120
can she be safe all her life.

275
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,600
No.

276
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,720
Where am I?

277
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,360
Did I travel again after I die?

278
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,720
Qing Feng

279
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,720
Shi Xia, you're finally awake.

280
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
Am I still alive?

281
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Of course, you are alive.

282
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,400
Not only you are alive,

283
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,440
Devil Lord is alive, too.

284
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,360
He is right next door.

285
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
We fell that far,

286
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,240
and my brother was stabbed.

287
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,840
How did we manage to survive?

288
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
You and Devil Lord fell
to the bottom of the cliff.

289
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,880
I didn't want your bodies left in the wild,

290
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,840
so Yi Yaogua and I went to look for you.

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
When we got there,

292
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,840
we found you lying there.

293
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,200
Thank goodness you were both alive.

294
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,920
Qing Feng

295
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,520
What would I do without you?

296
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,200
It's fine now.

297
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,720
Everything is over.

298
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,280
By the way,

299
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,160
everyone thinks you and Devil Lord are dead,

300
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,320
so you have to stay here and can't go anywhere

301
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,360
until they forget about this matter.

302
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,280
Okay.

303
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,280
Where exactly are we?

304
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,600
This is...

305
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,880
This is my house in the Otherworld Town,

306
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,160
but soon

307
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,880
it will also be Qing Feng's house.

308
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,680
What's going on with you guys?

309
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,280
Qing Feng and I are no longer

310
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,240
apprentices of Yuhua Sect.

311
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
She is the new owner of Qingcheng Sect,

312
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,360
while I am her fiancé.

313
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,320
All the houses of my family

314
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,160
will become the territory of Qingcheng Sect.

315
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
You guys made quite the progress

316
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,640
while I was asleep.

317
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,000
When's the wedding?

318
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,480
Don't listen to him.

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,640
I haven't even said yes yet.

320
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,760
I've prepared her dowry.

321
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
It'll happen soon.

322
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,800
I want to see my brother, Shi Dong.

323
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,960
His room is across from yours.

324
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,400
Was it wrong to

325
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,400
hide it from her like this?

326
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,680
I think we should tell her the truth.

327
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,600
No.

328
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,560
Things happened these days

329
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,320
are enough to prove

330
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,920
Yuan Zhao's determination to kill Shi Xia.

331
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,400
If we choose to tell her the truth now,

332
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,560
we would ruin Master Hou Chi's efforts.

333
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,080
Ow ow owie.

334
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,040
It hurts. Be gentle.

335
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,680
It was you who stabbed him first.

336
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,880
He only fought back.

337
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,120
My silly sister.

338
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,520
He meant to kill me,

339
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,000
and you are still on his side.

340
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
Quit mumbling.

341
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,840
The moment he decided to kill us,

342
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,080
my love for him was totally gone.

343
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,080
Since I have paid all that's due,

344
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,320
his life

345
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,120
matters to me no more.

346
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,360
Then why are you still wearing this ring

347
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,240
he gave you?

348
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,880
I just forgot to take it off.

349
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,120
Just throw it away for me.

350
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,280
Even when I sleep, it's harsh to my skin.

351
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,520
I put all the scenery in the yard

352
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,080
into this snow globe.

353
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,960
If you ever feel homesick,

354
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,360
just take a look at it.

355
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,320
What about you? Are you also in it?

356
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,560
Seasons may go by,

357
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
but in this snow globe

358
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,600
it's always summer.

359
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
(You said you liked trees,)

360
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,720
(so I made you a ring of leaves,)

361
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,680
(not sure if you like it.)

362
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,520
The liquor has already gone.

363
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,080
Never mind.

364
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I have another pot.

365
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,400
Hou Chi

366
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,680
Why don't you trust me?

367
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,440
(Why she is drinking again?)

368
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,280
Even if you have taken
the Love-forgetting Potion,

369
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,560
you should have believed in me.

370
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,840
Do I look like a bad guy?

371
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,400
The cliff was that high.

372
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,680
If I were not so lucky,

373
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,440
I would have died for good.

374
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,080
Hou Chi

375
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,680
You are the coldest, hardest

376
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,480
and the most stupid
piece of log in this world.

377
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,200
You know nothing about love.

378
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,920
Now listen up.

379
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,200
My next boyfriend

380
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
is sweet, gentle, and considerate.

381
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,680
He's taller and finer than you, too.

382
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,160
I will get myself a boyfriend here,

383
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,360
and I'll get another one as I go home.

384
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
Just wait and see.

385
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,640
However merciless you are to me,

386
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,120
I can't forget your love on my part.

387
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
Even without me,

388
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,040
you are still the brightest star
in the night sky.

389
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,640
Tomorrow
you'll enjoy the highlight of your life.

390
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,960
I hope whatever the Celestial Seal foretold

391
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,280
never comes true.

392
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,920
What you miss at day

393
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,000
what you dream at night.

394
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,240
It feels just like the real thing.

395
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,720
The liquor of the rich sure is something.

396
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,040
(Is she sleepwalking?)

397
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,800
Shi Xia

398
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,320
He can even talk.

399
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
(If she wakes up in shock,)

400
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,200
(this will be hard to explain.)

401
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,160
I won't let you get away

402
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
in my own dream.

403
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,000
It's just a dream after all.

404
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,640
I can do whatever I want.
