My Dear Brothers
EP02

2
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,880
I allow you to stay with me.

3
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,400
(Is he acting a domineering boss?)

4
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,320
Immortal,

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
I think you may misunderstand,

6
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm here by accident.

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,520
I don't want to stay here.

8
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,240
I want to go home.

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,960
Go home?

10
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,800
What for?

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,040
A lot of things.

12
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,040
Go to school, do part-time job,

13
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
take exams, do internship,

14
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,960
play games, play with mobile phones,

15
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,200
eat snacks, and watch variety shows.

16
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Don't you visit your brother?

17
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,800
He...

18
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,600
He's disappeared.

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,000
It doesn't matter.

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,400
Anyway, he's disappeared,

21
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,000
and I feel more free.

22
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,400
There is no one in this world

23
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,800
who will stay with another forever.

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,920
Isn't a brother supposed to protect his sister?

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,200
It used to be.

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,200
Stay here. I'll protect you.

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,760
Junior

28
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,760
Junior

29
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,320
Is there another immortal?

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,760
Hide yourself.

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,160
You can't be seen by him.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,480
(Hide?)

33
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,640
(What a good chance for me to escape!)

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,920
(I won't just hide.)

35
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
Senior, what do you want me to do?

36
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,600
I haven't seen you for just one day,

37
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
your yard has got a wall.

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
And beautiful flowers.

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,160
It's a new method of practicing.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,840
You yard

41
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,440
hasn't changed for about 200 years.

42
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,560
Today's change

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
is interesting.

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,440
Senior, if you have something to tell me, just say it here.

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,120
No.

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm talking business with you today.

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,200
I am here today

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
to deworm for you.

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,360
There is no worm here.

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,320
It used to be none.

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,720
But now there are flowers and grass,

52
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,360
they will cause worms.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,960
I remember you were afraid of worms most
when you were young.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,680
Senior

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,000
Senior, I can do it myself.

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
I can help.

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,600
This brother looks very kind.

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,120
(It seems that his secret)

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,760
(is behind him.)

60
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,200
Sprinkle some in the room.

61
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,000
Senior

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,840
Wait.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,920
Bro

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,240
What is that?

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,480
Dude

66
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,200
Can't you see me?

67
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,840
This is illegal imprison.

68
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,680
You are such a jerk knowing enchantments.

69
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
Jerk?

70
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
What is jerk?

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
The change of the clouds.

72
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,160
The spirit of the flowers and grass.

73
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,840
The rug of the mountains and the waves of the sea.

74
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,200
They are all the same with the journey to immortality.

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
This is what I learned from my recent practice.

76
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,640
It seems that you were concentrating on practicing.

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
But you're not experienced.

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
In your flowers,

79
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,880
most of them are female,
which are easy to attract insects.

80
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Are the flowers divided into male and female?

81
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,360
Of course.

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
Everything in this world has yin and yang.

83
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,680
Do you know

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
why there's no female in Yuhua Sect?

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
The Master said

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
it's for calmness.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,160
Females are like the female flowers in your yard.

88
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
There is

89
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,760
a strange breath all around her.

90
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
But in our Yuhua Sect,

91
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,960
we pursue the calmness.

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
The feminine breath is regarded as

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,600
the biggest culprit that disrupts practice.

94
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,000
What kind of absurd rules are these?

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,440
100 years ago,

96
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,320
there was a female who wanted to study from a master,

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
so she came to the ward at the foot of Mount Yuhua.

98
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,600
As a result, she was found by the owner,

99
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,360
and was sentenced to ten firewhips.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Okay, it's getting late.

101
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,280
I'll go back first.

102
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
It seems that

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,920
it is impossible for me to go back on my own.

104
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
But I can't be stuck here either.

105
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,320
I have to take the exams, do the internship,

106
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,600
and elect for the chairman of the Student Union.

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
And I also have to find my brother.

108
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,080
If my brother goes home but can't find me,

109
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,120
how anxious he would be!

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,440
(This Immortal is a super scholar,)

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
(he can send me back with the spells.)

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,520
(But, will he do that?)

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Stay here. I'll protect you.

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,600
(That man,)

115
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,200
(he's weird with a bit of sincerity.)

116
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,560
(It's unpredictable.)

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,280
(How can I persuade him to send me back?)

118
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
I have a stomachache.

119
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,840
I must be poisoned.

120
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,880
Maybe I ate insecticide accidentally.

121
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,120
Help!

122
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,920
Take me down the mountain.

123
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,200
Take me to the hospital.

124
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,400
It doesn't matter.

125
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
Here is a detoxification pill made by my Senior.

126
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,560
It's so bitter.

127
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,800
Immortal, you've been lived alone for so long,

128
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,239
you must feel bored.

129
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,639
Let's play a game.

130
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,640
Okay.

131
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,719
You promised?

132
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,920
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

133
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,560
The winner can make a request,

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
and the one who lose is not allowed to refuse.

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,600
Okay.

136
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
(This is my strong suit.)

137
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
(Shi Dong never beat me once.)

138
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
The rules are like this.

139
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Let's start.

140
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
Rock, paper, scissors.

141
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
Best two out of three.

142
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

143
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,720
Best three out of five.

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

145
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Paper, paper, paper.

146
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
Paper, paper, paper.

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,800
Best 53 out of 53.

148
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,000
You win.

149
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
My request is...

150
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,320
No excessive request.

151
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,440
No embarrassed request.

152
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
No request of violating the law or discipline.

153
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,960
No request for infringement of privacy.

154
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
I just want to know

155
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,600
how your brother protects you.

156
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
(Is it a request?)

157
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,960
(He's so different.)

158
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,240
My brother,

159
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
he was an unlearned liar.

160
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,760
He could do nothing except playing games.

161
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,280
And he was good at fighting and getting into troubles.

162
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,840
He often spent all of our pocket money.

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,200
Then he asked me to pretend
I'm poor in front of the shop owner,

164
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,280
saying that I was an orphan,

165
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,560
and asked them to free of charge.

166
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,440
Before he dropped out of school,

167
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,840
every time he failed the exams,

168
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
he made me to ask our uncle and aunt to sign for him.

169
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,600
And,

170
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
he violently beat all the boys around me

171
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,560
who treated me nice.

172
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,600
He blocked all my love affairs.

173
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,840
He often went to Internet bars all night.

174
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,800
If it weren't for

175
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
that he would cook a few dishes,

176
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,640
he could tell a few bedtime stories,

177
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,640
and the baby doll

178
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
who accompanied me from childhood to adulthood,

179
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,760
I wouldn't bother to care about him.

180
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I have said so much,

181
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,240
do you understand?

182
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,000
Cook,

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,320
bedtime stories,

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,480
and the doll.

185
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,240
There must be

186
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,200
a lot of ingredients left

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,640
by your Senior in that basket.

188
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,640
Junior, I'm so sorry.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,920
I left the food container at your place accidentally.

190
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,400
You can handle it for me.

191
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,680
Friendly reminder,

192
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
there is the best pork belly in it,

193
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
and it is suitable to be made into
Braised Pork in Brown Sauce.

194
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,360
Hold on, Shi Xia.

195
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,080
I can do it.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,680
I'm not hungry.

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,240
I'm not hungry.

198
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
What is this smell?

199
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,880
It is on fire!

200
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,960
Awful food?

201
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,120
Have a try.

202
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,480
It doesn't matter.

203
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,800
My master said

204
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,920
practice makes perfect.

205
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,760
Immortal, I believe you will be successful

206
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,520
if you practice repeatedly.

207
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,280
But I may not be able to live until that day.

208
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,880
Put out the fire by yourself.

209
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,000
Fortunately, there are two packs of instant noodles,

210
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
they really saved my life.

211
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,880
(The stupid guy.)

212
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,320
(I guess I can't count on him.)

213
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
(If the enchantments can bring me home,)

214
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,040
(then I can learn it.)

215
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
(I failed in cooking.)

216
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,040
(Is it because)

217
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,880
(I didn't get the method about how to use a sister?)

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,520
Senior

219
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,120
Please come to my place.

220
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,440
Junior

221
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,320
About girls,

222
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,560
it is complicated.

223
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,880
I must teach you in person.

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,960
Let me in and talk to you.

225
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,760
No need, Senior.

226
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,280
Just teach me here.

227
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,120
Do you want to know

228
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,040
how to make girls adore you?

229
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Listen to you?

230
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,520
You are asking the right person.

231
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
I have some experience in this area.

232
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,920
To get a girl,

233
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
it takes three steps.

234
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,280
First,

235
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,120
establish your own glorious image.

236
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,440
Describe yourself

237
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,360
as outstanding as you can.

238
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,160
Girls have a mentality to worship the strong.

239
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,520
They can't resist the strong.

240
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,480
Second, showing your weakness.

241
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Shape yourself a man

242
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,520
lonely and lack of love.

243
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,400
Girls have motherhood,

244
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,320
so they can't help caring about you.

245
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,520
Third, response to her every request.

246
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,160
Let every aspect of her life

247
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,040
has your traces.

248
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,920
Clear?

249
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm back to life.

250
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,920
Immortal

251
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,120
Have a try.

252
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,520
No, thanks.

253
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,840
I don't need to eat since I was born.

254
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,960
200 years?

255
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,120
Haven't you eaten a bite?

256
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,400
Your life has lost a lot of fun.

257
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,760
My master said

258
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,680
that was a lack of troubles.

259
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,440
Making you practice all day and not letting you eat,

260
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,800
did your master treat you as a human?

261
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Don't speak ill of my master.

262
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
Immortal, if...

263
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,000
I mean, if

264
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,040
I want to learn some enchantments of the Yuhua Sect,

265
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,720
like something that can open the ward.

266
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,000
Is it possible?

267
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,080
Maybe there's a chance,

268
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,840
but it will be difficult.

269
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,120
To get a girl,

270
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,720
you have to establish your own glorious image.

271
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Let her worship you.

272
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,080
The Yuhua Sect has been established
for more than 2,000 years.

273
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,720
With the purpose of eliminating demons

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,480
and defending the way and supporting justice,

275
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
it has stood proudly in the world.

276
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,040
Five leaders of the Immortals Alliance were from here,

277
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,160
and it was known as the leader of all the Sects.

278
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,120
The enchantments of our Sect is broad and profound,

279
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
and it is difficult for ordinary people to get its essence.

280
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,760
(Just a recitation of the school motto,)

281
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960
(do you need to act like that?)

282
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
Do you have anything that can't be understood?

283
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,200
Immortal

284
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm also a straight A student in my hometown,

285
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,960
can you try to teach me a little?

286
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,199
Eh...

287
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,800
What I practice is the superior enchantments

288
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,320
participating in the election of the leader
of the Immortals Alliance.

289
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,200
It doesn't suitable for you.

290
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,440
The head of the Immortals Alliance, terrific.

291
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,680
It is true.

292
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,520
The head of the Immortals Alliance

293
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,720
is the supreme honor of the Sects.

294
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,680
A general election is held about every 200 years,

295
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,200
and the selected person
can enter the Otherworld Array,

296
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,840
to become a real immortal.

297
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,160
The latest general election is in this year.

298
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,920
If there's no accident,

299
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
the selected person will be in Yuhua Sect again.

300
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,640
It will be

301
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,720
me.

302
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,440
Immortal,
you are really not humble.

303
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,960
What is humble?

304
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,480
Humble is

305
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
like what you do.

306
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,920
Speak out your excellence

307
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,200
without reservation.

308
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,000
(She also thinks I am excellent.)

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
(She admires me.)

310
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,200
Immortal

311
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,120
Do you have some textbooks here?

312
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
Books.

313
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,120
There's a lot in the attic.

314
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,200
Okay, I'll learn by myself.

315
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
What? Hou Chi suddenly stopped inedia?

316
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,960
He caught the cold and took medicine?

317
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,400
According to our observation in the past few days,

318
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,000
it seems like this.

319
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,440
I will ask him personally.

320
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,920
The owner is out.

321
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,840
Junior

322
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,120
Greetings, The owner.

323
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,640
Greetings!

324
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
What happened to Hou Chi?

325
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,320
Don't worry.

326
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,520
Hou Chi is your direct apprentice,

327
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,200
he had been outstanding since childhood.

328
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,320
It doesn't matter to have some changes.

329
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,840
Besides, it's less than a month
before the primary election

330
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,920
of the head of the Immortals Alliance,
we can't mess ourselves up.

331
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,760
It matters to the election,
it's better to find out what happened.

332
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,400
We can ask Bi Hong about that. They are close.

333
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
Ask Bi Hong to come to the hall.

334
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,240
I'm Bi Hong, the disciple of Yuhua,

335
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,560
pay my respect to Masters,

336
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
and The owner.

337
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,400
Bi Hong, do you see anything strange about Hou Chi lately?

338
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,320
Junior told me that he is trying

339
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
a new practice method recently.

340
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,680
A new practice method?

341
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,600
Did you ask him what the practice method is?

342
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,840
Junior is the hope of our entire Yuhua Sect.

343
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,400
What qualifications do I have to intervene him?

344
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
According to your understanding about him,

345
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,720
you should be clear.

346
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
He has been practicing hard for 200 years,

347
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
and has never stepped out of the yard.

348
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
He only wanted to be the head
of the Immortals Alliance,

349
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,680
and did not think about other things.

350
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,280
I don't think it's necessary for you

351
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,120
to worry about him.

352
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,800
That's it.

353
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
The Yuhua Nine Layers of Hou Chi

354
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
has already cultivated to the eighth layers.

355
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,760
If he practices intensively,

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,000
he is very likely to break through to the ninth level

357
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,600
before the election.

358
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,040
What Yuan Gui said is right.

359
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
Then I understand.

360
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,080
Hou Chi chose the new practice method just

361
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,080
for making the breakthrough.

362
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,400
Junior, let him do that.

363
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,120
You may be excused now.

364
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,160
Take care of Hou Chi these days.

365
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,280
If you see anything strange,
report it immediately.

366
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,800
What else do you want to say?

367
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,040
Every time you called me in the past 200 years,

368
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
you just ask about Hou Chi.

369
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,560
Don't you have anything to ask about me?

370
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Junior, that is your fault.

371
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,280
You should care more about Bi Hong.

372
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
After all, you two are father and son.

373
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,440
If you talk to him more,

374
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,520
he won't run down the mountain too much

375
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,240
to dispel loneliness.

376
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,320
A person without the immortal perception,

377
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,880
let him do whatever he wants.

378
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,240
Why should I bother in vain?

379
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,040
Masters

380
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,840
I don't know if I should say it or not.

381
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Say it.

382
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,920
We heard that the Devil Sect was spreading around,

383
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,480
saying that the Junior Master
was defeated by the Devil Lord.

384
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
And the head of the Immortals Alliance
this year must be the Devil Lord.

385
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,400
How could it be?

386
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,640
Hou Chi hasn't even been out of his yard,

387
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,000
how could he be defeated by the Devil Lord?

388
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,200
You descend the mountain quickly to find out
the truth of what the Devil Sect said.

389
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:32,920
Okay.

390
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,520
Senior Yuan Ye

391
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,400
Strengthen all the wards in Mount Yuhua.

392
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,440
Yes.

393
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,080
Yes, Master.

394
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,320
The enchantment about how to
speed across the sky.

395
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,280
The enchantment about how to drive the sword.

396
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,400
The enchantment about space-time reversal.

397
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,640
After learning this,
I could be able to open the ward.

398
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,800
I want to read book.

399
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,680
I want this one.

400
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,320
(I made a breakthrough today.)

401
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,680
(Could it be that the sister played a role?)

402
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,080
(I still need to work harder.)

403
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,000
Step forward with your right foot,
bend your knees into a right lunge.

404
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,520
Make a fist with your right hand
and raise it to the upper front.

405
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,240
Isn't this just military physical boxing?

406
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,360
It's already the ninth layers. Why...

407
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,200
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space.

408
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,720
After you learned this enchantment,

409
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,200
you can walk freely between time and space.

410
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,040
It wouldn't be limited by the past and the future.

411
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,040
This enchantment is exquisite and profound,

412
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,200
it is the highest secret enchantment,

413
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
and it can not be recorded here.

414
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,840
It's already a quarter to ten.

415
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,080
You have to go to bed.

416
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,640
Got it.

417
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,440
It really is the healthiest daily schedule.

418
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,160
Immortal

419
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,160
Don't be too stingy.

420
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
I can't sleep with the light off.

421
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,440
What do you want to do?

422
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,880
Stay away from me.

423
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,520
Stay there.

424
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,880
Didn't you say that

425
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,920
your brother told you the bedtime stories?

426
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,640
I can also do it.

427
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,360
On the coast of the East Sea,

428
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,680
there is an eighth-level Yulin beast.

429
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
It is huge and 32 feet tall.

430
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,640
The passing friars were all killed by it.

431
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,080
And then?

432
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
It died.

433
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,360
How?

434
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
My master led it to this yard,

435
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,400
and a righteous cultivator with the same name as me

436
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
killed it.

437
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,800
That's all?

438
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,280
What do you think?

439
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,720
The ending is a little hasty.

440
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,560
I know you haven't heard enough.

441
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,600
I'll tell you one more.

442
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,320
There was a devil cultivator in Yulin City.

443
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,360
He specialized in grasping the souls of living people,

444
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
practicing thousands ghost flags
to improve his cultivation.

445
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,040
There were countless ghosts died in his hands.

446
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,440
And then?

447
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,040
My master led him to this yard,

448
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,800
and a righteous cultivator with the same name as me

449
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,880
killed him.

450
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,760
You want to listen more?

451
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,200
I'll tell you one more.

452
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,120
There was once a traitor in Jiyue Sect.

453
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,680
He practiced sorcery, fell into the devil way,

454
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,760
and killed his masters.

455
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,280
And my master...

456
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,120
Led him into this yard,

457
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,560
and a righteous cultivator with the same name as you

458
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,520
killed him.

459
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,520
How did you know?

460
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,440
After all,

461
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,600
they were all killed by you.

462
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,200
These are all small matters, not worth mentioning.

463
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,680
Just one day, I have made great progress.

464
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,160
Sister is really extraordinary.

465
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,480
What kind of protection do you need?

466
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,320
Protection?

467
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,120
Don't be silly.

468
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,840
Do you know what protection is?

469
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,000
It's really not easy to protect one person.

470
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,120
I just want to get a good sleep.

471
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,320
Please don't bother me.

472
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,320
(Although she has no requirements,)

473
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,320
(I still need to work hard.)

474
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,600
The owner

475
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,840
I went down the mountain these days and found

476
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,520
that the Devil Sect was spreading rumors

477
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,120
about the Devil Lord defeated the Junior Master.

478
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,720
They also printed the process of battle

479
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
on the booklet.

480
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,400
There are also the picture version
for the people who don't know words.

481
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,840
I heard

482
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,560
that the Devil Lord is rehearsing a show.

483
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,320
And it will be touring around before

484
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,600
the selection of the leader of the Immortals Alliance.

485
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
What do people under the mountain say?

486
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Be honest.

487
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,720
They said that

488
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
this is the first time that the Devil Sect

489
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,600
has joined in the selection in the 2,000 years.

490
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,840
And they defeated the Junior Master who is well-expected.

491
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,600
They thought that

492
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,080
it's fate.

493
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,080
Leave me alone.

494
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,680
Alright.

495
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,240
It is not so great to use the enchantments to make it.

496
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:29,840
Here you are.

497
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,560
What kind of ghost is it?

498
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,640
Have you seen the ghosts?

499
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,320
Didn't I see him every day these two days?

500
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,240
Don't worry. This doll will accompany you from now on.

501
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,840
This doll?

502
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,960
I will have nightmares with it.

503
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,640
I don't like it.

504
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
Why does she get angry?

505
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,040
Junior Master, The owner is coming.

506
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,440
The Leading Master

507
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Is it the man

508
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
who whips others?

509
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,200
Hide yourself.

510
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,840
Okay, I will hide well.

511
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,600
Don't let your master come in.

512
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,879
Master

513
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,440
I wanted to see you

514
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,439
as soon as I stopped the closed-door practice.

515
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,920
What do you do recently?

516
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,919
Everything is fine.

517
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,200
Such a big problem, how long are you

518
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,040
going to hide about it?

519
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,640
(Oh, no. Master found the girl.)

520
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
Master, please listen to me.

521
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,119
It's the fact.

522
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,640
You don't need to explain.

523
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,360
I broke the rules,

524
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,800
and I should be punished without any complaint.

525
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,520
But, she's (he) not a bad guy.

526
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,240
The Devil Lord secretly attacked you without moral,

527
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,040
and you still thought that he is a good guy?

528
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,320
The Devil Lord?

529
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,880
It scared me.

530
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,960
I heard that

531
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,720
you are not doing inedia recently,

532
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,080
and got a cold.

533
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,720
Were you hurt badly by him?

534
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm fine.

535
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,440
It was because I distracted for a while,

536
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,760
and then got into the Devil Lord's trap.

537
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,680
Go into the house,

538
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,400
let me see your injury.

539
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,360
(What? He wants to come in?)

540
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,720
Master, let's go to the Holy tree.

541
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,720
(The expression of his Master)

542
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,880
(is like a roller coaster.)

543
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,040
( My heart nearly stopped beating.)

544
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,000
It's just a little injury, don't need to bother you.

545
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,280
Concentrate and calm your mind, put your heart and power together.

546
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,800
Master

547
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,680
You lost

548
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,120
a lot of Holy Power to heal me.

549
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,960
It doesn't matter.

550
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
Your heart was hurt by the Devil Lord,

551
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,240
so the wound would not heal for a long time.

552
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,680
I am worried that this

553
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,560
will affect the election.

554
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,080
Chi

555
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,520
You are the only hope of our Yuhua Sect.

556
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,560
You must be careful.

557
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,480
I won't slight it.

558
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,120
These vines

559
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,920
were made for you by Bi Hong, right?

560
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,920
What a fool!

561
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,240
He just loves to care for these flowers and plants,

562
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
and attracts the attention of women.

563
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,360
It's not my Senior.

564
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,720
You don't have to speak for him.

565
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,320
Chi

566
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
When I was in the closed-door practice,

567
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,120
I got something new.

568
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,960
Let's swap our ideas about it.

569
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,680
Listening to the conversation between him and his master,

570
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,560
he is like a pure

571
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,440
and unpretentious practicing machine.

572
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,360
Did I really misunderstand him?

573
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,000
Why should I care so much?

574
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,320
Get me out.

575
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,720
Get me out.

576
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,520
Get me out.

577
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,240
Get me out!

578
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,480
Brother!

579
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,720
Sorry.

580
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,560
I had a nightmare.

581
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,000
It doesn't matter.

582
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,040
Did your master punish you because of me?

583
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,760
That's me disappointed them.

584
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,040
You are pitiful.

585
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
200 years,

586
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,960
you just know about the practice.

587
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,560
You're like a machine.

588
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,680
The sorrow of a super scholar.

589
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,720
Quality education has a long way to go.

590
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,880
Wait me for a while.

591
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,680
This is for you.

592
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,920
For me?

593
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,560
The second place in the exam can also be rewarded.

594
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,720
Let me tell you.

595
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,800
Squeeze it when you feel stressed.

596
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,800
It can help you release your pressure.

597
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,000
And you can also eat it.

598
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,800
So perfect.

599
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,160
This object is not recorded in the books.

600
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,600
This is my gift for you.

601
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,160
Isn't it the first time

602
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,600
you have received a gift from someone else?

603
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,680
Can I give you a gift, too?

604
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
What do you want to give to me?

605
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,040
Is there anything you want to do,

606
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,920
but your brother never did it for you?

607
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,520
Yes.

608
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,520
What is that?

609
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,720
The Ferris wheel.

610
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,120
The Ferris wheel?

611
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,600
The Ferris wheel can lift people

612
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,720
from the ground to a very high altitude,

613
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,320
and you can overlook the panoramic view of the entire scenic spot.

614
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,720
So easy.

615
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,080
Let's go.

616
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,920
Why do you bring me here?

617
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,560
Immortal

618
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,240
What is that for?

619
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,560
It might be the Yuhua College.

620
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,640
It might be?

621
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,800
Haven't you been there before?

622
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,320
My master said

623
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,720
that is a training place for ordinary cultivators.

624
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,920
It's not suitable for me.

625
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,200
What I practice is different from theirs.

626
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,800
What are the differences?

627
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,560
We should go back.

628
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,400
What are you doing?

629
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,800
Let me go.

630
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,600
Miss

631
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,600
I have something to ask you.

632
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,000
Is he going to confess?

633
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,280
Can I be...
