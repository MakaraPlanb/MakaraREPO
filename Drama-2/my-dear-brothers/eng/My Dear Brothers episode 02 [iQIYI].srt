My Dear Brothers
EP02

2
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,759
I allow you to stay with me.

3
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
(Is he acting a domineering president?)

4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,200
Immortal,

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,039
I think you may misunderstand,

6
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm here by accident.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
I don't want to stay here.

8
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,120
I want to go home.

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,840
Go home?

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,680
What for?

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,920
A lot of things.

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,920
Go to school, do part-time job,

13
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,199
take exams, do internship,

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,840
play games, play with mobile phones,

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,080
eat snacks, and watch variety shows.

16
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,840
Don't you visit your brother?

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,680
He...

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
He's disappeared.

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,880
It doesn't matter.

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,280
Anyway, he's disappeared,

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,880
and I feel more free.

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,280
There is no one in this world

23
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,680
who will stay with another forever.

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Isn't a brother supposed to protect his sister?

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,079
It used to be.

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,079
Stay here. I'll protect you.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,640
Junior

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,640
Junior

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,200
Is there another immortal?

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Hide yourself.

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,040
You can't be seen by him.

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,360
(Hide?)

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520
(What a good chance for me to escape!)

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
(I won't just hide.)

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,440
Senior, what do you want me to do?

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,480
I haven't seen you for just one day,

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,240
your yard has got a wall.

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
And beautiful flowers.

39
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,040
It's a new method of practicing.

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,720
You yard

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,320
hasn't changed for about 200 years.

42
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,440
Today's change

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
is interesting.

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Senior, if you have something to tell me, just say it here.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,000
No.

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,120
I'm talking business with you today.

47
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,079
I am here today

48
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,720
to deworm for you.

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
There is no worm here.

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,200
It used to be none.

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,600
But now there are flowers and grass,

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,240
they will cause worms.

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
I remember you were afraid of worms most
when you were young.

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,560
Senior

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,880
Senior, I can do it myself.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,600
I can help.

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,480
This brother looks very kind.

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,000
(It seems that his secret)

59
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,640
(is behind him.)

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,080
Sprinkle some in the room.

61
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,880
Senior

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,720
Wait.

63
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Bro

64
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,120
What is that?

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,360
Dude

66
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,080
Can't you see me?

67
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
This is illegal imprison.

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,560
You are such a j*rk knowing enchantments.

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,560
J*rk?

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440
What is j*rk?

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,560
The change of the clouds.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
The spirit of the flowers and grass.

73
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,720
The rug of the mountains
and the waves of the sea.

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,080
They are all the same
with the journey to immortality.

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,120
This is what I learned from my recent practice.

76
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,520
It seems that you were concentrating on practicing.

77
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
But you're not experienced.

78
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
In your flowers,

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,760
most of them are female,
which are easy to attract insects.

80
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,560
Are the flowers divided into male and female?

81
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,240
Of course.

82
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,000
Everything in this world has yin and yang.

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,560
Do you know

84
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,480
why there's no female in Yuhua Sect?

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
The Master said

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
it's for calmness.

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,040
Females are like the female flowers in your yard.

88
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,640
There is

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,640
a strange breath all around her.

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
But in our Yuhua Sect,

91
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,840
we pursue the calmness.

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,840
The feminine breath is regarded as

93
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,480
the biggest culprit that disrupts practice.

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,880
What kind of absurd rules are these?

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,320
100 years ago,

96
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
there was a female who wanted to study from a master,

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
so she came to the ward at the foot of Mount Yuhua.

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,480
As a result, she was found by The owner,

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,240
and was sentenced to ten firewhips.

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Okay, it's getting late.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,159
I'll go back first.

102
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,000
It seems that

103
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,800
it is impossible for me to go back on my own.

104
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
But I can't be stuck here either.

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,200
I have to take the exams, do the internship,

106
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
and elect for the chairman of the Student Union.

107
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,480
And I also have to find my brother.

108
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,960
If my brother goes home but can't find me,

109
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,000
how anxious he would be!

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,320
(This Immortal is a super scholar,)

111
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
(he can send me back with the spells.)

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,400
(But, will he do that?)

113
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,800
Stay here. I'll protect you.

114
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,480
(That man,)

115
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,080
(he's weird with a bit of sincerity.)

116
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,440
(It's unfathomable.)

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,159
(How can I persuade him to send me back?)

118
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
I have a stomachache.

119
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
I must be poisoned.

120
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
Maybe I ate insecticide accidentally.

121
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,000
Help!

122
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
Take me down the mountain.

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,080
Take me to the hospital.

124
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,280
It doesn't matter.

125
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
Here is a detoxification pill made
by my Senior.

126
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,440
It's so bitter.

127
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,680
Immortal, you've been lived alone for so long,

128
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
you must feel bored.

129
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Let's play a game.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,520
Okay.

131
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,600
You promised?

132
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,799
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

133
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
The winner can make a request,

134
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,760
and the one who lose is not allowed to refuse.

135
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,480
Okay.

136
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,640
(This is my strong point.)

137
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,320
(Shi Dong never beat me once.)

138
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,840
The rules are like this.

139
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,840
Let's start.

140
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,120
Rock, paper, scissors.

141
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,600
Best two out of three.

142
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,560
Rock, paper, scissors.

143
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,600
Best three out of five.

144
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,280
Rock, paper, scissors.

145
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Paper, paper, paper.

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,920
Paper, paper, paper.

147
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
Best 53 out of 53.

148
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,880
You win.

149
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,840
My request is...

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,200
No excessive request.

151
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,320
No embarrassed request.

152
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
No request of violating the law or discipline.

153
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,840
No request for infringement of privacy.

154
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
I just want to know

155
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,480
how your brother protects you.

156
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,320
(Is it a request?)

157
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,840
(He's so different.)

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
My brother,

159
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,960
he was an unlearned liar.

160
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,640
He could do nothing except playing games.

161
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
And he was good at fighting and getting into troubles.

162
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,720
He often spent all of our pocket money.

163
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,080
Then he asked me to pretend
I'm poor in front of the shop owner,

164
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,160
saying that I was an orphan,

165
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,440
and asked them to free of charge.

166
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,320
Before he dropped out of school,

167
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,720
every time he failed the exams,

168
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
he made me to ask our uncle and aunt to sign for him.

169
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,480
And,

170
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,320
he violently beat all the boys around me

171
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
who treated me nice.

172
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,480
He blocked all my love affairs.

173
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,720
He often went to Internet bars all night.

174
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,680
If it weren't for

175
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,200
that he would cook a few dishes,

176
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,520
he could tell a few bedtime stories,

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,520
and the baby doll

178
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,520
who accompanied me from childhood to adulthood,

179
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,640
I wouldn't bother to care about him.

180
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
I have said so much,

181
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
do you understand?

182
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,880
Cook,

183
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,200
bedtime stories,

184
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,360
and the doll.

185
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,120
There must be

186
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,080
a lot of ingredients left

187
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
by your Senior in that basket.

188
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,520
Junior, I'm so sorry.

189
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,800
I left the food container at your place accidentally.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
You can handle it for me.

191
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,560
Friendly reminder,

192
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,280
there is the best pork belly in it,

193
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,440
and it is suitable to be made into
Braised Pork in Brown Sauce.

194
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,240
Hold on, Shi Xia.

195
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,960
I can do it.

196
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm not hungry.

197
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm not hungry.

198
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
What is this smell?

199
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,760
It is on fire!

200
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,840
Awful cuisine?

201
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,000
Have a try.

202
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,360
It doesn't matter.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,680
My master said

204
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,800
practice makes perfect.

205
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,640
Immortal, I believe you will be successful

206
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,400
if you practice repeatedly.

207
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,160
But I may not be able to live until that day.

208
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,760
Put out the fire by yourself.

209
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
Fortunately, there are two packs of instant noodles,

210
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,600
they really saved my life.

211
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,760
(The stupid guy.)

212
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,200
(I guess I can't count on him.)

213
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,120
(If the enchantments can bring me home,)

214
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,920
(then I can learn it.)

215
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,200
(I failed in cooking.)

216
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,920
(Is it because)

217
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,760
(I didn't get the method about how to use a sister?)

218
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Senior

219
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,000
Please come to my place.

220
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,320
Junior

221
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,200
About girls,

222
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,440
it is complicated.

223
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,760
I must teach you in person.

224
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,840
Let me in and talk to you.

225
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,640
No need, Senior.

226
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,160
Just teach me here.

227
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
Do you want to know

228
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,920
how to make girls adore you?

229
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,840
Listen to you?

230
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,400
You are asking the right person.

231
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I have some experience in this area.

232
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,800
To get a girl,

233
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,360
it takes three steps.

234
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,160
First,

235
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
establish your own glorious image.

236
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,320
Describe yourself

237
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
as outstanding as you can.

238
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,040
Girls have a mentality to worship the strong.

239
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
They can't resist the strong.

240
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,360
Second, showing your weakness.

241
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,320
Shape yourself a man

242
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,400
lonely and lack of love.

243
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,280
Girls have motherhood,

244
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
so they can't help caring about you.

245
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,400
Third, response to her every request.

246
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,040
Let every aspect of her life

247
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,920
has your traces.

248
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,800
Clear?

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,840
I'm survived.

250
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,800
Immortal

251
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,000
Have a try.

252
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,400
No, thanks.

253
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,720
I don't need to eat since I was born.

254
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,840
200 years?

255
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Haven't you eaten a bite?

256
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,280
Your life has lost a lot of fun.

257
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,640
My master said

258
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,560
that was a lack of troubles.

259
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,320
Making you practice all day and not letting you eat,

260
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,680
did your master treat you as a human?

261
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,040
Don't speak ill of my master.

262
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,040
Immortal, if...

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,880
I mean, if

264
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,920
I want to learn some enchantments
of the Yuhua Sect,

265
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,600
like something that can open the ward.

266
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,880
Is it possible?

267
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,960
Maybe there's a chance,

268
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,720
but it will be difficult.

269
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,000
To get a girl,

270
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,600
you have to establish your own glorious image.

271
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Let her worship you.

272
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,960
The Yuhua Sect has been established
for more than 2,000 years.

273
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,600
With the purpose of eliminating demons

274
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
and defending the way and supporting justice,

275
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,320
it has stood proudly in the world.

276
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,920
Five leaders of the Immortals Alliance
were from here,

277
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,040
and it was known as the leader
of all the Sects.

278
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,000
The enchantments of our Sect is broad and profound,

279
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,040
and it is difficult for ordinary people
to get its essence.

280
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,640
(Just a recitation of the school motto,)

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,840
(do you need to act like that?)

282
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
Do you have anything that can't be understood?

283
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,080
Immortal

284
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm also a straight A student in my hometown,

285
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,840
can you try to teach me a little?

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,079
Eh...

287
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
What I practice is the superior enchantments

288
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,200
participating in the election of the leader
of the Immortals Alliance.

289
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,079
It doesn't suitable for you.

290
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,319
The head of the Immortals Alliance,
terrific.

291
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,560
It is true.

292
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,400
The head of the Immortals Alliance

293
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,599
is the supreme honor of the Sects.

294
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,560
A general election is held about every 200 years,

295
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,080
and the selected person
can enter the Otherworld Array,

296
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,720
to become a real immortal.

297
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,040
The latest general election is in this year.

298
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
If there's no accident,

299
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,880
the selected person will be
in Yuhua Sect again.

300
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,520
It will be

301
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,600
me.

302
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,320
Immortal,
you are really not humble.

303
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
What is humble?

304
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,360
Humble is

305
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,640
like what you do.

306
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,800
Speak out your excellence

307
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,080
without reservation.

308
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,880
(She also thinks I am excellent.)

309
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,640
(She admires me.)

310
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,080
Immortal

311
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,000
Do you have some textbooks here?

312
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,880
Books.

313
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
There's a lot in the attic.

314
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,080
Okay, I'll learn by myself.

315
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,360
What? Hou Chi suddenly stopped inedia?

316
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,840
He caught the cold and took medicine?

317
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,280
According to our observation in the past few days,

318
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,880
it seems like this.

319
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,320
I will ask him personally.

320
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
The owner is out.

321
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,720
Junior

322
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,000
Greetings, The owner.

323
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,520
Greetings!

324
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
What happened to Hou Chi?

325
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
Don't worry.

326
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,400
Hou Chi is your direct apprentice,

327
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,080
he had been outstanding since childhood.

328
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,200
It doesn't matter to have some changes.

329
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
Besides, it's less than a month
before the primary election

330
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,800
of the head of the Immortals Alliance,
we can't mess ourselves up.

331
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
It matters to the election,
it's better to find out what happened.

332
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,280
We can ask Bi Hong about that. They are close.

333
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,760
Ask Bi Hong to come to the hall.

334
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm Bi Hong, the disciple of Yuhua,

335
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,440
pay my respect to Masters,

336
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
and The owner.

337
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,280
Bi Hong, do you see anything strange about Hou Chi lately?

338
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,200
Junior told me that he is trying

339
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
a new practice method recently.

340
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,560
A new practice method?

341
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,480
Did you ask him what the practice method is?

342
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,720
Junior is the hope of our entire Yuhua Sect.

343
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,280
What qualifications do I have
to intervene him?

344
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,480
According to your understanding about him,

345
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,600
you should be clear.

346
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
He has been practicing hard for 200 years,

347
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,760
and has never stepped out of the yard.

348
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,080
He only wanted to be the head
of the Immortals Alliance,

349
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,560
and did not think about other things.

350
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,160
I don't think it's necessary for you

351
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,000
to worry about him.

352
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,680
That's it.

353
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,280
The Yuhua Nine Layers of Hou Chi

354
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,840
has already cultivated to the eighth layers.

355
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,640
If he practices intensively,

356
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,880
he is very likely to break through to the ninth level

357
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
before the election.

358
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,920
What Yuan Gui said is right.

359
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Then I understand.

360
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,960
Hou Chi chose the new practice method just

361
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,960
for making the breakthrough.

362
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,280
Junior, let him do that.

363
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,000
You may be excused now.

364
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Take care of Hou Chi these days.

365
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,160
If you see anything strange,
report it immediately.

366
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,680
What else do you want to say?

367
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,920
Every time you called me in the past 200 years,

368
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
you just ask about Hou Chi.

369
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,440
Don't you have anything to ask about me?

370
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Junior, that is your fault.

371
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,160
You should care more about Bi Hong.

372
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
After all, you two are father and son.

373
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,320
If you talk to him more,

374
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,400
he won't run down the mountain too much

375
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,120
to dispel loneliness.

376
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,200
A person without the immortal perception,

377
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,760
let him do whatever he wants.

378
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,120
Why should I bother in vain?

379
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,920
Masters

380
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,720
I don't know if I should say it or not.

381
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,240
Say it.

382
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,800
We heard that the Devil Sect
was spreading around,

383
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,360
saying that the Junior Master
was defeated by the Devil Lord.

384
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
And the head of the Immortals Alliance
this year must be the Devil Lord.

385
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,280
How could it be?

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,520
Hou Chi hasn't even been out of his yard,

387
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,880
how could he be defeated by the Devil Lord?

388
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,080
You descend the mountain quickly to find out
the truth of what the Devil Sect said.

389
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,800
Okay.

390
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,400
Senior Yuan Ye

391
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,280
Strengthen all the wards in Mount Yuhua.

392
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,320
Yes.

393
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,960
Yes, Master.

394
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,200
The enchantment about how to
speed across the sky.

395
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,160
The enchantment about how to drive the sword.

396
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
The enchantment about space-time reversal.

397
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,520
After learning this,
I could be able to open the ward.

398
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,680
I want to read.

399
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,560
I want this book.

400
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
(I made a breakthrough today.)

401
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,560
(Could it be that the sister played a role?)

402
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,960
(I still need to work harder.)

403
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,880
Step forward with your right foot,
bend your knees into a right lunge.

404
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,400
Make a fist with your right hand
and raise it to the upper front.

405
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,120
Isn't this just military physical boxing?

406
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,240
It's already the ninth layers. Why...

407
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,080
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space.

408
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
After you learned this enchantment,

409
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,080
you can walk freely between time and space.

410
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,920
It wouldn't be limited by the past and the future.

411
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,920
This enchantment is exquisite and profound,

412
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
it is the highest secret enchantment,

413
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
and it can not be recorded here.

414
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,720
It's already a quarter to ten.

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,960
You have to go to bed.

416
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,520
Got it.

417
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,320
It really is the healthiest daily schedule.

418
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,040
Immortal

419
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
Don't be too stingy.

420
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,160
I can't sleep with the light off.

421
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,320
What do you want to do?

422
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,760
Stay away from me.

423
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,400
Stay there.

424
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,760
Didn't you say that

425
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,800
your brother told you the bedtime stories?

426
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,520
I can also do it.

427
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,240
On the coast of the East Sea,

428
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,560
there is an eighth-layer Yulin beast.

429
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,240
It is huge and 32 feet tall.

430
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,520
The passing friars were all killed by it.

431
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,960
And then?

432
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
It died.

433
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,240
How?

434
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
My master led it to this yard,

435
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,280
and a righteous cultivator with the same name as me

436
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
killed it.

437
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,680
That's all?

438
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,160
What do you think?

439
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,600
The ending is a little hasty.

440
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
I know you haven't heard enough.

441
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,480
I'll tell you one more.

442
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,200
There was a devil cultivator in Yulin City.

443
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,240
He specialized in grasping the souls
of living people,

444
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
practicing thousands ghost flags
to improve his cultivation.

445
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,920
There were countless ghosts
died in his hands.

446
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,320
And then?

447
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,920
My master led him to this yard,

448
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,680
and a righteous cultivator with the same name as me

449
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,760
killed him.

450
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,640
You want to listen more?

451
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,080
I'll tell you one more.

452
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
There was once a traitor in Jiyue Sect.

453
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,560
He practiced sorcery, fell into the devil way,

454
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,640
and killed his masters.

455
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,160
And my master...

456
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,000
Led him into this yard,

457
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,440
and a righteous cultivator with the same name as you

458
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,400
killed him.

459
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,400
How did you know?

460
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,320
After all,

461
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,480
they were all killed by you.

462
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,080
These are trifles, not worth mentioning.

463
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,560
Just one day, I have made great progress.

464
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,040
Sister, is really extraordinary.

465
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,360
What kind of protection do you need?

466
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,200
Protection?

467
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,000
Don't be silly.

468
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,720
Do you know what protection is?

469
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,880
It's really not easy to protect one person.

470
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
I just want to get a good sleep.

471
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,200
Please don't bother me.

472
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,200
(Although she has no requirements,)

473
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,200
(I still need to work hard.)

474
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,480
The owner

475
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,720
I went down the mountain these days and found

476
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,400
that the Devil Sect was spreading rumors

477
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
about the Devil Lord defeated the Junior Master.

478
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,600
They also printed the process of battle

479
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
on the booklet.

480
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,280
There are also the picture version
for the people who don't know words.

481
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,720
I heard

482
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,440
that the Devil Lord is rehearsing a show.

483
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,200
And it will be touring around before

484
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,480
the selection of the leader of the Immortals Alliance.

485
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
What do people under the mountain say?

486
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Be honest.

487
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
They said that

488
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,880
this is the first time that the Devil Sect

489
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,480
has joined in the selection
in the 2,000 years.

490
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,720
And they defeated the Junior Master
who is well-expected.

491
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,480
They thought that

492
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,960
it's fate.

493
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,960
Leave me alone.

494
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,560
Alright.

495
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,120
It is not so great to use the enchantments
to make it.

496
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,720
Here you are.

497
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,440
What kind of ghost is it?

498
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,520
Have you seen the ghosts?

499
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,200
Didn't I see him every day these two days?

500
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
Don't worry. This doll will accompany you from now on.

501
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,720
This doll?

502
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,840
I will have nightmares with it.

503
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,520
I don't like it.

504
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,960
Why does she get angry?

505
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,920
Junior Master, The owner is coming.

506
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,320
The Leading Master

507
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,360
Is it the man

508
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,640
who whips others?

509
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,080
Hide yourself.

510
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,720
Okay, I will hide well.

511
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,480
Don't let your master come in.

512
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,760
Master

513
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,320
I wanted to see you

514
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,320
as soon as I stopped the closed-door practice.

515
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,800
What do you do recently?

516
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,800
Everything is fine.

517
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,080
Such a big problem, how long are you

518
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,920
going to hide about it?

519
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
(Oh, no. Master found the girl.)

520
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,400
Master, please listen to me.

521
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,000
It's the fact.

522
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,520
You don't need to explain.

523
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,239
I broke the rules,

524
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,679
and I should be punished without any complaint.

525
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,400
But, she's not a bad guy.

526
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,120
The Devil Lord secretly attacked you
without moral,

527
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,920
and you still thought that he is a good guy?

528
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,199
The Devil Lord?

529
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,760
It scared me.

530
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,840
I heard that

531
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,600
you are not doing inedia recently,

532
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,960
and got a cold.

533
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,600
Were you hurt badly by him?

534
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm fine.

535
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
It was because I distracted for a while,

536
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,640
and then got into the Devil Lord's trap.

537
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,560
Go into the house,

538
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
let me see your injury.

539
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,240
(What? He wants to come in?)

540
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,600
Master, let's go to the Holy tree.

541
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,600
(The expression of his Master)

542
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,760
(is like a roller coaster.)

543
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,920
( My heart nearly stopped beating.)

544
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,880
It's just a little injury, don't need to bother you.

545
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,160
Concentrate and calm your mind, put your heart and power together.

546
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,680
Master

547
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,560
You lost

548
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,000
a lot of Holy Power to heal me.

549
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,840
It doesn't matter.

550
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,480
Your heart was hurt by the Devil Lord,

551
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,120
so the wound would not heal for a long time.

552
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,560
I am worried that this

553
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,440
will affect the election.

554
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,960
Chi

555
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,400
You are the only hope of our Yuhua Sect.

556
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,440
You must be careful.

557
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,360
I won't slight it.

558
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,000
These vines

559
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,800
were made for you by Bi Hong, right?

560
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,800
What a fool!

561
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,120
He just loves to care for these flowers and plants,

562
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
and attracts the attention of women.

563
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,240
It's not my Senior.

564
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,600
You don't have to speak for him.

565
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,200
Chi

566
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,400
When I was in the closed-door practice,

567
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,000
I got something new.

568
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,840
Let's swap our ideas about it.

569
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,560
Listening to the conversation
between him and his master,

570
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,440
he is like a pure

571
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,320
and unpretentious practicing machine.

572
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,240
Did I really misunderstand him?

573
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,880
Why should I care so much?

574
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,200
Get me out of here.

575
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,600
Get me out of here.

576
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,400
Get me out of here.

577
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,120
Get me out of here!

578
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,360
Brother!

579
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,600
Sorry.

580
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,440
I had a nightmare.

581
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,880
It doesn't matter.

582
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,920
Did your master punish you because of me?

583
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,640
That's me disappointed them.

584
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,920
You are pitiful.

585
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
200 years,

586
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,840
you just know about the practice.

587
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,440
You're like a machine.

588
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,560
The sorrow of a super scholar.

589
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,600
Quality education has a long way to go.

590
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,760
Wait me for a while.

591
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,560
This is for you.

592
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,800
For me?

593
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,440
The second place in the exam can also be rewarded.

594
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,600
Let me tell you.

595
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,680
Squeeze it when you feel stressed.

596
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,680
It can help you release your pressure.

597
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,880
And you can also eat it.

598
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,680
So perfect.

599
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,040
This object is not recorded in the books.

600
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,480
This is my gift for you.

601
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,040
Isn't it the first time

602
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
you have received a gift from someone else?

603
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,560
Can I give you a gift, too?

604
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
What do you want to give to me?

605
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,920
Is there anything you want to do,

606
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,800
but your brother never did it for you?

607
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,400
Yes.

608
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,400
What is that?

609
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,600
The Ferris wheel.

610
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,000
The Ferris wheel?

611
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,480
The Ferris wheel can lift people

612
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,600
from the ground to a very high altitude,

613
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,200
and you can overlook the panoramic view
of the entire scenic spot.

614
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,600
So easy.

615
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,960
Let's go.

616
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,800
Why do you bring me here?

617
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,440
Immortal

618
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,120
What is that for?

619
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,440
It might be the Yuhua College.

620
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,520
It might be?

621
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,680
Haven't you been there before?

622
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,200
My master said

623
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,600
that is a training place for ordinary cultivators.

624
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,800
It's not suitable for me.

625
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,080
What I practice is different from theirs.

626
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,680
What are the differences?

627
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,440
We should go back.

628
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,280
What are you doing?

629
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,680
Let me go.

630
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,480
Miss

631
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,480
I have something to ask you.

632
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,880
Is he going to confess?

633
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,160
Can I be...
