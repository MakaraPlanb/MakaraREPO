My Dear Brothers
EP04

2
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,960
Stop following me.

3
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,000
Go away.

4
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,400
Get lost.

5
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
Master Hou Chi

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Master Hou Chi

7
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,080
Did you see anyone suspicious

8
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,120
fled this way?

9
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,400
No.

10
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't you see I'm in the middle of practice?

11
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Get out of here.

12
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,880
Master Hou Chi

13
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,200
I lost the doll head by accident.

15
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,240
I'll find it for you.

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Never mind.

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,240
If you're caught leaving,

18
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
we'll be in trouble.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
Big news.

20
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Master Hou Chi has walked out of the door.

21
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,760
Alright, take care of yourself.

22
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,760
I have never seen him before.

23
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,640
So is he the legendary Master Hou Chi?

24
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,840
So cool.

25
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,760
Why is he here?

26
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,160
I have no idea he's so popular.

27
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,320
Hou Chi, you had never walked out of the door

28
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,600
since you established the "elixir pill" at fifteen.

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,080
Is there any special reason

30
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,080
for going out?

31
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,000
I...

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,080
I...

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
Hemming and hawing.

34
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Is there any personal thoughts

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,320
distracting you?

36
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,520
Be careful of being possessed by the devil.

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,760
It's the critical juncture for your practice.

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,960
Don't risk your efforts in the last two hundred years.

39
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,400
Go back now.

40
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,560
It's rare to see Master Hou Chi go downhill.

41
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
Must he leave so soon?

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,240
What a shame.

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,200
If only Master Hou Chi could

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,560
take up teaching in the academy.

45
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,640
With his instructions,

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
we'll certainly improve soon.

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,680
Master

48
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,040
May I have a word?

49
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,920
It's him again.

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,240
He's everywhere.

51
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,480
Master

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
There's a saying in my hometown.

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,280
Among all the methods of learning,

54
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,240
the least efficient one is to learn by rote,

55
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,040
the better one is to learn by understanding,

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
and the best is to teach others.

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,800
In one test,

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
two groups of people were told to read the same article.

59
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,520
One of them were asked to

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,280
tell it to others,

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
and this group had remembered

62
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
much more information than the other one.

63
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,800
This suggests that

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,120
if one has the intention to teach others

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,200
he would force himself to learn more and faster.

66
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,640
Quite true.

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,360
I remembered to see this story

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,840
in an ancient book.

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,160
So may I suggest

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,800
Master Hou Chi to

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
give a few lectures in the academy?

72
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,240
It will do him good to run for the leader of the alliance.

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
What do you think?

74
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,600
It's worth trying.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
Then let's start tomorrow.

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,920
Yes, Master.

77
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,200
Master Hou Chi is going to teach us.

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
I'm on top of the world.

79
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Now I'm giving a deodorant feather

80
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,360
to each of you.

81
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,520
Make sure you have it with you.

82
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
Don't disturb Master Hou Chi

83
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
with your body smell.

84
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
Let's welcome Master Hou Chi.

85
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,320
It seems that he's not in meditation.

86
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,760
What is he doing, siting still?

87
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
Just do as you're told.

88
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,440
It'll be fine.

89
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Thank you, Master.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,880
A signature of mine is not enough.

91
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,240
Keep working.

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,560
I wish you can get the signatures

93
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
of Master Yuan Zhao and Yuan Gui.

94
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,240
Only in this way can you be in the safe side.

95
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,040
Since Master has recognized my potential

96
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,640
through this signature,

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
I will certainly work harder.

98
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,840
Great.

99
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,240
Your Master Hou Chi's class has begun.

100
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,960
Go to class now.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
I still have one more question, Your Master.

102
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,840
What is it?

103
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
Do you know the enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

104
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,560
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

105
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
How dare you!

106
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,240
Who sent you here?

107
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,400
I know it by hearsay only.

108
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,160
I hope so.

109
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,840
But remember,

110
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,600
don't mention it again.

111
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
Or you'll be thrown out of here

112
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,880
in one month.

113
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,239
Well, go ahead.

114
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,400
The enchantment of breaking the virtual space.

115
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,280
May...

116
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,640
May I come in?

117
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,720
Sorry,

118
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm late.

119
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
The class is finally about to begin.

120
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,240
Shi Xia

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
The destroyer of

122
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,640
the class discipline.

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,680
He deserves to be punished!

124
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,400
You sit in the front.

125
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,000
Why ask him to sit in the front?

126
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,840
Why him?

127
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,080
May I take my desk mate with me?

128
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
His feet were injured.

129
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,600
Is anyone willing to help him?

130
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,400
I just want Shi Xia to be with me.

131
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,440
An Introduction to the Regulations of the Sect

132
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
How brilliant he is.

133
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
Cultivate from correcting our mind.

134
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,880
Life Force Management

135
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,080
He's really brilliant.

136
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,000
The body is the capital of cultivation

137
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,600
Shi Xia

138
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm here.

139
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,840
What do you want to learn in my class?

140
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Why him again?

141
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,800
I...

142
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,400
Don't mention the enchantment of breaking the virtual space ever again.

143
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,880
Or you'll be thrown out of here

144
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,320
in one month.

145
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
As a junior,

146
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,240
I can't think of anything for now.

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
Well, do you have any requirements?

148
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,560
Requirements?

149
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,600
I'd like to have a double-day off.

150
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,280
A couple cultivating?

151
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,720
Seriously?

152
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,560
A couple cultivating?

153
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
A couple cultivating with whom?

154
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,000
Isn't it supposed to be all of us?

155
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,920
Is he out of his mind?

156
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,800
If I have to appoint someone,

157
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,480
I want to have it with Qing Feng.

158
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,040
And it's better to have it in the dorm.

159
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,360
Shame on him.

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,360
No, no.

161
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,680
How do you know about it

162
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
at such a young age?

163
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,160
It's a birthright.

164
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
Every student deserves that

165
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,520
no matter how young they are.

166
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,560
I've read the History of Immortals

167
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,480
It says that it was a common thing in the past.

168
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,520
It was in the age of chaos,

169
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,600
the primitive time.

170
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
Don't mention it again.

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,640
So shameless.

172
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,440
How did it

173
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,520
turn into this?

174
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,320
The little one.

175
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Boss, I think Master Hou Chi

176
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,040
has regarded Shi Xia

177
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
with special attention.

178
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't start a rumor.

179
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Then why ask him to sit in the front?

180
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
He... he's short.

181
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,560
Short?

182
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,760
What about asking questions?

183
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,840
He's at the bottom of the class.

184
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,880
I'm warning you.

185
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,720
Master Hou Chi is pure and noble as the jade.

186
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't bad mouth him.

187
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,680
I see.

188
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,200
It's all The Little One's fault.

189
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,240
Keep a close watch

190
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,040
on Shi Xia.

191
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,520
Okay.

192
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,880
Qing Feng, why didn't you wait for me?

193
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,760
Leave me alone.

194
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
What's wrong?

195
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
You're way out of the line in the class.

196
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,040
It was he who asked for my requirements.

197
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
And it was also he who got mad at me

198
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
for no reason.

199
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,840
Got mad at you?

200
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
You were lucky you didn't be kicked out.

201
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
Is that requirement too much?

202
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,800
A couple cultivating is...

203
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,440
What?

204
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,000
It was a misunderstanding.

205
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,400
A completely misunderstanding.

206
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,880
What I mean is a double-day off.

207
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,880
Now we have only one day off on the first and the fifteenth day of every lunar month.

208
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,240
I read from the History of Immortals that

209
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
there were two days off in the past.

210
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,520
I was trying

211
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
to get more resting time

212
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,400
for our classmates.

213
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,200
I see.

214
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,920
Is it too late to explain?

215
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,920
For now,

216
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm afraid all the people in Mount Yuhua

217
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,240
have known you are here for couple cultivating.

218
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,160
I'm screwed.

219
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,160
Senior, is there anything I can help?

220
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm here to pass on a message from Master Hou Chi.

221
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,560
Disciple Shi Xia

222
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,640
Move immediately to the residence of Master Hou Chi behind the hill.

223
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,840
Without any delay.

224
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,960
Why?

225
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,080
Go ask him yourself.

226
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
What's wrong?

227
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm being forced.

228
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,480
Shi Xia

229
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,840
Move back here.

230
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,200
I won't.

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,160
Why not?

232
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,160
Tell me.

233
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,080
Does Qing Feng have something to do with the doll head's missing?

234
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,080
What if I say yes?

235
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Has he found your true identity?

236
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,280
Not yet.

237
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,520
I said I'd be careful.

238
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,640
Could you just let it go?

239
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,840
I also said I'd send you home.

240
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,240
Why don't you believe me?

241
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,600
It's conditional.

242
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,800
You need a girl to improve your force

243
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,160
and I'm just your tool.

244
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,800
What if the tool

245
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,040
gets broken one day?

246
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,880
Every word I said carries weight.

247
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,960
I promised to protect you,

248
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,160
I won't break it.

249
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,320
No one would always protect me.

250
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,680
Even my biological brother would leave me.

251
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,560
Equivalent exchange is the rule of the world.

252
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,760
I won't hand all my hope

253
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,640
to others.

254
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,200
What are you doing?

255
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,120
I don't need this.

256
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,520
And I don't need an elder brother either.

257
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,320
Shi Xia

258
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,040
Shi Xia

259
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,240
Qing Feng, can I have one Black-Sun Elixir?

260
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
Fortunately it's dark outside.

261
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,920
No one noticed you.

262
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,640
What are we gonna do in the future?

263
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,720
We don't have enough Black-Sun Elixir, do we?

264
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,160
Last time we lost one bottle.

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,240
It'll run out soon

266
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,040
if we both take it.

267
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,000
How about this? I ask for a leave

268
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,960
to go downhill and get some.

269
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,880
I'm sorry to get you into this.

270
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,520
Stop saying that.

271
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,360
It was me to get you into troubles.

272
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
But it'll delay your study.

273
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,320
Is there any other way?

274
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,360
Any other way...

275
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,080
We can get all the herbs from Master Bihong.

276
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,280
But

277
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,360
I have never been familiar with him.

278
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,240
What's more, once he knows the prescription,

279
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,960
our true identities would be exposed.

280
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,960
I have an idea.

281
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,080
Add some irrelevant herbs into it

282
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,440
to obfuscate.

283
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,120
I'm gonna go beg Senior Bihong for help.

284
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,480
This is it, I suppose.

285
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Senior Bihong

286
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,280
He seems to be at the critical juncture

287
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
of the cultivating.

288
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,000
I'd better come here later.

289
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,240
Oops.

290
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,880
Is he possessed by the devil

291
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,800
because of me?

292
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,480
Senior Bihong

293
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,440
Senior Bihong

294
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,240
Stay back.

295
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,800
I'm fine.

296
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,160
Senior Bihong, what's wrong with you?

297
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,440
Inhale.

298
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,160
It's camellia. It can relieve the pain.

299
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,720
Senior Bihong, you're finally awake.

300
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Junior Shi Xia

301
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,640
Thanks for staying with me for the whole night yesterday.

302
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,280
It was all my fault.

303
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,920
No.

304
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,240
It was me.

305
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,960
I wanted to try a new pill

306
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
and never expected to end like this.

307
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,640
Senior Bihong

308
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,440
You've been working on the pills every night, right?

309
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,080
You must have been

310
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,040
suffering from great pain

311
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,880
for the last 200 years.

312
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,560
Only in this way can you live 200 years with a mortal body.

313
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,160
Junior Shi Xia, you are too young

314
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,600
to experience the softness and

315
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,920
the fragrance of the beauty.

316
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,720
When you have it for the first time,

317
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,960
you'll know what I'm doing every night.

318
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,080
Stop lying to me.

319
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
I noticed your rough fingers,

320
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,040
which shows you work hard day and night.

321
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,840
And there are darker shadows under your eyes.

322
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,200
Others say you are idle in the daytime,

323
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
then you must work hard at night.

324
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,080
You know, in my hometown,

325
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,160
there are also kids just like you.

326
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,960
In the daytime, they sleep and play around,

327
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,560
and when they get home, they pull late nights.

328
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,920
All they want is to surprise everyone

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
when they got the first place.

330
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,440
Insecure as they are,

331
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,720
they just disguise themselves by idleness.

332
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,560
Seems like you won't lose if you never possess.

333
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,760
Won't lose if you never possess.

334
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,960
I can't believe the only one

335
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,680
who knows me

336
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,960
is this girl I just know for less than two days.

337
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,240
Senior Bihong

338
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,120
You've lived for 200 years with your own efforts.

339
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,440
You are the master of your destiny.

340
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,920
I am the master of my own destiny.

341
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Of course you are.

342
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,760
What if you speak out

343
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
my secret by accident?

344
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,200
Of course I won't.

345
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,400
I never gossip about others.

346
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,280
What about

347
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,440
using one of your secrets as an exchange?

348
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,320
I have no secrets.

349
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,440
Really?

350
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,200
So what's your relationship with Hou Chi?

351
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
It was just a tale of chance

352
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,200
that we had become real...

353
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,400
friends of different parents.

354
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
Well, I believe your word.

355
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,680
By the way,

356
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,360
Why did you come to me last night?

357
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,960
Oh right, this.

358
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,760
Could you make up the prescription for me?

359
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,240
Senior Bihong, I said there's no need.

360
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,120
I also said that

361
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
no matter what you need,

362
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
just come to me.

363
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,800
Well, I do need a favor.

364
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,400
Just say it.

365
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,240
Do you know the enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

366
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,200
Never heard of that before.

367
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,160
But from now on,

368
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
I can ask about it for you.

369
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
Thanks a lot.

370
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,480
It's conditional.

371
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,680
You need a younger sister to enhance your force.

372
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm nothing but a tool.

373
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,280
I don't need this.

374
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,880
And I don't need any elder brother.

375
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,160
Shi Xia

376
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,240
The magic item

377
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
takes your whole life to learn.

378
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
There must be a

379
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,440
solid foundation.

380
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,560
Hurry up everybody.

381
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,920
You got another fifteen minutes.

382
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
Master Hou Chi

383
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,760
Why are you here?

384
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,240
Master Hou Chi

385
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,000
Hou Chi

386
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,640
Didn't you say you won't be here today?

387
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm not a good teacher.

388
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,440
So today I'm here to learn some experiences.

389
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,440
Master Hou Chi

390
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,080
Please allow me to show you

391
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,800
my magic item.

392
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,160
Wait a second.

393
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,840
I'd like to have a look at others'.

394
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,600
Take mine.

395
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
Mine.

396
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,440
Shi Xia

397
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,320
Here is my magic item.

398
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,400
What sort of magic item is that?

399
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,040
Could it even be called as magic item?

400
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,120
Even though you can't make it,

401
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,640
there's no need to trick us

402
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,440
with a bamboo stick.

403
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,880
Right.

404
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,880
Well, I'll show you

405
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,080
to blow your mind.

406
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,440
Show me.

407
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,280
I've never seen this ward.

408
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,800
It's hard to believe that it can create a ward.

409
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,640
Showy.

410
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,960
Awesome.

411
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,200
Qing Feng

412
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,240
A ward in this shape?

413
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,880
It must be a first-class magic item.

414
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,480
What's this with various colors?

415
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,840
What is this now?

416
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,080
It's a heart's shape.

417
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,480
In my hometown,

418
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
it means love.

419
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,040
It means being attached to each other.

420
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,320
A world in a bubble

421
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,400
and a life in a leaf.

422
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,840
What a fine talk.

423
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,200
A kid with no talent

424
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,520
can think of such a fantasy.

425
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,720
It's really hard to come by.

426
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,720
Right.

427
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
How did he make it?

428
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,920
So good.

429
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,160
Master Hou Chi

430
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,040
You haven't seen mine.

431
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Shi Xia

432
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,360
Could I exchange my Damour Red Armillary Sash

433
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,120
with your magic item?

434
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,480
What about mine?

435
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Line up.

436
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,960
Let me pick first.

437
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,800
This looks great.

438
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,160
Qing Feng must like it.

439
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,280
Are you sure it's the enchantment of breaking the virtual space?

440
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,200
Boss, just wait.

441
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,680
The weed lines on the map

442
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,600
are supposed to be the brambles.

443
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,320
Behind the brambles, there would be a huge rock.

444
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,960
Knock three times on the rock, then you got the access to the forbidden area.

445
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,320
Boss, if you can get

446
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,440
the enchantment of breaking the virtual space,

447
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
you will not just rank second in the Yuhua Sect.

448
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,480
You're right. Let's go get it tomorrow night.

449
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,680
This should be the back mountain

450
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,040
mentioned by Yi Yaogua.

451
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,240
I remembered he said to go through brambles.

452
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,160
Where is it?

453
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,160
Behind the brambles, there would be a huge rock.

454
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,560
Knock three times on the rock, then you got the access to the forbidden area.

455
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,320
They had me fooled.

456
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,320
Is anybody there?

457
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,960
Somebody help.

458
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,600
My brother, where are you?

459
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,080
Why are you never around

460
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,880
when I need you?

461
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,000
Why did you hold that tree?

462
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
Because

463
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,480
trees only stick to one place

464
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,960
to rooting and sprouting.

465
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,880
They never leave,

466
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,720
and never move.

467
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,360
Never leave just as me?

468
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,240
I've been treating you so bad.

469
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,120
People would get away from me if he is treated this way.

470
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,560
Why did you come to me?

471
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
I promised to protect you and I won't break it.
