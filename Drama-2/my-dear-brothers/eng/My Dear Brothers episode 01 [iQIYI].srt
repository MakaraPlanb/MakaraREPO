00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,890
My Dear Brothers
EP01

2
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Devil Lord, it's over.

3
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
You can go.

4
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,920
Wait,

5
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,160
I didnâ€™t lose the fight.

6
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,040
It's not over yet.

7
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,640
I just went easy on you.

8
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,160
Otherwise,

9
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,600
you wouldn't have stood here talking.

10
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,760
Hou Chi

11
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,040
You cultivated essential nature
at the age of 12,

12
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,760
and established the "elixir pill"
at the age of 15.

13
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,120
You also awoke the "inner thunder"
one hundred years after that.

14
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,280
However,

15
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,560
do you know why

16
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,200
you still can't reach the peak yet?

17
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,560
My Master said that I don't have to.

18
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,160
My mission is to become
the leader of the Immortals Alliance,

19
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
and protect all kinds of creatures.

20
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
Bah.

21
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,920
You even don't know
what the Heart of Guardian is.

22
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,400
How come for you to protect all kinds of creatures?

23
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
The Heart of Guardian

24
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,000
means the commitment to protect and guard.

25
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,520
Stop it.

26
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,280
Reciting makes no difference.

27
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,880
Tell me who you have protected if you are so good.

28
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,120
Tell me even one.

29
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,360
I would admit you won.

30
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,400
How about you?

31
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,760
Devil Lord, have you ever protected anyone?

32
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,040
Of course,

33
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
I have protected my sister.

34
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,720
Your sister?

35
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,880
My sister is the cutest

36
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,200
and kindest little girl in this world.

37
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,840
She has a round face,

38
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,000
which is soft and plump when I touch it.

39
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,640
Always follow my heart and never give up.

40
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,520
That's my motto.

41
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,120
Be diligent and work hard.

42
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
That's my guideline.

43
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,600
In the vast space and infinite time...

44
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
Study hard and work hard

45
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,120
for the development of the forestry

46
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,960
and the ecology of our country.

47
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,000
You're the next one.

48
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,320
Do your best.

49
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,320
If you wanna get the national scholarship,

50
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,600
just do it well.

51
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,680
Go for it.

52
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
Hello, I'm Shi Xia,

53
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,360
a sophomore majoring in forestry.

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,840
The theme of my speech is...

55
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,920
Hello? Who is it?

56
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
You're Shi Xia, right?

57
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,400
I heard about your elder brother, Shi Dong.

58
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
Where is my brother?

59
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,720
You should go to Huan Xi internet bar now.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,040
I will tell you after you give me money.

61
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,160
But I'm busy now.

62
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
I will go to find you after I finish this.

63
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,960
Is that okay?

64
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,560
I can only wait half an hour.
I won't be there after that.

65
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,640
Hello?

66
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,440
Hello?

67
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,159
-Hello?  -Thanks.

68
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,280
Good job.

69
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,520
Shi Xia, what are you doing here? absent-minded

70
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,920
It's your turn. Hurry up.

71
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,960
Come on.

72
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,600
I can only wait half an hour.
I won't be there after that.

73
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,880
Shi Xia?

74
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,800
It's Lucian.

75
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,080
I can't use the Fast Pace.

76
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,680
Little girl, you're punctual.

77
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Where is my brother?

78
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,760
Be patient.

79
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Come on.

80
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,400
Scan it.

81
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,320
Why should I trust you?

82
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
Since Shi Dong has disappeared one year ago,

83
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,960
I have received 73 fraudulent phone calls.

84
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,880
Your trick has no big difference from theirs.

85
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,280
Look at this bar.

86
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
Do you remember?

87
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,760
Shi Dong was a bar waiter here.

88
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,880
(He's right.)

89
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,520
(Two thousand yuan.)

90
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,920
(Just use the money to buy a glimmer of hope.)

91
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,760
Tell me.

92
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,120
Come on. Have a look.

93
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,040
The sky wheel.

94
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,520
The amusement park will be closed
at five in the afternoon.

95
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,360
Time is short.

96
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,440
Shi Dong, you idiot.

97
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,960
You have disappeared for one year.

98
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,960
Now you appear again,
but it costs my scholarship.

99
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,360
I must not spare you after you come back.

100
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
Shi Dong

101
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,120
Shi Dong

102
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,840
Shi Dong

103
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,760
Shi Dong

104
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,720
Shi Dong

105
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,160
Shi Dong

106
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
Shi Dong

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,720
Shi Dong

108
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
Shi Dong

109
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,440
Shi Dong

110
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,280
Shi...

111
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,520
My sister is
the most important person for me all my life.

112
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
I must protect her with my life.

113
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,960
You will never know
the meaning of such protection.

114
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Why should I know?

115
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,560
You don't know what protection means,

116
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,880
but talk about
protecting all kinds of creatures all the time.

117
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,800
Hou Chi

118
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
No one is more hypocritical than you
in this world.

119
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
You're a man of no feelings,

120
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,320
but of deceptive nature.

121
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,840
You're not qualified
to be the leader of the Immortals Alliance.

122
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,280
You...

123
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,560
I will teach you a lesson today.

124
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,480
I can defeat you with no other help

125
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,600
but my heart of guardian to my sister.

126
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
The leader of the Immortals Alliance

127
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,000
should be me.

128
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,680
Sister? What does sister mean?

129
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,920
Devil Lord said without a sister,

130
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,040
I can't get the Heart of Guardian.

131
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Sister, wake up.

132
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,320
Sister, sister, wake up.

133
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,720
Sister, wake up.

134
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,680
Who are you?

135
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Why are you here?

136
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,200
Yeah.

137
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Why?

138
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,040
What is this place?

139
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
Why am I here?

140
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,720
You have trespassed on Yuhua Sect.

141
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,160
How dare you ask me?

142
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,240
(This man is so weird.)

143
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,480
(His words are strange too.)

144
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,040
(Is he filming?)

145
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,120
(There is no camera but only him alone.)

146
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,480
(Is he a fraud?)

147
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,360
(He is somehow handsome.
It's a pity for him to be a fraud.)

148
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,040
Quirky expressions and uncertain intentions.

149
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,960
Tell me.

150
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
Are you a spy of Devil Sect?

151
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Look at the prop,

152
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
and the clothes.

153
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,320
The fraud also does well in filming.

154
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,120
But a fraud must have flaws.

155
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,520
For example, your hair...

156
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Master Chi

157
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,360
We heard strange noises.

158
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,480
Any intruders?

159
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,040
It's just a red-crowned crane.

160
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,440
Don't overreact.

161
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,200
Before Master Yuan Zhao went for training,
he had ordered us

162
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,600
to guard you well.

163
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,960
I don't need guards here.

164
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,080
Please leave me alone.

165
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,520
Yes.

166
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,480
You...

167
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Indeed, you're not a kind person.

168
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,440
You...

169
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,880
This person has no Holy Power at all.

170
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
But why could she
break the protection ward of Yuhua Sect?

171
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,160
Great.

172
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,320
It was just a nightmare.

173
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,240
Where am I again?

174
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,400
The amusement park will be closed
in ten minutes.

175
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,839
It's not too late yet.

176
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,960
What's going on?

177
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,000
Is it that guy...

178
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,320
Kidnap?

179
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,680
My phone.

180
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,960
Where is my phone?

181
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm screwed.

182
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,000
Shi Xia, Shi Xia.

183
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
You must calm down.

184
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
Why is there no response?

185
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,960
SOS?

186
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,640
Help?

187
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,240
Police?

188
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,280
Let's see who will help you.

189
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm doomed.

190
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm still young.

191
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,760
Will I die here today?

192
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
It's four fifty.

193
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,160
It should be a long time,

194
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,320
but it is still four fifty.

195
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,560
I see.

196
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,240
It's a dream.

197
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
As a big movie fan,

198
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,640
I won't be trapped in this.

199
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,480
I have watched Inception three times.

200
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,960
It's okay. It's just a dream.

201
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,120
It doesn't hurt.

202
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,840
No, I don't believe it.

203
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,200
I must wake up.

204
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,240
(Delicate face and soft skin.)

205
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,640
(Long and beautiful hair.)

206
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,280
(According to the definition in books,
she should be)

207
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,760
a woman.

208
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,080
Hooligan, let go of me.

209
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,520
Can't you hear me?

210
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
I said let go of me.

211
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,600
Let go of me.

212
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Let go of me.

213
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
Let go of me.

214
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,760
According to the definition in books,

215
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,840
you're really a woman.

216
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
Brutal and impolite.

217
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,160
You should be a hellcat.

218
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,720
I...

219
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,880
You are a fraud with a wire.

220
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,960
What do you want from me here?

221
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,400
Incoherent

222
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,760
and nonsense.

223
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,880
What is the wire?

224
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,160
And why did you sneak into my yard?

225
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,520
You fraud, how dare you ask me?

226
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,560
No.

227
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,120
I shouldn't argue with a person in my dream.

228
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,800
I must be imposing.

229
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,680
You can't bully me in my dream.

230
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
My Master said
the woman likes throwing things.

231
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,040
The woman is emotional,

232
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
and likes screaming.

233
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,960
They also like pulling men's hair.

234
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
It's right.

235
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
What a real dream.

236
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,440
Who are you?

237
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,280
What is this place?

238
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm Hou Chi, the disciple of Yuhua Sect.

239
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,440
This is the backyard of Yuhua Sect,

240
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,360
where I live and cultivate.

241
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,800
Spells, flying, sect, and cultivation.

242
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,560
It's not a dream.

243
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,000
If it's not a dream,

244
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,760
who helped me change the clothes?

245
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,760
No wonder it hurts to when I fell.

246
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,880
It's not a dream.

247
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,480
The woman

248
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,200
You have no Holy Power,

249
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,560
how did you
break the protection ward of Yuhua Sect?

250
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,560
(Yuhua Sect.)

251
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,400
(It sounds like a noble sect.)

252
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
(This man is also powerful,)

253
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,560
(and they called him Master.)

254
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,320
(But he doesn't)

255
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,920
(look so smart.)

256
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,600
If I tell you

257
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,680
how to break the ward,

258
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,680
you will let me go, right?

259
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,440
As long as you are not a spy of Devil Sect,

260
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,480
I won't imprison you.

261
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,360
Deal.

262
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,400
I will tell you.

263
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,600
I have no Holy Power,

264
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,920
but I have Holy Pills.

265
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,120
My Holy Pills are not the same
as the ordinary pills.

266
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,360
You can't swallow it.

267
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,720
You need to chew it until it is digested.

268
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,680
Only in this way can it work.

269
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
After it works,

270
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,120
you can break all kinds of wards.

271
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,920
Try it.

272
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,160
Do as I do.

273
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,480
Chew it.

274
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,720
Come on.

275
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,280
Come on. Have a seat.

276
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,800
After you take the pill,

277
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,120
you must close your eyes and meditate.

278
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,640
No matter what happens,

279
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,800
you can't stop.

280
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,080
What a liar.

281
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,760
It's not a pill.

282
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,120
Master

283
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
I didn't mean to lie to you.

284
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,880
I also don't know how I came here.

285
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,160
I just dropped in a pool.

286
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,720
Then swoosh.

287
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,520
Here I am.

288
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,960
So,

289
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,360
you admit that you have broken the ward
at the bottom of the pool?

290
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,080
That's right.

291
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,680
I came here through the bottom of the pool.

292
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Who sent you here?

293
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Nobody.

294
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,760
I came here alone.

295
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,920
That's impossible.

296
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,120
You have no Holy Power,

297
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,640
so you can't break the ward.

298
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,280
Why is it impossible?

299
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
According to the books,
women are good at telling lies.

300
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,680
You have committed a crime
of trespassing on Yuhua Sect.

301
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,640
You are a woman,
making the crime more serious.

302
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,400
Is this really a noble sect?

303
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,600
You can't get my point,

304
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,120
and even discriminate against my gender.

305
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,360
Don't try to sidetrack me.

306
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,400
Tell me. Who sent you here?

307
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,120
Why can't you understand?

308
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I was about to give a speech

309
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
on the meeting of national scholarship.

310
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,320
Then I received a phone call

311
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,560
and someone said he knew where my elder brother was.

312
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
I am his sister.

313
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,280
I had to go there and have a look.

314
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,000
Wait.

315
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
What did you say?

316
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,720
What?

317
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,280
You said you're

318
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,200
a sister?

319
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,720
My sister

320
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,920
is the most important person for me
all my life.

321
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,840
I must protect her with my life.

322
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,440
You will never know
the meaning of such protection.

323
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,520
Are you really a sister?

324
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,960
Why should I lie to you?

325
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,440
My sister looks cute,

326
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,320
but you'd better never irritate her.

327
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,760
Do you want to be angry with me?

328
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,400
Please be angry with me.

329
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,560
It's the first time
that I have ever been requested like this.

330
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
Do you think you're great?

331
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,120
It's me who comes to your world.

332
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,840
If you came to mine,

333
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,320
I would send you to the biology museum,

334
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,400
science museum,
technology institution, and the zoo.

335
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,720
You will be studied by a lot of people.

336
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,080
They would preserve you in formalin.

337
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,400
Then you would live forever,

338
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
and never die...

339
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,320
My sister

340
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,880
She has a round face,

341
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,160
which is soft and plump when I touch it.

342
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,160
Is there any discipline in your world?

343
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
My sister is a cute foodie.

344
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,840
Whenever she sees the food,

345
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,200
her eyes will become bright.

346
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,600
Do you want to eat something?

347
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
Since you have mentioned this matter,

348
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,480
I feel hungry now.

349
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,600
What do you want to eat?

350
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,920
I wanna eat

351
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,880
cheesecake, Bubble tea,

352
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,920
durian pizza, fried chicken,

353
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
chocolate, ice cream...

354
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,960
Forget it.

355
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,640
Everything is okay.

356
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,800
Senior

357
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Would you please send me some food?

358
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,720
What a handsome man!

359
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,640
When's my turn?

360
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,400
I can't wait.

361
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,280
Miss Wang has made progress in playing the Pipa.

362
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,640
Immortal Venerable Bihong, you think
she does well in playing the Pipa,

363
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,920
so you don't care about my cricket anymore.

364
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,720
I have fed it for three months.

365
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,280
Miss Lin is so famous in this town for

366
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,400
your ability to raise insects.

367
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,640
The Tiger General you have raised

368
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,680
sings brightly and loud.

369
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,400
It's the best cricket in this world.

370
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,320
Its voice matches well with
the tweedle from Miss Wang,

371
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,800
which is the most beautiful music
in this world.

372
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,240
Thanks to you, who cured my hand,

373
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,960
so that I can raise a cricket like this.

374
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,960
If you like it,

375
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,520
I will keep all the greatest insects
in my shop

376
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,560
for you.

377
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,840
The two of you have just recovered
from the illness.

378
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,200
So you should not be resent or angry.

379
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,000
He's so gentle.

380
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,840
Yeah.

381
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
He's so considerate.

382
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:41,840
Senior

383
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,520
Could you please send me some food?

384
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,240
Mr. Yu

385
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,320
Could I cook in your kitchen?

386
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,080
Junior, you have kept dieting
since you were a child.

387
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,440
Now you even don't need to eat food.

388
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,160
What's wrong with you today?

389
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,600
A new cultivation method.

390
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,960
What?

391
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,840
I didn't speak to you.

392
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,120
(He didn't speak to me,)

393
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,320
(so he spoke to a ghost?)

394
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,320
Junior, who are you talking to?

395
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,560
I'm talking to myself.

396
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,960
No worries.

397
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,360
Junior, I'm coming back this afternoon.

398
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,680
Then I will go to see you.

399
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,040
Senior, please don't come to see me today.

400
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,360
I'm really busy.

401
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,480
(He's insane, or I am.)

402
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,160
(I'd better find a way to go home
as soon as possible.)

403
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,120
Is there really no way out?

404
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,560
Devil Lord said

405
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,800
a sister can help me
get the Heart of Guardian.

406
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,840
But according to the doctrine,

407
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,600
women can't stay in Mount Yuhua.

408
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,720
A sister must be a woman,

409
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,480
so how can I solve this problem?

410
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,440
Immortal Venerable Bihong

411
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,040
Immortal Venerable Bihong

412
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,520
It is said that your Junior, Hou Chi,
was defeated by Devil Lord.

413
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,640
Is it true?

414
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,120
Really?

415
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,360
Junior

416
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,920
Hou Chi

417
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,240
Senior

418
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,400
What do you want?

419
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,200
I heard that

420
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,360
you were defeated by Devil Lord.

421
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,200
What a ridiculous rumor.

422
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,400
Senior

423
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,600
What's wrong?

424
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
I was defeated.

425
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,320
What?

426
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,640
You were really defeated by Devil Lord?

427
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,960
He must have defeated you with a sneak attack.

428
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,720
As far as I know,

429
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,640
no one can be more powerful than you.

430
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,480
That's true.

431
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,040
Devil Lord's moves were so weird.

432
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,000
He could even break the ward of Yuhua Sect,

433
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,760
and he used odd weapons.

434
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,160
He even told me something so absurd.

435
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,720
I was defeated.

436
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,840
But the Leading Master
will finish his cultivation soon.

437
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,440
What if he knows...

438
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,840
I have started a new cultivation method.

439
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,120
Can you give me some medicines for colds?

440
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,160
Medicines for colds?

441
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,760
That's your new cultivation method?

442
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,600
That's it.

443
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,640
You have been so weird
in these two hundred years.

444
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,400
Thank you, Junior.

445
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,720
Junior

446
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,800
What's the matter?

447
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,480
Do you have a sister?

448
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,400
A sister?

449
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,960
I do.

450
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,640
You have a sister, too?

451
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,840
Too?

452
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,360
Of course.

453
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,640
Speaking of a sister,

454
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,680
as long as you are sincere,

455
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,400
you will certainly have one.

456
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,920
It seems that everyone has a sister.

457
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,000
It must be helpful for cultivation.

458
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,000
He looks so strange recently.

459
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,680
He must have a secret.

460
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,000
It's bitter.

461
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,120
It's not bitter.

462
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,840
It's bitter.

463
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,480
The useful medicine is always bitter.

464
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,480
Why am I still here?

465
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,600
Did you save me?

466
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,200
Never mind.

467
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,320
What happened yesterday made me realize that

468
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
you're a mortal,

469
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,200
a woman.

470
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
You need to eat

471
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,960
and take medicine when you're ill.

472
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,840
Though you're a little troublesome,

473
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,360
I can endure it.

474
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,880
So?

475
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,120
So I allow you to stay with me.
