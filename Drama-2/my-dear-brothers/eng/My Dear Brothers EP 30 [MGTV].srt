00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,120
My Dear Brothers
EP30

2
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,480
Shi Xia

3
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
Little did I expect

4
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
the one that ended up taking her life

5
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,880
is you.

6
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
A life for a life.

7
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,880
That's only fair.

8
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,080
A life for a life?

9
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
Then it should have been my life instead.

10
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
All mark my words.

11
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,720
I

12
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,880
was the murderer of elder Yuan Gui.

13
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,800
What? It was him.

14
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,640
He was the murderer.

15
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,280
No way.

16
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,760
What's going on?

17
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,760
That's impossible.

18
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Exactly.

19
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,360
Evidence and witnesses
all proved against his words.

20
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Take none of his nonsense.

21
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,160
Evidence could be forged,

22
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,680
and the witnesses are free to lie.

23
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,520
If you don't believe me,

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,560
I shall show you the truth.

25
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,920
Qiu Li

26
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,520
Don't make me do it.

27
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,200
Get away.

28
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,240
-It really was him.  -Yeah.

29
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,320
He was the one who killed elder Yuan Gui.

30
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,400
How could it be?

31
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,600
That image

32
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
was forged by this devil woman.

33
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,960
She's trying to fool us.

34
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
That was what elder Yuan Gui saw in person.

35
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,600
Nobody can make a counterfeit.

36
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,800
Why is there

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,280
elder Yuan Gui's memory in your eyes?

38
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
You asked me once

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
how I recovered my sight.

40
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,160
In fact, these new eyes of mine

41
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,200
belonged to Master Yuan Gui.

42
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
So, what you saw just now

43
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,600
was the sheer truth.

44
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,680
That is to say,

45
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,640
elder Yuan Gui was already killed
when he was in Devil Sect.

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,400
Yuan Zhao

47
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,680
To cover up for your illegitimate son,

48
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,560
you signed us all up for dirty business.

49
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,440
Such a disregard for justice

50
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,560
would even be disdained by a devil.

51
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Illegitimate son?

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
Bi Hong is not an ordinary illegitimate son.

53
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,480
He is my true brother.

54
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
Our mother

55
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,960
is the former Immortal Aunt
of the Devil Sect,

56
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Qiu Ya.

57
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,720
Is he really the son of
that Immortal Aunt of the Devil Sect?

58
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Really?

59
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
That's impossible.

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,360
Each one of you here

61
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,760
did your part in hurting Devil Lord.

62
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,080
None of you will walk out of here alive.

63
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,880
Immortal Aunt

64
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,360
Yuan Zhao

65
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
You might have stopped me this time,

66
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,400
but you can't be there to stop me every time.

67
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
You have my words.

68
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,520
All of you here

69
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,800
will die on my hands

70
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,160
in agony one after another.

71
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Let's go.

72
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,840
You can't leave yet.

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,400
Senior

74
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,240
How dare you stop me?

75
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,760
If you leave here today,

76
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,080
you will have no way back.

77
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,600
You have no right to stop me.

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Hou Chi

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,240
My greatest regret for life

80
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,440
was my mercy on you,

81
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,520
which had Shi Xia killed for nothing.

82
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,640
Starting today,

83
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
our friendship

84
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,400
is just like this umbrella.

85
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
Broken beyond repair.

86
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,120
I have the blood of devil in me,

87
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,440
so I'm bound to return to Devil Sect.

88
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,560
If anyone stands in my way again,

89
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,160
I will have the world know

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,520
every one of his secrets.

91
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,120
As for what you took from me

92
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
and who you gave them to,

93
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,120
you know better than anyone else.

94
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,280
Master

95
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,200
Let's go.

96
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Hold up, Master Yuan.

97
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,600
Yuan Zhao

98
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,200
Today, you and your disciple

99
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,920
have done such a disgraceful deed.

100
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,840
It shamed us so much in front of Devil Sect.

101
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
If you can't make it up to us,

102
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
we won't let you go.

103
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
Master had his fault,

104
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,000
but it was me who did the killing.

105
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,240
If you have to hold a grudge,

106
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,240
it should all be towards me.

107
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Please don't blame my Master.

108
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,920
Well,

109
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
how do you want me to repay you?

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
You had words in secret with Devil Sect.

111
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,760
That head of the Alliance you trained

112
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,280
no longer fits for his position, then.

113
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,840
The Alliance won't follow such a man.

114
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,200
So, Hou Chi should give up
the seal of the head of the Alliance.

115
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,320
Then we will find someone truly qualified
to take the place.

116
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
I should be the only one to blame

117
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,880
for what happened today.

118
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
I have ruined the reputation
of the Immortal Sect.

119
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
I also feel ashamed to carry
the title of the Yuhua Sect owner.

120
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,960
I am willing to give up my position

121
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,520
to make things just.

122
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,560
However,

123
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
all matters about the head of the Alliance
should refer to Shen Guan.

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,240
We have to report to Shen Guan,

125
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,000
and wait for her decision.

126
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,600
I believe Lord Shen Guan

127
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,760
will make the right decision.

128
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,120
I'm aware of what happened today.

129
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,640
Hou Chi's position as the head
was what meant to be.

130
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,040
It has nothing to do with sect conflicts.

131
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,440
So Hou Chi should still
be the head of Immortals Alliance.

132
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,360
I'll hear no further discussions.

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,720
Hou Chi

134
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,840
Report to the Celestial Palace
to take up your position tomorrow.

135
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Make no mistakes.

136
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,840
Yes.

137
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840
I have sent my words back to Yuhua Sect.

138
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,920
The owner of the sect

139
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,560
will be Senior Yuan Ye.

140
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,880
From now on,

141
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,400
he will be in charge of

142
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,000
everything in Yuhua Sect.

143
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Qing Feng and Yi Yaogua

144
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,360
After I leave,

145
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,760
the two of you

146
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,160
shall escort Hou Chi to the Celestial Palace

147
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,920
and help him take up his position.

148
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,880
Master, please allow me to quit Yuhua Sect.

149
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,240
Qing Feng

150
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,360
It was just Master's mad word

151
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,240
that he was to expel you.

152
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't let it go to your head.

153
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
But I took them seriously.

154
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,400
Many things happened these days.

155
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
Some of them troubled me with confusion.

156
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,480
As for the conflict between the Immortals and Devils,
and the gap between right from wrong.

157
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,520
I was confused.

158
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,680
So from now on,

159
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,680
I just wish to go my own way,

160
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
and do my own deed.

161
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,760
Please allow me to quit Yuhua Sect.

162
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,000
In that case,

163
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,200
Master, please allow me

164
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,760
to follow Qing Feng.

165
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,000
I am not the owner anymore,

166
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,560
so I have no right to stop you.

167
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,760
You should

168
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,400
make this decision yourselves.

169
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
Master, I bid you farewell.

170
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,320
Master Hou Chi, I bid you farewell.

171
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,400
Master, I bid you farewell.

172
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,000
Master Hou Chi

173
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,040
Farewell.

174
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,520
Chi

175
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Master

176
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,840
I must have

177
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,640
let you down.

178
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
As your disciple, I'm in no position

179
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,280
to judge your past.

180
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,840
But I have been following your words
ever since I was young.

181
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,600
I believe that

182
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,880
there must be sound reasons behind all your actions.

183
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,240
It will please me much

184
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,120
if Bi Hong gets to be
half as bright as you are.

185
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,280
Senior is kind by nature.

186
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,880
He was seduced by that devil woman.

187
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,200
That's why he lost himself for the moment.

188
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,640
After I take up my position,

189
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,440
I will help you get him back.

190
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,200
If he is unwilling to return,

191
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,160
just let him be.

192
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,080
Every one of us had our own path written

193
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
when we were born.

194
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,800
And we must go down these paths

195
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
throughout our life.

196
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,760
Bi Hong

197
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,000
is destined to be a mortal.

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,720
And you are bound to have a high position,

199
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,040
and bring honor to Yuhua Sect.

200
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,000
It's your Succession Ceremony tomorrow.

201
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,400
I can't be publicly present,

202
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,120
but I'll be there in the shadows.

203
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,840
Chi

204
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
No matter what will happens tomorrow,

205
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,760
you must get to the Celestial Palace.

206
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Do not turn back.

207
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,880
Qing Feng

208
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,840
Why didn't you wait for me?

209
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,080
We are not fellows in the same sect anymore.

210
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,600
So we have no connections at all.

211
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,360
We're bound to part ways.

212
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,600
Quit dragging along.

213
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,480
You used to kiss me,

214
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,160
we do have connections now.

215
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
From now on,

216
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
you are my woman.

217
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,040
We shall hold each other's hands

218
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
till death tear us apart.

219
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,520
Shameless fool.

220
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,960
Who would ever stay with you?

221
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,280
Qing Feng

222
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,760
I know the mishaps of your family.

223
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,360
I also know that's why you feel homeless.

224
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,920
But my family has got sufficient wealth.

225
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Wherever you wish to be,

226
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,080
we can go and settle their together.

227
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,640
I don't want your money or houses.

228
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,840
That's not what I meant.

229
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,520
I...

230
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,840
I know you're not a fan of any of that.

231
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
I just want to make you a home.

232
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,240
A warm place for two.

233
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,560
Did I say something wrong again?

234
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,240
If you dare to kiss me
without consent again,

235
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,880
I will break your legs.

236
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,480
Alright.

237
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,920
I won't kiss you without your consent again.

238
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,320
Only you can kiss me at will.

239
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,040
So is that a yes?

240
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,680
We've got a long way ahead.

241
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,960
Where should we start?

242
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,720
I want to go to the bottom of the cliff

243
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,800
to find the bodies of Shi Xia and Shi Dong.

244
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,800
They deserved a proper funeral.

245
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,480
Master Hou Chi

246
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,560
Why did you keep calling him Master?

247
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,240
Hou Chi, since you killed Shi Xia,

248
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,880
I will never forgive you.

249
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
Were you looking for Shi Xia?

250
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,880
Follow me.

251
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,280
Shi Xia, Devil Lord

252
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,440
Are they...

253
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,680
Shi Dong is fine.

254
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,560
They are just asleep.

255
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
So you have figured a way out for them
since the beginning.

256
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,840
Trapped by the Evil Aura,

257
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm no longer that powerful.

258
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,640
If Shi Xia gets into trouble one day,

259
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,520
I might not be there in time.

260
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,680
I hope this ring

261
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,760
can protect Shi Xia for me.

262
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,240
I'll have to ask you for a favor.

263
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,080
Please hide them well
and take good care of them.

264
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,400
Please don't tell them what happened
while they're asleep.

265
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,720
And please don't tell them that

266
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,400
it was me who saved them.

267
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,680
Since you still love Shi Xia,

268
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,120
why don't you tell her the truth?

269
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,520
Yeah, why not?

270
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
Shi Xia loves you so.

271
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,400
You care for each other.

272
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,720
Why do you have to be strangers?

273
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Only if I never meet Shi Xia again

274
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,240
can she be safe all her life.

275
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,720
No.

276
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,840
Where am I?

277
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,480
Did I travel again after I die?

278
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,840
Qing Feng

279
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,840
Shi Xia, you're finally awake.

280
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,640
Am I still alive?

281
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Of course, you are alive.

282
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,520
Not only you are alive,

283
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,560
Devil Lord is alive, too.

284
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,480
He is right next door.

285
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,800
We fell that far,

286
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,360
and my brother was stabbed.

287
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,960
How did we manage to survive?

288
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
You and Devil Lord fell
to the bottom of the cliff.

289
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,000
I didn't want your bodies left in the wild,

290
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,960
so Yi Yaogua and I went to look for you.

291
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,640
When we got there,

292
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,960
we found you lying there.

293
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,320
Thank goodness you were both alive.

294
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,040
Qing Feng

295
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,640
What would I do without you?

296
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,320
It's fine now.

297
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,840
Everything is over.

298
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,400
By the way,

299
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,280
everyone thinks you and Devil Lord are dead,

300
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,440
so you have to stay here and can't go anywhere

301
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,480
until they forget about this matter.

302
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,400
Okay.

303
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,400
Where exactly are we?

304
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,720
This is...

305
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
This is my house in the Otherworld Town,

306
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,280
but soon

307
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,000
it will also be Qing Feng's house.

308
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,800
What's going on with you guys?

309
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Qing Feng and I are no longer

310
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,360
apprentices of Yuhua Sect.

311
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,240
She is the new owner of Qingcheng Sect,

312
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,480
while I am her fiancé.

313
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,440
All the houses of my family

314
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,280
will become the territory of Qingcheng Sect.

315
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,640
You guys made quite the progress

316
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
while I was asleep.

317
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,120
When's the wedding?

318
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,600
Don't listen to him.

319
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,760
I haven't even said yes yet.

320
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,880
I've prepared her dowry.

321
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
It'll happen soon.

322
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,920
I want to see my brother, Shi Dong.

323
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,080
His room is across from yours.

324
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,520
Was it wrong to

325
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,520
hide it from her like this?

326
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,800
I think we should tell her the truth.

327
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,720
No.

328
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,680
Things happened these days

329
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,440
are enough to prove

330
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,040
Yuan Zhao's determination to kill Shi Xia.

331
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,520
If we choose to tell her the truth now,

332
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,680
we would ruin Master Hou Chi's efforts.

333
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,200
Ow ow owie.

334
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,160
It hurts. Be gentle.

335
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,800
It was you who stabbed him first.

336
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,000
He only fought back.

337
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,240
My silly sister.

338
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,640
He meant to kill me,

339
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,120
and you are still on his side.

340
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,160
Quit mumbling.

341
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
The moment he decided to kill us,

342
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,200
my love for him was totally gone.

343
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,200
Since I have paid all that's due,

344
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,440
his life

345
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,240
matters to me no more.

346
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,480
Then why are you still wearing this ring

347
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,360
he gave you?

348
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
I just forgot to take it off.

349
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,240
Just throw it away for me.

350
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,400
Even when I sleep, it's harsh to my skin.

351
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,640
I put all the scenery in the yard

352
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,200
into this snow globe.

353
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,080
If you ever feel homesick,

354
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,480
just take a look at it.

355
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,440
What about you? Are you also in it?

356
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,680
Seasons may go by,

357
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
but in this snow globe

358
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
it's always summer.

359
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,720
(You said you liked trees,)

360
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,840
(so I made you a ring of leaves,)

361
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,800
(not sure if you like it.)

362
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,640
The liquor has already gone.

363
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,200
Never mind.

364
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
I have another pot.

365
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,520
Hou Chi

366
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,800
Why don't you trust me?

367
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,560
(Why she is drinking again?)

368
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,400
Even if you have taken
the Love-forgetting Potion,

369
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,680
you should have believed in me.

370
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,960
Do I look like a bad guy?

371
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
The cliff was that high.

372
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,800
If I were not so lucky,

373
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,560
I would have died for good.

374
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,200
Hou Chi

375
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,800
You are the coldest, hardest

376
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
and the most stupid
piece of log in this world.

377
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,320
You know nothing about love.

378
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,040
Now listen up.

379
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,320
My next boyfriend

380
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,960
is sweet, gentle, and considerate.

381
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,800
He's taller and finer than you, too.

382
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,280
I will get myself a boyfriend here,

383
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,480
and I'll get another one as I go home.

384
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,600
Just wait and see.

385
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,760
However merciless you are to me,

386
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,240
I can't forget your love on my part.

387
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,480
Even without me,

388
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,160
you are still the brightest star
in the night sky.

389
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,760
Tomorrow
you'll enjoy the highlight of your life.

390
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,080
I hope whatever the Celestial Seal foretold

391
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,400
never comes true.

392
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,040
What you miss at day

393
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,120
what you dream at night.

394
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,360
It feels just like the real thing.

395
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,840
The liquor of the rich sure is something.

396
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,160
(Is she sleepwalking?)

397
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,920
Shi Xia

398
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,440
He can even talk.

399
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,840
(If she wakes up in shock,)

400
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,320
(this will be hard to explain.)

401
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,280
I won't let you get away

402
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,640
in my own dream.

403
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,120
It's just a dream after all.

404
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,760
I can do whatever I want.
