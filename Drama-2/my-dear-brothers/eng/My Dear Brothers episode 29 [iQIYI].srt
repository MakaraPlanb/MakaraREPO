My Dear Brothers
EP29

2
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,479
Shi Xia

3
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,960
You awake?

4
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,720
Immortal Venerable Bi Hong

5
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,960
Qiu Li

6
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
Why are you in my room?

7
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,560
I knew you were pretending during the day.

8
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,920
Technically,

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm completely cured.

10
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
From now on,

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,880
there is no Bai Li, a weak chick in the world,

12
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,120
but only me, Qiu Li--the Immortal Aunt
of the Devil Sect.

13
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,240
Bi Hong, you're my biological brother.

14
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
Why do you hate me so much?

15
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,400
As your sister, I've kept

16
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,680
a great secret for you.

17
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
If you continue to help me,

18
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,320
I will consider

19
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,880
to help you transplant the Holy Root
and regain the Holy Power.

20
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,079
Otherwise...

21
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,079
I'm out of the Yuhua Sect.

22
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,240
So I have nothing to do with that sh*t.

23
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,880
All I want is to live as an ordinary people.

24
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,079
So, please give me the quarter

25
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,720
and let me go.

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,920
My game rule is to

27
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,880
continue,

28
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,840
and you have no choice to quit.

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
It's not an either-or game.

30
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,000
All you want

31
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,280
is to retaliate against Dad
and the Yuhua Sect.

32
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,960
What happened before was an accident.

33
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,959
Dad has been guilty all his life.

34
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
Can't you forgive him?

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,160
An accident?

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
But when it happened,

37
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,040
he chose you,

38
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,160
and abandoned me and my mother.

39
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm the one who had been abandoned.

40
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,280
You have no right to ask me to forgive him.

41
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,240
Qiu Li

42
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Bi Hong, remember.

43
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
You owe me this.

44
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,320
Shi Xia, the ward has been broken.

45
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,240
Let's go.

46
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,520
(It's chill at night.)

47
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,360
(She's just an ordinary person,
and she can't bear the chill.)

48
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,520
(Forget it.)

49
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,960
(She would get me wrong when she wakes up.)

50
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,760
Hou Chi

51
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,760
Since you're here,

52
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
why don't you show up?

53
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,040
Yue, he's your brother,

54
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
don't hurt him.

55
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,240
Don't call me that.

56
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm here today to negotiate with you.

57
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,640
If you promise what I said,

58
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,280
I will let him go.

59
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
What do you want?

60
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,200
Trade your disciple's Holy Root

61
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,040
for your son's life.

62
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,120
It's all my fault.

63
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,440
Do what you want to me.

64
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Don't hurt others.

65
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,920
You asked me not to hurt others?

66
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
But who

67
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
made me like this?

68
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,840
The things you cherish,

69
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,320
I will destroy them one by one.

70
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,440
With your ability,

71
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
you can't threaten me.

72
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,480
If I don't have the leverage,

73
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,799
how can I come to talk to you?

74
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,840
Bi Hong lost his sight in the dark forest,

75
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
and later he regained it.

76
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,160
Don't you think it's strange?

77
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,640
What do you mean?

78
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
While Yuan Gui disappeared,

79
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
Bi Hong regained his sight.

80
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
Is there really

81
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
such a coincidence in the world?

82
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,480
You mean

83
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,240
Hong killed Yuan Gui,

84
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,040
and took his sight?

85
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,840
Impossible...

86
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,520
It's impossible.

87
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Yuan Gui's corpse is in the vicinity
of the forest in the Devil Sect.

88
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
If you don't believe it,

89
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,280
go and have a look.

90
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
If you don't promise me today,

91
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
Bi Hong's secret

92
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
will spread along the streets and lanes.

93
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,240
At that time, those decent people

94
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,560
will not tolerate him.

95
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,800
Let me think about it.

96
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,640
I want to see

97
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,560
which one you will choose

98
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,680
between your useless son

99
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
and a good disciple?

100
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,720
(I seem to be lying on someone's lap.)

101
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,600
(There should be only me and Hou Chi.)

102
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
(So...)

103
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,520
(I'm lying on his lap...)

104
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,480
(How could I do that?)

105
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,880
(Shi Xia)

106
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,240
(Good for you.)

107
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,280
(What should I do now?)

108
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,360
(If I get up,)

109
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,360
(it would be so embarrassing.)

110
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,520
(Anyway, he's meditating now.)

111
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,000
(I won't move until he moves.)

112
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,280
Since you wake up,

113
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
now get up.

114
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,760
Sorry.

115
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,160
Maybe I'm used to sleeping on a pillow,

116
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
so I can't fall asleep without it.

117
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,480
The ward was broke.

118
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,800
Let's get out of here.

119
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
When did you break it?

120
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,280
Just now.

121
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
Thank you.

122
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,480
Never mind.

123
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,440
You two spent the night together,

124
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,600
but no progress at all.

125
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
-How dare you to throw me under the bus.  -It hurts.

126
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
You set a trap for me?

127
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,520
I was trying to help you.

128
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,840
Because of him, you didn't want to go home
and gave up your dreams.

129
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
I don't believe that
you will give up that easily.

130
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,400
Tell me the truth,

131
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,000
or I will make troubles for you every day.

132
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,600
Okay, let me tell you.

133
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
You're not allowed to intervene

134
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,200
the relationship between me and Hou Chi.

135
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,720
Love Calamity?

136
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,240
Love-forgetting Potion?

137
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,760
Really?

138
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,280
Such a clichÃ©,

139
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,520
and it happened to you.

140
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,560
I see.

141
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,960
This is not a script for the hero at all.

142
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,080
It is clearly a sweet script for the heroine.

143
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,520
He doesn't remember me anymore.

144
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,000
It's useless for me to do anything.

145
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,160
Only if I stay away from him,

146
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,160
he will be able to live well.

147
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,640
I promise you.

148
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,280
When we go back,

149
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,160
I will help you find a boyfriend.

150
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,680
And he will be better than Hou Chi,

151
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,520
okay?

152
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,600
Is it all right?

153
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
Let's go shopping.

154
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,920
Go.

155
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,040
This is Hou Chi's seal
as the head of the Alliance.

156
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
He may have accidentally lost it just now.

157
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,600
I need to give it back to him.

158
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,440
No hurry.

159
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,440
I failed in competing for
the head of the Alliance.

160
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Now it would be nice to touch the seal.

161
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
Don't mess up with it.

162
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,160
What are you doing?

163
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,800
Such a good gem,

164
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,080
it must be worth a lot of money.

165
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,880
Don't touch it...

166
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,160
Did you see it?

167
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Why do I feel this place is a bit familiar?

168
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,400
It's the Celestial Palace.

169
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,400
Well, is this seal able to predict the future?

170
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
If that's the case,

171
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,720
it will be dangerous for Hou Chi
to enter the Celestial Palace, right?

172
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,240
Is there anything wrong with you?

173
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,880
Yuan Zhao wants to kill you,

174
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,920
and you want to look for his help?

175
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,480
He wants to kill me because of Hou Chi.

176
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
He hopes

177
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,840
Hou Chi to be safe and sound the most.

178
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,600
The owner Master

179
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,760
Who's that?

180
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,160
What are you doing here?

181
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,040
I have something important
to discuss with you.

182
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,000
You did violate the agreement

183
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,240
and show up in front of Hou Chi.

184
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
What do you want?

185
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,880
There's one thing related to his life that

186
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,840
I must tell you.

187
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,520
There is no one in this world

188
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
can endanger Hou Chi's life,

189
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
except you.

190
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,760
Old grumpy

191
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,360
Why do you always have the last word?

192
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,800
Can you listen to her first?

193
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,960
I found Hou Chi's seal
as the head of the Alliance,

194
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,800
and touched the gem inside by accident.

195
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,720
I saw the collapse of the Celestial Palace.

196
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,960
You touched the Celestial Seal?

197
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,560
Yes, what's wrong?

198
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,080
Now the point is that

199
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
Hou Chi may be in danger
if he enters the Celestial Palace.

200
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,400
Shouldn't you find a way

201
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,680
to save your disciple?

202
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,640
In other words,

203
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,040
Hou Chi has no idea that

204
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,480
you two touched the Celestial Seal.

205
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,600
Yes.

206
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,840
Then tell me,

207
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,000
what did you see?

208
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
I just saw Hou Chi get seriously injured

209
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,560
after he entered the Wonderland Town.

210
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,960
The frames were not coherent,

211
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,480
so I can't say what happened.

212
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,720
Hou Chi is highly-skilled.

213
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,480
If you let him touch the Celestial Seal,

214
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,880
maybe he is able to
prevent trouble before it happens.

215
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,760
Is there anyone else knowing about this

216
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,400
except you?

217
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Nope.

218
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,280
It matters a great deal,

219
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,480
so I can't privately decide

220
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,640
to let Hou Chi touch the Celestial Seal.

221
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,320
I'll tell Shen Guan

222
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,880
and discuss it with her.

223
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,200
Could you please tell me

224
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,720
the result after you discussed with Shen Guan?

225
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,920
Okay.

226
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
But you have to promise me

227
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
that you will no longer be close to Hou Chi.

228
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,880
Let's meet at the foot of the Houshan of
the Wonderland Town tomorrow morning.

229
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,520
I will tell you about that.

230
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,880
Deal.

231
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,840
Let's go.

232
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,600
Go.

233
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,360
Hong

234
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,760
Did you know?

235
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,520
There has been a weight

236
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,080
in my mind

237
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,120
for a long time.

238
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,280
I hope

239
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,480
when you know about the whole thing one day,

240
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,680
you won't blame me and your mother.

241
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Don't worry.

242
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,520
This time,

243
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,200
I will protect you.

244
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,600
Yuan Zhao is not punctual.

245
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,880
Do you think

246
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,320
Shen Guan will agree to allow Hou Chi

247
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,440
to touch the Celestial Seal in advance?

248
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:11,880
Relax.

249
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,200
If she doesn't agree,

250
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,440
I will lead the Devil Sect to make a big fuss
at the Immortals Alliance's ceremony.

251
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,960
If they don't save Hou Chi,

252
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,560
I will help you out there.

253
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,680
The man is motionless.

254
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,280
He seems to be dead.

255
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
Let's go and see if we can save him.

256
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,840
Master Yuan Gui

257
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,520
The one who disappeared in the Devil Sect?

258
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,680
Stop it.

259
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,840
Master Yuan Gui

260
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,680
Junior

261
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,720
Junior

262
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
The fatal wound on my Junior

263
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,160
was made by the instrument of Devil Lord.

264
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,360
You killed him.

265
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,720
It was not us.

266
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,920
We saw him lying here

267
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,440
as soon as we arrived.

268
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,880
He was dead at the time.

269
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,280
How dare you to excuse
as the evidences are here?

270
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,360
Hou Chi, take them down.

271
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,840
We didn't kill him.

272
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,280
Chase after them.

273
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,760
What are you waiting for?

274
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,240
Yes.

275
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,320
Junior

276
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,120
I didn't expect that it was my kids

277
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
who killed you.

278
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm sorry.

279
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,800
You two knew too much.

280
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,160
And trading your lives

281
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
in exchange for the peace
of Hong and the world,

282
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,360
it is a worthy death for you.

283
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,680
Go.

284
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,520
Immortal Aunt, there's something wrong.

285
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,680
Devil Lord is in trouble.

286
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,440
What?

287
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,040
You have no way to escape,

288
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,680
why not give up?

289
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,480
It's me who killed Yuan Gui.

290
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,480
It has nothing to do with Shi Xia.

291
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,440
Don't talk nonsense.

292
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,000
Don't confess what you haven't done.

293
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,520
Don't worry.

294
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,320
I'm here, and I'll protect you.

295
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,120
Why should I let you
take responsibility alone?

296
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,760
You're so close.

297
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,280
And I will do you a favor.

298
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,120
You can die together.

299
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,440
Master

300
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,120
Devil Lord is no longer bloodthirsty,

301
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,960
and Shi Xia is not a cruel person.

302
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
I beg you to spare them.

303
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,920
I agree.

304
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,840
You got big nerve.

305
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,600
Who dare to plead for them,

306
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,360
he will not be my disciple any more.

307
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,200
I will protect Shi Xia
even if I can't be your disciple.

308
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,360
Qing Feng

309
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,360
Don't do anything stupid for me.

310
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,880
Come on,

311
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,440
take them away.

312
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,040
Yes.

313
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,600
In the past, the Devil Sect killed
countless decent people.

314
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,240
Today, Devil Lord and his sister
killed the elder of our Yuhua Sect.

315
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,840
I'll carry God's will

316
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,160
to kill the siblings

317
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,040
to claim the justice and comfort the dead souls.

318
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,400
Kill Devil Lord to claim the justice.

319
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,400
Master

320
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,600
Master

321
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,200
Let me do it.

322
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
The one who killed Master Yuan Gui

323
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,800
is not my brother.

324
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,280
Seeing is believing.

325
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,960
I only believe what I see.

326
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,760
Shi Dong was right.

327
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,560
After drinking of the Love-forgetting Potion,

328
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,520
you became indifferent.

329
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,040
Master Yuan Gui treated me nice,

330
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,560
and I'll revenge for him today.

331
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,280
Brother

332
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
-Brother  -Shi Xia
