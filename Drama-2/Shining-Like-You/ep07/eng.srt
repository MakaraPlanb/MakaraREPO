You’ll see.

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,675
What?

00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,750
Where are you?

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,975
OK. I’m on my way.

33
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,400
Others don’t understand people like us.

34
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:58,800
They mistake genius

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,275
as madness.

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,925
Well, there’s a fine line between them.

37
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,550
It’s up to you

38
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:09,575
to cross it or not.

39
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:15,750
Listen, the path you choose

40
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,125
will lead you to a bigger world.

41
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:19,750
How do you know that?

42
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,600
I can see your future.

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,600
The script has already said it.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,325
It’ll be a bumpy road,

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,100
but remember,

46
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:36,225
follow your heart

47
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,450
and stick to your choice.

48
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,425

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,425
has a silver lining.

50
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:12,650
Don’t do this to him!

51
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,375

00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:20,696
Move!

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,275
I can see your future!

55
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:28,825
I can see your future!

56
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,525
I’m sorry.

57
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:00,100
I’ve been up all night

58
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:01,450
and no, I can’t be with you

59
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:05,125
(Bai Qiao)
because of someone else.

60
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,600
Hello, dad?

61
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:15,425
Qiyi,

62
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,975
your flight is tomorrow.

63
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:20,100
Is your speech ready?

64
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,475
Uh, yeah.

65
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:22,750
Let me take a look.

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
Oh, and I booked the 10 am one.

67
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,750
I’ll pick you up at the airport.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
Have a safe trip.

69
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,075
A carry-on will do.

70
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Is there anything else?

71
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:33,900
Dad.

72
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,200
Yeah?

73
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,925
Must I go back?

74
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:38,700
Why? You don’t want to?

75
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,200
Follow your heart

76
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,375
and stick to your choice.

77
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,950
Every cloud

78
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:52,025
has a silver lining.

79
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,225
My schedule is tight at school.

80
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,725
And I mean,

81
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,175
everyone has their own dreams

82
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,600
and paths they choose.

83
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,850
We should respect that,

84
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,900
shouldn’t we?

85
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:11,250
Alright.

86
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,225
Your mom and I have discussed that.

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,800
Also,

88
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,400
your high school has made a plan B.

89
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,900
If you can’t make it,

90
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,875
I’ll deliver a speech for you.

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,425
Study hard.

92
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,450
Talk to you later.

93
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,900
Dad...

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,450
Hey...

95
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,500
(2018 Musical Festival)

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Excuse me.

97
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,450
Coming through.

98
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,550
Excuse me. Excuse me.

99
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,550
Sorry. Excuse me.

100
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:55,975
Qiyi,

101
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:57,700
you can do The White-Haired Girl, right?

102
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,300
Sign up for it.

103
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,950
That’s a Chinese new opera,

104
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,675
technically, not a musical.

105
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,550
Besides, I don’t have a partner.

106
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,200
Is there such a thing as new opera?

107
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:13,475
Let’s go back
and I’ll tell you about it.

108
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,300
Come on.

109
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,225
Let’s go. Come.

110
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:30,375
Is this The White-Haired Girl?

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,275
Yeah.

112
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,425
My grandma used to play in it.

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,425
A family of artists, should I say?

114
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:40,425
No wonder your parents
want you to study acting.

115
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,075
It runs in your veins.

116
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,825
You really shouldn’t

117
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:44,750
miss the Musial Festival.

118
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,225
“Someday, when the wind blows,

119
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:49,325
Roc Bird will rise high without limits.”

120
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,925
Have you been there the whole time?

121
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,450
You almost made me jump.

122
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:57,900
Hi, Bai Qiao.

123
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,750
Are you interested in
this Musical Festival?

124
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,200
We can play together.

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,825
What do you think?

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,775
I’ve already found someone.

127
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,225
OK.

128
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,375
So pretentious!

129
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:20,900
What’s up with you?

130
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:24,750
I got dumped.

131
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,875
By whom?

132
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,025
Li Xiao told Bai Qiao he likes her.

133
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,550
She knew I was into him,

134
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:32,875
but she didn’t turn him down.

135
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,200
And?

136
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,825
That’s it!

137
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,725
They’re seeing each other, no doubt!

138
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:38,900
I don’t think so.

139
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,950
Qiyi,

140
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,600
if you and Zhang Yang

141
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,900
are on the stage together,

142
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,675
you’ll crush her!

143
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:45,925
After that,

144
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,500
Li Xiao will give her up.

145
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,050
Should I ask Zhang Yang?

146
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:00,525
What if he says no?

147
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,225
Well,

148
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,650
I’ll close my eyes and count to 10.

149
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,825
If he shows up,

150
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,175
then I’ll do it.

151
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:25,500
Miss,

152
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,275
step aside, please.

153
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,550
Sorry, sir.

154
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:29,350
That doesn’t count.

155
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,475
Start over. One more time.

156
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:35,200
One, two, three, four...

157
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,675
Hey.

158
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,075
Why walking with your eyes closed?

159
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,700
I’m getting to know the blind.

160
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,494
I see.

161
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,150
Be careful. Don’t get hurt.

162
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:47,425
I will.

163
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,775
Zhang Yang.

164
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:49,550
Yeah?

165
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,550
Uh...

166
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,325
Will you be my partner
at the Musical Festival?

00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,500
Sure.

168
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:57,675
You’ll do it?

169
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:58,250
Yeah.

170
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,475
OK then. I’ll call you later.

171
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,375

00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:35,150
♪Can’t stop the passion to chase♪

193
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,575
♪Even if there’s a trap ahead♪

194
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:45,450
♪I’m still proud, I’m still going♪

195
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:57,825
- You...
- You...

196
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,400
Go ahead.

197
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,600
You first.

198
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,075
I knew you were a straight-A student,

199
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,225
but you can also sing!

200
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,100
That’s too nice of you to say that.

201
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,025
I’ve only started it
since this semester.

202
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,775
Thank you

203
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,125
for practicing with me.

204
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,950
We’ve known each other for ages.

205
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,025
No more thanks.

206
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
It’s late.

207
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,200
You should probably go back.

208
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,875
Yeah.

209
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,575
I’ll see you tomorrow.

210
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,425
Bye.

211
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,300
See you.

212
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,175
Busted!

213
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:42,875
Qiyi,

214
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,975
did you two hook up behind my back?

215
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:46,225
I saw everything.

216
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,225
He patted you.

217
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,150
We aren’t there yet.

218
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,300
A rendezvous then?

219
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,525
Of course not.

220
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,550
Kaixin,

221
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,150
you can eat

222
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,025
as much as you can tomorrow.

223
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,975
My treat.

224
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:02,100
Really?

225
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,575
Yeah.

226
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:03,450
I promise.

227
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,550
But I remember

228
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,025
we’ll get weighed in class tomorrow.

229
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:12,000
“Four tones are the key
to proper pronunciation.”

230
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,150
“Four tones are the key
to proper pronunciation.”

231
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,450
“High and low, rise and fall.”

232
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,975
“High and low, rise and fall.”

233
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:22,325
“Be accurate and precise.”

234
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,900
“Be accurate and precise.”

235
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,275
Our next class

236
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,275
is about imagination.

237
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:33,200
Please be prepared for it.

238
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,875
That’s all for today.

239
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,650
Dismissed.

240
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,675
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

241
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:40,775
See you, Mr. Sun.

242
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:41,575
Thank you, sir.

243
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:44,700
Qiyi,

244
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,125
are you still going to
rehearse with Zhang Yang?

245
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,050
Not today.

246
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,625
OK.

247
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,025
When are you guys gonna go public?

248
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,775
Stop it!

249
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,100
Go ahead.

250
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,450
A rainstorm is coming tonight.

251
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,050
Don’t be out too late.

252
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,750
I won’t.

253
00:13:58,975 --> 00:13:59,500
See you.

254
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,200
- Bye.
- See you.

255
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,200
What the heck?

256
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,375
The arrow hasn’t been shot

257
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,325
and they’re together already?

258
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,675
Where’s your arrow?

259
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,200
It’s...

260
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:13,675
- Where is it?
- It’s right here! Here!

261
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:14,875
Go away! Get out of here!

262
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:23,950
Zhang Yang,

263
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:25,750
why are you still here?

264
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,900
What do you mean?

265
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,025
Aren’t you supposed to
rehearse with Know-it-all?

266
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,725
Know-it-all?

267
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,425
You mean Qiyi?

268
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,900
I’m occupied.

269
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
We’re doing it tomorrow morning.

270
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,775
Here you are.

271
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,625
Thanks

272
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:55,875
for that night.

273
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,625
Thank you.

274
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,525
Come on, guys.

275
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,775
Let’s go shoot hoops!

276
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:20,000
Chop-chop!

277
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,275
Take it!

278
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,375
Nice place!

279
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,275
It’s quiet.

280
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,150
What’s the deal?

281
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,000
Two versus two?

282
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,500
Warm up first.

283
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,050
Sure.

284
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,000
Your ball!

285
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,725
Here.

286
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,625
What did you and that bar owner

287
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,350
talk about that day?

288
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,050
I didn’t know she was your type.

289
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:49,950
It’s not what you think.

290
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,425
Pass!

291
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,825
Hey,

292
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:57,575
did you and Qiyi grow up together?

293
00:15:57,575 --> 00:15:58,100
Mhmm.

294
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,050
You two must’ve gone way back.

295
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,800
Yeah, about 10 years.

296
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,550
Not everyone can be friends

297
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,450
with a know-it-all.

298
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:13,500
You don’t know her.

299
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:15,675
Do you?

300
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,750
Zhang Yang,

301
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,775
would you date a girl

302
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,125
like Qiyi?

303
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,600
She’s cute.

304
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,650
You two are meant to be. Trust me.

305
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,600
I can set you two up if you want.

306
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,975
Are you gonna play or not?

307
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,575
Yeah, yeah, let’s do it.

308
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,450
What’s wrong with you?

309
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:39,800
I should ask you that!

310
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,200
What’s your problem?

311
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,675
That’s our bottle there.

312
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:45,500
We call dibs on the court.

313
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,400
Is there such a rule?

314
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:47,450
Ignore them.

315
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,675
- Let’s play.
- Calm down.

316
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:49,475
Don’t be mad.

317
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,300
Let’s go back.

318
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,000
We can play at our school.

319
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,425
Your school? SUA?

320
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,525
Basketball isn’t for you punks!

321
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:57,250
Right, Li Zhao?

322
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,925
Who are you calling a punk?

323
00:16:58,925 --> 00:16:59,750
Is there a problem?

324
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,225
I dare you to play against us!

325
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:02,500
Piss off if you lose!

326
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,200
Deal!

327
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:05,350
You throw it.

328
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,300
I...

329
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:17,325
Back!

330
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:28,100
SUA! SUA!

331
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,000
Nice shot!

332
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,275
Nice! Yeah!

333
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,575
Where did Zhang Yang go?

334
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,300
To play the piano at the Bar.

335
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,425
I gotta say

336
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:06,900
he’s a good player.

337
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:07,925
Sit here.

338
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:08,450
Gosh!

339
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,650
Hi, Qiyi!

340
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,500
Thanks, guys.

341
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:19,550
I’ll go get food.

342
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,275
Hey,

343
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,550
what did you get?

344
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,125
Smells good.

345
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,875
Come on! I’m not gonna grab it.

346
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:30,975
Just relax.

347
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:34,925
Qiyi,

348
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,150
I’m starving.

349
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,350
Could you get me some food?

350
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,700
Leave him to starve to death.

351
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,250
What did I do to you?

352
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:46,300
Stay out of this!

353
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,125
Qiyi,

354
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,725
I’ll have the same as Fang Yan.

355
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,725
I should help him.

356
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,075
He can’t walk...

357
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,625
Qiyi,

358
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,075
you’re a savior!

359
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,050
Go away!

360
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
Eat your food.

361
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,500
Why are you staring at me?

362
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:24,125
Don’t...

363
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,600
Be quiet.

364
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:33,600
How’s your leg?

365
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,400
We can go to the Health Center

366
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,900
and have Xiaoyu treat you.

367
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,675
I’m good.

368
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:42,400
No need to trouble your girl.

369
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,443
Speaking of which,

370
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,250
when are you gonna introduce her to us?

371
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,375
Qiyi, hurry!

372
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,025
Pig feet are selling fast.

373
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,950
What are you doing?

374
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,425
What’s wrong?

375
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:57,525
People are watching us.

376
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,425
- Here’s your food.
- Thanks.

377
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,000
OK.

378
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,325
Thank you, Qiyi.

379
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:12,525
You’re so sweet.

380
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,825
Qiyi.

381
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:17,325
Yeah?

382
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:17,950
Your phone.

383
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,750
You touched my phone?

384
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:21,750
My battery died,

385
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,575
so I used yours.

386
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,400
But you don’t know my password.

387
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,600
671671, no?

388
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:32,725
Sanshang,

389
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,275
go get drinks for everyone.

390
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:38,025
I’ll go with him.

391
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,300
Are you done?

392
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,800
Sanshang,

393
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,725
I’m not sure

394
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,150
if I should tell you this.

395
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,100
What’s wrong?

396
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:00,000
Take a look.

397
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:06,875
You get it?

398
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:10,825
I think

399
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,375
that’s your girl.

400
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:22,675
That’s all I know.

401
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,500
The rest

402
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,400
is up to you.

403
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:41,150
Qiyi,

404
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,400
go get him!

405
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,300
Du Ang pretended to be you
and told Zhang Yang you like him?

406
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:50,475
I’m gonna kill him!

407
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,350
Oh, my God!

408
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,000
Du Ang is...

409
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:55,400
a genius!

410
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,300
Kaixin!

411
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,550
He did you a favor.

412
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,550
Or when would you tell him yourself?

413
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,975
Show me what he sent.

414
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,450
(Qiyi: Zhang Yang, I like you.
If you like me back,

415
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,550
meet me at
the west gate pavilion tonight at 8.)

416
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,700
How clever!

417
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:15,625
This is perfect!

418
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:17,925
Du Ang

419
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,075
is annoying most of the time,

420
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,875
but he can step up if necessary.

421
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,025
He’s driving me nuts!

422
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,350
Keep it down, will you?

423
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:33,925
You woke me up.

424
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:43,100
What should I do?

425
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,675
The gun is loaded.

426
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,175
Just pull the trigger.

427
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,925
I can’t.

428
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,375
Yes, you can!

429
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:16,550
(Zoom in)

430
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:22,050
What’s going on between them?

431
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,025
Can you give it a rest?

432
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,800
You don’t understand.

433
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,200
I’m having a strange feeling.

434
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,650
I wonder how Zhang Yang

435
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,250
and Qiyi’s date goes.

436
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,625
She’s not dating you.

437
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:47,850
Why are you so jumpy?

438
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,500
I don’t know.

439
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,325
It’s like

440
00:24:51,475 --> 00:24:53,250
I’m having butterflies in my stomach.

441
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,975
Hey,

442
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,150
what were you thinking?

443
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,275
Why did you send that text?

444
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:03,200
I meant to give them a push.

445
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,725
Otherwise, at her rate,

446
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,150
she’d drag her feet forever.

447
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,900
What if Zhang Yang doesn’t like her?

448
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,575
No way!

449
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,650
I asked him earlier.

450
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:14,650
He said she’s cute.

451
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,125
Dude,

452
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,050
you’ve been on that page for an hour.

453
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:29,025
Why do you care?

454
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:31,725
Weirdo.

455
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:44,036
(Du Ang: Are you out?
It’s now or never!)

456
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,125
What are you still doing here?

457
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:48,925
It’s 7:45 pm already.

458
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,825
Stop pacing yourself!

459
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:21,925
Can’t you sit down?

460
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,275
She texted me back.

461
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:32,125
She’s out.

462
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,125
Will Zhang Yang be back tonight?

463
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:26,675
I don’t know.

464
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,575
(Bai Qiao)
Give up if Zhang Yang still hasn’t

465
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:43,722
shown up.

466
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,675
That day at the party,
I saw him and that bar owner...

467
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,650
You should probably see for yourself.

468
00:29:46,725 --> 00:29:52,500
(San Francisco)

469
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:05,925
No kidding!

470
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,125
Qiyi stayed out all night, too?

471
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:08,950
No, it’s wrong.

472
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:09,550
My pa says

473
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,900
girls can’t do that.

474
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,500
What?

475
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,625
It’s wrong to...

476
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,250
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

477
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:15,300
It doesn’t feel right.

478
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:16,950
I don’t believe it.

479
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:17,975
That was only their first date.

480
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,500
Even I couldn’t make that happen.

481
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,575
Enough.

482
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,150
Go ask Kaixin.

483
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,750
Kaixin...

484
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,425
Go away!

485
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:36,025
I...

486
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:37,275
All men are jerks!

487
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,125
- I haven’t said...
- Could you please

488
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,225
leave us alone?

489
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:39,800
Zhang Yang...

490
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,550
Don’t even go there!

491
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:41,975
He’s really getting on my nerves!

492
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,350
What happened last night?

493
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,700
Zhang Yang was a no-show.

494
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,275
Qiyi waited and waited in the rain

495
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:51,400
and came back with a fever.

496
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:53,950
Kaixin...

497
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,325
Shut up and shove off!

498
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,550
Fever?

499
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,575
(Du Ang: Qiyi, are you OK?)

500
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:41,800
(I’m really sorry.)

501
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,420
(Talk to me, please!)

502
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,650
(It’s all my fault.)

503
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,250
(I shouldn’t have interfered.)

504
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,900
(Qiyi: I’m fine.)

505
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:03,050
(Du Ang: Hotpot on me. It’ll cure you.)

506
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:15,750
(Qiyi: It’s just that I lost a partner.)

507
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,775
♪Don’t dare to reveal♪

508
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,525
Hey, man.

509
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:28,575
Come, Qiyi.

510
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:29,050
Sit.

511
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,600
So,

512
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,075
are you happy with your new partner?

513
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,825
This guy’s only second to me

514
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,975
in terms of singing in our class.

515
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:41,125
He’s your man.

516
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:43,000
Take your time.

517
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,725
I’ll leave you two alone.

518
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,450
Have you decided on the verse?

519
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,500
We were supposed to do Balcony.

520
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,350
It’s boring to do
someone else’s work.

521
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,525
Let’s try something different.

522
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,625
I’ll go get pills for you.

523
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,400
Be right back.

524
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,475
Doctor,

525
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:41,625
I need pills for colds.

526
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,250
Signs of headache?

527
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:44,625
Uh...

528
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:46,675
Sore throat?

529
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,950
Uh...

530
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,150
Do you cough or not?

531
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:53,300
Yeah.

532
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,950
There was a fever

533
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,975
because of the rain last night.

534
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,925
Doctor,

535
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,225
give me everything you got.

536
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:00,325
Take them on time.

537
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,000
Is this it?

538
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,975
Hi, there.

539
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,650
I was practicing next door.

540
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,125
Are you OK? You don’t look well.

541
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,925
Are you sick?

542
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,700
Hey,

543
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,225
when is our next rehearsal?

544
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,625
Didn’t Qiyi tell you

545
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,175
that she’s having a new partner?

546
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,875
A new partner?

547
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:43,150
Why?

548
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,750
Our school

549
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,450
is making our own show.

550
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,400
OK.

551
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,525
So now, you’re...

552
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,275
Lu Qiyi’s new partner.

553
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,575
You guys continue.

554
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:06,475
I’m off.

555
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,225
Zhang Yang...

556
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,250
Take the pills first.

557
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,425
What’s taking you so long?

558
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:20,550
Are you stuck in there?

559
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,850
My neck is still stiff.

560
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,050
Almost done. Be patient.

561
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,275
Is it true

562
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,800
that Bai Qiao got herself a sugar daddy?

563
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:35,025
Who knows?

564
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,750
Anyway, Lu Qiyi said so.

565
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,625
- She did?
- Let’s go.

566
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,450
What happened to you?

567
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,925
Stiff neck, remember?

568
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,950
Hold me.

569
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,875
You’re too big.

570
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:44,950
Hey!

571
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:47,575
What an ingrate!

572
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,150
Zimo.

573
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,800
Yeah?

574
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,075
Qiyi is so not herself lately.

575
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:05,125
Is there a way to cheer her up?

576
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,600
She’s doomed to suffer the heartbreak.

577
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,900
If I see that jerk,

578
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,975
I’ll kick him

579
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,050
so high into the air

580
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,300
that he’ll land on his face!

581
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:19,250
On his face!

582
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,925
Kaixin, let’s go this way.

583
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,675
Speaking of the devil!

584
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,475
How could he still eat?

585
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,125
Kaixin, chill!

586
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,050
Ask him!

587
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:46,200
Zhang Yang,

588
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,950
why did you bail on Qiyi last night?

589
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,400
Don’t play innocent.

590
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,050
Qiyi waited for you all night

591
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,050
in the rain at the pavilion.

592
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,125
What happened?

593
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:57,400
You don’t know?

594
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,225
Didn’t you see her text?

595
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,800
She said if you like her back,

596
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:02,875
meet her at
the west gate pavilion at 8 PM.

597
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,700
I didn’t receive it.

598
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:15,525
I’ll go see her.

599
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:18,425
Hey...

600
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,575
Your guitar!

601
00:37:31,825 --> 00:37:32,675
Stop calling her.

602
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:33,450
She won’t answer it.

603
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,625
I know who deleted that text.

604
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,850
(Qiyi: Zhang Yang, I like you.
If you like me back,

605
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,350
meet me at
the west gate pavilion tonight at 8.)
