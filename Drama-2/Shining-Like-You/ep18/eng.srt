Go! You can make it!

What’s up?

26
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,300
Hello, I’m here for the audition.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,180
What’s up, baby?

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,100
Here is another baby?

29
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:14,980
Hello, I’m here for Wang Hai.

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,260
Wang Kai baby.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,780
A girl is here looking for you.

32
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,740
Who is it?

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,550
I don’t know. Who are you?

34
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,260
This…

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,380
Isn’t this the crew of Jujiu?

36
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,180
You’re back.

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,020
Can you be more careful?

38
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,500
You can’t meet me
every time you get distracted.

39
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,460
When did you come back?

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,900
I’m asking you
if you could be more careful.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,500
Yes, yes. I promise.

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,980
Qiyi,

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,580
how was your audition?

44
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,460
I got eliminated.

45
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,780
But the producer let me go
for a second audition.

46
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,020
Isn’t that great?

47
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780
I went there.

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,860
He was not there.

49
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,260
Where? When?

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,380
12 o’clock

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,260
in room 1805 of Mei Qiu Fino Hotel.

52
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,940
12 o’clock?

53
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,260
You just came back from there?

54
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,860
Yes.

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,100
I wonder if I misheard it.

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,500
Maybe it’s 12 at night.

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,420
No way.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,660
If it’s really at midnight,

59
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,100
you shouldn’t go.

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,100
It’s too dangerous.

61
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,340
I think so.

62
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
Let’s wait.

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,140
If it’s 12 o’clock at night,

64
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,580
I will go with you.

65
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,540
OK.

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,540
Are you hungry?

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,600
Let’s go have some food.

68
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,700
Why is my every period so painful?

69
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,740
Have some warm water.

70
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,900
Qiyi.

71
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,420
Yes?

72
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,220
You know what?

73
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
Sanshang makes me so angry.

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,540
What’s wrong?

75
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,060
Do you know why he didn’t
go to the audition?

76
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,980
Why?

77
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,900
Because he went for an interview for

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,860
an elementary school trainee teacher.

79
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,025
He said it had a good salary

80
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,020
and could solve the household
registration problem.

81
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,620
What’s wrong with him?

82
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,580
We’re learning acting

83
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,940
just to become actors.

84
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,700
I told him. But he didn’t listen.

85
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,060
I’m so angry.

86
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,260
Everyone has his own wish.

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
By the way,

88
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,500
is my audition really 12 at night?

89
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,580
No way.

90
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,900
The audition is about to begin.

91
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,460
Don’t forget.

92
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,180
It’s really 12 at night.

93
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,380
No way!

94
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,540
Fang Yan doesn’t answer my call.

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Shall I go or not?

96
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,020
Will it be dangerous?

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,060
But, it’s hard to get this opportunity.

98
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Whatever.

99
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,820
There are many people in the hotel.

100
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,580
You don’t wait for Fang Yan?

101
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,620
It’s too late.

102
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,420
Let me go with you.

103
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,860
Just have enough rest.

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,580
I’ll send you my location when I arrive.

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,140
OK.

106
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,060
Don’t worry. Bye.

107
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,900
Bye.

108
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,900
Be careful.

109
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,820
I look around.

110
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,500
Where is my girl?

111
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,020
Sir, it’s here.

112
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,780
Just in time.

113
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,620
Coming.

114
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,820
Who are you looking for?

115
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:19,485
I…

116
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,100
My nose!

117
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,380
You… Are you insane?

118
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,460
I…

119
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,020
Who are you?

120
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,380
Li Xiao?

121
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Wang Hai?

122
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,820
Officer, thank you.

123
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,740
Alright.

124
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,062
Thanks.

125
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,620
You may leave if there is nothing else.

126
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,060
OK.

127
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,460
Mr. Sun.

128
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,820
It’s such a big misunderstanding.

129
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,900
I didn’t know you two

130
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,780
knew each other.

131
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,340
No matter what,

132
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,380
there should have been no fight.

133
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,740
This time, it’s his fault.

134
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,780
Don’t say that.

135
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,740
After Jujiu starts shooting,

136
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,940
we still have to work together.

137
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,420
I will still

138
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,860
need your help.

139
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,860
It’s all a misunderstanding.

140
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,300
Let’s forget about it.

141
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,420
Thank you.

142
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,140
We’re leaving.

143
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,780
I’ll pay your medical bill later.

144
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,260
Director Sun, that’s so kind of you.

145
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,860
See you.

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,025
Qiyi,

147
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,820
go get a car for Mr. Sun.

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,300
OK. Well…

149
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,500
It’s okay.

150
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,980
Li,

151
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,580
watch out next time.

152
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,780
Look carefully what the one

153
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,100
who lent you money looks like.

154
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,540
Don’t hit the wrong guy.

155
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,420
Luckily, we know each other.

156
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,500
If it was someone you didn’t know,

157
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,980
you would have been in big trouble.

158
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,220
What?

159
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,740
Keep away

160
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,460
from my schoolmates.

161
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,180
You brat!

162
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:41,580
(China Police)

163
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,475
Mr. Sun,

164
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,300
the car will be here soon.

165
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,660
Please wait for a while.

166
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,900
(Shocking news! Su Wen’s secret son
was revealed.)

167
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
(Su Wen has not only an ex-wife
but also an 18-year-old son!)

168
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,300
(Su Wen’s son is Fang Yan, now studying
in the School of Performing Arts of SUA.)

169
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,325
(From the photo, we can see that
little Fang Yan is handsome and cute.)

170
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:06,375
(From the photo, we can see that
little Fang Yan is handsome and cute.)

171
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,300
(Very talented in acting!)

172
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
I saw the news.

173
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,860
Why didn’t you tell me

174
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,620
Su Wen is your dad that day?

175
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
It’s of no point.

176
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,620
I’m not related to him now.

177
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,740
But you still

178
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,420
care about him, don’t you?

179
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:54,620
Fang Yan,

180
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,020
I called you out so late today

181
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,820
because I have to

182
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,900
tell you something.

183
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,700
The photo of me and Su Wen

184
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,140
is a premeditated thing,

185
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,580
and the person behind the curtain

186
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,260
is someone I know.

187
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,100
Who is it?

188
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,860
Wang Hai,

189
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,220
now the producer of Jujiu.

190
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,100
Did you get any evidence?

191
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,220
No.

192
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,620
But it was Wang Hai who asked me

193
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,950
to go to that hotel that night.

194
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,260
I opened the door

195
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,625
and saw Su Wen lying on the ground,

196
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,180
having an asthma attack.

197
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,420
Mr. Su Wen!

198
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,500
What happened?

199
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,700
I did nothing else,

200
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,460
just some first aid measures,

201
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,340
which could help him feel better.

202
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,460
Hello? Emergency services?

203
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,500
Someone needs help!

204
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,380
Then we were photographed.

205
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,020
That’s where the news came from.

206
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,940
This must have something
to do with Wang Hai.

207
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,780
Fang Yan,

208
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,060
with your permission,

209
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,740
I can stand out to clarify all this.

210
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,740
What do you want to do?

211
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,660
I’m a party involved.

212
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,780
I will tell the truth to the media.

213
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,550
(Qiyi: Fang Yan, where are you?)

214
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,375
(Qiyi: Why didn’t you answer my calls?
Is everything alright?)

215
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,975
(Qiyi: I saw the news…)

216
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:31,625
(Qiyi: Waiting for your call.)

217
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,740
Hello? Fang Yan.

218
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,780
What are you doing?

219
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,025
How was your interview?

220
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
I didn’t get the interview.

221
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,060
But I got an invitation
to the opening ceremony.

222
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,820
Don’t worry.

223
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,420
There will be a role for you then.

224
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,220
Fang Yan,

225
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,540
is Mr. Su Wen really your…?

226
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,420
Kind of.

227
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,660
I didn’t expect that.

228
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,340
Then, Su Wen…

229
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,180
About your father…

230
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,620
It’s okay.

231
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
I got to know that

232
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,540
his case

233
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,940
is a frame-up made by someone.

234
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,860
I will find evidence to clarify it.

235
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,300
Anything I can do for you?

236
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,180
There’s only one thing
you can do for me.

237
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,500
What is it? Go ahead.

238
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,220
Take good care of yourself in the crew.

239
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,275
Do your best.

240
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,620
Got it. Don’t worry.

241
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,160
(Large-scale spy film “Jujiu”
Director: Sun Zhuowen)

242
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,700
Back up! Back up! Back up a bit.

243
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,380
Higher! Higher! Come on.

244
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,660
Di… Director.

245
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,700
It… It’s all right.

246
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,300
This scene

247
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,340
is about

248
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,860
the spy, Jujiu, which is, Ms. Peony,

249
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,140
whose identity is exposed.

250
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,020
The leadership wants her to
retreat immediately.

251
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,900
But she is afraid that once she leaves,

252
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,220
the underground organization
will be undermined.

253
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,900
So she delays her leaving.

254
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,060
Qiyi,

255
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,420
the Lan you play

256
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,500
is a liaison disguised as a village girl

257
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,220
who has just escaped
the enemy’s pursuit.

258
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,180
You’ve come to the contact point.

259
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,620
Tonight is Jujiu’s last chance.

260
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,860
Got it?

261
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,700
Got it, Director.

262
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,140
OK, we’ll start if ready.

263
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,175
- OK, Director.
- Come on.

264
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:58,800
Alright.

265
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,300
All the depts., ready?

266
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,620
Xing.

267
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,540
OK.

268
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,380
Come on. Start.

269
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,660
Start filming.

270
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,225
Come on.

271
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,860
The 65th scene, shoot one, first time.

272
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,420
Three, two, one.

273
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,860
Action!

274
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,540
Now in this situation,

275
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,620
I can’t go.

276
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,675
- But the ship has arrived…
- Stop.

277
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,650
- It’ll be late if you don’t go.
- Stop! Stop!

278
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:31,075
Stop! Stop! Stop!

279
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,340
Qiyi.

280
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:35,150
Yes.

281
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,620
You took the wrong position.

282
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,140
Focus on your position.

283
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,980
You blocked Ms. Peony.

284
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,180
Again. Try again.

285
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,250
- OK. OK.
- Don’t be nervous.

286
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,380
Sorry, sir.

287
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:44,980
Relax.

288
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,860
Alright. Again.

289
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,340
Start!

290
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,375
Go.

291
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,180
OK. The 65th scene,
shoot one, second time.

292
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,340
Three, two, one.

293
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,420
Action!

294
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,860
Now in this situation,

295
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,420
I can’t go.

296
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,820
Stop.

297
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,860
Stop!

298
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:15,940
Qiyi,

299
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,900
there are two problems.

300
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,540
First,

301
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,740
don’t look at the mark on the ground.

302
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,540
It’s too obvious.

303
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,540
The other one is

304
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,020
your lyrics.

305
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,460
You have to show your attitude.

306
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,460
Think about your tasks.

307
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,140
Don’t be nervous.

308
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,850
Think about it before you say it, OK?

309
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,740
- One more time.
- OK, Director.

310
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,250
Come on.

311
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,150
Sorry.

312
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,940
One more time!

313
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,375
- She’s just a student.
- No hurry.

314
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,150
OK.

315
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:45,000
Go!

316
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,500
The 65th scene, shoot one, third time.

317
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,790
Three, two, one, action!

318
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,940
Now in this situation,

319
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,780
I can’t go.

320
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
But the ship has arrived.

321
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,450
It will be late if you don’t go.

322
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,300
If I left,

323
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,980
the whole underground station
would be exposed.

324
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,380
Ms. Peony.

325
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,660
Now you’re our only hope.

326
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,380
You have to leave tonight.

327
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Don’t worry.

328
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,780
We’ll take care of ourselves.

329
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,140
Go now.

330
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,925
Take care.

331
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,820
See you!

332
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,300
OK. Pass!

333
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,180
Qiyi, good job!

334
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,980
Come on, get in.

335
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,500
Attention!

336
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:15,940
Thank you.

337
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,860
Thank you, Xun.

338
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,940
Here. S60.

339
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,180
Qiyi, go get prepared.

340
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,260
OK.

341
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,260
Fang Yan, are you going out?

342
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,180
They won’t leave.

343
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,260
Hey! Wait!

344
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,140
How is your first-day filming?

345
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,060
I wanted to come to see you.

346
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,500
But they said there was no scene for me.

347
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,420
So I couldn’t come.

348
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,740
What’s wrong?

349
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,500
Why are you so upset?

350
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,820
Filming is totally different from
what we do in class.

351
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,940
I kept making mistakes today.

352
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,620
And I almost forgot how to act.

353
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,460
How could you not know how to act?

354
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,820
You’re the straight-A student
in our class.

355
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,860
If you can’t act,

356
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,052
what will I do?

357
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,580
Do you want me to teach you?

358
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,020
I wondered who you were.

359
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,700
Here comes our great supporting actor.

360
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,660
Why do you sound so jealous?

361
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,660
Oh, gosh!

362
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,420
Hey, let’s eat together.

363
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,340
I just don’t understand.

364
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,980
Why did they pick you?

365
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,500
Are you handsome

366
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,660
or professional?

367
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,900
Go away.

368
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,820
Mr. Sun watched secretly

369
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,020
and found that

370
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,580
I’m professional

371
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,780
and excellent.

372
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,460
What? Not convinced?

373
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,300
Du Ang.

374
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,975
Yes?

375
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,260
You’re really handsome today.

376
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,900
Really?

377
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,450
Do you know why?

378
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,000
Why?

379
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,660
Your eyes are so big today.

380
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,660
I can make them bigger.

381
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,900
Do you know why?

382
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,300
You don’t even blink
when you’re telling lies!

383
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,940
Go away!

384
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,860
Alright,

385
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,180
there must be a reason

386
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,500
for Mr. Sun to pick him.

387
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,780
You heard that?

388
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,260
Did you hear that?

389
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,220
That’s the truth.

390
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,700
Qiyi,

391
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,780
it’s so nice of you.

392
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,420
Then, what is the reason?

393
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,220
I don’t know.

394
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,580
Mr. Sun is blind.

395
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,380
The three future movie stars,

396
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,940
tell me how you feel
about your internship in the film crew.

397
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,020
Zimo.

398
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,900
You’re here!

399
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,140
Our teacher said “Behind the Scenes”
needed to be shot.

400
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,140
I came to learn something.

401
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,180
I’ve been shooting the whole day.

402
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,620
But no one cooperated with me.

403
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Come on, say something.

404
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,740
Let me first.

405
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,600
Let me.

406
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,460
Let me. Take a seat.

407
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,575
Don’t. Wait.

408
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:14,675
You… Let me. Let me.

409
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,140
After I came, I found that…

410
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,660
Are you alright?

411
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,900
I’m fine.

412
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,340
Take a seat.

413
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,060
Be careful.

414
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,780
Sorry.

415
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,340
Did you get hurt?

416
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,220
I’m fine.

417
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
What… What are you all doing?

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,771
Sorry. Sorry.

419
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:34,650
Sorry, sir.

420
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,460
You… Who are you?

421
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,380
I’m a student from SUA.

422
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,620
I came to…

423
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,180
Only staff is allowed here.

424
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,660
Go. Go out.

425
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,927
Get out.

426
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:44,825
- Get out.
- Hey, wait.

427
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,580
She is

428
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,340
a new staff
to shoot “Behind the Scenes”.

429
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,500
All the lights are rented.

430
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,300
What… What if you break it?

431
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
It… It’s not broken.

432
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,660
Be… Be careful… next time.

433
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,220
Students… should not be…
allowed to come.

434
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
OK. OK. Don’t worry.

435
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,580
Thank you.

436
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,100
How will you thank me?

437
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,900
Add me on WeChat.

438
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,100
I didn’t bring my phone here.

439
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,740
Do you want my contact?

440
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,860
Go away.

441
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,100
Hey.

442
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,060
Don’t you want to have a look?

443
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,100
These kids are amazing.

444
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,450
(Kaixin: What are you doing?)

445
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,200
(Sanshang: Waiting for the interview.)

446
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,450
(Kaixin: How do you feel?)

447
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:17,625
(Sanshang: Fine. Just a little nervous.)

448
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,660
Your girlfriend?

449
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,820
Checking on you?

450
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,820
How are you? Confident?

451
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,300
Everyone is not confident
at the beginning.

452
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,540
I just graduated a year ago.

453
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,500
Do you have any acting experience?

454
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,900
Does classwork count?

455
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,140
No, I think.

456
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,700
I’ve done a movie, a theatrical one.

457
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,660
I heard it won the Golden Broom Award.

458
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,175
(Name: Lei Wenjie Education:
Bachelor’s degree Major: Acting)

459
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,750
(Self-description: Easy-going, kind…)

460
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,650
(Xiao Wei Entertainment)

461
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,860
Please.

462
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,620
Boss,

463
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,260
the two of them want to meet you.

464
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,780
The two most popular people recently
are all here.

465
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,220
Interesting.

466
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,340
Have a seat, please.

467
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
No one took picture of you

468
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,420
when you came in just now?

469
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,860
Alright,

470
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,780
just go ahead.

471
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,420
Why are you here?

472
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,180
In this field,

473
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,700
it’s hard for stars

474
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,260
to hide away from you.

475
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,580
But,

476
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,660
you may not know it.

477
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,100
You were used by someone.

478
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,025
What? What do you mean?

479
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,580
All those things you shot are fake.

480
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,380
I was there that day

481
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,660
because a producer named Wang Hai

482
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,540
set me up.

483
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,820
He called me and told me

484
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,940
to pick up someone.

485
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,980
After I arrived and opened the door,

486
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,380
I saw Su Wen, who was
suffering from asthma.

487
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,700
So I helped him to the bed

488
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,740
and unbuttoned him

489
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,100
because it could help him to breathe.

490
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,660
That’s all.

491
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,460
The news you made up this time

492
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,140
was all designed by Wang Hai.

493
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,140
We were all set up by him actually.

494
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,020
Is what

495
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,700
I’m telling you big news?

496
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,700
Why are you telling me this?

497
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,580
I’m just a student.

498
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,220
I want to prove my innocence.

499
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,540
My reason is simple.

500
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,620
No matter how Su Wen is,

501
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,660
he is still my father.

502
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,580
That seems like a reasonable deal.

503
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,820
But

504
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,100
I’m not a greedy person.

505
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,740
To tell you the truth,

506
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,780
I’ve made enough money

507
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,020
from the news this time.

508
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,300
Aren’t you afraid that

509
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,700
I will expose this to others?

510
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,260
Actually, I’ve already known

511
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
the truth about Wang Hai.

512
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,180
But, it’s okay.

513
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,980
You can tell others.

514
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,980
Alright.

515
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,380
Since there is no cooperation,

516
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,500
we’ll leave now.

517
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,820
Wait.

518
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,820
Please don’t mind.

519
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,940
It’s our rule.

520
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,380
Easy come, difficult go.

521
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,740
Show me your bags, phones,

522
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,180
and all the things in your pockets.

523
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,540
No talks

524
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,580
in my meeting room

525
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,660
can be brought out.

526
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,700
Go!

527
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,580
After them!

528
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,820
Fang Yan!

529
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,300
Fang Yan!

530
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,980
Fang Yan!

531
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,340
Finally.

532
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,660
Tell me.

533
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,060
Why do you come to me?

534
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,460
What are you doing?

535
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,820
Go!

536
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,140
Fang Yan!

537
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,780
Are you alright?

538
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,220
Fang Yan!

539
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,180
Sense of belief.

540
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,540
Yes.

541
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,460
From now on, I am Lan.

542
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,140
Qiyi.

543
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,180
Mr. Wang.

544
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,460
You’re working so hard.

545
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,660
I bought drinks for you.

546
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,540
No, thanks.

547
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,260
Just take it.

548
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,020
Feel at home.

549
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,740
Qiyi,

550
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,940
for the first time I met you,

551
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,060
I felt so close to you.

552
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,300
You’re like my sister.

553
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,620
It’s tiring to film here.

554
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:33,940
But

555
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,780
I can’t let my sister feel tired.

556
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,260
Is everything going well?

557
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,340
Good.

558
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:50,740
By the way,

559
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,780
I have told

560
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,660
the investor.

561
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,140
Just do your job.

562
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,900
As long as I’m here,

563
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,900
no one will make it difficult for you.

564
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,780
Mr. Wang, don’t bother.

565
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,580
Thank you.

566
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,100
Qiyi.

567
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,150
What are you doing?
Director is asking for you.

568
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,775
Oh.

569
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,820
Qiyi,

570
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,460
take this.

571
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
It’s a hard job.

572
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,220
Have enough rest.

573
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,620
Go for it.

574
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:27,780
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

575
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,100
The Director asked for her.

576
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,340
Take your time.

577
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,340
See you.

578
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,660
See you, Mr. Wang.

579
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Be careful.

580
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,500
Thank you!

581
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,740
Go on.

582
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,220
It’s OK. Have enough rest.

583
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,380
Thank you.

584
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,420
Not at all.

585
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,060
Thank you,

586
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,740
officer.

587
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,940
I’m not the police.

588
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,860
I’m an actress.

589
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:12,975
What?

590
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,700
I was heading to a crew nearby

591
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,180
and didn’t get changed.

592
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,540
So, I met the peer.

593
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,660
You are also actors?

594
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,500
Yeah. We’re studying acting.

595
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,660
Acting students?

596
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,580
So great.

597
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,200
I’m Song Qinqin. Nice to meet you.

598
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,300
What’s your name?

599
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,220
I’m Fang Yan.

600
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,180
You have to do more examinations

601
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,860
to see if there is any problem.

602
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,540
I’m really fine.

603
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,540
Don’t bother.

604
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,620
I think you’d better
follow the instructions.

605
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,340
It’s for your good.

606
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,260
Fang Yan,

607
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,260
what should we do next?

608
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,860
Let me think about it.

609
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,700
How about we ask Qiyi for help?

610
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,140
Wang Hai is now the producer of Jujiu.

611
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,540
Qiyi is close to him.

612
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,180
Don’t tell Qiyi this for now.

613
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,420
But we have no other way out now.

614
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,500
Don’t worry. I’ll handle it.

615
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,900
Just leave it to me.

616
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,580
What will you do?

617
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,460
Whatever,

618
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,380
forget about it.

619
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,980
You know the producer of Jujiu?

620
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,900
Yes. Lights! Hurry up!

621
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,512
(General Commission Agents)

622
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,060
Go, higher. Higher.

623
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,125
Higher.

624
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,100
Higher.

625
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,140
Fang Yan,
I still have work to do tomorrow.

626
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,100
I’m leaving.

627
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,974
Thank you for today.

628
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,050
It’s OK. Bye.

629
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:53,400
Bye.

630
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,025
By the way, remember to tell me

631
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:57,125
if you need an actress.

632
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,900
Bye!

633
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,300
Bai Qiao.

634
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,140
It’s late today.

635
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,900
You must be tired.

636
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,820
Go back home now.

637
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,260
But, you’re here alone…

638
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
I’m fine.

639
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,060
Don’t worry.

640
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:16,980
Alright.

641
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,020
Hello? Fang Yan.

642
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,460
How is your day today?

643
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,860
Not bad.

644
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,060
How about you?

645
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,020
Did you find the guy
who framed your father?

646
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,180
Yes.

647
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,500
Who is it?

648
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,940
He is

649
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,300
an old enemy of my dad’s from long ago.

650
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,220
But we don’t know each other.

651
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,940
Oh.

652
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,125
Qiyi, it’s your turn.

653
00:31:57,425 --> 00:31:58,075
Hurry up.

654
00:31:58,075 --> 00:31:58,730
OK. OK.

655
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,340
Fang Yan, I gotta go.

656
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,500
Let’s talk on WeChat later.

657
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
I’m going to shoot first.

658
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,380
OK.

659
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,300
OK. Pass!

660
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,940
Lan, good. Change the scene.

661
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,900
Come on. Another scene!

662
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,580
Go!

663
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,075
Next scene!

664
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,075
OK. OK. We’re on the way.

665
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,460
Nice!

666
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:31,980
Drink this.

667
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,900
No, thanks, Mr. Wang.

668
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,300
Come on.

669
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,340
If you don’t take it,

670
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,620
I’ll be upset.

671
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,860
Take it.

672
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,060
That’s right.

673
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,275
Here.

674
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,225
Sit.

675
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:48,500
Sit down.

676
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,340
Qiyi,

677
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,180
I checked your schedule.

678
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,340
You have no work tonight.

679
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,660
How about going to a party

680
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,700
with me tonight?

681
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,780
No, thanks.

682
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,260
Careful!

683
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,860
She won’t go.

684
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,460
She will join me tonight.

685
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,060
There is no fun in the crew here.

686
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,580
Anyway, our teacher said

687
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,340
we couldn’t leave.

688
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,060
Qiyi,

689
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,740
there are many bigshots of
the film industry tonight.

690
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,100
I can introduce you to them.

691
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,700
There will be many opportunities
for you.

692
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,580
If you don’t

693
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,340
go with me,

694
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,500
that will be a pity.

695
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,740
What?

696
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,700
Take me with you, too.

697
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,220
We don’t need a stunt double now.

698
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,180
Alright.

699
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,460
I’ll go with you.

700
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,620
Yeah. That’s it.

701
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,140
I’ll come to pick you up later.

702
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,620
Looking forward to meeting you.

703
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,620
See you tonight.

704
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,820
What a jerk!

705
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,820
Why are you going with him?

706
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,340
There can’t be anything good.

707
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,580
But, if I don’t go,

708
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,100
he will trouble me again.

709
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,220
Look at you.

710
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,220
Why don’t you always listen to me?

711
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,540
Be careful tonight.

712
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,375
Don’t worry. I know.

713
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,100
Alright, don’t be angry.

714
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,075
Don’t get angry. Come on.

715
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,925
Hello? Fang Yan.

716
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,980
Kaixin, are you in the crew?

717
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,940
Yes.

718
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,180
I can’t reach Qiyi.

719
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:14,575
I want to ask you

720
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:15,540
if there is

721
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,780
a producer called Wang Hai on your crew.

722
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,740
Yes.

723
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,140
Qiyi told you?

724
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
That man

725
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,900
always troubles Qiyi.

726
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,060
What?

727
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,060
Let me tell you.

728
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,100
He took Qiyi out tonight,

729
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,420
saying that there was a party

730
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,140
with many big shots.

731
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,380
Where is it?

732
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,340
It’s called Golden Jade Bar.

733
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,275
- Hai!
- Hello, Hai!

734
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:43,125
Hai!

735
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,500
Please.

736
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,175
Hai,

737
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,980
the girls with you

738
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,900
are always so beautiful.

739
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,940
Don’t talk about it.

740
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,050
Cheers.

741
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,800
Hai, cheers.

742
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,940
The number you dialed is out of service…

743
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,700
Sorry,

744
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,620
the number you dialed is out of service…

745
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,180
Qiyi, call me if you see the message.

746
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,540
Sir, I’ll get off here.

747
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,780
We haven’t arrived yet.

748
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,425
Keep the change.

749
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,250
OK. Thank you.

750
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,540
Hi! What a coincidence!

751
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,620
Where are you going?
I’ll give you a ride.

752
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,980
Let me ride.

753
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,660
You sit behind me.

754
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,060
This is
how the entertainment industry is.

755
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,020
It just depends on

756
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,820
who got the best trick.

757
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,740
So, I said

758
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,140
Su Wen abandoned his wife and son,

759
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,900
then it became the truth.

760
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,100
Bros,

761
