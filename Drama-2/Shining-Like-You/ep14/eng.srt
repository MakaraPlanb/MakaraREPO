Are you OK?

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,700
Why did you drink so much?

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,660
I’m fine.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,660
Bai Qiao,

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,060
what happened?

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,980
Is something bothering you?

30
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,075
Why don’t you go take a shower?

31
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,500
Go and pack up.

32
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,020
I’m gonna send you back.

33
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
I’m waiting for you at the door.

34
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,420
You can go back now.

35
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,380
Anything else?

36
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,820
Not bad.

37
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,860
90.

38
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,300
Really?

39
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,900
Thank you, sir.

40
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,475
Go.

41
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,460
Okay.

42
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,600
See you, sir.

43
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,780
Ma’am.

44
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,940
Did you see

45
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,460
the pinks there?

46
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,660
What?

47
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,940
Pinks.

48
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,740
The flower is this big.

49
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,580
It’s purple.

50
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,860
There are this many.

51
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,780
Just over there.

52
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:51,140
No, I didn’t see any.

53
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,325
Ma’am.

54
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,980
Did you see anyone come here?

55
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,500
A girl often comes to water flowers.

56
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,460
What does she look like?

57
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,060
She’s thin, with fair skin.

58
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,020
Big eyes.

59
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,380
Two pigtails.

60
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,500
It’s you.

61
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,340
Thank you, ma’am.

62
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,675
Gather ye rosebuds

63
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,380
while ye may.

64
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,380
Perhaps someone has taken them.

65
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,300
Qiyi.

66
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,380
Are you together with Fang Yan?

67
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,060
You’re silent. I’ll take it a yes.

68
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,620
I don’t know if we are together.

69
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,540
You two held hands.

70
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,940
Are you not together?

71
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,300
Did you see us?

72
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,340
Yes.

73
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,850
But he didn’t do anything later on.

74
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,540
So, are you two in a relationship

75
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,780
or not?

76
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,220
I don’t know either.

77
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,060
Don’t you?

78
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,180
Do you like him?

79
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,620
You like Zhang Yang

80
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,660
and dislike Fang Yan, right?

81
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,420
Babe.

82
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,540
What’s wrong with you?

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,460
You can’t be in a muddle right now.

84
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Du Ang decorated the door

85
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,420
for you all the day...

86
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:34,700
No, I can’t hide it anymore.

87
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, I’ll tell you everything.

88
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,140
Du Ang

89
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,460
spent the whole day

90
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,060
to decorate the iron door.

91
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,820
Moreover,

92
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,980
he paid for a band

93
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,180
to give you a big surprise

94
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,620
at night.

95
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:46,500
As a result,

96
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,540
in the school,

97
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,620
he saw you and Fang Yan

98
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,620
walking hand in hand.

99
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Look.

100
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,260
You like Zhang Yang,
and also hook up with Du Ang.

101
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,820
And you held hands with Fang Yan.

102
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,140
Tell me. Who do you really like?

103
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,300
Now tell me the first name

104
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,940
that comes into your mind.

105
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,900
Come on.

106
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,460
Three, two, one.

107
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:07,460
- Who?
- Fang Yan.

108
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,400
No.

109
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,740
I gotta make it clear with Du Ang.

110
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,420
Don’t.

111
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,340
If you go to him now,

112
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,325
he’ll be very embarrassed.

113
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,140
What should I do then?

114
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:21,860
Sit down.

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,660
I think,

116
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,660
it’s not your fault.

117
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,220
After all,

118
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,940
you’ve never told Du Ang you like him.

119
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,500
It’s just his wishful thinking.

120
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,780
So, you shouldn’t be blamed.

121
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,340
I just feel pity for Du Ang.

122
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,660
I gotta make it clear with Du Ang.

123
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,340
Don’t.

124
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,060
Fang Yan held your hands.

125
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,475
Did he get your ears away as well?

126
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,025
Why don’t you listen?

127
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,740
Sit down.

128
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,100
Did you hear what I said?

129
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,100
Yes.

130
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,940
Did you get it?

131
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,620
Yes.

132
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,420
Have you remembered it?

133
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,100
Yes.

134
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,140
Now read the book.

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,460
Now the end-term show is coming.

142
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,540
Our school has so many events.

143
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,225
Hey.

144
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,420
The seniors told me that,

145
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,220
the annual end-term show

146
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,140
is the highlight of all majors.

147
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,460
By that time,

148
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
many big names will attend it.

149
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,420
Once you are chosen,

150
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,620
you’ll have a soaring career.

151
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,020
Li Xiao was chosen by a director

152
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,140
when he was a sophomore.

153
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,420
Li Xiao is so awesome.

154
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,580
Badly, he has bad eyes on women.

155
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,860
He’s blind.

156
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:03,400
So polite.

157
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:05,750
And...

158
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,300
Mr. Yang, we miss you.

159
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,620
Before the class,

160
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,260
I’d like to announce something.

161
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,860
The end-term show is coming.

162
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,860
Our freshman performing class

163
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,900
will select the best work for it.

164
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,780
You’re free to team up
and choose themes.

165
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,540
The assessment will be in a week,

166
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,260
which will be

167
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,940
recorded to your final grade.

168
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,100
Besides,

169
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,940
to be fair,

170
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,575
the Dean

171
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,820
and other teachers will be present.

172
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,260
Now you may have a discussion.

173
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,780
The class begins in 20 minutes.

174
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,580
Free to team up? But how?

175
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,820
What should we perform?

176
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,420
Classic plays?

177
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,140
Fang Yan.

178
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,825

Bai Qiao.

186
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,380
Can we sit here?

187
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,140
Yes.

188
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,180
Thanks.

189
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,220
Bai Qiao.

190
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
Do you still need a teammate?

191
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,875
We really wanna be your teammates.

192
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,140
Our team is one person short,

193
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,500
for I’ve promised Xiaoying.

194
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,660
But one of you

195
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,350
can join us.

196
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,180
No.

197
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,620
We must be together.

198
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,020
Let’s go.

199
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,660
Curly.

200
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,540
We may team up next time.

201
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,820
I’m in.

202
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,820
I’d rather have her.

203
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,940
Why?

204
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,325
My study is better than hers.

205
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,580
No reason.

206
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:09,620
I’m going.

207
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,420
You’ll be notified for rehearsal.

208
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,940
I can quit.

209
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,660
Traitor!

210
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,300
Qiyi.

211
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,980
Will our team

212
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,725
fall apart?

213
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,780
What will we perform?

214
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,460
We have no idea even now.

215
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,660
How about this?

216
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,620
We can find a ready-made play.

217
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,540
At least the content

218
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,540
has no problem.

219
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,700
Good idea.

220
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,940
In that case, I will

221
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,580
spy on others for intelligence.

222
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,540
Lest they have the same play as ours.

223
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,020
Here you are.

224
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,820
It’s all for you.

225
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,900
You are so kind.

226
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Eat less. We’ll have a performance.

227
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:09,900
(Aunt)

228
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,060
I need to take this.

229
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,620
Hello, Aunt.

230
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,000
- Qiyi.
- Yes.

231
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,020
What are you doing?

232
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,625
I’m eating.

233
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,775
Qiyi.

234
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,740
My words may be harsh,

235
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,340
but it’s not easy to be an actress.

236
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,500
You should consider your future.

237
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,100
I know, Aunt.

238
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,660
I will work hard

239
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,380
and prove I can do it well.

240
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,740
Well, Aunt,

241
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,020
we’ll have a performance
at the end of the term.

242
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,700
If you are available,

243
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,180
I’d like you to watch it.

244
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,375
Oh,

245
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,940
I see.

246
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,580
What’s your role?

247
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,740
It’s not decided yet.

248
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,260
Are you the lead?

249
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,820
Not decided either.

250
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,220
That’s why it’s a hard path to take.

251
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,980
Only the leads will be remembered.

252
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,300
Viewers only focus on the leads.

253
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,660
I know, Aunt.

254
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
I will do my best.

255
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,820
Alright.

256
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
I won’t say more.

257
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,020
Good luck.

258
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,540
I’ll ask who will go with me

259
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,620
in our family.

260
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,580
Okay.

261
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,740
Goodbye, Aunt.

262
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,250
You’re back.

263
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
I’m fetching something.

264
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,500
I’m leaving.

265
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:13,400
Bye...

266
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,150
Hey.

267
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,660
Is she living with her boyfriend?

268
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,340
Bai Qiao, hold on!

269
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,060
What’s the matter?

270
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,220
Do you know why Curly

271
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,780
badmouthed you in the Internet forum?

272
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,660
Because she likes Li Xiao as well.

273
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,940
I know.

274
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,060
Do you?

275
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,540
Then why did you choose her?

276
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,980
She could apologize
in front of the class.

277
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,820
Rather than a dishonest person
like you,

278
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,340
I prefer her.

279
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,350
Wu Rida.

280
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:31,380
Wu Rida.

281
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,700
Do you still need a teammate?

282
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,820
Rida.

283
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,460
Can I join your team?

284
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,140
Du Ang.

285
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,100
You can join us

286
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,060
if you don’t have a team.

287
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,060
I’ve joined Rida’s team.

288
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:10,625
Oh.

289
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Du Ang.

290
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,580
I think you should talk with Fang Yan.

291
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,980
I have nothing to say with him.

292
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,820
Okay.

293
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,100
Hold on!

294
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,140
Has your team got enough people?

295
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,900
Many hands make light work!

296
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,580
So, do you need a talent like me?

297
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,500
No.

298
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,200
I think you should make it clear

299
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,900
to Fang Yan.

300
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,620
Maybe later.

301
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,325
I didn’t eat.

302
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,860
Now I’m hungry.

303
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,775
Rida.

304
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,300
Would you go to eat with me?

305
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,820
Go alone!

306
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,420
Why are you so rude?

307
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,420
Let’s go grab a bit.

308
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,180
Get up. Come on.

309
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
You let me eat with you,

310
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,140
go to classes with you,

311
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,425
and even go to the toilet with you.

312
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,140
Go alone.

313
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,180
Get lost!

314
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,660
Get lost.

315
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,820
Producer Wang.

316
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,500
Yes.

317
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,260
Nice to meet you.

318
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,700
I admire you.

319
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,100
You are young and promising,

320
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,380
investing in such a big film.

321
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,180
Dean.

322
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,650
Yes?

323
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,420
Are you asking for me?

324
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,220
Ms. Tang.

325
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,060
Come. Come.

326
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,460
Let me introduce them to you.

327
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,700
This is

328
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,525
the producer of Jujiu, Wang Hai.

329
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,620
Nice to meet you.

330
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,580
Nice to meet you, Ms. Tang.

331
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,420
This is Ms. Tang.

332
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,220
What a beauty!

333
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,060
Thanks.

334
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,340
I don’t need to introduce her, do I?

335
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,860
She’s well known.

336
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,180
Come on, Li Xun.

337
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Let’s sit and talk.

338
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,780
Take a seat, everyone.

339
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,380
I,

340
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,540
Sun Zhuowen, and Li Xun,

341
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,180
we are alumni.

342
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,100
We are close.

343
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,820
We’ve always been close.

344
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,100
Seniors and juniors.

345
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,140
Friends.

346
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:25,980
Right?

347
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,400
Li Xun comes to our school

348
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,060
for cooperation.

349
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,500
You may say it.

350
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,340
The shoot of Jujiu is about to begin.

351
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,540
Zhuowen happens to be the director.

352
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,380
So, we applied to the producers

353
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,100
for selecting some young actors

354
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,460
from our school.

355
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:52,300
Hey.

356
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,340
So, Mr. Sun,

357
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,220
Ms. Tang,

358
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
you know the students best.

359
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,540
You may recommend some.

360
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,220
I think,

361
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,260
we may listen to Mr. Sun.

362
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,740
How about this?

363
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,580
The end-term show is coming.

364
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,775
Producer Wang and everyone else

365
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,140
can come and watch it.

366
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,580
That’s good.

367
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,500
We can choose and decide on site.

368
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,050
Okay.

369
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,620
Alright.

370
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,940
Okay.

371
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,325
Ms. Tang.

372
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
You don’t know it.

373
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,260
Thanks to Li Xun,

374
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,780
Zhuowen could get this film.

375
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,500
It not only means a lot to our school.

376
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,100
It means more to Sun Zhuowen.

377
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,775
Okay.

378
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,700
We haven’t met for a while.

379
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,540
And we have a new friend here.

380
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Let’s have dinner together.

381
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,100
My treat.

382
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,400
Thank you, sir.

383
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,660
But Zhuowen and I

384
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,540
need to talk about the creation.

385
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,540
Okay. Okay.

386
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,980
Suit yourself.

387
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,660
Have a nice talk.

388
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,620
Next time.

389
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,820
Next time we may have dinner together.

390
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,580
That’s a deal.

391
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,460
Okay.

392
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,300
Alright.

393
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,250
Dean.

394
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,800
Hey.

395
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,660
I’m going then.

396
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,580
Have a good talk.

397
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,500
A good talk.

398
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,060
Come on.

399
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,380
Next time.

400
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,025
Ms. Tang.

401
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,825
Yes?

402
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,875
See you.

403
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,660
Please.

404
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,625
- Dean.
- Yes?

405
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,420
We need a composer as well,

406
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,020
and want to recruit someone.

407
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,060
If there are excellent students
in your school,

408
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,100
you may recommend to us.

409
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,580
Yes, of course.

410
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,500
- Ms. Tang.
- Yes?

411
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,100
You may see to it.

412
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,860
Talk about it with the music teachers.

413
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,540
Yes, sir.

414
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,060
Ms. Tang.

415
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,300
I appreciate your help.

416
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,980
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Alright.

417
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,860
Let me walk you out.

418
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:54,540
- Okay. Okay.
- Please.

419
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,140
See you.

420
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,675
Let’s go.

421
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,460
Come on. Wu Rida.

422
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,420
Sit up. Sit up.

423
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,400
You got me in trouble.

424
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,540
The other teams are all full.

425
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,420
What should I do?

426
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,550
You...

427
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,460
You can join Fang Yan’s team.

428
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,225
No way!

429
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,400
Hey.

430
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,420
Otherwise, you’ll fail the course.

431
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,980
Buddy.

432
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,420
Isn’t that nonsense?

433
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,100
Do you want some punches?

434
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,500
I’m gonna teach you a lesson.

435
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,050
I...

436
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,775
Bring it on.

437
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,260
I...

438
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,540
Follow the GPS.

439
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,980
Let’s talk about the rehearsal.

440
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,050
Hey! Hey! Hey!

441
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:20,475
Ouch!

442
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,225
What are you doing?

443
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,340
Practicing kung fu, the Iron Head?

444
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,540
Are you not watching the road?

445
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,170
Why do you call me to this place?

446
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:36,980
Close your eyes.

447
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,860
What?

448
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,140
Just close your eyes.

449
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:51,700
Don’t be afraid.

450
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,200
Open your eyes.

451
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:16,975
Watch out!

452
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,220
Wait for me here.

453
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,300
I’ll be right back.

454
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,340
Peach blossom charm?

455
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,220
Don’t move.

456
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,625
By the way,

457
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,180
why do you have this?

458
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,140
Now we have a regular place.

459
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
You gave it to me before.

460
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,060
Did I give it to you?

461
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,900
I can’t give this to you.

462
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,980
It’s just a pendant.

463
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Who wants that?

464
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,180
It’s not an ordinary pendant.

465
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,060
It’s the peach blossom charm

466
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,340
from a senior in the Society of Changes.

467
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,660
It must be given to a boyfriend.

468
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,025
Then you should give it to me.

469
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,900
Give it back.

470
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,475
No.

471
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,340
- Get it if you can.
- My arm hurts.

472
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,100
It hurts.

473
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,740
Who made these?

474
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,175
I’m startled.

475
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,220

Not yet.

505
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,940
It was your idea

506
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,180
in the second art exam.

507
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
You may do it again this time.

508
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,260
Don’t make trouble then.

509
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,700
I was improvising, alright?

510
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,900
Your improvisation

511
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,460
nearly got me fail the exam.

512
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,900
Hadn’t I improvised,

513
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,275
you’d have failed it. Okay?

514
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,700

515
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,580

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,460
Hey.

517
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,500
Alright. Alright.

518
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,860
Listen to me.

519
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,100
Everyone wants classic plays.

520
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,450
They are hard to rehearse,

521
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,740
without novelty.

522
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:01,900
How about this?

523
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,660
We make an original.

524
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,740
Original?

525
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,980
Who will write the script?

526
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,940
The straight-A student, of course.

527
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,175
Okay.

528
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,860
I’ll think about it.

529
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,660
Fang Yan.

530
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,660
I have something to ask you.

531
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,260
Did you know Bai Qiao
before the college?

532
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,700
Why asking?

533
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,500
I saw your photo on her table.

534
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,540
You carried her on your back.

535
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,380
I did know her before.

536
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,860
And?

537
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,940
In Grade 3,

538
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,660
we studied in the same training class.

539
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,740
We had dinner together that night.

540
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,975
- That was the first time we met.
- Bai Qiao. Look here.

541
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,340
Let me take a picture for you two.

542
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,220
She was in a bad mood,

543
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,900
and drank some wine.

544
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,940
Then we went back.

545
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,820
Six ones.

546
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,125
Bai Qiao.

547
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,340
I want wine.

548
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,100
Sit here first.

549
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:24,725
Come on.

550
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,020
Fang Yan.

551
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,140
Fang Yan.

552
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,820
Fang Yan.

553
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,740
You know what?

554
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,460
I am so happy today.

555
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,260
I finally talked to you.

556
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,860
I’ve never talked

557
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,975
so much with anyone

558
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,300
heart to heart.

559
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,260
I am so happy today.

560
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,980
I’m so happy.

561
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,780
Fang Yan.

562
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,140
I like you.

563
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,220
Fang Yan.

564
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,300
You know what?

565
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,540
You got my attention

566
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,180
when I first came to the training class.

567
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,420
I like your nose.

568
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,260
Your eyes.

569
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,060
Your mouth.

570
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,380
I’ve been looking for a chance
to talk with you.

571
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,420
But I’m shy.

572
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,780
I was afraid you’d refuse me.

573
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,180
Today I finally talked to you.

574
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,540
I’m so happy.

575
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,460
Fang Yan, I like you so much.

576
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,940
Bai Qiao.

577
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,700
Fang Yan.

578
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,100
Bai Qiao.

579
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,900
Yes?

580
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,180
You are drunk.

581
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,660
She likes you.

582
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:19,500
Do you know it?

583
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,660
I know.

584
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,980
But I’ve never

585
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,780
thought about her that way.

586
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,420
Today Bai Qiao came to me.

587
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,540
She said she’s already

588
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,860
with Li Xiao.

589
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,460
Don’t worry about it anymore.

590
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,780
Alright?

591
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,500
Ouch!

592
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,420
It hurts.

593
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Annoying.

594
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,340
My arm still hurts.

595
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Have you tidied up?

596
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,600
Yes,

597
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,500
I have.

598
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Will you really let me live
in your house?

599
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,900
Plus the dorm,

600
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,820
I have two houses under my name.

601
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,500
It’s no problem to share with you.

602
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,100
I should pay the rent then.

603
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,620
I don’t want your rent.

604
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,500
That’s not okay.

605
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,500
I want you to have dinner
with me every day.

606
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,780
You’re so serious.

607
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,100
No.

608
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,300
You can’t read it now.

609
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,650
Of the girls
in the 2018 Performing Class,

610
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,620
I think you and Lu Qiyi
are the most gifted.

611
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Who do you think

612
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,550
is better?

613
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,660
Of course you are.

614
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,650
Do you mean it?

615
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,460
Do you wanna hear my true thought?

616
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,780
Of course.

617
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,540
Your conditions are better than Lu Qiyi,

618
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,300
but Lu Qiyi is more persistent.

619
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,750
Are you

620
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,660
emphasizing the latter sentence?

621
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,860
Alright. I’m kidding.

622
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,020
Look.

623
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,460
Let’s talk about a serious matter.

624
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,060
Um.

625
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,060
Guess who I met just now?

626
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,150
Who?

627
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,460
Mr. Sun and Li Xun.

628
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,300
And the famous producer Wang Hai.

629
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,900
Li Xun?

630
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,180
Is it Ms. Li Xun?

631
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,260
The producers wanna
cooperate with the school,

632
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,860
and select some actors.

633
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,825
Thus, in the end-term show,

634
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,180
the producers and Li Xun will come.

635
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,675
Really?

636
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,420
Well,

637
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,300
do I have any opportunities?

638
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,220
That’s why

639
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,420
you need to work harder.

640
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:22,750
Um.

641
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,340
I will.

642
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,180
I’m gonna pay the bill.

643
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,260
Wait for me here.

644
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,900
(Producer Wang Hai)

645
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,050
(Hahaha, I’ve been waiting for you
to be humiliated)

646
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,725
(When you end up in shame)

647
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:01,350
(When you live in pain as a mute)

648
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,126
(You’ve lost all your favor
and failed in the struggle of women)

649
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:23,025
(You are no longer the lead
in this troupe)

650
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,875
(Rufeng:
Go after what you want bravely.)

651
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,775
(Fight for it. That’s the life I want.)

652
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,940
The old place. The old dishes.

653
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:32,820
It...

654
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,580
The pavilion is occupied.

655
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,660
I may go to another place.

656
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,100
How about this room?

657
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,500
Here? Okay.

658
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,300
Sir, there’s someone inside.

659
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,780
Share the room with her.
Make do with it.

660
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,275
It’s you!

661
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,260
What’s the odds?

662
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,775
Yeah.

663
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,380
Well,

664
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,180
you took me here last time.

665
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,940
I think the environment is good.

666
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,540
So I come.

667
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:04,700
Oh.

668
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,900
The boss said the pavilion was occupied.

669
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,300
He took me here.

670
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,460
Am I disturbing you?

671
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:10,925
No.

672
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,980
Okay, I’ll go to another room.

673
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,650
Wait!

674
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,025
You may sit here.

675
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,180
Is it okay?

676
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,740
Ms. Tang, you’ve even learned this.

677
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,375
Yeah.

678
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,400
I learned it from you.

679
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,620
You’re a quick learner.

680
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,060
You know what?

681
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,380
You do have a gift.

682
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,060
You’ve almost

683
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,380
learned all my tricks.

684
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,660
How was your talk

685
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,940
about the creation?

686
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,700
Creation?

687
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,300
Not bad.

688
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,460
Did you have a nice chat?

689
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,780
We just talked briefly.

690
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,580
Looks like

691
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,860
Li Xun is very kind to you.

692
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:16,700
Um.

693
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,860
She admires you a lot.

694
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,180
We went way back.

695
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,060
We do know each other well.

696
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,750
Oh.

697
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,260
Well,

698
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,500
a relationship has ended for 7 years.

699
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,500
Can it start over?

700
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,020
Well...

701
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,820
Well... Well...

702
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,260
Ms. Tang.

703
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,220
It seems

704
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,980
you are not happy today.

705
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,700
Can you see that?

706
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,820
Ms. Tang.

707
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,060
Is something bothering you?

708
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,100
Don’t you know

709
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,500
what is bothering me?

710
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,100
I...

711
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,420
I... I don’t.

712
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,620
How is it?

713
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,220
It’s cleaned so well.

714
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,580
Of course.

715
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,100
Thank you.

716
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,180
Don’t mention it.

717
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,700
Look at that.

718
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,500
Girls have many clothes.

719
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,660
Is this wardrobe big enough?

720
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,940
What about your clothes?

721
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,580
All in the dorm.

722
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,020
Do you want me to live here permanently?

723
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,380
I would feel uneasy.

724
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,800
It’s fine.

725
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,540
Tidy up now.

726
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,340
Let me help you.

727
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,780
Rest assured.

728
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,500
When I have enough money,

729
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,740
I will move out.

730
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,940
If you please,

731
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,860
you can live here as long as you want.

732
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,460
Ms. Tang. Slowly.

733
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,420
It’s beautiful.

734
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,780
Ms. Tang.

735
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,740
It’s dangerous, Ms. Tang.

736
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,500
Ms. Tang, don’t!

737
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,650
Don’t go there.

738
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,740
There’s the way.

739
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,820
There.

740
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,820
There.

741
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,900
Is it here?

742
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,860
No. No. No.

743
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,300
No.

744
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:36,900
Ms. Tang.

745
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,060
Sorry. Sorry.

746
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,020
Sorry. Sorry.

747
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,060
- Never mind.
- Come in.

748
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,780
Sorry.

749
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,380
Ms. Tang, stop it.

750
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:44,775
Ms. Tang.

751
00:41:45,325 --> 00:41:45,979
Ms. Tang.

752
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:46,775
Ms.... Ouch!

753
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,380
Hasn’t Sanshang come?

754
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,660
Coming.

755
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,300
And with someone.

756
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
Let go of me.

757
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,325
Let go.

758
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,300
Let me go.

759
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,700
He dragged me here.

00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,020

00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:46,140
