00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,900
I have other plans.

194
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,925
I’ll pass.

195
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:19,450
Go with them.

196
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,975
Hey, you’re...

197
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,475
She’s Zouyang Zimo,

198
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:34,350
from the School of Directing.

199
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,375
The rest of us

200
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,575
are all from the
School of Performing Arts.

201
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:38,600
Hi.

202
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,850
Play for the Freshmen Reception?

203
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:46,950
OK, sure.

204
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,950
Hi, nice to meet you.

205
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,950
(School of Music
Name: Zhang Yang)

206
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,775
Zhang Yang,

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,525
School of Music.

208
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,375
Guys,

209
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,300
let’s go for lunch.

210
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,050
This is my new classmate, Sanshang.

211
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,925
Here’s another, Fang Yan.

212
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,950
Come on, say hi.

213
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,225
I... I’m Sanshang.

214
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,850
I’m Fang Yan.

215
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,600
Stop shooting.

216
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,375
Sorry, guys.

217
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,525
(Please take the sidewalk.)

218
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:35,850
How did you drive?

219
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:45,350
Dude,

220
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,125
language.

221
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,650
We’re sorry.

222
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,575
Let me wipe it clean.

223
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,050
Get off!

224
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,325
Look at the dings.

225
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,275
Dude,

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,675
I saw it.

227
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,425
Your car was

228
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,350
overspeed.

229
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:03,325
I was turning, so I...

230
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:03,975
The car...

231
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:05,150
I had no time to turn around,

232
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,675
right?

233
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:06,825
Look,

234
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,350
just tell me, how much do you want?

235
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,100
Two thousand.

236
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:13,925
Two thousand.

237
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,200
Two thousand for this rusty car?

238
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:20,425
Watch your tongue.

239
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,975
I just said it.

240
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,375
Dude,

241
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,125
it is

242
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:32,525
our fault today.

243
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,050
Look,

244
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,425
here’s...

245
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,425
Two hundred.

246
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,775
Take it or beat it.

247
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:51,350
This is not over.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,675
Man,

249
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,625
you’re awesome.

250
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:09,900
You owe me two hundred.

251
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,725
Pay me on WeChat.

252
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,350
(Lu Qiyi)
Zhang Yang, where are you?

253
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:19,575
I’ll go find you.

254
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,325
Bai Qiao,

255
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
I’m going out.

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,600
OK.

257
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,050
Lu Qiyi,

258
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,900
buy some food for me, please.

259
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:36,800
OK.

260
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,750
Hello, Mom.

261
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:11,625
Qiyi,

262
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,300
has the admission problem been resolved?

263
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:14,650
Yes, it’s over.

264
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,625
They missed out on my name.

265
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,575
Alright.

266
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,325
Your dad and I are on our way
to the campus.

267
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,350
Your dad

268
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,950
would like to meet your head teacher.

269
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,050
Wait, Mom.

270
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,275
The teachers are busy.

271
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,575
It’s inconvenient.

272
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,250
We have to meet them.

273
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,450
Your dad insists on it.

274
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:35,500
No, Mom.

275
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,100
Hello?

276
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,600
You’re back.

277
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,050
I have something to tell you.

278
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,325
What’s wrong?

279
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,475
Oh,

280
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,600
what’s up? Don’t cry.

281
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,325
Tell me.

282
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,075
The cat is out of the bag.

283
00:14:58,075 --> 00:14:59,525
What are you talking about?

284
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,700
My parents want to meet my head teacher.

285
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:02,941
The head teacher?

286
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,250
Tell them she’s busy.

287
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,850
They’re heading to SFSU now.

288
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,225
Tell them the truth.

289
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,950
No, I can’t.

290
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,275
My dad would go mad.

291
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:15,600
He’d make me quit

292
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,775
and take the exam in the next year.

293
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,000
Bai Qiao, you know

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,325
how hard I tried to get here.

295
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
What should we do then?

296
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:26,250
What?

297
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,750
You want me to fake the teacher?

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,900
What?

299
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:32,325
You told your parents

300
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:34,325
she teaches English?

301
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,275
Come on,

302
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,900
I never passed an English test.

303
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:48,850
How do I look?

304
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,275
Not bad.

305
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:52,800
Have you memorized her profile?

306
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,625
Yes.

307
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:54,475
Only for you.

308
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,325
I’ll never do it

309
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:56,375
for someone else.

310
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:58,425
(Music Bar)
Dad, Mom.

311
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,600
Qiyi.

312
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,550
This is Miss Bai.

313
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,275
Miss Bai.

314
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,450
Nice to meet you.

315
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:03,100
Nice to meet you.

316
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,025
It’s a pleasure.

317
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,050
After you.

318
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,875
He was aggressive

319
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:09,625
and charged at me.

320
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:10,775
Without a second thought...

321
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:14,700
Hi.

322
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,625
(Southern University of the Arts
Audition Waiting Room)

323
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,075
Hey,

324
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,325
our subject is an umbrella.

325
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,575
I have an idea.

326
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,700
Would you like to hear it?

327
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,850
Miss Bai,

328
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,850
Qiyi told us

329
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,100
you studied in the U.K.

330
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,075
So we singled out

331
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,950
this featured restaurant.

332
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,425
You’re so kind.

333
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,450
Miss Bai,

334
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,125
here.

335
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,500
You first.

336
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:00,025
Thank you.

337
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,150
Qiyi,

338
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:08,875
you order it.

339
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:11,350
Miss Bai,

340
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,100
with all due respect,

341
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,925
which college do you graduate from?

342
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,375
The University of Leicester.

343
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,450
Your major?

344
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,325
English literature.

345
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,650
Miss Bai,

346
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:26,425
in the medical circle,

347
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,375
there’s a scholar named Chen Jia’ao.

348
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,625
He’s also a graduate of Leicester,

349
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,900
and is now a Ph.D. mentor.

350
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,200
Do you know him, Miss Bai?

351
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,150
Different trades, different worlds.

352
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,250
I never heard of him.

353
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,950
Right,

354
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,600
he’s now in his 60s.

355
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,450
I’m not surprised.

356
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,750
Miss Bai, you’re already a doctor.

357
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,850
You look quite young.

358
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,825
You flattered me.

359
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,500
I’m 29 years old.

360
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,825
29?

361
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,825
You look younger.

362
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,175
What year was she born?

363
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:09,350
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit.

364
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,500
1989, the year of Snake.

365
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,625
Snake.

366
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,100
Yeah.

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,275
Totally compatible.

368
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,050
Hi, man.

369
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,700
Fang Yan,

370
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,850
do you know Lu Qiyi from your class?

371
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,550
Yeah.

372
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,550
What’s up?

373
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,025
I can’t get in touch with her.

374
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,750
Go get her

375
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,275
to rehearsal later.

376
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,950
Sure.

377
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,800
Who is Lu Qiyi?

378
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,325
The girl in there

379
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,475
with two braids.

380
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:50,300
I’ll go.

381
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:58,625
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,875
it’s a pleasure.

383
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,875
Lu Qiyi,

384
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,025
Li Xiao would like you
to rehearse tonight.

385
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,250
Rehearse?

386
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:09,575
For what?

387
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,500
For the...

388
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:13,750
The boys and girls

389
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,975
are going to rehearse

390
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,425
for a short English play.

391
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:17,950
No, it’s not an English play.

392
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,075
It’s the tradition of SFSU,

393
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,600
especially for the School of English.

394
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:23,825
The School of English?

395
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:25,975
Hey,

396
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,875
you have a rehearsal tonight.

397
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,800
Go back now.

398
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:30,775
Qiyi and I will be there.

399
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:40,850
Wait.

400
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,425
Qiyi,

401
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,750
he must be your classmate.

402
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,575
So are the lads outside.

403
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:47,550
Am I right?

404
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,425
Invite them over.

405
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:51,025
Look, Dad,

406
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:52,975
Miss Bai is our guest.

407
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,125
It’s inappropriate.

408
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Yes, yes, yes.

409
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,275
Teacher Bai is

410
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,500
gentle and kind.

411
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,225
She cares for her students.

412
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:03,825
My name is Du Ang.

413
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:06,325
English is very important.

414
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:08,175
You eat beef.

415
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,500
I go.

416
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,375
Bye.

417
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:12,225
Miss Bai.

418
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,000
Fang Yan asks me to see

419
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,575
what’s been holding you up.

420
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,075
In my opinion,

421
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,275
the best actors
from the Chinese mainland

422
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:30,825
are Huang Bo and Su Wen.

423
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,600
They’re acting heart and soul.

424
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,175
They’re singing up there.

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
♪Fill the golden cups♪

426
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
♪With mellow kumis♪

427
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,675
♪Everything is so beautiful♪

00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,950
♪Friends, join me with a hearty drink♪

429
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,600
He’s drunk.

430
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,850
The Mongolian learners

431
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,575
are truly passionate.

432
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:14,450
Miss Bai, enjoy the steaks.

433
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,750
I need to use the bathroom.

434
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,975
Miss Bai.

435
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:19,725
- Yeah.
- Let’s eat.

436
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:27,875
Ma’am.

437
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,325
Thank you.

438
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:30,975
You are welcome.

439
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,175
You’re Qiyi’s classmate, right?

440
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:37,150
Yeah.

441
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,150
We’re from the same class.

442
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:39,800
It’s the first time

443
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,875
she moves out from home.

444
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,400
We’re worried.

445
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,025
You peers,

446
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:45,250
be good

447
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,050
and look after each other.

448
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,325
Don’t worry, Mrs. Lu.

449
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,725
Qiyi is a confident girl.

450
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,075
Is she?

451
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,400
Don’t you know?

452
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,025
During the admission exam,

453
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,025
she slapped one of the interviewers.

454
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,950
It’s a hot issue on campus.

455
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,025
(Southern University of the Arts
Audition Room)

456
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,675
Is there a problem?

457
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,975
Are you clear of the subject?

458
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,450
Yes, I am.

459
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:14,075
You don’t know what to do?

460
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,025
To be an actress,

461
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:22,975
the first and foremost are imagination,

462
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,125
passion and performance.

463
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,650
How could you expect to be an actress

464
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,775
like this?

465
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:29,225
Come on.

466
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,425
Give me a surprise.

467
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:32,950
Do it.

468
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:33,625
Hurry!

469
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,600
Come on. Do it!

470
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,350
Do it!

471
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,400
Alright,

472
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,663
I’ll remember you.

473
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:08,975
What classes do you usually have?

474
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,075
For performing arts students,

475
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,800
it’s nothing more than vocal, lines,
performance and figure.

476
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,250
By the way, Mrs. Lu.

477
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,775
There’s a mini-show at SUA’s

478
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:16,750
campus theatre tomorrow.

479
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,475
You’re welcomed to watch it.

480
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,875
See you, Mrs. Lu

481
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:20,975
Bye.

482
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,475
For steaks,

483
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,325
medium well is the best.

484
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,150
Mm-hmm.

485
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,425
But some

486
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,525
insist medium or rare.

487
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:35,725
That’s too much

488
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:39,725
To you, Miss Bai.

489
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:42,100
Darling, join me.

490
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,350
Miss Bai,

491
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,750
my wife and I

492
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,250
would like to propose a toast.

493
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:51,475
I have high hopes for Qiyi.

494
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,325
I hope she will succeed in her studies.

495
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:55,350
For the best, like you,

496
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,575
I hope she can study abroad.

497
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,950
In fact, foreign universities

498
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,175
take priority in building independence.

499
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,900
Qiyi is already an independent girl.

500
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,275
And she’s strong-minded.

501
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,900
Actually, I hope

502
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,050
you can try to respect

503
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,825
the ideas on her mind.

504
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:26,350
Miss Bai,

505
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,800
I’ll trust Qiyi with you.

506
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,700
It’s my duty.

507
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,850
Be strict with her.

508
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,025
And be frank with

509
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,000
her mistakes.

510
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:33,875
I will.

511
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:34,925
Qiyi,

512
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,550
goodbye.

513
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,732
- Bye.
- Bye.

514
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:39,725
- Take care. Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

515
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:40,825
Bye, Mom.

516
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:44,600
(San Francisco Restaurant Music Bar)

517
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:50,300
I’m so scared.

518
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,525
It’s over now.

519
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:56,350
I have an appointment tonight.

520
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,325
Gotta go.

521
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,475
Thanks, Bai Qiao.

522
00:24:58,475 --> 00:24:59,125
By the way,

523
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,250
don’t forget the rehearsal.

524
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,075
See you.

525
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:17,950
Darling,

526
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,825
can I help you?

527
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:20,225
Excuse me,

528
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:21,400
I want to buy a dance suit.

529
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,375
A dance suit.

530
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,100
Small size?

531
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:24,850
Mm-hmm.

532
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:27,175
How about bras?

533
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:28,575
The bras are on promotion.

534
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:29,225
They’re great.

535
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,375
You can get a discount.

536
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,375
Here, look.

537
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:33,175
The push-up bra.

538
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,875
It’s great.

539
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,425
Look.

540
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:36,875
Try it on. Your skin is milky.

541
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,200
It will look good on you.

542
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,525
Are you really not considering it?

543
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:40,275
Try it on.

544
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,175
- I really don’t need it.
- Look.

545
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,550
Try it. Feel the fabric.

546
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:43,700
I have a few.

547
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,600
Well, you’ll need to change.

548
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,125
Come on.

549
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,225
Take one.

550
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:53,325
Hey,

551
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:55,250
it suits you well.

552
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,500
Buy it.

553
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,850
How much? I’ll buy it.

554
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:00,925
150 Yuan.

555
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,300
Then I’ll pack it up for you.

556
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,150
Which do you like?

557
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,050
I’ll buy this one.

558
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,525
OK.

559
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,075
I’ll pack them up for you.

560
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:21,100
We are classmates,

561
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,350
but we’re not on good terms.

562
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,575
We often fight.

563
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,709
One day,

564
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,475
when we stay behind to update
the news columns,

565
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:28,800
it begins to rain suddenly.

566
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,125
We’re trapped at school.

567
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,625
You can start.

568
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:45,675
There you are.

569
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,150
Mom,

570
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,750
let’s go home.

571
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:57,700
Mom,

572
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:00,600
it’s pouring rain.

573
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,775
Let’s go home.

574
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,950
We had a plan.

575
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,700
Mom!

576
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,325
Look at me.

577
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,850
I’m not Dad.

578
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,050
My dad is gone.

579
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,300
Please do not keep
torturing yourself, OK?

580
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:32,900
Well,

581
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,300
is the bra comfortable?

582
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,300
You must be surprised.

583
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I got the offer

584
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,150
despite your sabotage.

585
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,725
Without me,

586
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,325
your chance was slim.

587
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:47,225
Mom!

588
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,100
- Give me the umbrella!
- Mom!

589
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,975
- Give me the umbrella!
- Mom!

590
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:49,475
Mom!

591
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:50,650
Give it to me!

592
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,700
You ungrateful child!

593
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,125
- Mom, let’s go back.
- Give me the umbrella.

594
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,975
- It’s raining cats and dogs.
- Give me the umbrella.

595
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:55,600
Mom.

596
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,425
You ungrateful child.

597
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:01,350
Qiyi,

598
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:07,350
weren’t you coming to see me?

599
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:18,650
Um... my parents came after that.

600
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,625
We went out for food.

601
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,450
Listen up.

602
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:25,750
I’m Tang,

603
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,575
your body performance teacher.

604
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,575
Nice to meet you, Ms. Tang.

605
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:29,125
Hello, Ms. Tang.

606
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,875
We have limited time.

607
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,825
So no more talking.

608
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,375
Zhang Yang, do you have the score?

609
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,350
Give Fang Yan a copy.

610
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,700
Lu Qiyi, right?

611
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:43,725
Yes, ma’am.

612
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:45,000
You’re the dancer.

613
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,925
Make it simple.

614
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,450
Just spice things up.

615
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:53,700
Lu Qiyi!

616
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,100
Stop.

617
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
The left leg should step down

618
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,575
and the right leg kicks high up,

619
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,000
and then spin.

620
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,075
Qiyi,

621
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,100
let’s choose another move.

622
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,975
Ma’am,

623
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,450
I can do it.

Come to the little theater

640
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,625
at 10:00 AM tomorrow.

641
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,225
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

642
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:56,175
Lu Qiyi.

643
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,100
Not bad.

644
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:00,550
Good night, Ms. Tang.

645
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,175
Zhang Yang, one moment.

646
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,900
Wait for me.

647
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,675
Take this.

648
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:16,850
It’s for me?

649
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,425
Why?

650
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,125
Without your help today,

651
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,600
my secret would have been given away.

652
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,725
Our dads have been colleagues for years.

653
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,250
It’s just a call.

654
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:30,850
I’m the support?

655
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,300
I did you a huge favor.

656
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,225
I’m gonna kick you.

657
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:37,900
Hi there.

658
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,800
The best Jiang Ziya on campus.

659
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,975
Have a round. Let’s gang up.

660
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:44,675
I’m tired.

661
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:46,425
Boring.

662
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,350
Xiuwen,

663
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,400
this is the last round.

664
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,125
You’d better not lose.

665
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:57,625
I’m a licensed dealer.

666
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,725
It’s true.

667
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,300
(New Journey)

668
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,400
(Freshmen Reception
and Commencement 2018)

669
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,700
A warm welcome to the faculties

670
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,225
of Southern University of the Arts.

671
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,575
This year, over 20,000 students

672
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:17,750
applied for SUA.

673
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:20,925
(Southern University of the Arts)
But only 400 present here are admitted.

674
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:21,950
In SUA,

675
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,150
you’ll find your strength

676
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:27,475
and the real meaning

677
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,000
to be a true artist.

678
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,425
Those who dream to take a shortcut,

679
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,575
to become famous overnight,

680
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,300
and to gain without pains

681
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,100
can leave right now.

682
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,475
There are a lot of talented young people

683
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:43,075
like you

684
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:45,550
who can replace you easily.

685
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:47,925
Last but not least,

686
00:32:48,825 --> 00:32:49,975
good luck!

687
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,675
Thank you Sun Yue for your wonderful
performance.

688
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,125
Next, students from the School of Dance

689
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,475
will bring us a wonderful performance.

690
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,875
Break a leg.

691
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:26,600
Are you nervous?

692
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,475
Is your mom here?

693
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:32,225
My mom?

694
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:35,375
I invited her yesterday
at the restaurant.

695
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:38,775
What’s wrong?

697
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,225
