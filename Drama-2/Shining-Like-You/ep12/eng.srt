OK.

OK. OK.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,900
Bye.

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,150
Hi.

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,300
Do you have an appointment?

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,860
Xun invited me to come over
in the afternoon.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,500
Your last name, please?

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,175
Lu.

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Just a moment, please.

35
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,625
Excuse me,

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,940
are you Lu Qiyi?

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,700
Yeah, that’s me.

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,700
Please come with me.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,220
Take a seat.

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,420
Xun will be here soon.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,580
One moment, please.

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
The casting and news of Jujiu

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,700
can be released.

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,820
OK, Xun.

45
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,100
Hi, Xun.

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,340
Qiyi, I’m sorry

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,220
to have kept you waiting.

48
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,300
Listen up, guys.

49
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,100
Let me introduce to you

50
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,780
Miss Lu Qiyi who is also from SUA.

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,500
One of her teachers

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,350
is the famous director, Sun Zhuowen

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
that I often talk about.

54
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,750
Sit.

55
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,740
Forgive me.

56
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,900
I haven’t had lunch yet.

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,540
Would you like some?

58
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,100
I’ve already eaten.

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,950
Is that what you usually eat?

60
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:39,180
Yes.

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,580
Is this enough to fill you up?

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,300
I really wish to know what it feels like
to be full.

63
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,500
Which field would you like to choose
in the future?

64
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,580
TV works or theatre?

65
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,575
I haven’t thought about it yet.

66
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Do you like acting?

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,900
Actually, when I first met you,

68
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,540
I could tell you have great potential.

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,740
You’re talented.

70
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,125
If you want,

71
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,660
I can recommend some producers to you.

72
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,000
Or

73
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,140
I can recommend some roles

74
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,860
in TV works that suit you.

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,740
I couldn’t have achieved

76
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,860
what I have now without your support.

77
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,420
Thanks to my parents,

78
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,620
my friends

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,380
and my fans.

80
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,220
I love you all.

81
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,780
By the way,

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,220
I invited you over today

83
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,780
to ask you a favor.

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,060
A favor?

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,660
Nobody

86
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,220
can do me the favor but you.

87
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,025
(Dearest Huang Bo)

88
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,750

Directed by Xu Zheng)

89
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,175
(The Chef, The Actor and The Scoundrel)

90
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,775
Guys,

91
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,300
guys.

92
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,700
I’m gonna be famous.

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,660
Xun’s latest film, Jujiu

94
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,900
is casting.

95
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,450
The estimated investment is 500 million.

96
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,420
Which Xun?

97
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,980
Who else can make me

98
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
so excited?

99
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,460
Li Xun?

100
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,660
Bingo!

101
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,340
In fact, I’ve always had a secret

102
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,260
that I’ve never revealed to anyone.

103
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,780
Xun is my childhood

104
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,580
Goddess Divine.

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,950
(Little Target Drama Club Training Plan)

106
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,660
Who’s the director?

107
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,140
The director is...

108
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,940
to be decided.

109
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,460
Jujiu is a big IP.

110
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,025
These days, IP and cast are
everything TV platforms want.

111
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,220
Who cares about the director?

112
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,420
It doesn’t even matter
who the scriptwriter is.

113
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,620
That’s how it is now.

114
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,780
It’s a lucrative business.

115
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,220
Really?

116
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,340
Of course.

117
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,780
So, I’m asking for your help

118
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,180
to convince Mr. Sun

119
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,500
to direct this film.

120
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,380
It is also a film

121
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,140
that he wishes to direct for years.

122
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,350
But

123
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,300
how am I going to convince Mr. Sun?

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,140
He is now committed to teaching.

125
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,300
He mentioned you to me many times

126
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,660
and spoke highly of you.

127
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,020
Can you do that for me?

128
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,100
I called you out

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,825
to ask for your help.

130
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,900
Qiyi,

131
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,020
I’ll do whatever you want me to do.

132
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,700
But I haven’t figured out
what to do yet.

133
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,220
Don’t worry.

134
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,075
Take your time.

135
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,780
I can help you with that.

136
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,300
Be a doer,

137
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,975
not a talker.

138
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:53,740
Shut up!

139
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,980
I just want to look at Qiyi.

140
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,450
When he comes up with an idea,

141
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,525
it’ll be dark already.

142
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,260
So where should we start?

143
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,460
The General Director of Jujiu,

144
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,580
what a great opportunity!

145
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,500
To convince Mr. Sun,

146
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,860
we have to find the reason
why he doesn’t want to take it.

147
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,940
Do you think

148
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,220
it’d be because Mr. Sun

149
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,700
wants to focus on teaching?

150
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,700
Could it be
that the school won’t allow it?

151
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,700
No way.

152
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,340
Our school advocates the most

153
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,380
the combination
of teaching and practice.

154
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,620
And there are precedents of teachers

155
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,140
directing and acting in TV works.

156
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,340
What’s the reason then?

157
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:42,060
Well,

158
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:43,860
we have to ask the man

159
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
Mr. Sun is close with for an answer.

160
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,780
Who is close with Mr. Sun?

161
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,020
Mr. Zhang.

162
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,580
Right.

163
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,100
How could I forget about him?

164
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,820
He plays chess with Mr. Sun every day.

165
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,820
Maybe he has an idea.

166
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,300
Yeah.

167
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Let’s go find him.

168
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,980
Sanshang, don’t you

169
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,340
have something to do?

170
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:09,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,780
I have to wash my underwear.

172
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,860
We have to go.

173
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,775
I’ll go with him.

174
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:13,380
Bye.

175
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,025
OK.

176
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:15,660
Come on.

177
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,660
There’s a club activity later.

178
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,850
I can’t go.

179
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,800
Fang Yan.

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,625
Qiyi,

181
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,375
I have nothing to do.

182
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,260
We can go.

183
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,375
Let’s go.

184
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,740
Come on.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,100
(Gentle and Pleasant Breeze)

186
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,140
Well, Mr. Sun

187
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
was a rising star

188
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,460
in the directing circle back then.

189
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,700
His debut film...

190
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,620
What’s the phrase to describe it?

191
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,380
Made a hit.

192
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,660
Made a sensation.

193
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,300
No wonder

194
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Xun insists Mr. Sun
should be the director.

195
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,860
But Mr. Sun hasn’t directed for so long.

196
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,180
Why is Xun so resolute?

197
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,780
What do you think the reason is?

198
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,200
No idea.

199
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,575
Xun is a leading actress now.

200
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,060
There’s a line of directors
wishing to work with her.

201
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,380
Were Mr. Sun and Xun

202
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,150
used to be...?

203
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,750
Hey!

204
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
Young man,

205
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,025
don’t make idle speculations.

206
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,125
However,

207
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,450
I also think

208
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,020
there’s something unusual between them.

209
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,620
Mr. Zhang.

210
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,220
Yeah?

211
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,200
Do you think we have a chance
to convince Mr. Sun?

212
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,660
I’m just wondering.

213
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,060
Why do you

214
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,180
have to convince Mr. Sun
to take the offer?

215
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,940
Xun helped us a lot.

216
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,580
And she said

217
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,260
this film

218
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,220
has always been Mr. Sun’s dream.

219
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,360
I have one more question.

220
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,935
Yeah.

221
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,100
If Mr. Sun was that popular,

222
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,700
why can’t I find

223
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,860
any information about it online?

224
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,060
It’s been a long time.

225
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,900
It’s normal
that you can’t find anything online.

226
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,780
Anyway, I can’t tell you

227
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,925
the name of this film.

228
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
You can find the CD

229
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,500
of Half Awaken in the library.

230
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,060
Half Awaken?

231
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,620
You mean Mr. Sun’s debut film

232
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,700
is Half Awaken?

233
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,340
Yeah, yeah, Half something.

234
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,060
I know what to do now.

235
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,975
Let’s go, Qiyi.

236
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:31,550
Hey,

237
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,300
there’s another thing.

238
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,940
Well, Li Xun

239
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,340
came to visit Mr. Sun two days ago.

240
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,215
Yeah?

241
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,660
Mr. Sun talked to me about it.

242
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,900
But,

243
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,300
judging by his attitude,

244
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,740
he’s definitely not taking it.

245
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,692
(CDs are not for loan.)

246
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:11,860
Du Ang.

247
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,750
What?

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,940
It’s not

249
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,540
a right thing to do, is it?

250
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,580
Why not?

251
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,060
It’s not like we’re stealing it.

252
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,980
We’ll give it back
when we finished watching it.

253
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,050
Right?

254
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,140
But...

255
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,380
No more buts.

256
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,420
There’s no time to hesitate.

257
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,380
You need to give Xun a reply tomorrow,

258
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:32,140
don’t you?

259
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:33,420
Listen,

260
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,500
I’ll take responsibility
if something goes wrong.

261
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,620
Keep looking.

262
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,650
Qiyi.

263
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:52,400
Mm-hmm.

264
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,975
Have you considered

265
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:55,260
what I asked?

266
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,220
What did you ask?

267
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:05,780
Would you date me?

268
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,900
Do you like me?

269
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,300
No.

270
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,940
Why not?

271
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,650
Because...

272
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,940
Because we know each other too well.

273
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:23,950
We’re friends.

274
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,060
Well, can we only be ordinary friends?

275
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:30,675
Yeah.

276
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,500
But I like you. I like you.

277
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,780
I like you. What should I do?

278
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,250
I...

279
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,620
What do you want me to do?

280
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,740
How do I know what to do?

281
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,900
Can I kiss you?

282
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,220
Just one kiss.

283
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,140
Stop.

284
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,250
No.

285
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,225
OK.

286
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,180
Look,

287
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,300
I thought it was funny.

288
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,220
So I cracked a joke.

289
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,850
Half Awaken.

290
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,450
Qiyi,

291
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:13,540
look, I found it.

292
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,100
Is this the one?

293
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
(Half Awaken)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,980
(Half Awaken)
This is it, right?

295
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,025
Hey, who’s there?

296
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:19,860
Hide.

297
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,460
I... I...

298
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,180
What are you doing?

299
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:27,950
Oh.

300
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:28,860
Oh.

301
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,675
What am I doing?

302
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,900
I’m a little dizzy.

303
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,340
I’ve been drinking and I’m dizzy.

304
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,300
Why am I here?

305
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,100
Where is this place?

306
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,300
Faster!

307
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,340
Speed up!

308
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,540
Hello?

309
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,540
I’m filling in again?

310
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,020
Alright, I’m going back now.

311
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,575
Um... chief,

312
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,900
I have to go.

313
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,660
Chief,

314
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,500
I’ve got work to do
in the cafeteria today.

315
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,740
I also have to go.

316
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Who else wants to leave?

317
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,200
Chief,

318
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
I promised Wu Rida

319
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,300
to go shopping with him today.

320
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,260
I’ll practice passing balls in the dorm.

321
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,375
Where is Li Shuang?

322
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,420
He has a lot of homework

323
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,100
and takes a day off.

324
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,025
Where are the others?

325
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,700
Some excused themselves

326
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,700
and three quit.

327
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,420
Quit?

328
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,940
Do you also want to quit?

329
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,700
That’s not what they mean.

330
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,500
They have work to do, right?

331
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,975
Yeah.

332
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:45,500
Work?

333
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,940
Why couldn’t you finish it
before you came?

334
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,540
It’s on short notice.

335
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,740
Don’t bother coming

336
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,940
to rehearse, if you don’t have time.

337
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,800
Chief,

338
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,100
to be frank,

339
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,580
we all have a lot to do every day.

340
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,150
If the passing ball is
all we’re gonna do,

341
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,220
we might choose to do something else.

342
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,460
This is the warm-up before rehearsal.

343
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,580
Warm up?

344
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,420
We do need a warm-up.

345
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,980
We’ve joined the club for a long time,

346
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,500
yet not one play is rehearsed.

347
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,140
You arrange all the training.

348
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,180
You’re just a freshman.

349
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,675
If you want to quit, just say so.

350
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,460
Don’t beat around the bush.

351
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,650
Chief, I’m busy.

352
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,340
I have to go.

353
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,220
My boss is waiting for me.

354
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,020
I have something to do too.

355
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,460
See you, Chief.

356
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,300
I’m leaving.

357
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,660
You misunderstood them.

358
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,700
Misunderstood?

359
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,620
What do they mean then?

360
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,820
I suggest we

361
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,340
hire an instructor.

362
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,200
An instructor?

363
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,300
I heard other societies

364
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,740
hired professional instructors

365
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,460
on the campus and from the public.

366
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,220
The instructor
doesn’t have to come often.

367
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,140
But as long as we have one,

368
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,940
students will join our club.

369
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,580
Because they value experience.

370
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,460
Is this the practice of other societies?

371
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,500
The Experimental Drama Society

372
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,580
have over 10 instructors.

373
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,420
That’s enough for amateur

374
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,220
performing arts learners.

375
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,180
We’ll discuss this later.

376
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,950
Tonight,

377
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,260
you gather all the members here.

378
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,460
Alright, OK.

379
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,060
Don’t hop.

380
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,175
Take care. Be careful.

381
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,020
Be careful.

382
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,980
That’s about right.

383
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,654
- Yeah.
- OK.

384
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:50,325
Here it is.

385
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,580
Sorry.

386
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,000
I overslept.

387
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,060
There’s juice.

388
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,100
Qiyi bought it for you.

389
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:08,580
Thank you.

390
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,660
Thanks, Qiyi.

391
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,420
Qiyi told me

392
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,500
you got caught stealing the CD
last night.

393
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,140
Is everything alright?

394
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:15,700
Yeah.

395
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,500
I told them I was studying.

396
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,820
Du Ang was studying?

397
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,900
And they bought it?

398
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,100
Why not?

399
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,020
I don’t have the stolen CD in my hand.

400
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,060
You’re a habitual thief.

401
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,420
Shut up.

402
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,980
Well, I cracked some jokes

403
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,060
with the security guards

404
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,660
and wrote a commitment.

405
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,660
Thank you, Du Ang.

406
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,900
What are you going to reward me?

407
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,660
Try it.

408
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,820
See if the CD can be played.

409
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:51,820
How’s it going?

410
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,775
Good.

411
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,980
Be careful.

412
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,060
I can’t

413
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,540
open this.

414
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:58,820
Wait, let me tell you.

415
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,540
This...

416
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,260
There you are.

417
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,350
Why are you here?

418
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,220
Doesn’t Fang Yan call a club activity?

419
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,100
Don’t mention it.

420
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,580
The club is about to break up.

421
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,740
The members complain

422
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,460
about a lack of professional training.

423
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,140
I suggested we drew Mr. Sun in.

424
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,260
But Fang Yan disagreed.

425
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,100
The members are quitting.

426
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,020
Soon,

427
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,780
they’ll be all gone.

428
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,700
Isn’t Bai Qiao well-connected?

429
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,020
Ask her help to find an instructor.

430
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,220
Qiyi,

431
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,700
can you ask Bai Qiao about it?

432
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,700
For Fang Yan’s sake.

433
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,860
- OK.
- Hey, hey, hey.

434
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,775
Our classmates are coming.

435
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,780
Let’s get the player set up

436
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,060
and the CD.

437
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
I’ll go then.

438
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,300
I’m going with you.

439
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,860
Are you sure? Your foot.

440
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,580
I’ll be fine.

441
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,380
And I got Sanshang.

442
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,980
Take care of her.

443
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,660
Bye.

444
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,780
What are we doing here?

445
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,125
Qiyi,

446
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,300
why are we having an extra movie review?

447
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,180
Stop it.

448
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,660
Qiyi, play it.

449
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,380
Sleepy.

450
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,660
Keep quiet.

451
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,980
As the deputy monitor,

452
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,700
I’ll explain for Qiyi.

453
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,700
Mr. Sun is coming in a while.

454
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,450
Let’s watch the film.

455
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,060
There’s a surprise in the film.

456
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,900
What surprise?

457
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,740
Shut up!

458
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,540
Look.

459
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,980
Pick anyone you like.

460
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,700
They’re all my friends.

461
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:15,800
Ox,

462
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,525
how much do they charge?

463
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,525
From leading actors to infamous ones,

464
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,940
they charge differently.

465
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,500
It depends on your need.

466
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,860
Infamous...

467
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,700
Which leading actors do you know?

468
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,900
Anyone you can name

469
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,820
is not a problem.

470
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Ox is very nice.

471
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
I’m sure he can help us.

472
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,940
Ox,

473
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,140
if we offer

474
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,580
500 yuan for an hour,

475
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,340
do you have any recommendations?

476
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,740
500 for an hour?

477
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,900
Bai Qiao,

478
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,820
your little friend is so funny.

479
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,825
Here’s the thing, Ox.

480
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,500
We’re all students

481
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,420
and can’t afford expensive instructors.

482
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,820
All my friends

483
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
are famous actors in Showbiz.

484
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,775
They won’t come for 500.

485
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:11,420
At least this number.

486
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,580
2,000?

487
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,260
No.

488
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,460
20,000.

489
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,375
And for 45 minutes.

490
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,060
Think about it.

491
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,100
How about this, Ox?

492
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,900
We’ll discuss it

493
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,020
with the chief of the club.

494
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,700
Right.

495
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,580
They’ll think about it.

496
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,700
Thanks, Ox.

497
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,225
(Director Sun Zhuowen)

498
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,700
Mr. Sun?

499
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,060
This film was directed by Mr. Sun?

500
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

501
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,060
Awesome, right?

502
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,140
Mr. Sun is amazing.

503
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,660
I’m wide awake now.

504
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,940
Where did you get the CD?

505
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,580
Did you rehearse for your homework?

506
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,660
Instead of rehearsing,

507
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,780
you’re watching a film.

508
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,940
Do your job.

509
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,740
Dismiss.

510
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,100
What are you doing?

511
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,300
Come on.

512
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,420
I need to change the dressing.

513
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,850
This way.

514
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,780
Hurry!

515
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:12,725
Faster!

516
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,400
Hya!

517
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,740
Hya!

518
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,300
Walk on!

519
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,820
Can we go another day?

520
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,740
No.

521
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,180
Hya!

522
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,625
Hya!

523
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,500
Woo!

524
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,075
Go ahead.

525
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,420
Talk things out with her.

526
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
What should I say?

527
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,300
Are you stupid?

528
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,500
Tell her whatever is bothering you.

529
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,250
Go.

530
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,780
Get in.

531
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,820
Go, go, go!

532
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,340
Hurry up!

533
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,740
Xiaoyu!

534
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,220
Can I help you, miss?

535
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,340
Um...

536
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,580
Hey, be careful with your foot!

537
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,500
How did it go?

538
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,425
Don’t worry.

539
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,100
We’ll work out something else.

540
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,820
How did it go with you two?

541
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,140
Did you find an instructor?

542
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,380
There are a lot.

543
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,580
But they charge too much.

544
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,540
That’s not the problem.

545
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,780
Bai Qiao’s friend

546
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,020
is a complete blowhard.

547
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,300
Xiuwen.

548
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Fang Yan falls out with club members.

549
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,780
He wants us to go right now.

550
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,540
Then let’s go.

551
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:05,200
Hey,

552
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,700
what about the CD player?

553
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:08,060
Leave it.

554
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Let’s go.

555
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,420
Few came to the club today

556
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,060
and they slacked on training.

557
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,300
Fang Yan was furious.

558
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,820
They got into a fight.

559
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,820
Talk to him.

560
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,660
I have to go.

561
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,225
Fang Yan,

562
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,100
don’t worry.

563
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,860
Bai Qiao is finding
suitable instructors.

564
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,460
Let’s try to keep the members.

565
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,820
Fang Yan, where are you going?

566
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,740
We’re all trying to help you.

567
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,420
Fang Yan,

568
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,660
do you think

569
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,020
everyone should follow your lead?

570
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:03,100
Fang Yan.

571
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,220
It’s Xun.

572
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,925
Answer it.

573
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,020
You’ll have to tell her the truth.

574
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,380
Who is it?

575
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,460
Mr. Sun.

576
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,100
Come in.

577
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:35,725
What is it?

578
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,075
Mr. Sun,

579
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,020
we all watched the film.

580
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,125
You’ve directed such a successful work.

581
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,500
We believe

582
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,100
you’ll make a great comeback.

583
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,780
I’ve made it very clear.

584
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,500
I won’t direct films anymore.

585
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,460
But Xun told me

586
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,980
Jujiu has been a dream film for you.

587
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,780
Time has changed.

588
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,300
It’s all gone.

589
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,180
People change.

590
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,100
Anything else?

591
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,340
If that’s all, go back.

592
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,420
I have to prepare for class.

593
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,425
Mr. Sun.

594
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,980
Is it because you have to teach?

595
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,140
Or is it not allowed?

596
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,250
No.

597
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,540
Then why?

598
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,275
Huh?

599
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,250
Hya!

600
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,140
Go left.

601
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,300
Go right.

602
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,700
Sanshang,

603
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,460
can you take an S route?

604
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,220
You should have lost weight.

605
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,660
By the way, Sanshang,

606
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,660
would you feel reluctant

607
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,540
that you have to look after me

608
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,060
because I was injured for your sake?

609
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,220
Why would I?

610
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
As long as you’re happy.

611
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,380
How glib!

612
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,165
Stop.

613
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,900
Mm-hmm.

614
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,020
A serious question.

615
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,300
Today outside the Health Center,

616
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,060
why didn’t you go in?

617
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,600
Don’t you agree

618
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,980
if you miss out on someone

619
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,020
or something at the right time,

620
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,820
they’ll be gone forever?

621
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,380
Hya!

622
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,380
Run!

623
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,060
We’re going!

624
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,950
Hurry! Go!

625
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,175
Fang Yan.

626
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,750
Sanshang told me

627
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,460
you’ve been busy with the club.

628
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,050
So I come to see

629
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,820
if I can be of some help.

630
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,850
I have an appointment
with some teachers tomorrow.

631
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
I’m sure they’ll have time.

632
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,580
Come to talk to them.

633
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,050
Thank you.

634
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,940
I’ve been thinking

635
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,380
someday we can walk side by side

636
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,380
on the campus like right now.

637
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,180
It’s late.

638
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,300
Let me walk you to the dorm.

639
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,580
I should go.

640
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,500
Good night.

641
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:31,350
(Du Ang: Basketball court, now.)

642
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:51,533
(Half Awaken)

643
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,020
What are you doing?

644
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,425
It’s pouring rain.

645
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,450
Are you crazy?

646
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,380
Fang Yan,

647
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,900
I dare you to battle with me.

648
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,540
Are you OK?

649
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,580
I’m totally fine.

650
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,620
Liar.

651
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,900
I know.

652
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
Qiyi

653
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:43,300
really likes you.

654
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,940
Actually,

655
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,100
at the beginning of college,

656
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,275
I found Qiyi

657
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,100
very interesting

658
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,400
and cute.

659
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,380
I’m happy when she’s around.

660
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,940
I remember on the first day,

661
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,060
she was trapped on the iron gate

662
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,500
and threw herself at me.

663
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:10,540
Wasn’t she silly?

664
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,300
You’re mistaken.

665
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,420
There’s nothing between me and Lu Qiyi.

666
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,800
Are you serious?

667
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,260
Let’s go.

668
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,500
Back to the dorm.

669
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,260
I have a practice course
the next morning.

670
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,020
Hold on, wait.

671
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:37,975
Look at me

672
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,180
and say it seriously.

673
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,580
Are you coming?

674
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,700
I’m leaving.

675
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:47,750
Hey!

676
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:49,075
Hey!

677
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,550
Remember what you said.

678
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,200
Don’t regret it.

679
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,000
I’m gonna charm her with every effort.

680
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,780
Don’t cry when I get her.

681
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,420
Deputy chief.

682
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,950
Hang on a little.

683
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,980
We’ll find an instructor soon.

684
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,050
Forget it.

685
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,980
I become nervous when I’m performing.

686
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,600
The instructor

687
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,700
will make it worse.

688
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
Hang on.

689
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,740
Let him go.

690
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,620
We also have to go.

691
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,175
Hey!

692
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,140
You’re early today.

693
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,900
Who found this place?

694
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Genius.

695
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,300
Where are you going?

696
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,060
Come around.

697
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:03,900
Stop standing there.

698
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,420
Come on now.

699
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,300
Get back here.

700
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,425
This is something

701
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,020
which I’ve never told anyone about.

702
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,860
It’s the most important thing
that’s ever happened to me.

703
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,460
Thank you, everyone.

704
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,075
Who’s next?

705
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,100
Xiuwen.

706
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,580
Xiuwen, come on.

707
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,075
I...

708
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:32,700
Come on.

709
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,725
Actually...

710
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:43,925
Hi!

711
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,300
Good work, everyone.

712
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,460
You don’t have to buy us water
every time.

713
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,180
It’s nothing.

714
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,300
Have a bottle of water, Mr. Sun.

715
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,180
No thanks.

716
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,500
I got it.

717
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,420
Alright, take a break.

718
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,180
Have some water.

719
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,300
Thank you.

720
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,860
You’re really something

721
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,260
to convince Mr. Sun to come.

722
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,500
It wasn’t you?

723
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,180
No.

724
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,060
Qiyi,

725
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,540
can you hear me?

726
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,020
Grandpa,

727
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,750
I can hear you.

728
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,500
I’m listening.

729
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,940
Dad,

730
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:52,460
keep it low.

731
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,220
You don’t have to yell.

732
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,750
Qiyi,

733
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,375
your grandma and I

734
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,780
know about what happened.

735
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,780
You’ve been

736
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,180
a good girl since childhood.

737
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,860
What you did

738
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,300
is really shocking.

739
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,580
But I know

740
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,220
my granddaughter must
have her reason to do that.

741
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,700
Today I just want to know

742
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,180
why.

743
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,500
In my opinion,

744
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,470
Qiyi is quite like me.

745
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,020
She loved to dance on stage
in childhood.

746
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,000
Qiyi,

747
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,275
you have my support.

748
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,300
I’m asking Qiyi. Don’t interrupt.

749
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,600
Actors nowadays

750
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,380
are unlike the ones in the past.

751
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,540
The Showbiz is scandalous.

752
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,780
Alright, stop it.

753
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,300
You don’t know much yourself.

754
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,335
Mom,

755
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,340
I hate to say,

756
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,260
but Qiyi could have

757
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,940
gone to one of the top 10 universities

758
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,100
with her academic result.

759
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,180
She could have studied finance,

760
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,340
medicine,

761
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,700
or architecture

762
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,325
with good job prospects.

763
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,350
But she chose to be an actress.

764
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,725
Studying performing arts

765
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,300
doesn’t mean you can be a star
in TV works.

766
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,340
There are surplus actors in China.

767
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,740
Too much uncertainty.

768
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,780
If Qiyi’s career is not smooth,

769
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,500
you’ll regret.

770
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,625
Alright, enough.

771
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,540
Qiyi isn’t a child anymore.

772
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,340
Let’s listen to her.

773
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,020
It took me great courage

774
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,100
to make this decision.

775
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,220
I remember the first time
I performed on stage when I was little.

776
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,580
Somehow,

777
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,060
I was caught at first glance

778
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,380
by the dazzling spotlight

779
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,940
and the beautiful stage.

780
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,180
It was like a dream.

781
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,980
At that moment,

782
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,060
I fell in love with performing.

783
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,260
I attended almost every performance

784
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,460
in the six years of elementary school.

785
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,340
When I went to junior high,

786
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,940
I began to get busy with study.

787
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,380
Dad wouldn’t let me perform anymore.

788
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,020
Do you remember

789
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
the dance contest before the exam
to senior high?

790
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,060
If it were not for extra points,

791
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,340
Dad wouldn’t have agreed to let me go.

792
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,900
But I cherished that opportunity.

793
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,020
Every day, I tried

794
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,580
to finish homework at school.

795
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,620
After school,

796
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,580
I went to practice at the studio

797
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,140
over and over again

798
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,340
until it was dark.

799
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,550
Unexpectedly,

800
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,820
there was an accident.

801
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,020
I sprained my ankle.

802
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,660
I cried all night,

803
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,220
not because of pain,

804
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,420
but because I was afraid

805
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,140
that I’d never be able
to perform on stage again.

806
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,860
Then in senior high,

807
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,260
I threw myself at study.

808
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,460
In the end, I became the top student
in the class,

809
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
the best student to the teachers

810
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,260
and the pride of my parents.

811
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,620
When I applied for universities,

812
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,940
the teachers recommended

813
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,620
a lot of universities and majors,

814
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,740
but I didn’t like any of them.

815
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,050
The moment

816
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,900
I saw School of Performing Arts, SUA,

817
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,820
I made up my mind.

818
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,180
So I went to the admission exam
behind your back.

819
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,060
I couldn’t believe I was admitted.

820
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,780
When I filled out the application,

821
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,020
I hesitated.

822
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,500
I knew

823
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,300
you wouldn’t agree.

824
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,900
But I was 18 years old.

825
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,100
I wanted to fight for my dream.

826
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,060
I was afraid it was gonna be

827
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,060
the last chance if I let it slip.

828
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
I know you’re angry with me.

829
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,220
I hope you can forgive me.

830
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,500
And please trust me.

831
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,900
I chose this path.

832
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,540
No matter how hard it is,

833
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,580
I will stick to it.

834
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,780
I will be responsible for my life.

835
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,740
Qiyi,

836
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
stick to what you like.

837
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,340
We support you.

838
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,420
Qiyi,

839
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,100
if you’re determined,

840
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,700
I will say no more.

841
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,180
But you used
to be the pride of the family.

842
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,580
Now that you’re studying acting,

843
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,180
you must do your best.

844
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,060
