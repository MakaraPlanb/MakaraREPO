=Episode 15=

24
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,980
On a stormy night,

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,340
in a downtown theatre,

26
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,100
a spectacular musical is on.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,340
The lead actress, Ruoyu,

28
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,180
wins a big round of applause.

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,660
But right at this moment,

30
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,820
a mysterious woman

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,220
shows up at the backdoor of the theatre.

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,300
She sneaks into the theatre

33
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,580
to recover what Ruoyu took from her.

34
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:15,600
Yes.

35
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,940
It’s a story

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,980
about two actresses fighting
for the lead.

37
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,300
What do you think?

38
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,100
It’s so real.

39
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:24,540
I like it.

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,175
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,540
Not bad.

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,800
No objection.

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,900
So who’s the scriptwriter?

44
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,140
It’s me.

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,375
If you think it’s OK,

46
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,900
then let’s talk about the characters.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,200
There are five characters in the play,

48
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,340
the mysterious woman, Rufeng,

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,600
the lead actress of the play, Ruoyu,

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,620
the lead actor of the play, Tianzong,

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,940
the patron of the theatre,

52
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,025
Mr. Three Million,

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,660
and a waiter

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,100
who appears as a clown.

55
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,820
I think Fang Yan is the best candidate
for Tianzong.

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,540
He’s noble and handsome,

57
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,180
but sort of eye candy.

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,820
Sanshang should play Mr. Three Million.

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,475
What about the clown?

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,500
It requires high flexibility
to play a clown.

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,380
I think Du Ang is our man.

62
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:28,325
I don’t play clowns.

63
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,780
You’re the most flexible among us.

64
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,900
No one can play it except you.

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,525
Shut up.

66
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,580
Am I funny?

67
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,340
Who said clowns must be funny?

68
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,075
They can be cool.

69
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:44,825
Right?

70
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,820
Yeah.

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,020
Well, I’ll rewrite the script.

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,475
As for the girls,

73
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,300
Kaixin is good for...

74
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,460
I want to play the lead actress.

75
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,100
Please, my dearest Qiyi.

76
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,625
Qiyi,

77
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,175
who would remember roles
other than the lead ones?

78
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,425
The lead actors are whom we watch on TV.

79
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,180
Kaixin,

80
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,740
I have an idea.

81
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,660
We both give it a try.

82
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,420
The better one gets the role,

83
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,975
OK?

84
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,140
Alright.

85
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,740
You’re such an affectionate man.

86
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,100
You’re buried in my soil,

87
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,050
where you take root,

88
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,780
and tie me up with your roots.

89
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,820
Your thick canopy

90
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,580
shades every inch of me.

91
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,980
In the abyss of darkness,

92
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,580
I’ve already fallen completely.

93
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,100
Look at me.

94
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,660
Look at me.

95
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,620
I don’t know when I started

96
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,980
to get used to living so humbly,

97
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,350
and wishing you could set your eyes

98
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,130
on me.

99
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,620
Forget it.

100
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,940
Forget it.

101
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,300
None of that matters anymore.

102
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,100
You’re the one

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,700
and only.

104
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,420
I love you

105
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,380
with all my heart.

106
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,020
I think Qiyi is better.

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Qiyi did great,

108
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,425
but I’ll go with Kaixin.

109
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:41,350
Huh?

110
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,540
Sorry, Kaixin.

111
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,420
I think Qiyi is better.

112
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:25,260
What do you want?

113
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,625
Du!

114
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,540
If you’re angry,

115
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,300
take it out on me.

116
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,220
Why do you think I’m angry?

117
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
If you’re not happy,

118
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,375
punch me.

119
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,900
Do you have the guts to fight me?

120
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,860
What kind of man are you
to embarrass a girl in the rehearsal?

121
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,725
Listen, Fang Yan.

122
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,100
I’ll do my part in the play.

123
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,875
But our brotherhood

124
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:07,375
is over.

125
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,580
I wonder how Hao Kaixin

126
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,180
got admitted to Performing Arts.

127
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,700
I hear she has a special talent,

128
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,740
martial arts.

129
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,540
So she can only work as a stand-in

130
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,740
like a sandbag

131
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,180
in a crew.

132
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,900
In Showbiz,

133
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,700
plain girls have no future.

134
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Shadowing Lu Qiyi doesn’t give her

135
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,540
any privileges.

136
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,450
Kaixin,

137
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,300
check it out for me.

138
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,740
Is the schedule OK?

139
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,400
Isn’t it always your call?

140
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,060
So, rehearsal at 9:00 AM tomorrow.

141
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,940
Don’t forget.

142
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,500
I want to play the lead actress.

143
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,780
Okay, my dearest Qiyi?

144
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,015
Like I said,

145
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,700
it’s difficult to be an actress.

146
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,780
Who would remember roles
other than the lead ones?

147
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,740
The lead actors are

148
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,020
whom we watch on TV.

149
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,700
Late for the first rehearsal.

150
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,500
Are we gonna rehearse or not?

151
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,540
Fang Yan said he couldn’t make it

152
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,500
and would come in the afternoon.

153
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,620
How can we rehearse with someone absent?

154
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,140
Let’s do it another time.

155
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,100
Kaixin,

156
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,380
let’s read the lines today.

157
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,300
Sanshang,

158
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,860
can you read Fang Yan’s lines?

159
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,900
I don’t mind.

160
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,860
But most of my parts are with Fang Yan.

161
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,000
I’m not good at

162
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,300
filling in for others.

163
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,660
Du.

164
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,020
Can we work a little hard on it?

165
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,740
The tryout is in two days.

166
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,900
If I were the lead actress,

167
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,020
I’d do my best.

168
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,580
How about this?

169
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,540
I’ll fill in for him.

170
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,380
OK.

171
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,580
Du Ang,

172
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,540
start with you.

173
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,650
Prologue.

174
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,900
I’ll start with this.

175
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:22,400
Du Ang.

176
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,975
Yeah.

177
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,550
You’re playing a clown.

178
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,565
Can you add more exaggerating

179
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,900
or funny moves?

180
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,020
I think it’d be better.

181
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,100
Oh.

182
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,900
Got it.

183
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,200
Well...

184
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:40,350
Hey!

185
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:42,400
Hey!

186
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,620
Du Ang, where are you going?

187
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,500
I think we’re all in great shape.

188
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,540
However, we need to pay attention

189
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,620
to details,

190
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,140
especially the lines.

191
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,300
We need more practice.

192
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,820
Let’s go over it again.

193
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,775
OK.

194
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,180
Alright.

195
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,180
I’ll read it.

196
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,180
Act one,

197
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,700
date…

198
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,260
- Excuse me.
- March...

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,980
I have to take a call.

200
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,660
You guys go on.

201
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,820
You always interrupt me.

202
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,225
25th.

203
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,180
Hello? Hai.

204
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,875
Did you consider it?

205
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,540
Yes, I did.

206
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,460
I have so much homework.

207
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,180
So I probably can’t go this time.

208
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,460
Then I won’t be able

209
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,860
to get you a role in the film, Jujiu.

210
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,225
OK.

211
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,020
Maybe this is destined.

212
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,420
But do call me next time

213
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,580
when you need me.

214
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,950
Alright.

215
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,325
So be it.

216
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,660
Thank you.

217
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,250
Bye.

218
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,100
Here.

219
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,940
Thank you, sir.

220
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,780
How did it go with the rehearsal?

221
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,600
Not bad.

222
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,180
OK.

223
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,300
What’s it about?

224
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,420
It’s about two actresses

225
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,275
fighting for the lead.

226
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,620
You wrote the script?

227
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,500
Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,220
It’s a good theme.

229
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,100
Better be the head of a dog
than the tail of a lion.

230
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,380
The actors who don’t want to be the lead
are not good actors.

231
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,740
But Qiyi,

232
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,650
do you know

233
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,140
why everyone wants
to be the protagonist?

234
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,060
Because only they can be
remembered by the audience.

235
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,820
Have you watched Crazy Stone?

236
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:52,150
Yes.

237
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,420
Is Huang Bo the lead actor?

238
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,175
No.

239
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,420
But everyone remembers him.

240
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,100
And this supporting role

241
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,900
is the start of his career.

242
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,700
Do you know why?

243
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,020
Because he cherishes
every chance to perform.

244
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,625
His motto is

245
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,180
“There are no minor roles,
only blinkered actors.”

246
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,325
Qiyi,

247
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,550
do you know what to do now?

248
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,150
Hey,

249
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,875
hey, what is this different
from the real one?

250
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:33,175
It looks real,
which means it’s not real.

251
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,950
Then let’s do a swap.

252
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Let’s just switch it over, right?

253
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:42,225
What?

254
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,275
Kaixin,

255
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,000
I want to talk to you.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,850
A swap?

257
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:49,650
That’s right.

258
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,420
You can play Rufeng.

259
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,860
(Fang Yan as Tianzong)

260
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,020
Mr. Three Million,

261
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,675
Miss Ruoyu has been
very popular recently.

262
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,980
Shall we

263
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,620
give her a chance to audition

264
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,300
for the lead actress of the new play?

265
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,900
No.

266
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,980
(Li Sanshang as Mr. Three Million)

267
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,100
If Miss Rufeng finds out

268
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,220
someone is shaking her up
as the lead actress,

269
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,820
she’ll go crazy.

270
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,740
That’s true.

271
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,300
But a theatre has to

272
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,420
embrace new actors and actresses

273
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,620
to keep the audience’s attention.

274
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,420
Among all actresses,

275
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,540
who else is

276
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,300
more impressive than Ruoyu?

277
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,300
Not only does she have a good voice,

278
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,660
but she’s also tender

279
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,150
and modest.

280
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,340
Do you think we should...?

281
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,420
I advise you

282
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,340
to keep some distance from Ruoyu.

283
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,500
I heard

284
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,100
someone saw you

285
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,700
and her discussing script alone

286
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,500
in the park last night.

287
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,200
If Miss Rufeng finds out

288
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,180
that her boyfriend

289
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,020
is so kind to another woman,

290
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,620
she’ll probably be astonished.

291
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,540
We were discussing the script
last night.

292
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,140
She didn’t understand some of it.

293
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,340
The show is about to start.

294
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,825
Let’s watch

295
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,340
Miss Rufeng’s performance first.

296
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,150
(Lu Qiyi as Ruoyu)

297
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:05,155

Dean.

314
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:22,900
Yeah.

315
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,700
Would you like to say a few words?

316
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,380
After you. Please.

317
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,075
OK.

318
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,725
Ladies and gentlemen,

319
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,860
I can see that

320
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,060
you’ve put a lot of thought

321
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,620
into this assignment.

322
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,100
Good job.

323
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,675
We’ve discussed it

324
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,540
and agreed

325
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,700
that the play by Lu Qiyi’s team

326
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,600
is more fascinating

327
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,140
in both the storyline

328
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,300
and the performance.

329
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,980
And I admire their courage

330
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,260
to make it a musical.

331
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,725
So we decided

332
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,900
that Lu Qiyi’s team

333
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,950
should participate in the show

334
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,940
on behalf of the freshmen.

335
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:16,600
Yeah!

336
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,650
However,

337
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,460
there are some problems with it.

338
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,980
The stage effect is rather dull.

339
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,660
So we decided

340
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,500
some of you will perform

341
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,660
and the others work behind the scenes.

342
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,500
Let’s try our best

343
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,620
to present the best work

344
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:43,500
on the stage.

345
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,250
I hope everyone will work hard.

346
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:50,850
Dean?

347
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,425
Mm-hmm.

348
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,540
Your comments, please.

349
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,250
Sure.

350
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,340
Mr. Sun is right.

351
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,050
No more compliments.

352
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,900
It’s true that there are
still some problems.

353
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,300
The prominent one I think

354
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,220
is that we need to reconsider the cast.

355
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,975
I watched
the other three groups perform.

356
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,540
I think

357
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,300
Bai Qiao is a better candidate
for the homeless girl, Rufeng.

358
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,150
Also,

359
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,980
the clown.

360
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,400
It requires the high flexibility
of the actor.

361
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,500
It seems you can

362
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,140
barely manage it.

363
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,940
I think the most flexible boy

364
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,420
in your class

365
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,260
is a better candidate.

366
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,420
Sir,

367
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,725
so you’re saying

368
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,780
I’m no longer needed.

369
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,700
We should avoid our weaknesses.

370
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,140
Sir,

371
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,980
we have been practicing for a long time

372
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,500
and we perform better as a team.

373
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,850
It’s settled.

374
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,100
This musical

375
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,300
is meant to be the best by the freshmen.

376
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,940
So the cast has to be the best.

377
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,780
I’m fine.

378
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,660
Qiyi,

379
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,020
maybe I’ll never be

380
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,820
the lead actress in my life.

381
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,850
Hello?

382
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,780
Hello?

383
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,100
Qiao,

384
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,220
when is this month’s money coming in?

385
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,540
Don’t worry.

386
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,860
I’ll transfer it in a few days.

387
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,900
Look,

388
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,600
your tuition is over 10,000 a year.

389
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,525
But till now,

390
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,925
you haven’t acted in any works.

391
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,060
What a waste of money!

392
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,620
Alright,

393
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,980
I’ll transfer the money tomorrow, OK?

394
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,700
Why do you want to sell your bag?

395
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,420
I don’t like it anymore.

396
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,980
This bag is worn out.

397
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,020
What?

398
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,660
How?

399
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,980
I only carried it twice.

400
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,225
Once it’s used, its value drops.

401
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,580
You name a price then.

402
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,380
3,000.

403
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,340
3,000?

404
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,300
I bought it for over 10,000.

405
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,925
Then inquire elsewhere.

406
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,380
That’s my offer.

407
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,700
Hello? Hai.

408
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,875
It’s about the thing you said last time.

409
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,740
Yeah, I’ve considered it.

410
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,250
800 soldiers rushed to the north slope.

411
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,740
For the next pose,

412
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,250
I’d like you to form some kind of

413
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,060
communication

414
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,460
with your partners.

415
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,260
Ready?

416
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,540
Go.

417
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,460
Nicely done, Qiyi.

418
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,180
You’re great, too.

419
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,325
What is this?

420
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,425
I’m Rose.

421
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,860
I’m Jack.

422
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,580
What a lame pose!

423
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,460
No wonder the ship sank.

424
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,500
OK, resume your positions!

425
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,425
The girls did great.

426
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,650
What’s wrong with the boys
in your class?

427
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,100
You’re so lifeless.

428
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,740
Can you practice a little harder?

429
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,180
Show me your muscles

430
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,380
and your strength!

431
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,150
Ma’am,

432
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,180
here comes the strength.

433
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,020
Ma’am,

434
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,620
may I have a dance with you?

435
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:31,275
(Southern University of the Arts)

436
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,180
Hello? Aunt.

437
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,925
Hi, Qiyi.

438
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,060
Aunt, do you remember

439
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,500
the end-term show I told you about?

440
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,660
The date is set.

441
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,350
And I got the lead role.

442
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,740
Congratulations, Qiyi.

443
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,900
Good luck!

444
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,060
Thank you, Aunt.

445
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,620
And Dad said

446
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,460
he’d come to watch it
with my grandparents.

447
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,140
If you’re available,

448
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,740
I’d like to invite you, too.

449
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,300
Great. When?

450
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,700
It’s next weekend.

451
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,220
Make sure you do your best.

452
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,020
Don’t let us down.

453
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,380
Most of all,
don’t let your grandpa down.

454
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,700
Understood?

455
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,140
Don’t worry, Aunt.

456
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,020
I’ll do my best.

457
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,850
Good. Is that all?

458
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,220
I have to go.

459
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,380
Yes, that’s all.

460
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,260
By the way, Aunt,

461
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,780
I wrote the...

462
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,820
Hello?

463
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,180
Kaixin,

464
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,260
are you going out?

465
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:31,575
Mm-hmm.

466
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,780
How did you do
on the Marxist Philosophy test last week?

467
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,940
Not bad.

468
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,620
I can speak in a hoarse voice.

469
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,580
That would be better.

470
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,780
Bai Qiao,

471
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,980
finally.

472
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,500
Sorry.

473
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,340
I’m late.

474
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,900
It’s OK.

475
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,260
We just started.

476
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,660
I read the lines for you.

477
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,020
Thank you.

478
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,900
Hey,

479
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,380
you OK?

480
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,450
Yeah, I’m fine.

481
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,400
Let’s do it.

482
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,600
OK.

483
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,740
What the heck is going on?

484
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,900
Tianzong,

485
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,260
someone drugged my coffee.

486
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,025
I...

487
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,820
Help me, Tianzong.

488
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,620
Help me, Tianzong.

489
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,875
What were you thinking?

490
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,420
You screwed up an important show.

491
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,580
It wasn’t my intention.

492
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,140
Someone set me up.

493
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,200
It’s like this.

494
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,380
It wasn’t my intention.

495
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,780
Someone set me up.

496
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,340
With emotion.

497
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,300
Look at him in the eyes.

498
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,620
What’s the difference?

499
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,700
Go on, go on.

500
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,700
Forget it. Don’t fight.

501
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:51,700
Help me, Tianzong.

502
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,660
Someone set you up?

503
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,060
Who can prove it?

504
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,100
I can testify to Miss Rufeng.

505
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,420
I saw it.

506
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,620
Someone did set her up.

507
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,850
Tianzong,

508
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,380
please believe me.

509
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,540
Tianzong,

510
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,820
you have to believe me.

511
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,925
Tianzong,

512
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,860
you have to believe me.

513
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
I think you can grab him at this point.

514
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,500
Are you Rufeng or am I?

515
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,180
But every line I wrote

516
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,420
serves a purpose.

517
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,250
Calm down. It’s OK.

518
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,140
Qiyi is right.

519
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,220
Let’s do as she said.

520
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,860
Bai Qiao improvised it great.

521
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,940
It’s the same.

522
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,260
It means pretty much the same thing.

523
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,900
But...

524
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,300
I think we should call it a day.

525
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,950
No one’s in the best shape.

526
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:45,625
Hey,

527
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,460
Bai Qiao is definitely drunk.

528
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:49,820
Also,

529
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,300
why is Qiyi so irritable today?

530
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,740
She isn’t usually like this.

531
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,580
Why don’t we rehearse in the afternoon?

532
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,620
More?

533
00:29:58,675 --> 00:29:59,300
Mm-hmm.

534
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,425
Yes.

535
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,100
Fang Yan,

536
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,780
was I bad-tempered

537
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,060
during the rehearsal?

538
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,860
I know you’re under a lot of pressure.

539
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,500
I invited my family to watch the show,

540
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,900
so I have to do my best.

541
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,620
Silly girl.

542
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,300
Don’t put so much pressure on yourself.

543
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,980
Thank you.

544
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,860
Well,

545
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,125
do you think the script is lame?

546
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,740
Let me put it this way.

547
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,620
Many scripts

548
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,180
are being revised

549
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,900
until the shooting.

550
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,250
Recently,

551
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,340
- Well…
- the famous actor, Su Wen...

552
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,900
Can you read the script

553
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,540
- after the evening rehearsal?
- According to an insider,

554
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,220
Su Wen is suspected of tax evasion.

555
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,060
And his previous investment in films

556
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
is thought to be money laundering.

557
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,580
Fang Yan.

558
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,260
Su Wen’s image as a good man

559
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,450
- Fang Yan.
- is questioned.

560
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,000
Huh?

561
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,980
Next, a quick look at the latest films.

562
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,650
Fang Yan,

563
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,175
- help me improve the script
- The shooting of The Undercover

564
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:09,820
- after the rehearsal.
- by a famous director, Wang Liang,

565
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:11,595
- I have other plans.
- kicks off at Hengdian.

566
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,550
- Maybe you have to do it on your own.
- We’re informed that this film

567
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,527
- I have to go.
- that features martial arts

568
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
takes 7 years in the planning.

569
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,425
Director Wang, with his talent,

570
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:20,175
gathers Li Kun, Zhao Ying

571
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:21,550
and other leading actors in his cast.

572
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,267
This film is expected

573
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,700
to be released next year.

574
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:27,925
You haven’t eaten, have you?

575
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,880
No.

576
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
I ordered some for you.

577
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,260
Here.

578
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,580
Thank you.

579
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,675
Is it good?

580
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,425
Mm-hmm.

581
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:46,980
It’s great.

582
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
I came over last night

583
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,150
and waited for you until 11:00 PM.

584
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,850
Is something wrong?

585
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:02,800
No.

586
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,050
My friend broke up with her boyfriend.

587
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,100
I went to stay with her.

588
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:09,775
Oh.

589
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,925
(Glamor Body Contouring)

590
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:38,540
Hi,

591
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,825
would you care to learn more?

592
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,860
Our hospital offers a discount now.

593
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,950
The price is low.

594
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,525
We have doctors from abroad.

595
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,875
The consultation is free.

596
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,925
Look at my face.

597
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,500
I had surgery there.

598
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,020
How do I look?

599
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,100
It’s completely natural.

600
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,450
Take it.

601
00:32:54,425 --> 00:32:55,340
Hello, miss.

602
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,980
Take a look. Here.

603
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,700
(Glamor Body Contouring)
We offer a discount now.

604
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,540
Favorable price for face shaping
and whitening.

605
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,060
(Micro-plastic Surgery)
No, thanks.

606
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,420
(Micro-plastic Surgery)
It’s true. Take a look.

607
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,820
Go consult the doctor.

608
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,125
I was told that the doctor
came from abroad.

609
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,980
I did come back from abroad.

610
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,475
Generally speaking,

611
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,540
your face

612
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,180
is featureless.

613
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,900
Your facial organs

614
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,020
don’t look bad.

615
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,140
But on the whole…

616
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,060
How should I put it?

617
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
I think it’s unattractive.

618
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,500
Really unattractive.

619
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:50,580
Well,

620
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,420
what do you suggest?

621
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,025
Miss,

622
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,140
don’t worry.

623
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,980
Well,

624
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,580
we can get your chin

625
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,220
reduced a bit.

626
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,300
Here.

627
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,660
Here.

628
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,260
Check this out.

629
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,340
We have several packages.

630
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,250
Yeah, this one.

631
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,140
And this.

632
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,860
Doctor,

633
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,060
do I have to do all these?

634
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,900
Don’t you want to be a star?

635
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:25,825
Yeah.

636
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,340
Then tell me this.

637
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,340
Which actor or actress

638
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:32,300
hasn’t had plastic surgery?

639
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,950
I’ll be honest with you.

640
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,220
I’m not exaggerating.

641
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,940
Our hospital

642
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,980
is basically their first choice.

643
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,820
Well, for our business’s sake,

644
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,775
we have to keep it confidential.

645
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,300
I promise

646
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
you’ll become prettier and more elegant

647
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,460
than those actresses.

648
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,220
Because you’re not bad all over.

649
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,380
And you’re young.

650
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:57,975
Right?

651
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,020
Rest assured.

652
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,140
We won’t mislead you.

653
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,500
We have professional ethics.

654
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,780
It’s your call.

655
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,260
OK.

656
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,420
I don’t have the key.

657
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,020
Dude,

658
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,860
my dorm is locked.

659
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,525
I can’t get in.

660
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,700
Can I use your phone?

661
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,100
Do you have Uzhda’s number?

662
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,100
How about Luo Xiuwen’s?

663
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,675
You don’t have their numbers?

664
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,000
I don’t know them.

665
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,900
Alright. Forget it.

666
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,300
I’ll sit and wait.

667
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,350
How many times have I told you

668
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,180
not to turn around when filming?

669
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,260
You wanna steal the spotlight?

670
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,140
From the lead actress?

671
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,740
I’m talking about you.

672
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,260
Don’t laugh.

673
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,125
Fame or job? Your choice.

674
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,820
Let me tell you.

675
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,220
I can find as many extras

676
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,140
like you as I wish.

677
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,820
Do you want to keep this job or not?

678
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,860
Ox.

679
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,820
Get out of here.

680
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,775
Ox.

681
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,350
I’m Hao Kaixin.

682
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,060
I’m good at martial arts.

683
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:07,335
Hao Kaixin.

684
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:07,850
Yeah.

685
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,860
What can I do for you?

686
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,140
I want

687
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,300
to make money.

688
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,700
To make money?

689
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,350
Yeah.

690
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,660
Is there anything I can do?

691
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,980
I’m counting on you, Ox.

692
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,300
Come with me.

693
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:32,025
(Chiba Restaurant)

694
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,540
You’re good.

695
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,740
What a waste

696
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
if you don’t act!

697
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,980
Come to me when you need money.

698
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,055
Mm-hmm.

699
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,940
Thank you, Ox.

700
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,220
However, I have to give you

701
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,260
a small tip.

702
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,140
As a stunt double,

703
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,340
your face can’t appear on camera.

704
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,540
If necessary,

705
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,940
you take the beating.

706
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,460
Don’t fight back.

707
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,380
Got it.

708
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,075
Yeah.

709
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,700
(Casablanca)

710
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,180
Hey, Sun.

711
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,975
What are you doing tonight?

712
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,420
It’s your birthday.

713
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,660
Don’t you remember?

714
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,660
It doesn’t matter how I found out.

715
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,260
Clear your schedule for tonight.

716
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,100
Alright, say no more.

717
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,900
It’s settled.

718
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,860
Why did Lu Qiyi choose Fang Yan?

719
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,625
Why didn’t she choose you?

720
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,060
Me?

721
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,340
It doesn’t matter.

722
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,340
But look at me.

723
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,220
I’m good-looking,

724
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,300
hot,

725
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,660
humorous,

726
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,740
and charming.

727
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,100
And I’m rich.

728
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,660
I can’t even find a flaw in myself.

729
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,620
You and Lu Qiyi were
childhood sweethearts

730
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,020
and you’ve known each other
for ten years.

731
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,940
I would understand if she chose you.

732
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,780
But how was she bewitched by Fang Yan?

733
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,500
I think you’re good

734
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,740
in every way,

735
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,140
except for the long face.

736
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,940
But you’re kind under the cool demeanor,

737
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,740
a better man than Fang Yan.

738
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,500
And you’re more handsome.

739
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,225
You’re not bad.

740
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,340
Oh, I’m flattered.

741
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,175
Hey,

742
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,425
you’re always playing others’ songs.

743
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,220
Why don’t you write one yourself?

744
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,020
I haven’t written songs in a long time.

745
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,220
Your inspiration has dried up.

746
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,820
That’s a shame.

747
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,700
It’s a shame.

748
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,200
(Xiaoshi
I’m already here.)

749
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,775
(Xun)

750
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:58,850
Hello?

751
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,740
Shall we begin?

752
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,180
I’d like to apologize to you.

753
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,180
I was bad-tempered.

754
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,180
It’s OK.

755
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,300
We understand.

756
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,060
Let’s do it.

757
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,700
OK.

758
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,525
By the way, Qiyi.

759
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,300
Let’s practice the part in the center.

760
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,525
I think…

761
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,580
You and Sanshang should come up first.

762
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,300
Hello? Kaixin.

763
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,140
Don’t panic.

764
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,980
I’ll be right there.

765
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,580
What’s wrong?

766
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,940
It’s Kaixin!

767
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,475
Hey!

768
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,660
Calm down.

769
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,740
Tell us what happened.

770
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,100
Kaixin hurt an actor in the crew.

771
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,060
She’s detained by Ox.

772
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,460
He’s gonna break her leg

773
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,500
if we don’t compensate.

774
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,780
I have to go save her.

775
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,900
I know Ox.

776
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,620
