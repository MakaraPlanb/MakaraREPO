25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,250
Scholar,

26
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:44,350
do you know

27
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,900
how to start a club?

28
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,000
You need to go through
the application first.

29
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,075
You have to go to Mr. Zhang first

30
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,025
to submit the form.

31
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:54,125
You really know that?

32
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:57,800
It’s written in the student handbook.

33
00:01:58,975 --> 00:01:59,450
Thanks.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,325
Wait!

35
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:05,250
Do you

36
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,050
really think

37
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,325
I’m not fit to study acting?

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,075
Did you get irritated

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,325
by what I said in class?

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,975
No.

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,200
I don’t know if you’re fit for it.

42
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:22,300
But there must be a reason

43
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,600
why you passed the admission exam.

44
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,775
After all,

45
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,225
you’re quite good at slapping people.

46
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,450
Mr. Zhang has a dog!

47
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,800
Got it!

48
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,650
Excuse me, sir.

49
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,550
Hey.

50
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,750
I’m here to apply for the club.

51
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,750
Come here. Take a seat.

52
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,750
Play the game with me.

53
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,225
Oh.

54
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,000
Come here. Come on.

55
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,825
Which class are you in?

56
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:12,200
Sir,

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,175
I’m in the acting class.

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,025
Does Mr. Sun approve of your
participation in club activities?

59
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,000
Do not let school activities

60
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,775
interfere with your studies.

61
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,150

Do you have enough initial staff?

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,325
Not enough, I’m afraid.

66
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,050
Sir,

67
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,425
there are three of us.

68
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,425
It’s expressly stipulated in the school

69
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:55,775
that there have to be
at least ten people

70
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:57,675
to start a club,

71
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,075
and the application will be

72
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,875
completed before this Friday.

73
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,900
Come on.

74
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:05,675
Forget it.

75
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,150
Only three days to go.

76
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:11,100
I think you’d better

77
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,425
go back to your class and follow

78
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,525
Mr. Sun to study hard.

79
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,600
Checkmate.

80
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:23,375
Dead game now.

81
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,875
We have only the three of us.

82
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,300
Only Hao Kaixin will join us.

83
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:35,175
If I say,

84
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,700
give out 200 yuan per person.

85
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,500
I don’t believe no one will come.

86
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,700
Bill on me.

87
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,125
No.

88
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,725
If so,

89
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:47,475
I’d rather not start it.

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,500
Then, what to do?

91
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,050
Get ten people in three days.

92
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,925

93
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,500

97
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:39,475

98
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,550
Bro,

99
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,625
what name should we

100
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,150
make for our drama club?

101
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,725
There has to be a direction.

102
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:46,825

in acting,

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,550
there is a method

called empathy.

135
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:06,925

to get the feeling,

137

- Flowers

195
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,850
Fighter!

196
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,775
Fighter! Fighter! Fighter!

197
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:43,750
Alright.

198
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,000
Practice more later.

199
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:45,700
Come on,

200
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,500
next one.

201
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:51,400
(Line clip training)

202
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,325
That’s all

203
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,475
for today.

204
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,275
Wait.

205

206
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:02,775

207
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,200
Anyone is going to it?

208
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,850
Good.

209
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,675
Class is over.

210
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,675
- See you, sir.
- Class is over.

211
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:19,700
Thank you, sir.

212
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,025
See you, teacher.

213
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:23,675
Senior,

214
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,350
(Masquerade)
the performer Li Xiao

215
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,850
(Performers: Li Xiao/Zhang Yang/Liu Mengying)
written on this.

216
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,950
Is it you?

217
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,775
Is there

218
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,325
another Li Xiao in our school?

219
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,325
Are you going tonight?

220
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,500
Yes,

221
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,400
if I get time.

222
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,600
See you tonight.

223
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,375
OK.

224
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,413
Yeah!

225
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,925
He invited me! He invited me!

226
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:47,975
What an anthomaniac!

227
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:49,050
Du Ang!

228
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,575
What?

229
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,975
Qiyi,

230
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,475
you have to go with me tonight.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,225
I need to go to the library.

232
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,425
Look who it is.

233
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Zhang Yang.

234
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,700
Who is it?

235
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,500
Zhang…

236
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:08,425
I’ll go.

237
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:09,375
I’ll go.

238
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,950
Fang Yan,

239
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,000
are you sure

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,250
they are all your members?

241
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,450
Are you sure you can help me?

242
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,275
Don’t judge them by appearance.

243
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,825
Rest assured.

244
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,175
There are many hidden talents

245
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:32,925
in our club.

246
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,600
There is no problem

247
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:36,000
to help you free your nature.

248
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:53,325
Oh my!

249
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,625
Brilliant!

250
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,300
Since you have all showed your skills,

251
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,275
I won’t hide it anymore.

252
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I can travel across dimensions.

253
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,025
- Oh my!
- Let’s go!

254
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,450
My goodness!

255
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,975
He needs artificial respiration!

256
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,750
No artificial respiration!

257
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
So tired.

258
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,400
They do

259
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:42,850
have potentials.

260
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:44,700
But I think

261
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,125
you still need some professionals.

262
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,575
I heard many genius

263
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:53,575
will go to the masquerade tonight.

264
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,100
You can go there to promote.

265
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Maybe you can meet some right people.

266
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,975
Or you can ask someone professional

267
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:01,800
for help.

268
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,450
Right?

269
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,050
So, you’re interested in acupoint?

270
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:23,750
No! No, I’m not!

271
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:25,200
Then why are you watching that?

272
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,075
My uncle is a veteran.

273
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:29,275
Veteran?

274
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,825
I mean veteran traditional physician.

275
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,450
What’s this?

276
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,475
You want to invite me to a masquerade?

277
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:42,375
It’s okay if you have no time.

278
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,200
I may not really have time.

279
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,525
I still have work tonight.

280
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,500
Xiaoyu,

281
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,400
you can have the night off.

282
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,625
So, you can go now?

283
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,575
What do you think?

284
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:02,400
San Shang.

285
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:03,350
Yes?

286
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,125
Where is the girl you invite?

287
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,750
She said her friend
had internal tickets.

288
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,700
She doesn’t need to buy.

289
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,025
What if she doesn’t go?

290
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,650
She promised me.

291
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,725
She will be there.

292
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,700
I, Hao Kaixin,

293
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,375
my first priority is to
get a boyfriend today.

294
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,625
She, Lu Qiyi,

295
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,750
must have her love told to Zhang…

296
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:28,300
Good luck!

297
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:30,525
Guys,

298
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
stop waiting.

299
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,725
The tickets are sold out.

300
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,225
Senior,

301
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,275
don’t lie through your teeth.

302
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,250
You still have two tickets in hand.

303
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:42,275
I told you it’s sold out.

304
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,625
Senior,

305
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,850
better make friends than make enemies.

306
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:47,500
Please sell the tickets to us.

307
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,675
Don’t beg him.

308
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,325
Senior, I want them.

309
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,200
Thank you.

310
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,125

311

My Xiaoyu…

312
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,175
What a pity.

313
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,775
Only two tickets.

314
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,075
The two of you can go.

315
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:13,575
Come on.

316
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,650
You promised to tell your love tonight.

317
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,125
Tell your love?

318
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,550
For whom?

319
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,325
Alright, you two just go tonight.

320
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:22,225
Wish you good luck.

321
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:24,475
I’ll just go to the library to read

322
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:25,250
for empathy

323
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,425
and feelings for the lines.

324
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:31,000
Being single is a special feeling.

325
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,950
Being in love is a waste of time.

326
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
If it’s just for relationships,

327
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:36,075
I won’t go.

328
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,225
The two of you can enjoy it.

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,725
Don’t you need to shoot
for your homework?

330
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,675
It’s okay.

331
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:41,775
Just go.

332
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:42,600
Don’t worry about me.

333
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,425

What?

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,325

00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,650
Ma Xiangyu is here.

387
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,225
Go now.

388
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,175
Come on. Hurry up.

389
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,300
Senior.

390
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,900
Hey.

391
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,375
Senior,

392
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,100
let’s go to the counter.

393
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,075
Have some food first.

394
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:20,950
Come on.

395
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,600
Hi, I’m Ma Xiangyu.

396
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,750
Hi.

397
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:32,025
Kaixin!

398
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,100
Say hi.

399
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:34,450
Hello.

400
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:35,825
Your mask is titled.

401
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,300
What about mine?

402
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,100
Yours is great. It’s tight.

403
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:41,900
Have you seen Qiyi?

404
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,575
Why is she not here?

405
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,350
No.

406
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,225
I don’t know.

407
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,575
Qiyi!

408
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,325
Ladies and gentlemen!

409
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,875
Welcome to

410
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:08,400
our annual masquerade!

411
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,075
Now, let’s start our party!

412
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:21,875
Let’s take seats over there.

413
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:23,250
You can go first.

414
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:25,025
Wait for me.

415
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,825
San Shang.

416
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,575
What took you so long?

417
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,275
Why are you dressing like a waiter?

418
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,500
What’s wrong?

419
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,025
You look petty today.

420
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:12,325
That’s not right.

421
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:13,300
Come on! Hurry up!

422
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:18,271
Who is it?

423
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:26,350
Qiyi?

424
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:31,975
What’s the matter?

425
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,025
No… Nothing.

426
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:42,600
You’re drunk?

427
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,275
Don’t come closer!

428
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,150
What’s wrong?

429
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:47,050
No. No.

430
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:48,000
Nothing.

431
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:51,125
What are you doing here?

432
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:51,925
I… I…

433
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,600
I’m thinking about something here.

434
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:55,625
Don’t worry about me.

435
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,025
Then, take your time.

436
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,025
No rush.

437
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,025
Thank you.

438
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:08,075
When you told me you were coming to

439
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:08,925
Southern University of the Arts,

440
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,075
I thought you were kidding.

441
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,300
I never thought you’d really come.

442
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,000
By the way,

443
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,225
let’s have dinner together later.

444
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,525
We haven’t had

445
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,575
a good talk since school started.

446
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,550
What dinner?

447
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,675
Skip that!

448
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:25,075
Just tell him directly!

449
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,550
Zhang Yang…

450
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,625
I…

451
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,725
Zhang Yang, I…

452
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,900
Are you alright?

453
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:08,525
I…

454
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,375
I’m fine.

455
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,450
Thank you.

456
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,975
What did you want to say?

457
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,625
I…

458
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,475
I…

459
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,050
What are you two doing here?

460
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,525
Where is the restroom?

461
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,475
Let’s go.

462
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,025
So annoying!

463
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:56,525
Look at the boss lady.

464
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:57,900
She should have come later.

465
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,275
It wasn’t the right time!

466
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:01,100
So close!

467
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,850
That was such a good chance.

468
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:06,625
But we missed it again.

469
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:07,500
Qiyi,

470
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,000
you’re too timid.

471
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:13,975
I can’t say that out.

472
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:16,250
Forget it.

473
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,700
I’d better go back.

474
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,475
No!

475
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,325
There won’t be another chance.

476
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,225
Kaixin is right.

477
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,225
Love is like a war.

478
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,125
You need to fight for it yourself.

479
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,625
You’re finally here.

480
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,400
Bai Qiao,

481
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:38,500
you’re so gorgeous!

482
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:41,850
Come on,

483
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:42,975
come with me.

484
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,325
You can’t admit defeat in front of love.

485
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,075
Let’s go for a war.

486
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:49,500
Come on.

487
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:50,550
Let’s go.

488
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,175
Hmm.

489
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,875
Look at Mazda.

490
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,125
He really treats us as the waiters!

491
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:04,225
Alright,

492
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:05,450
let’s

493
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:07,275
add something into his wine.

494
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,325
Hey,

495
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,675
don’t fool around tonight.

496
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,400
I’ll go have a check later.

497
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,700
Everyone else is here.

498
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,950
Don’t let anything go wrong.

499
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,750
Mazda!

500
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,125
Who are you two?

501
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,400
We’re the new waiters of the restaurant.

502
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah. Yes.

503
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,125
Yes, right. Right.

504
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,425
Why have I never met you before?

505
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,150
I told you we were newcomers.

506
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:37,300
What’re you doing?

507
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,275
Why does it take you so long?

508
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,875
They are my classmates.

509
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,200
I asked them to come for help.

510
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,050
Yes. Right.

511
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:04,850
Xinfei.

512
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,300
It’s okay.

513
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:07,775
I’m rushing them to serve the wine.

514
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,550
I need to go out for a second.

515
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,250
What’s wrong?

516
00:27:29,975 --> 00:27:31,300
Enjoy your time.

517
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:32,200
Bye.

518
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,750
You have to

519
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,675
tell him your feelings tonight.

520
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:39,350
Okay.

521
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,125
I’ll go to him later.

522
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:45,050
Hundreds and thousands of times
I searched for her in the crowd.

523
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,725
Suddenly I turned,

524
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:50,850
and there she stood, in the dim light.

525
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:52,900
Now here comes the chance.

526
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:56,175
We will turn off all the lights
for ten seconds.

527
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,800
As long as you have the courage

528
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:01,125
to hold the hand of the person you love,

529
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:04,550
then you can get

530
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,600
a warm hug.

531
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,375
Are you ready?

532
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,275
Lights off!

533
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,500
- Ten.
- Senior.

534
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:13,675
I…

535
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:14,375
Nine.

536
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,375
I’m going to the toilet.

537
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,725
Eight.

538
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:18,650
Seven.

539
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,550
Six.

540
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,200
Five.

541
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,825
Four.

542
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:27,325
Three.

543
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:29,200
Two.

544
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:32,700
One.

545
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,475
Lights on!

546
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:23,550
Where did you go?

547
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,725
I was tortured so much!

548
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,950
They are all here.

549
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:30,725
Let’s get started.

550
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:43,525
What’s going on?

551
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
Why does the music stop?

552
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,219
No music?

553
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,825
You got them here?

554
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,475
Not me!

555
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,775
Hey!

556
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,475
No, that’s...

557
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,475
(Masquerade)

558
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:50,925
Hello, everyone.

559
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,450
Sorry for taking your time

560
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,700
in such a way.

561
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,633
I’m Fang Yan, president of the
Little Target Drama Club.

562
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:56,275
Senior, this…

563
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,375
Our club is dedicated to
providing opportunities

564
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,275
for people who love performing.

565
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,675
I believe all of you here have had to

566
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:03,575
make yourselves ordinary, even numb,

567
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:04,500
in order to fit into society.

568
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,475
But you must be keeping your

569
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:07,525
original dreams in hearts!

570
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,525
If so,

571
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,200
join us!

572
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,525
Hey, you!

573
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:16,380
(Little Target)

574
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,070
(Masquerade)

575
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,700
(Masquerade)

576
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,352
(Mr. Sun)

577
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:44,575
(Inform the class that we’ll meet at
5:00 AM tomorrow for exercise.)

578
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,975
(Guys, morning exercise

Sorry. Sorry.

I’ve been begging Buddha for 500 years!

595
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:38,700
I beg Buddha for
a relationship between us.
