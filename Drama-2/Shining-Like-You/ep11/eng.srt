Qiyi.

25
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:43,975
Thanks.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
Who is that?

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,050
Even with bodyguards!

28
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:52,000
Who is it?

29
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:53,100
Who is with bodyguards?

30
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:07,525
How are you thinking about it?

31
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:10,625
It is

32
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:12,475
not the right time now.

33
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,625
There is no one better than you.

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,225
You’re not me.

35
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,075
You can’t feel what I feel.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,575
I can.

37
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:26,625
I know you.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,650
Let’s talk about something else.

39
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:44,800
Then

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,950
what do you want to talk about?

41
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:51,500
Let’s talk about

42
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,625
the students I’m teaching now.

43
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,800
Now

44
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,025
the thing I want to do most

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,225
is to teach these students well.

46
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,750
A beautiful and elegant woman.

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,975
A gloomy and mellow man.

48
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,300
There must be a story.

49
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:15,975
Hey!

50
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:19,050
Can you stop gossiping?

51
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,250
Are you here to celebrate my birthday

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,150
or for the gossip?

53
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,250
The food is getting cold.

54
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,250
Let’s stop watching.

55
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,075
He is getting mad.

56
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Let’s go back.

57
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,325
Come on.

58
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait!

59
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:34,575
Xun!

60
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,675
Who is that guy?

61
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,125
It looks like Mr. Sun!

62
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,325
Mr. Sun?

63
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,225
It is not like him. It’s him.

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,350
Xun, paparazzi.

65
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,450
I gotta go now.

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,550
Bill is on you.

67
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,425
Tell them to wait for a while.

68
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,825
Does it hurt?

69
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,325
Yes.

70
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:31,825
Then

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,150
that means this is true.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,475
I didn’t expect

73
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,450
that Mr. Sun knows Xun.

74
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,700
I think

75
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:43,425
their relationship is more than
just knowing each other.

76
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:45,325
Now my birthday

77
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,725
is ruined.

78
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:53,175
(Li Xun’s Studio Li Xun)

79
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,300
Hmm.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
Sir,

81
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:10,775
check out.

82
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,625
Tang,

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,425
it’s been a long time.

84
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,850
When do you plan to tell him?

85
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,525
See you.

86
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,175
See you.

87
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:45,125
Time to eat!

88
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,300
We went to a restaurant today.

89
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,550
It’s really interesting.

90
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,325
And I get a dish back for you,

91
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:55,750
called “Nothing New Under the Sun”.

92
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,925
Do you know

93
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,300
what it is made of?

94
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:06,625
Shredded pork with fish spice
and drumstick!

95
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,775
Sanshang, have some food.

96
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:18,175
Sanshang.

97
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:19,725
Time to eat.

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,050
Sanshang!

99
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,375
Sit.

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,025
Sit down.

101
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:40,975
While you’re eating,

102
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,500
I will tell you

103
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:46,000
a super shocking secret.

104
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:49,625
Take it.

105
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:54,825
Guess who I saw in the restaurant today.

106
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,850
Mr. Sun!

107
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
Guess whom he was with.

108
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,775
Li Xun!

109
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,800
And

110
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,575
it’s probably the two of them

111
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,250
were together once before.

112
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,000
Isn’t it surprising?

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,175
Here.

114
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:28,750
Have the food.

115
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,850
Eat.

116
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,725
I’m familiar

117
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,150
with all the bosses here.

118
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,750
I know all the chefs, waiters

119
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,625
and cashiers.

120
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,975
But what’s the point of it?

121
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,775
I can’t cook.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,300
I can’t open a restaurant.

123
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,300
I can’t go to a foreign country

124
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,550
to open a big Li Hongzhang Chop Suey.

125
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,175
I only know to eat.

126
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,175
I can only eat.

127
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,675
I fail in everything I do.

128
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,000
I made deficit as an official.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
I lost money in business.

130
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,850
What is the use of studying for me?

131
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,975
What good is it?

132
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,225
What’s the point?

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,675
Mr. Sun,

134
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,425
can I go get some fresh air?

135
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,750
Sure.

136
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,375
Sanshang, where are you going?

137
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,900
Next one.

138
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,175
I have no tears.

139
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,675
Universe.

140
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,975
Universe has no tears either.

141
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,550
Tears are of no use.

142
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,375
We have only storms,

143
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,525
only thunder, only lightning.

144
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,700
We have no dragging rain.

145
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,200
This is my will.

146
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,750
The will of the universe!

147
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,775
Stir up, the wind!

148
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:47,300
Roar, the thunder!

149
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,925
Blaze, the lightning!

150
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,700
Destroy all that sleep

151
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,050
in the darkness!

152
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,125
Destroy!

153
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:56,900
Destroy!

154
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:07,450
59.

155
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,150
Any question?

156
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,000
Fang Yan,

157
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:23,800
Mr. Su Wen’s review

158
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,125
of you at the musical festival
was very pertinent.

159
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,100
Think about

160
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,700
what the problem is.

161
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:32,225
That’s all for today.

162
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,575
Bro,

163
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,275
music bar?

164
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,900
I have something to do at home.

165
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,600
Excuse me.

166
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,975
Bro…

167
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,550
Bai…

168
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,400
Kaixin. Kaixin.

169
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:55,050
Come on,

170
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,325
let’s go to the music bar.

171
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:57,625
I’ll go to find Sanshang.

172
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,700
I’m worried about him.

173
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,275
Qiyi,

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,850
they’re not going.

175
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:03,675
Let’s go.

176
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,775
I’ll go to see Sanshang, too.

177
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
How about we go together?

178
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,850
Let’s go.

179
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,425
We’ll go now.

180
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,975
Wu Rida,

181
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,125
have some food in the music bar?

182
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,800
What roast whole lamb?

183
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:22,775
Xiuwen,

184
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,500
- Yes?
- come on.

185
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,650
Let’s go to the music bar.

186
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,500
Can you treat me to a muffin?

187
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,400
No problem.

188
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,625
I can buy you a box of it.

189
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:36,775
Come on.

190
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,125
Let’s go to see Sanshang.

191
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,150
Come on.

192
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Hurry up.

193
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:41,500
What?

194
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,275
Sanshang keeps dancing like this

195
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,275
without eating anything.

196
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:54,975
Sanshang!

197
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,200
Sanshang!

198
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,200
Stop for a while, okay?

199
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,325
Sanshang!

200
00:11:58,825 --> 00:11:59,700
Sanshang!

201
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,500
Sanshang!

202
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,100
Stop!

203
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,775
Stop moving!

204
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,075
Sanshang!

205
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,025
Sanshang!

206
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,600
Sanshang, just tell us

207
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,650
if you feel bad.

208
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,450
Don’t torture yourself.

209
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:16,450
Alright.

210
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:19,000
Why do you still have

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,800
so much strength after a day of dancing?

212
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,350
They are coming.

213
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
How is he now?

214
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,175
Du Ang is with him.

215
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,375
What about his other roommates?

216
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,850
Fang Yan went back home.

217
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,400
Zhang Yang is not here.

218
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:45,575
Qiyi.

219
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:46,150
Yes?

220
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,100
(Li Xun’s Studio Li Xun)
Du Ang asked me to give this to you.

221
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,300
Xun’s name card.

222
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,775
What does this mean?

223
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,375
I’m really fine.

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,325
Don’t look at me.

225
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:28,775
Zhang Yang is not back yet?

226
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,300
He often does not come back.

227
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,050
You can go back now.

228
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:39,300
Xiuwen,

229
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,350
go buy some food and drinks.

230
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,425
Let’s eat and have a talk here.

231
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,625
OK. I’m going.

232
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,525
Don’t bother.

233
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
I’m not hungry.

234
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,900
You may go back now.

235
00:13:58,575 --> 00:13:59,850
Why is Bo not here?

236
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:04,950
I took it off.

237
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,225
It’s of no point.

238
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,700
I’m going to take a pee.

239
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:19,950
I’ll go with you.

240
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,800
So do I.

241
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,425
It can’t keep going like this.

242
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,050
Sanshang is having a
psychological problem.

243
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,250
Use this.

244
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,525
Wait,

245
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,200
Du Ang wants us

246
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,025
to get Huang Bo here?

247
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,000
I remember Sanshang often said

248
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,975
that he only adored two people
in his life.

249
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,175
One is his father

250
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:24,675
and the other is Huang Bo.

251
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,450
Now his father is gone.

252
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,750
I think now only Huang Bo can save him.

253
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:30,575
But,

254
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,900
where can we find Huang Bo?

255
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,324
Xun seems to have just finished working

256
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:41,575
with Bo on a TV series.

257
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,950
Then, which one of us should
give Xun a call?

258
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,375
Alright.

259
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,100
Mom.

260
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,850
You’re back.

261
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:04,200
You’re making dinner?

262
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Yeah.

263
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,650
- How is it?
- Smells so good.

264
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,250
Have some rest.

265
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,750
The noodles will be ready soon.

266
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,025
This…

267
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,175
Mom.

268
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,975
Yes?

269
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:19,625
Why did you buy so many things?

270
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,400
Your dad sent these here.

271
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:27,625
Come here.

272
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:29,875
Have a taste.

273
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,650
What’s wrong?

274
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,525
Have a try.

275
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,100
Return them.

276
00:16:44,975 --> 00:16:46,725
I didn’t want to accept.

277
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:48,225
But the deliveryman said

278
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:49,275
they can’t be returned.

279
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,650
And I don’t want to make it
difficult to others.

280
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,025
I said return it.

281
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:53,873
This…

282
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:55,800
Alright.

283
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,225
I will make the call tomorrow.

284
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,050
Have the noodles first.

285
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,250
Come on.

286
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,425
I will make the call later.

287
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:05,225
OK?

288
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:06,950
Try the noodles.

289
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,325
Sorry, Mom.

290
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,125
Good boy.

291
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:17,275
OK.

292
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:18,850
Thank you, Xun! Thanks.

293
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,275
Bye.

294
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:25,175
How is it going?

295
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,050
She said yes.

296
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,250
But it’s hard for a meeting.

297
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,650
She will find a way out for us.

298
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:34,725
OK.

299
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,774
(Recent Calls)

300
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:26,625
(Mom Yan Shang Mr. Sun)

301
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,300
(Mom Calling…)

302
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:36,150
(Mom Call ended)

303
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:43,575
Du Ang,

304
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,225
happy birthday.

305
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,075
Mom.

306
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,700
Yes?

307
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,200
I’m leaving.

308
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,925
OK.

309
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,625
Wait!

310
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,625
Take some fruit with you.

311
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,400
Take more.

312
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,925
- OK.
- Go now.

313
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:19,900
Bye, Mom.

314
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,575
OK.

315
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:21,725
Be careful.

316
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:22,325
Bye.

317
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,500
Bye.

318
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,100
You come just in time.

319
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:47,750
Take all your things away.

320
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:49,500
Yan,

321
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,150
don’t talk to your dad like this.

322
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,025
My dad?

323
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,400
He is not qualified to be my dad.

324
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,125
Fang Yan!

325
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:00,400
It’s okay.

326
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,525
He is still angry with me.

327
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,825
How dare I be angry with you?

328
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,100
You’re the best actor, Su Wen.

329
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,000
Fang Yan!

330
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,625
I know why you’re still angry.

331
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,450
Do you think I was wrong about
what I said about you

332
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:18,900
the other day?

333
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,050
How can you be wrong?

334
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:21,750
You can never be wrong.

335
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,250
Not convinced, right?

336
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,450
OK.

337
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,250
I’ll tell you the truth today.

338
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:32,600
About your performance that day,

339
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,800
any acting teacher

340
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,900
of a certain level

341
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,950
can tell the problem.

342
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,150
Prove yourself to me

343
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,000
if you can’t accept it.

344
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,225
But I still think

345
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,725
with the method you use now,

346
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:51,900
you will never be able to

347
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,825
achieve anything in terms of acting.

348
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,775
Do you know that?

349
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,475
Actually,

350
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:09,350
I didn’t agree with you

351
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,025
when you chose this major.

352
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,325
The road of acting is difficult.

353
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,700
But since you have chosen it,

354
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,675
you should do your best.

355
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:25,225
At least

356
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,350
you have to do it like my son.

357
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,525
I don’t dare to have anything
to do with your fame.

358
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,950
Alright, enough.

359
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,625
Stop arguing.

360
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,100
I know that

361
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,850
you’re afraid of being ashamed when

362
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,575
people know

363
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,475
I’m your son.

364
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,725
Su Wen, listen carefully.

365
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:44,775
From now on, whatever kind of life
I choose and

366
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:45,775
however I live will

367
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:47,475
have nothing to do with you!

368
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,325
From the moment

369
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:50,475
you chose to abandon me and my mom,

370
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,425
our relations have been cut off!

371
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,675
Take away all the things you sent here!

372
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,825
We don’t need that!

373
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:04,425
Fang Yan!

374
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,650
Fang Yan!

375
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:29,325
Those

376
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,450
are some costumes I bought

377
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:34,575
for him when I was shooting in Paris.

378
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,900
You’d better take them back.

379
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,375
He won’t

380
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,750
wear them.

381
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Qiyi,

382
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,000
did you get Sanshang’s matter done?

383
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,925
Yes.

384
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,325
By the way,

385
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,825
have you seen Fang Yan?

386
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,500
I can’t find him.

387
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:52,750
Look at him.

388
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:54,200
He doesn’t even come back
from home to take the exam.

389
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:55,700
I’ll ask him for you.

390
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:04,350
(Fang Yan: I’m at the beach. Come here.
Don’t tell anyone.)

391
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,950
Excuse me. I have to go out.

392
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,025
Hey.

393
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:08,075
Take it easy.

394
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:09,200
I’m asking for you.

395
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,275
Hello, Zhang Yang.

396
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:17,400
Qiyi.

397
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,325
I’m at the music bar.

398
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,425
Can you come over?

399
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,850
I…

400
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:27,975
You’re busy now?

401
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:28,525
I…

402
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:30,225
Here is it.

403
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:32,275
I have something
really important to tell you.

404
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:34,150
Why don’t we meet up and talk?

405
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:35,800
I’ll wait for you.

406
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,425
Zhang Yang.

407
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:56,775
That’s it.

408
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,225
If you like it, go after it.

409
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,425
That’s the right thing to do.

410
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,375
If she knows you prepared all these,

411
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,950
she will be so moved.

412
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,600
Boss,

413
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,700
that’s the best wine in your restaurant!

414
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,025
Go for it.

415
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,150
Thank you.

416
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:33,750
Fang Yan,

417
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,325
why don’t you go to rehearsal…

418
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,925
I just want a hug.

419
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,150
What happened?

420
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,775

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,350
I’m a little hungry.

438
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,350
Hey!

439
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,275
If you keep standing here,

440
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,725
there will be no food in the canteen.

441
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:22,925
Then, wait for me!

442
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:26,825
Wait!

443
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,825
Come on!

444
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:33,650
Wait!

445
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,475
How about

446
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:42,575
you give her another call?

447
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,950
Try again.

448
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:29,125
Forget it.

449
00:28:33,975 --> 00:28:35,250
I don’t think she will come.

450
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:37,175
No way.

451
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:38,850
Let’s wait for a little longer.

452
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,125
If she doesn’t come,

453
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:43,650
you go find her.

454
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,285
(“New Oriental Cup” Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau
Student Debate Competition)

455
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:38,200
Fang Yan,

456
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,775
why don’t you go to rehearsal…

457
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,025
(Zhang Yang Missed calls (7))

458
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:11,050
(Qiyi: I was busy just now,)

459
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,375
(so I didn’t make it there.
What’s the matter?)

460
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,000
(Zhang Yang: Nothing.)

461
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:50,100
Qiyi,

462
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:51,625
where did you go just now?

463
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,425
I…

464
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,975
I went to the library.

465
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:56,775
That’s right.

466
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,125
There is an exam this afternoon.

467
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,200
They say

468
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,075
you got good scores
in the first three exams.

469
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:09,400
Your total score seems to rank
second in our class.

470
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,825
Who is the top one?

471
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,175
Bai Qiao, of course.

472
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:14,750
You’re not sleeping?

473
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,375
I wanted to.

474
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,825
But someone keeps sighing.

475
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:26,350
So I failed to fall asleep.

476
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:28,750
That’s because I’m worried
about Sanshang.

477
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,350
Qiyi,

478
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,675
will Sanshang jump off the building?

479
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:34,725
No.

480
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,900
Fang Yan is watching him.

481
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,400
Fang Yan is back?

482
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,150
Yes.

483
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:41,825
What can I do?

484
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,200
I’m still worried.

485
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,575
When a woman

486
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,675
keeps worrying about a man,

487
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,675
that means that woman has

488
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:56,000
totally fallen in love with the man.

489
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,525
Who said that?

490
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:00,900
Sanshang and I…

491
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,550
We are like brothers.

492
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,450
Brothers.

493
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,350
Qiyi,

494
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:09,525
say something for me.

495
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:10,125
Am I right?

496
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:12,400
Yeah.

497
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:13,225
Brothers.

498
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,500
What’s on your mind?

499
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:19,725
Nothing.

500
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,775
Let me tell you.

501
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:24,850
Do your best this afternoon.

502
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,825
Don’t make me embarrassed.

503
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:27,850
Don’t worry.

504
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,700
Wait a second.

505
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:32,950
It’s Xun.

506
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,625
Answer it!

507
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,550
Hello, Xun.

508
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,300
Really?

509
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,325
That’s great!

510
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:44,025
OK. OK. Sure.

511
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,575
Thank you, Xun!

512
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:47,950
See you.

513
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,425
What’s going on?

514
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,550
Xun said she is now at the launch.

515
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,075
Huang Bo happened to be there.

516
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:55,825
And he agreed to make a recording.

517
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:57,475
Great! Let’s go.

518
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,750
But…

519
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,550
Oh!

520
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,150
We still have an exam this afternoon.

521
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:05,550
I’ll go on myself.

522
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,000
But your leg.

523
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,950
Huang Bo’s recording

524
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,325
is more important than anything.

525
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:12,100
Yes.

526
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,575
Kaixin.

527
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,350
What?

528
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:20,450
I’ll go.

529
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,200
Ah?

530
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,025
You need to rest.

531
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,650
I can go. Don’t worry.

532
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:27,850
Oh.

533
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,950
Be careful on your way back.

534
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:32,750
Be careful.

535
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,975
(Fang Yan: Even you are absent
from the exam?)

536
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,500
(Qiyi: There is always a first time
for everything.)

537
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:58,252
(Fang Yan: Aren’t you afraid of
disappointing your parents?)

538
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,425
(Qiyi: Now I have something
more important to do.)

539
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:12,375
Many people’s first love is painful

540
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,175
and ends without a word.

541
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,750
When you get rid of someone who

542
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,275
doesn’t belong to you in your heart,

543
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,750
a new one will

544
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,200
come in without you realizing it.

545
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:37,150
Big black bugs bleed blue black blood

546
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,275
but baby black bugs…

547
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,975
The exam begins now.

548
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,150
Where is Lu Qiyi?

549
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Even the Scholar is absent from exam?

550
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,225
Anyone knows where Lu Qiyi is?

551
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,050
Sir,

552
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:09,675
Qiyi doesn’t feel good

553
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:10,550
and went to the hospital.

554
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,075
Yeah. She went to the hospital.

555
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:16,850
The exam begins.

556
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:29,900
I’m here.

557
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Where are you guys?

558
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:34,925
Tree?

559
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,225
I see it.

560
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,575
I see it.

561
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,550
What are you doing?

562
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:10,475
Hi, Sanshang.

563
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,025
I’m Huang Bo.

564
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,575
I didn’t expect to
talk with you in this way.

565
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,275
I was very touched after

566
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,775
I heard your story.

567
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,475
You are unfortunate

568
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,625
because you lost the person
you love most;

569
00:36:27,575 --> 00:36:29,150
you are also lucky because

570
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:32,225
there are so many people
who care about you.

571
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,500
They have done so much

572
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:38,075
to find me to record

573
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,550
this message in order to help you.

574
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,950
Maybe my words can’t heal your pain,

575
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,325
but I see

576
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:51,000
the love and dedication
your friends have for you.

577
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,850
There is much unfairness in life.

578
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,525
Whether we were born unfair

579
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,550
or experienced unfairness,

580
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,500
that all make us struggle.

581
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:06,975
But when we take a moment
to think about it,

582
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,700
and look back,

583
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:12,750
life also gives us many gifts,

584
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:15,475
such as dreams,

585
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,325
and friends.

586
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,075
Go! Sanshang!

587
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,150
No need to say thank you.

we have to celebrate your birthday.

594

- Happy birthday.

595

Happy birthday.

596
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:46,075
Why… Why are you doing this?

597
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,625
You have to make me cry, don’t you?

598
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,500
Sanshang.

599
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,975
Did you already know it before?

600
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,700
You collude with them to deceive me?

601
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,825
When did you become so bad?

602
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:54,650
You bad boy.

603
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,475
Look at you!

604
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:56,200
Du,

605
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:57,700
the candles are lit.

606
00:38:57,975 --> 00:38:58,750
Make a wish.

607
00:38:58,975 --> 00:38:59,725
Go. Go.

608
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,150
I hope Sanshang can be back

609
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:13,475
to how he was before.

610
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:15,575
That cute Sanshang.

611
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,675
The second wish is

612
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,575
I hope

613
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,700
our friendship

614
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:28,325
will never change.

615
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:28,975
Sure.

616
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:29,875
OK.

617
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,150
The third wish is…

618
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,125
I don’t think it’s a wish.

619
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,475
It’s a phrase.

620
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,900
Lu Qiyi,

621
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,700

624
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:39,150
I am, totally.
