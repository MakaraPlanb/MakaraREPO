don’t leave me!

Mr. Sun!

28
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:53,425
How will I continue my exam
if you pass away?

29
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,275
What if I can’t pass it?

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,500
Mr. Sun!

31
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:03,175
It’s hard for me

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,900
to come here.

33
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,100
Please don’t go!

- Please!
- Enough!

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,475
Stop! Enough!

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,600
Sanshang,

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,225
let me ask you.

38
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,525
What’s your performance just now?

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,975
Keening.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,850
OK, I see. I got it.

41
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,125
Sir,

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,300
if that was not good enough,

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,150
I can do something else.

44
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,150
Hold on a second.

45
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,800
I want to ask you

46
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:37,825
why you chose to perform keening.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,150
In rural areas,

48
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:42,075
keening is one of the most
common performances.

49
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,435
The person who died has nothing to do

50
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,400
with the keener.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
But when the keener cries,

52
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,775
it feels like one of his relatives died.

53
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,525
A great man once said that

54
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,450
art is inspired by life but beyond it.

55
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:00,850
I think this kind of folk performance is

56
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,050
exactly inspired by life but beyond it.

57
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,275
Why are you still here?

58
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,475
I’ll stay for a while.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,850
What’s wrong?

60
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,550
You look upset.

61
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,925
A new problem arises.

62
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,975
What is it?

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,750
Li Sanshang.

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,250
And?

65
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:43,025
He wants to quit school.

66
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,475
What?

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,175
(Application Form for Admission Exam

68
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,900
Ms. Tang,

69
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,650
I think this kid did well.

70
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,300
The keener?

71
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,925
Yes.

72
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,425
I think

73
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:04,350
his line performance and physical
appearance are average.

74
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,725
And he has an accent.

75
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,075
Yeah.

76
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,750
That’s his weakness.

77
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,400
But I saw a really precious quality

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,950
in his eyes.

79
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,650
And he

80
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,575
does live up to my expectation.

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,700
I heard he became the first one

82
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,250
from his village to enter
an art college.

83
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,625
Yeah.

84
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,650
A rural child

85
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:34,500
with so much passion for acting

86
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,325
and the courage to pursue.

87
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:37,725
What does this prove?

88
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:39,450
It proves that he has

89
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,400
the potential
of being an excellent actor.

90
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,325
What do you plan to do now?

91
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,275
He is my student.

92
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:51,550
Without my permission,

93
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,725
he can never

94
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,775
quit school.

95
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:57,350
Sir.

96
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,800
What again?

97
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,275
If you can give me a chance,

98
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:06,025
I will return a miracle to you!

99
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,000
He still owes me a miracle.

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,850

hundred years of sorrow in the rain.)

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,650
Sanshang.

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,325
Your classmates are here.

106
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,125
Go greet them.

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,050

110

111
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,050
Are you okay?

112
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,750
We’re all worried about you.

113
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:42,900
Look at you.

114
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,375
You just left without telling us.

115
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,050
I’m fine.

116
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,000
Why are you all here?

117
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,350
We’re worried.

118
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:56,500
I’m fine.

119
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:58,375
It’s busy in my family.

120
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,950
I’m afraid I can’t entertain you now.

121
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,775
You can find a place to wait.

122
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,700
I’ll meet you when I’m done.

123
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:06,725
Sanshang,

124
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,850
just tell us

125
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,375
if you need help.

126
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,000
We can all help you.

127
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,250
Yeah.

128
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,600
Just tell us if you need anything.

129
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,550
No, thanks.

130
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:19,975
The funeral is all prepared.

131
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,300
And my uncle is here, too.

132
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,850
You can just have a rest.

133
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,350
I’ll be there with you later.

134
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:29,575
Hey…

135
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,200
Don’t you think Sanshang is strange?

136
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,425
He is not as sad as I imagined.

137
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,825
Relatives’ worship.

138
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,850
My dear brother!

139
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,675
Why did you leave like this?

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,825
Why left me, your poor brother,

141
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:03,025
to see you die before me?

142
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,950
Dad!

143
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,750
Dad!

144
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,950
(Half a lifetime of hard work and
frugality left him a good name.)

145
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,175
(Funeral)

146
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,825
You are

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,450
my brother’s classmates, right?

148
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,375
I’m not good at studying.

149
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,275
I don’t have a promising future
like my brother does.

150
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,775
He is the only one in our village

151
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:26,000
who got into a prestigious university.

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I will be able to see him
on TV in the future.

153
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:33,350
Don’t say that.

154
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,325
Studying acting doesn’t mean you…

155
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,075
You’ll also have a promising future.

156
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:40,625
You’ll be as excellent as your brother.

157
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,700
It’s all like this in our village.

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,100
Only one of the two children
of the family

159
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,775
can go out.

160
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:50,750
The other must stay at home.

161
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,450
My brother went out.

162
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,250
So, I have to stay here at home.

163
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,300
Have you seen Sanshang?

164
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,150
No.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What a brat!

166
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
He disappeared after the funeral.

167
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,250
He has been

168
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,775
suppressing his emotions.

169
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,975
I hope nothing bad would happen.

170
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,725
I saw

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,250
my brother head for the river bank.

172
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:22,575
Go!

173
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,350
- Sanshang!
- Sanshang!

174
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:28,450
- Sanshang!
- Sanshang!

175
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,300
Sanshang had a very good score

176
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,100
in the college entrance exams.

177
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,550
But he insisted on majoring in acting.

178
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,900
He even went to take the admission
exam himself

179
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,475
and passed it.

180
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,425
No one in this family agreed to it

181
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:40,725
except his father.

182
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,375
Sanshang!

183
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,550
I don’t understand.

184
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,625
Please tell me

185
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,325
what acting is.

186
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:53,650
Uncle,

187
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,475
are you alright?

188
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Sanshang

189
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,625
is different from you guys.

190
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,425
He is not as pretty as you guys.

191
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,300
Maybe because our family

192
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,200
has been engaged in this industry

193
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:11,225
and we can be counted as folk artists.

194
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,025
But the folk artists

195
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:19,000
are different from stars.

196
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,150
Let’s go and find him.

197
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,450
- Sanshang!
- Sanshang!

198
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,300
Sanshang!

199
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Sanshang!

200
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,775
Sanshang!

201
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,575
Sanshang!

202
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,475
Sanshang!

203
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,850
Sanshang!

204
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,650
Sanshang!

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,350
Look! It’s my brother.

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,575
Sanshang!

207
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,904
Xiaoshang,

208
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,375
let them go.

209
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:00,600
Sanshang!

210
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,400
Why are you all here?

211
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,600
Do you know

212
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,425
you scared all of us?

213
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,000
I’m fine.

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,675
You’re fine?

215
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,700
Then why did you come here?

216
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,875
I’m here to find the fireflies.

217
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,600
Fireflies?

218
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,125
My dad said

219
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:27,325
when people die,

220
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,650
they turn into fireflies.

221
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,950
The brightest one

222
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:36,125
is the one closest to you.

223
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,900
I think now

224
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,450
he should have become a firefly.

225
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:45,450
When I was a kid,

226
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,000
he used to bring me here
to see fireflies

227
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:52,625
and teach me to play the suona.

228
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,800
There used to be many fireflies here.

229
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:04,400
Why

230
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,000
are there none now?

231
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,650
It’s OK.

232
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,775
You may go now.

233
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:14,950
Sanshang, it’s OK.

234
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:16,825
If not here,

235
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,200
let’s go elsewhere to find.

236
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:22,525
Sanshang,

237
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,025
just cry if you want.

238
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,900
Hello?

239
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,150
Hello.

240
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,600
Dad.

241
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,750
Dad.

242
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:16,025
I’ll listen to you.

243
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,750
If you don’t want me to learn acting,

244
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,975
I’ll listen to you.

245
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,475
What’s wrong?

246
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,050
Who is it?

247
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,050
Qiyi?

248
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,700
Let me talk to her.

249
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:46,875
Qiyi.

250
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,925
What’s wrong?

251
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,750
Mom.

252
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,950
Don’t cry.

253
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,400
Your dad is no longer angry.

254
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,050
He agreed that you should stay at

255
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,800
SUA to study for the time being.

256
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
Just study hard.

257
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,625
Don’t think too much.

258
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,050
Don’t cry.

259
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,475
I gotta go now.

260
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,450
Have a good sleep.

261
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,550
Here is the

262
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:30,875
arrangement tonight.

263
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:33,675
Kaixin,

264
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,100
you sleep here.

265
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:37,350
Qiyi,

266
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,325
you here.

267
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,975
This happens to be a vent.

268
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,100
I’ll sleep here.

269
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:52,325
Fang Yan,

270
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:53,700
you there.

271
00:15:58,475 --> 00:15:59,925
Girls on the left side

272
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,350
and boys on the right side.

273
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,650
It’s reasonable.

274
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,375
Is everyone okay with this?

275
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,600
If so,

276
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,500
it’s late now.

277
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,875
I’ll go to bed.

278
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,300
I’m not.

279
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,700
You’re always not okay with everything.

280
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:15,875
You change with Fang Yan.

281
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,325
Why?

282
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,950
You’re not a gentleman.

283
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,000
It’s dangerous for Qiyi
to sleep next to you.

284
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,500
You’re not a gentlewoman.

285
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,525
Then why don’t you sleep next to me?

286
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,025
What did you say?

287
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,975
You want to quit school?

288
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,400
I have decided.

289
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,450
Actually, I know

290
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,525
how my grades are

291
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:41,075
after the whole semester.

292
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,725
I know it clearly.

293
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,050
I’ll quit.

294
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:47,900
I’m not qualified.

295
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,400
It’s a waste of time.

296
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,975
I’ll stay.

297
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,550
Then Xiaoshang can go to school.

298
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,675
Sanshang,

299
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,025
don’t worry about us.

300
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:55,875
If it’s because of money…

301
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,400
Mom,

302
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,850
don’t say anything.

303
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,275
I’ve decided.

304
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,050
It’s late.

305
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,625
You should go back to sleep.

306
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,025
Sanshang.

307
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,075
Auntie.

308
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Uncle.

309
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,350
I want to use the toilet.

310
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,950
But I’m a little scared.

311
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,350
Sanshang,

312
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,250
go with her.

313
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:28,475
Go.

314
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:29,575
Come on.

315
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,600
What to do now?

316
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,075
Sanshang.

317
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,800
What?

318
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,050
It’s too dark in here.

319
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:54,325
Can you sing a song for me?

320
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:57,875
Sanshang.

321
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,150
Sanshang.

322
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,475
Just sing a song.

323
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,375

What are you doing?

349
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,475
I know

350
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,425
you don’t want to quit.

351
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:09,950
It’s because you have
difficulties at home.

352
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:11,825
It’s OK.

353

If you have financial difficulties,

354
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:15,000
we can help you to solve it,

355

as long as you do not give up.

356
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,675
Get down here.

357
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,750
I won’t.

358
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,025
Don’t interrupt me, okay?

359
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,600
Even if you quit school,

360
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,600
nothing can be solved.

361
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,325
I’m your friend.

362
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,025
Go back to school with me.

363
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,500
Sanshang!

364
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:38,675
If you say no,

365
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:41,200
I will jump down here.

366
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,850
Li Sanshang!

367
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,475
If you don’t go back with me,

368
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,800
I’ll jump down from here.

369
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:58,600
You got Kung Fu.

370
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,050
You’ll be fine.

371
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,250
Kaixin!

372
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:15,475
How could you really jump down?

373
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,125
Where did you get hurt?

374
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,500
Be gentle!

375
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,250
Does it hurt?

376
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes.

377
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,775
Can you walk?

378
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,975
No.

379
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:34,650
I don’t care.

380
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:36,500
I’ve jumped.

381
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,200
You have to go back to school with me.

382
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,650
Let me carry you.

383
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,675
If you carry me,

384
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,875
that means you promise
to go back to school with me.

385
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,225
Sanshang!

386
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:04,100
Look!

387
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,300
There is a firefly!

388
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,300
I think

389
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:19,025
your father

390
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:22,200
would not want to see you like this.

391
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,625
Here are

392
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,800
the school’s rules and regulations.

393
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,075
(Safety Plan)

394
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:54,275
Actually,

395
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:55,975
they are just rules.

396
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,275
Rules are fixed.

397
00:22:58,425 --> 00:22:59,900
But people can change it.

398
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,575
Thanks.

399
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:03,650
Hey!

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,025
Wait. Sit down.

401
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,900
Listen to me.

402
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,625
If it’s the financial difficulty,

403
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:11,500
we can solve the financial problem.

404
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,850
If it’s the emotional difficulty,

405
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,950
we can solve the emotional problem.

406
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,600
You’ve experienced this before.

407
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,375
You have to say

408
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,500
what you want to say.

409
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,600
How about

410
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:27,775
sending a message?

411
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,250
Or you can just make a call.

412
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:35,150
Alright.

413
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,475
I gotta go now.

414
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,175
We’re all waiting for you to come back.

415
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:33,950
Bro.

416
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,075
Come back soon.

417
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:51,700
Take good care of yourself,

418
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,075
Sanshang.

419
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,950
If you want to quit,

420
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,025
none of us will agree to it.

421
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,800
For the sake of my leg,

422
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:12,925
you should come back.

423
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,325
We’re leaving now.

424
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:25,500
See you, Xiaoshang.

425
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:35,850
Sanshang,

426
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:40,100
let’s have a family meeting.

427
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:57,100
(Focus on the object you should focus on
and be right to all fictitious stages…)

428
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,275
([626] Buddies Never Break Up!)

429
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:33,439
(School of Performing Arts
Name: Li Sanshang)

430
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,825
Done?

431
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:01,875
Fang Yan,

432
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:05,025
the topic I gave you is

433
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:07,650
that your girlfriend of seven years

434
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,675
just cheated on you.

435
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,000
Do you think you acted correctly?

436
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:21,675
Lu Qiyi,

437
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,700
comment on Fang Yan’s performance.

438
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,875
I think Fang Yan’s performance

439
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
was quite layered.

440
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:36,075
At first it was rather depressing,

441
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,950
but later he used bottles and chairs

442
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,750
as a fulcrum for emotional venting.

443
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,725
Did you feel his anger?

444
00:27:45,975 --> 00:27:46,675
I…

445
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,925
Just a little.

446
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:52,050
Were you scared?

447
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Not really.

448
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,025
OK.

449
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:56,975
Fang Yan, back to your seat.

450
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,300
For students who are new to acting,

451
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,075
the two most common

452
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:04,600
problems are

453
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:09,750
programmed performance
and overacting.

454
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:12,550
(Perceptual exercises)
Students with these problems…

455
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,775
(Programmed Overacting)

456
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,275
should pay more attention to it.

457
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,875
Alright.

458
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:19,625
That’s all

459
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,550
for today.

460
00:28:20,725 --> 00:28:21,350
Class is over.

461
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,150
Sir,

462
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:26,925
how is Sanshang now?

463
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:34,425
Sanshang!

464
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,350
Sanshang!

465
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:38,650
Sanshang!

466
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,050
Mr. Sun,

467
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,400
I’m back.

468
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,175
- Sanshang!
- Sanshang!

469
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:54,125
You’re back!

470
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,375
You’ve lost weight!

471
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,800
- More handsome now!
- Handsome!

472
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,850
You’ve gained weight!

473
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:00,269
Hey, hey!

474
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,950
I knew you’d be back.

475
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,575
Or, no one will carry me.

476
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:18,525
I will.

477
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:20,975
Come on!

478
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:26,625
Carry her on your back!

479
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,625
Sanshang.

480
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,975
It’s yours.

481
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,025
Put it on the wall.

482
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:51,900
Don’t bother.

483
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,950
Let’s go have dinner.

484
00:30:00,475 --> 00:30:01,800
I’m not hungry.

485
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,375
How are the club members?

486
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
They are doing well.

487
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,400
Some members don’t like

488
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,950
my training method.

489
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,850
They’re not satisfied with it.

490
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,675
You have to communicate well with them.

491
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:26,800
Is everything

492
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,900
settled back at your home?

493
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:32,625
Yes.

494
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,000
Hey!

495
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:48,925
Where are you going?

496
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:50,675
Physical training room.

497
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,250
Now?

498
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,950
Sanshang is really worrying.

499
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:55,900
When the God is about to
grant a man great responsibility,

500
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,350
he would first frustrate
his spirit and will,

501
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,975
toiling his flesh and bone,
starving him always…

502
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,275
He is back.

503
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:04,800
That’s great enough.

504
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,850
Qiyi.

505
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,825
Do you feel that Sanshang
is not quite right?

506
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:11,850
What’s wrong?

507
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,000
I don’t know.

508
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:16,725
I just feel weird.

509
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,600
Especially his smile.

510
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,050
When you say so, I also feel a little.

511
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:28,650
After all, his dad just passed away.

512
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,625
He must need time to adjust to it.

513
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:44,900
Wow!

514
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:46,800
The popular actress Xun and

515
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,475
a mysterious man had a date in a hotel

516
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:49,675
with intimate actions.

517
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:51,350
Underground relationship exposed!

518
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,500
Let me see.

519
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,275
Do you think

520
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,850
this man is a bit like Mr. Sun?

521
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,975
Mr. Sun?

522
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:07,475
Mr. Sun and Xun

523
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,025
are not people from the same world.

524
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:10,350
Yeah.

525
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,150
There must be something wrong
about Sanshang.

526
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,275
Gosh!

527
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:24,050
Xun’s boyfriend is exposed!

528
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,375
Who is exposed?

529
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,200
Xun’s boyfriend.

530
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,450
Whose boyfriend?

531
00:33:28,525 --> 00:33:29,375
Xun.

532
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,275
Who is Xun?

533
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,625
Check it on Weibo!

534
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,400
What is Weibo?

535
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,975
Get lost!

536
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:36,475
What a dork.

537
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:40,294
(Du Ang: Are you free tomorrow?)

538
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:44,137
(What will you do tomorrow?)

539
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:58,031
(Qiyi: What’s the matter?)

540
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:05,425
(Du Ang: It’s my birthday tomorrow.)

541
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:12,950
(Qiyi: How do you want to celebrate?)

542
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,425
(Du Ang: Eat, drink and have fun!
Are you free?)

543
00:34:16,425 --> 00:34:19,575
(Qiyi: Yes.)

544
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,775
(Du Ang: Old Village Bar.)

545
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:26,025
(Qiyi: OK.)

546
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,500
Du Ang,

547
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,650
happy birthday!

548
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,850
Qiyi,

549
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,500
now my mood

550
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,325
is like this bouquet of roses…

551
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,850
What are you doing?

552
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,150
I…

553
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,950
Bro, you’re so mean!

554
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,650
Why don’t you tell us
it’s your birthday?

555
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,650
Come on, let’s go have some food.

556
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,325
Wait.

557
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,375
Why are you all here?

558
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:11,875
Then, we’re leaving.

559
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,875
Qiyi, let’s go.

560
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,075
- Come on!
- Wait! Wait!

561
00:35:16,475 --> 00:35:18,225
Let’s go. Have lunch together.

562
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,450
Beg me.

563
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:27,400
Please, Kaixin.

564
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:29,925
That’s it.

565
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:30,950
Come on.

566
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:41,675
But I…

567
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,125
I have no tears.

568
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,575
Universe.

569
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,950
Universe has no tears, either.

570
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,825
Tears are of no use.

571
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,675
We have only storms,

572
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:56,750
only thunder, only lightning!

573
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,075
We have no draggy rain!

574
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,500
This is my will.

575
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,425
The will of the universe!

576
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,250
Stir up, the wind!

577
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,000
Roar, the thunder!

578
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:09,475
Blaze, the lightning!

579
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:12,425
Destroy all that sleeps

580
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,750
in the darkness!

581
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,000
Destroy!

582
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:21,875
(Wine)

583
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,225
(Wan Lang)

584
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,225
Qiyi,

585
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,900
take the seat.

586
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:33,725
Thank you.

587
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:38,475
I’ll sit here.

588
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:39,775
Get lost.

589
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,600
Qiyi,

590
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,175
just order anything you want.

591
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,575
Two for the garret.

592
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:48,125
As usual.

593
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:48,800
OK.

594
00:36:57,025 --> 00:36:59,775
I want “Use for My Talent”.

595
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,975
The “Garden of Spring” suits you.

596
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:06,575
Do you mean I’m pretty?

597
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,725
“Withered Tree with Crows”.

598
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,325
Qiyi, you make the order.

599
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,550
Is this the place you always come to?

600
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,900
I always want to take you here.

601
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:21,650
Qiyi.

602
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,700
Thanks.

603
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:26,925
Wow!

604
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,525
Who is that?

605
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:30,875
Even with a bodyguard!

606
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:31,700
Who is it?

607
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,900
