24
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,700
How’s she?

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,100
She’s asleep.

26
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,225
That girl still doesn’t take your call?

27
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,800
Don’t you

28
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,225
want to know

29
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:58,550
why Xinfei deleted your message?

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,075
She mistakes you
for the owner of the music bar.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Where is he?

32
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,225
No idea.

33
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,300
Since he left,

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,150
he has never come back.

35
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:26,200
Later I knew that

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
you and he looked so alike.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
So,

38
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:31,850
she picked you at first sight.

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,000
The name of the bar

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,500
wasn’t Restaurant Music Bar.

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,650
After the owner left,

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,725
Xinfei was once very passive

43
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,475
and even tried to sell the bar.

44
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:47,825
But later,

45
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,525
she had a dream.

46
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,225
In the dream, the owner told her

47
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:53,400
to wait until he comes back.

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,450
So, she decided to cheer up.

49
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,400
Then, she’s been running the bar.

50
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,675
But such a dream is absurd.

51
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,600
No one knows

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,750
if the owner would come back or not.

53
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:10,925
But Xinfei believed that.

54
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,725
And she renamed it Restaurant Music Bar.

55
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,100
I can see that

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,100
the girl likes you a lot.

57
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,000
You mean Lu Qiyi?

58
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:32,800
Mhmm.

59
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:36,000
We’ve known each other
since we were little.

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,875
But...

61
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,600
I never thought she would like me.

62
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,675
You don’t like her?

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,150
I don’t know.

64
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:49,250
However,

65
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,600
when you heard she waited
for you in the rain all night,

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,175
you rushed out.

67
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,075
I really don’t know.

68
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:02,975
I think

69
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,300
you’d better think it over.

70
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,500
If you like her, go chase her.

71
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,025
It’s not too late yet.

72
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:18,625
Your favorite drink.

73
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:21,250
Thanks.

74
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:23,925
What do you want me for?

75
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,025
I want to ask if you have time.

76
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,175
I need a partner
for the Musical Festival.

77
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:33,425
I promised to be someone else’s partner.

78
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh.

79
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,100
Who?

80
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,225

What happened to you?

88
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:36,975
I was out of tune.

89
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,075
You were out of tune several times.

No.

99
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,025
I just can’t calm down.

100
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:00,600
A woman’s mood

101
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,600

Fine.

I guess

131
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,600
it must be an insider.

She’s quite hurting him!

00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:56,350
He likes her. What can you do?

141
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,500
Hey, hey.

142
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,475
Did you read the post about Bai Qiao?

143
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,750
I don’t believe that.

144
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,475
We’re at SUA.

145
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,150
Before I came here,

146
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,375
I had read about many girls like this.

147
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,525
I didn’t expect
to see one in our university.

148
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,400
I don’t care.

149
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:28,950
Well,

150
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,075
isn’t it inappropriate
to gossip about our classmate?

151
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,375
What?

152
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,075
You mean I gossiped?

153
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,500
I didn’t write the post.

154
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,575
I also wonder who did such a thing.

155
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:41,650
You’re done?

156
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:42,650
I’ll have it somewhere else.

157
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,525
Fang Yan.

158
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:46,750
Sanshang...

159
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:51,050
Why did you yell?

160
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,100
I...

161
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,075
I’ll stop yelling.

162
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,600
It isn’t me!

163
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,275
To all the Gods,

164
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:59,575
I swear

165
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,750
that I didn’t write the post.

166
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,125
Besides,

167
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,225
martial artists like us

168
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:05,275
always behave frankly.

169
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
If I want to gossip,

170
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,075
I’ll speak it out loud!

171
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,650
When Bai Qiao reads it,

172
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,000
will she think I posted it?

173
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,675
I’ll be too aggrieved, then.

174
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,725
Don’t overthink.

175
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,500
Such a logical post

176
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,050
can’t be written by you, okay?

177
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,725
That’d be better.

178
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,175
Besides,

179
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,325
the poster said

180
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,525
he had known Bai Qiao for a long time.

181
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,400
But I just got to know her.

182
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,575
Also,

183
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:33,050
they used to be

184
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,975
very close friends.

185
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,075
Bai Qiao is with Li Xiao
that I adored.

186
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,625
She’s not my friend.

187
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,725
Who do you think posted it?

188
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,325
Will you think

189
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,350
I wrote the post?

190
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,300
She and I have known
each other for years.

191
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,525
We’re close friends, too.

192
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,425
Did you or did you not post it?

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,350
I believe Qiyi.

194
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:00,450
It can’t be her.

195
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,575
I don’t think she posted it, either.

196
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,975
But the point is...

197
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:05,100
Will Bai Qiao believe her?

198
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,725
Let’s practice again.

199

♪The touching moments in life
that won’t fade♪

200
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,525
What do you think?

201
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,325
I still feel something wrong.

202
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,150
How about this?

203
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,875
I’ll go to the library

204
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,400
and borrow some videos on musical.

205
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,375
Let’s watch them and learn.

206
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,850
Mhmm.

207
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,525
Hello, Mom.

208
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,550
Qiyi,

209
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,950
your father is going to Nancheng City
for a meeting.

210
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,875
I think

211
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,950
it’s a good chance
to tell him the truth.

212
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,950
Get prepared.

213
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,875
He’ll be arriving tomorrow.

214
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,900
Tomorrow?

218
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,814
After walking through the gate,

219
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:15,125
First Avenue is right in front.

220
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,825
The English Building is on the left.

221
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,500
No, the building for my major.

The second floor is for books
of German and Spanish.

223
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:37,025
Hello, Dad.

224
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:38,500
Qiyi,

225
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,100
what are you doing?

226
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,075
I’m...

227
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,975
I’m... I’m reading English.

228
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,125
Oh.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,850
You’re on campus?

230
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,950
Yes, I am.

231
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,525
Your mother told you, didn’t she?

232
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:53,225
The speech I made in your high school

233
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,375
was a great success.

234
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,150
Teachers and students
all appreciated it.

235
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,775
By the way,

236
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,150
do you have time these days?

237
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,425
I want to visit you tomorrow.

238
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,325
Okay. Okay.

239
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,125
I’ll be waiting for you on campus.

240
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,325
Oh, Qiyi,

241
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,275
for this Medical Forum,

242
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,600
documents from the University of Leicester
need to be translated.

243
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,375
Could you make an appointment for me

244
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,475
with your teacher Miss Bai?

245
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:18,025
I want to communicate with her.

246
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,550
Miss Bai?

247
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,225
You read it, too?

248
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,375
Do you know who posted it?

249
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,125
It doesn’t matter.

250
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,600
The point is, do you believe the post?

251
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,900
I don’t, with no doubt.

252
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:56,050
I can help find out who posted it.

253
00:14:57,675 --> 00:14:59,575
I think I know who did.

254
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,325
Who?

255
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,925
It doesn’t matter.

256
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:07,375
As long as you believe me.

257
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:25,125
My classmate wants to see me.

258
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,050
I gotta go.

259
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,475
Let me walk you there.

260
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,525
Don’t bother. I’ll go alone.

261
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,275
Bai Qiao,

262
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,350
if you need anything,

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,975
remember to call me.

264
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:39,500
All right.

265
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,825
See you at tomorrow’s rehearsal.

266
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,525
Bye-bye.

267
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,500
Bai Qiao.

268
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,325
Why can’t we talk in the dorm?

269
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,850
My father has come.

270
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,975
He wants to see you.

271
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:06,575
No.

272
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,375
I mean Miss Bai.

273
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,450
Last time, didn’t I tell you

274
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:12,925
that I wouldn’t help you anymore?

275
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,450
Bai Qiao,

276
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,600
no one in our university
knows my secret but you.

277
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,075
Only you can help me out.

278
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:27,500
Fine, then.

279
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,550
You’ll meet him?

280
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,125
I can’t just watch
and do nothing, can I?

281
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,975
That’s great.

282
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,400
Thank you, Bai Qiao.

283
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
Thank you.

284
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,825
Fine. I gotta go.

285
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:40,800
Bai Qiao,

286
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,900
I have something to tell you.

287
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:48,325
I remember when school started,

288
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:50,425
we were so close.

289
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,650
You were always helping me

290
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,425
and taking care of me.

291
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,050
I don’t know why it started,

292
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,950
but our relationship
seemed to have changed.

293
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,575
It’s been long
since we talked last time.

294
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,425
But,

295
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300
I’ve always regarded you

296
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,825
as my best friend!

297
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:14,450
Bai Qiao,

298
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,300
I swear to you.

299
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,750
I have never

300
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,850
spoken ill of you.

301
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,150
I never care about that.

302
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:23,425
It doesn’t matter.

303
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,175
Let’s go.

304
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,550
(Wish you would be cooler.
I always support you.)

305
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,600
Bai Qiao,

306
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,550
let me check.

307
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

308
00:17:59,125 --> 00:17:59,700
Let’s go.

309
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,500
Wait.

310
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,625
Let’s confirm it.

311
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,900
You’ll tell my father

312
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,625
you’re too busy
to take the translation work.

313
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,325
Remember.

314
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:06,975
Mhmm. Okay.

315
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,475
Do remember.

316
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:07,900
Let’s go.

317
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,750
Wait.

318
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,350
You’re going to England
for vocational study.

319
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,150
England.

320
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,075
Don’t missay it.

321
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,425
Keep it in mind.

322
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:16,450
Hello, Mr. Lu.

323
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,200
Nice to meet you again.

324
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,325
Miss Bai,

325
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:19,175
nice to meet you.

326
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,025
Dad.

327
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:20,525
Mhmm?

328
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:21,825
When are you going to the meeting?

329
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:22,525
I’m in no hurry.

330
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:24,350
Miss Bai,

331
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,000
Qiyi must have told you about it.

332
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,150
This time,

333
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,200
we want to ask you for a favor.

334
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,275
Here’re some English documents
about medicine.

335
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,725
If you have time,

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,425
could you translate them for me?

337
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,200
Miss Bai?

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,850
Sir,

339
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,025
maybe you have already
seen me through.

340
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,750
I’m not an English teacher

341
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,500
at Southern Foreign Studies University.

342
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:53,175
Bai Qiao!

343
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,425
Miss Bai,

344
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:56,925
if you’re not my teacher, what...?

345
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,650
Qiyi.

346
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:01,900
Miss Bai,

347
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,325
what do you mean?

348
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:07,325
Sir,

349
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,950
I mean

350
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,850
I’m not Lu Qiyi’s English teacher

351
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,600
or a graduator
from the University of Leicester.

352
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:17,125
I’m only a student of grade 2018

353
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:17,950
of the School of Performing Arts

354
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,050
at Southern University of the Arts.

355
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,150
I know we made a mistake

356
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,300
and lied to you.

357
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,525
But I came today,

358
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:29,775
to explain everything to you.

359
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,775
Qiyi isn’t studying
at Southern Foreign Studies University

360
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,250
or majoring in English.

361
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,600
Just like me,

362
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,750
she majors in Performing Arts.

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,650
You must be kidding, Miss Bai.

364
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:52,775
Sir,

365
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:54,775
I’m not kidding.

366
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,550
Don’t blame Qiyi.

367
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,125
I know we shouldn’t have done this.

368
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,525
But she has a reason for that.

369
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,025
I always wanted to tell you

370
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,200
to communicate more with her

371
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,475
and have more talks with her.

372
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,800
I also told her

373
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,700
that I wanted her

374
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
to tell you everything.

375
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,325
Qiyi,

376
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,500
I’m sorry.

377
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,325
Dad,

378
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,400
actually...

379
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,350
Actually, I...

380
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,950
Lu Qiyi,

381
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,400
come out with me!

382
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:50,525
Come!

383
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,225
Qiyi,

384
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:21,825
it’s so brave of you.

385
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,225
If I did this,

386
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,825
my father would have killed me.

387
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,900
Kaixin,

388
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,300
could you be quiet?

389
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,550
Dad.

390
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,350
Dad!

391
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,000
Qiyi.

392
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:53,775
Qiyi,

393
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,800
I’ve invited your father

394
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,725
to watch the Musical Festival.

395
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,625
He said he had never watched
any of your performances

396
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:03,075
and didn’t know
if you could learn to perform well.

397
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,025
As for whether you can stay,

398
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,475
it depends on your performance.

399
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:09,550
Did...?

400
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,200
Did he agree to come?

401
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,725
He would like to give you a chance.

402
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:16,800
Work hard.

403
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:25,075
Bai Qiao,

404
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:27,625
I have something to tell you.

405
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,550
Let’s talk out there.

406
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:36,825
Why did you do that?

407
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,525
Didn’t you do something worse?

408
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,018
I just said something

409
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:45,775
I knew.

410
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:47,225
What about you?

411
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,975
You made up stories.

412
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:51,275
I didn’t.

413
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:53,000
You didn’t?

414
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,800
I knew a girl

415
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,500
who totally fell.

416
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,725
She always stayed out

417
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,175
and dealt with different men.

418
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:00,950
Lu Qiyi,

419
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,800
didn’t you say that?

420
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,775
Bai Qiao,

421
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:07,925
think about it carefully.

422
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,750
What good can I get from this?

423
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,725
We’ve known each other for years.

424
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,850
I take you as my best friend.

425
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,050
Why don’t you trust me?

426
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,275
Come on, Lu Qiyi.

427
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,325
What else can you do,

428
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,000
besides pretending to be pathetic?

429
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:28,575
What can you do, then?

430
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,675
Have you thought about

431
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,025
why there’s so much gossip about you?

432
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,750
I didn’t say that, anyway.

433
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,800
You know best

434
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,375
if you said it.

435
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,200
Bai Qiao!

436
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,250
Anyway,

437
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,200
I’d like to thank you.

438
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,175
Without you,

439
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,875
I would still be too cowardly

440
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:01,925
to tell my father the truth.

441
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,675
From this day on,

442
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,675
I no longer need to lie.

443
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,650
Lu Qiyi,

444
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:16,375
you’d better go back with your father.

445
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,050
Your temper

446
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,625
isn’t suitable for arts.

447
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,125
Qiyi.

448
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:40,200
I didn’t know you could quarrel.

449
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,375
By the way,

450
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,275
who wrote the post about Bai Qiao?

451
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,250
With such a post,

452
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,950
everybody would suspect Qiyi.

453
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,450
But the more they suspect,

454
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:50,250
the less likely it can be.

455
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,050
Yes. You make sense.

456
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,550
The poster defamed Bai Qiao

457
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,675
and framed Qiyi up.

458
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:59,250
He hurt two persons with one post.

459
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,350
That was cruel!

460
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,925
(The whole cybercafe booked)

461
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:14,175
Dudes!

462
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,800
Today, I invited you here

463
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,650
to find out who wrote the post!

464
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,675
He’s severely harmed
my friend’s reputation

465
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:27,000
and caused extremely bad influence.

466
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:28,525
My friend

467
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:32,200
is now depressed and remains in bed.

468
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,500
So,

469
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,700
we must find out who’s behind it!

470
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:37,700
Okay!

471
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,875
Start!

472
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,375
Good job.

473
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,025
Who’s that?

474
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:16,875
Bai Qiao.

475
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,750
Li Xiao,

476
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,800
if you don’t let me stay tonight,

477
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:23,850
I’ll have to sleep on the street.

478
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:28,400
Come on in.

479
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:46,525
Where have you gone?

480
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:47,950
You didn’t answer the call, either.

481
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,550
Has Bai Qiao come back?

482
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:52,950
It’s already 10:00 PM.

483
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,350
I don’t think she’ll come back.

484
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:56,925
Also, she’s too ashamed to come back.

485
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,475
Stop worrying.

486
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,050
Didn’t Mr. Sun say that

487
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,275
there was still hope?

488
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,475
Now,

489
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:07,775
you should rehearse carefully.

490
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:09,575
After your parents watch it,

491
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,150
they’ll let you stay.

492
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,175
Human effort is the decisive factor.

493
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,350
Man will conquer nature.

494
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,300
Come on!

495
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,675
It’s said that our school
has spent quite a lot

496
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,750
on this Musical Festival.

497
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:24,625
What?

498
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,325
Senior actor Su Wen is invited
to be the judge.

499
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,950
Su Wen who often plays the role
of a rich man?

500
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,150
Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:33,450
You don’t know?

502
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,950
He graduated
from our university years ago.

503
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,725
Then, this Musical Festival

504
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:40,650
will be extraordinary.

505
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,500
Sure.

506
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:42,550
Fang Yan.

507
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,025
I hear

508
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,950
you also entered
for the Musical Festival.

509
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:49,000
Do you have the confidence
to win, chief?

510
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:51,950
I will win.

511
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,175
So,

512
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,525
you’re regretting it?

513
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:07,275
I’m not.

514
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:10,775
I always

515
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:14,325
take an eye for an eye.

516
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,400
A revengeful person

517
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:25,475
never talks about taking revenge.

518
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:29,900
Do you believe

519
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,300
that Qiyi wrote the post?

520
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:34,450
No.

521
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:40,075
But I hate her.

522
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:44,025
I hate her very much.

523
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,350
Why?

524
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,750
She looks like a nerd,

525
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:57,350
but she’s quite talented in art.

526
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,575
A couple of years ago,

527
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:03,125
we took part in a dance competition.

528
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,000
She performed the classical dance

529
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,650
very well.

530
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:12,800
On the stage,

531
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,950
she was like a fairy.

532
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:20,300
Gorgeous.

533
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,225
Later, we were in a group

534
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
and had to perform together.

535
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,950
Mhmm.

536
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:31,875
However, I did jazz dance

537
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:34,425
while she did classical dance.

538
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,650
We were confused immediately.

539
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,275
We had no choice,

540
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:43,675
but to dance together.

541
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:46,750
Unexpectedly,

542
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,925
it turned out to be brilliant.

543
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,375
Since then,

544
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,150
we’ve been good friends.

545
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:05,000
We called and texted each other
on WeChat every day.

546
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:07,450
We were nearly together all the time.

547
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,350
Until one day, she told me

548
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,875
she got over 640 points.

549
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:24,350
Over 640 points

550
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,225
But she abandoned the chance
to go to a famous university,

551
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,850
and came to SUA.

552
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,800
But for me,

553
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,700
to be admitted to this university,

554
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,550
it took me two more years
in high school.

555
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,500
Two more years.

556
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,875
I’m jealous of her.

557
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:03,875
She has parents
who love and spoil her.

558
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:09,150
But I don’t.

559
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,625
I have nothing.

560
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,275
I’m so tired.

561
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:25,275
So tired.

562
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:30,025
So tired.

563
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:34,600
Bai Qiao,

564
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:39,725
if you have trouble with your roommates,

565
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,950
come to me.

566
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,700
I’ll go back to my dorm.

567
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay?

568
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:20,600
Li Xiao?

569
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,225
I found the poster.

570
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,550
Good job.

571
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,800
Give me five.

572
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,976
Yeah.

573
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:17,275
Come on.

574
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:22,475
Tell us.

575
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:24,575
Tell us about your post.

576
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,975
I wrote the post

577
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:34,550
to defame Bai Qiao.

578
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:36,375
But I’ve deleted it.

579
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:38,375
Why did you do that?

580
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,500
Because of Li Xiao.

581
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,025
Li Xiao?

582
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,425
She likes Li Xiao.

583
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,675
What?

584
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,350
Since when?

585
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:49,450
Since the school started.

586
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:52,100
When I met him for the first time
at the class meeting,

587
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,875
I fell in love with him.

588
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,375
I’m your senior

589
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:55,900
and the teaching assistant.

590
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,600
Hope we can communicate freely

591
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,125
in future study and life.

592
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,075
No one loves him more than I do.

593
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,000
But he doesn’t even look at me.

594
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,300
Why does he like Bai Qiao?

595
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:26,925
She isn’t good enough for him.

596
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,100
You defamed Bai Qiao.

597
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,950
I’ll go tell her.

598
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,075
Wait, wait, Monitor.

599
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,750
Monitor,

600
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,475
I’m begging you.

601
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,250
Could you not tell other classmates?

602
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,800
If they know it,

603
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,225
I can no longer stay at our school.

604
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,625
You’re scared now?

605
00:34:42,825 --> 00:34:44,100
When you posted it,

606
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,050
why weren’t you scared?

607
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,725
You even framed Qiyi up.

608
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:48,750
I didn’t frame her up.

609
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,150
I wrote the post,

610
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,775
simply to let Li Xiao know

611
00:34:51,775 --> 00:34:53,375
what kind of girl Bai Qiao was.

612
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,800
But when you did that,

613
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:57,325
did you think about
how Bai Qiao would end up?

614
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:00,325
I’ve deleted the post.

615
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,725
If necessary,

616
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,575
I can write another post
to clear the air.

617
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:06,350
Monitor,

618
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,400
it took me great trouble

619
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,725
to be admitted to this university.

620
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,500
My parents are in poor health, too.

621
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,200
I can’t let them down.

622
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,100
Monitor,

623
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,025
I...

624
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,500
I won’t do it ever again.

625
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,625
Monitor,

626
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:24,425
could you not tell Bai Qiao?

627
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,125
Please don’t tell her.

628
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,175
I beg you. I beg you.

629
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,725
Don’t tell her.

630
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:32,275
Qiyi...

631
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,025
I won’t do it again.

632
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:33,800
Make the decision yourself.

633
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,300
Monitor. Monitor.

634
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,575
Monitor, say something!

635
00:35:39,575 --> 00:35:41,525
I swear I won’t do it again.

636
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:44,975
(Stress: Relationship, Context)
Logical stress

637
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,950
(Logical stress, Emotional stress)
refers to emphasizes words,

638
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,850
(Stress, Render)
according to the meaning of dialogues.

639
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,425
The same line with different stresses

640
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,550
expresses different meanings.

641
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:00,800
(Stress doesn’t mean loud pronunciation.)
Stress doesn’t mean loud pronunciation.

642
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:03,050
All right.

643
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:05,350
So much for today’s class.

644
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,300
I have something to announce.

645
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,175
For this Musical Festival,

646
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:15,300
there’s only one quota for our class.

647
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,800
I’ve thought about it.

648
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,700
In our class,

649
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,650
only Qiyi and Bai Qiao entered for it.

650
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:23,700
So,

651
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,950
do you think you can

652
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:29,050
make your shows into one?

653
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:33,700
Mr. Sun,

654
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:36,925
I don’t agree.

655
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,925
Our shows are of different styles.

656
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:43,350
We can’t make it one.

657
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,925
How about this?

658
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,375
Let’s have a primary election in class

659
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:52,000
and all classmates shall vote.

660
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:53,350
The winner

661
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,325
can go to the Musical Festival
on behalf of our class.

662
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,775
Qiyi,

663
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,100
what do you think?

664
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,225
I...

665
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,075
Mr. Sun,

666
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:18,400
we accept it.

667
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:23,800
Fine.

668
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,450
Let’s do this, then.

669
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:27,550
Go get prepared.

670
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,825
Class is over.

671
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,575
Bai Qiao.

672
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,500
Bai Qiao!

673
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,700
Can we have a word?

674
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,800
I know I don’t do things perfectly.

675
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,925
I apologized to you.

676
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,025
Do we really need to be distant?

677
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,400
You’d better go get prepared.

678
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,225
Five, six, seven, go.

679
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:10,025
One, two, three, four.

680
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:11,700
Five, six, seven, eight.

681
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,375
- Stop.
- Two...

682
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:14,950
You were slow.

683
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:16,825
What was on your mind?

684
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,850
I’m sorry.

685
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,525
I forgot the pace.

686
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:21,775
I’ll be more careful.

687
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,050
Five, six, seven, go.

688
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:28,000
One, two, three, four.

689
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,700
Five, six, seven, eight.

690
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,250
Two, two, three, four.

691
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,000
Stop!

692
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,525
Lu Qiyi,

693
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,000
why didn’t you turn around?

694
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,525
Do you or do you not want to win?

695
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:43,300
Never mind.

696
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,700
Go back for some rest.

697
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,025
We’ll practice this evening.

698
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:53,250
What happened to Fang Yan?

699
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:54,625
He seems like a different man.

700
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,500
Go back for some rest, too.

701
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,800
I have nothing to do
back in the dorm.

702
00:38:57,825 --> 00:38:59,100
Shall I practice with you?

703
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:00,250
Qiyi, come on.

704
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,675
Why do they both behave so weirdly?

705
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,625
Come on, everybody.

706
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,900
Free snacks.

707
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,925
Come on. Be quick.

708
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:13,800
Come on. Quickly.

709
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,650
Come on.

710
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,800
Slow down. Don’t rush.

711
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,650
You’ll all get some.

712
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:20,300
Be careful. Be careful.

713
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,850
Don’t only eat.

714
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,100
Remember to vote for Qiyi.

715
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,550
What?

716
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,775
Hey, hey.

717
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:29,725
Don’t leave.

718
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:30,900
Come back!

719
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,825
Go. Go get them back. Get them back!

720
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,225
You don’t dance smoothly enough.

721
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,675
But it feels right.

722
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,575
Let’s practice a few more times.

723
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,325
Okay.

724
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,950
Li Xiao.

725
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,475
What?

726
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,125
Do you think we can win?

727
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,900
I don’t understand.

728
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,775
You could have been Lu Qiyi’s partner.

729
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,825
Why did you make her your competitor?

730
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,500
Unless you’re my partner,

731
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,700
I can’t win.

732
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:30,825
You care so much about the victory?

733
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,275
What do you want me for?

734
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,300
Didn’t Qiyi promise me

735
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,500
that she wouldn’t tell other classmates?

736
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,075
I didn’t.

737
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,875
What do you mean, then?

738
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:56,700
Nothing special.

739
00:40:56,775 --> 00:40:58,250
Just vote for Qiyi tomorrow.

740
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:00,125
Oh.

741
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,575
Come on in.

742
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,475
Mr. Sun.

743
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,950
Qiyi,

744
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:16,675
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

745
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,325
Take a seat.

746
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,475
Don’t you want to know

747
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:28,275
what your father and I talked about

748
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:29,375
yesterday?

749
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:31,150
This is why I came.

750
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,425
Mr. Sun,

751
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,700
do you think

752
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,200
my father will let me stay?

753
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:35,975
Qiyi,

754
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:39,300
when you decided to apply
for our university,

755
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:40,550
did your father agree?

756
00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:42,850
No.

757
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,250
Now, he has known the truth.

758
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,925
What are you going to do?

759
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,800
I’ll convince him with real action.

760
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,175
Or I’ll go beg him.

761
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:55,975
Fine.

762
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:59,275
Now that you know what to do,

763
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,475
stop worrying.

764
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,650
What you need to do now

765
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,475
is to focus on the Musical Festival.

766
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,850
And you must understand

767
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:07,650
he’s your father, after all.

768
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,650
Do you get it?

769
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,625
I get it.

770
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:13,100
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

771
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,075
I’ll leave you alone.

772
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:15,500
Okay.

773
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,275
Bai Qiao.

774
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,500
How are you preparing?

775
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:44,725
What?

776
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,225
I saw Lu Qiyi go to see Mr. Sun.

777
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:57,650
So?

778
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,175
Don’t underestimate her tricks.

779
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,475
Remember?

780
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,150
- Be careful.
- Mhmm.
