My mom?

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,375
I invited her yesterday
at the restaurant.

28
00:01:59,175 --> 00:01:59,825
What’s wrong?

29
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:09,583
(Mom: I’m waiting for you by the lake.)

Hey!

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,725
We have a performance to give.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,500
Mom,

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:15,950
I...

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,425
Be quiet, Lu Qiyi.

35
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:19,600
You’re so disappointing.

36
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,275
I can’t believe

37
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,175
you fooled us around.

38
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,925
You’re an adult

39
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:26,100
and independent, right?

40
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,625
So you think you can make

41
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,925
such a big decision, right?

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,125
You know why we objected it?

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,875
Your dad opposes performing arts

44
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,750
because he’s worried

45
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,475
you won’t fit in the showbiz.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,525
Mom,

47
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,025
I’m sorry.

48
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,575
I lost sleep last night.

49
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,875
I haven’t told your dad.

50
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:51,500
But he’ll find out someday.

51
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,975
It’s only a matter of time.

52
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:54,450
You’ll face

53
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,225
the consequence by yourself, you know?

54
00:02:58,275 --> 00:02:59,250
Miss Bai.

55
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,025
Whoever she is,

56
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,600
she’s right about one thing.

57
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:03,775
You’re an adult now.

58
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,875
You have the right to choose your life.

59
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,975
Since you insist on it,

60
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:09,700

But please believe me.

66
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,475
I can do it.

Alright.

68

(GALLERY)

100
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:00,375
I’m your chief performance teacher

101
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,425
and head teacher.

102
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:04,725
My name is Sun Zhuowen.

103
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,600
(Sun Zhuowen)
For my class,

104
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:07,750
there are a few requirements

105
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:09,675
I must expound.

106
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,325
First,

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,550
nobody comes late

108
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,375
or leaves early.

109
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:18,600
Second,

110
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,050
in my class,

111
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,975
no fanciful clothes are allowed,

112
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,575
including necklaces and earrings.

113
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,125
Third,

114
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,925
do not slack on academic study

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
due to campus activities.

116
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,575
(Rules)

117
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:38,375
The rules

118
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,650
will not be repeated.

119
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,675
Any questions?

120
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:50,975
To perform, we imitate a man.

121
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,250
(Man)

122
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,225
To do it great,

123
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,750
you have to be a good man first,

124
00:07:57,525 --> 00:08:00,275
as ethics before skills.

125
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,850
Now...

126
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,625
Excuse me.

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,400
Now,

128
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,050
let’s do some exercises.

129
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,100
Excuse me.

130
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,750
Sir,

131
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,350
I went to dump the garbage.

132
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,325
No explanation.

133
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
You, come here.

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,475
What’s your name?

135
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,000
Fang Yan.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,850
How old are you?

137
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,525
19.

138
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:25,575
OK.

139
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,975
Now, turn around.

140
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,900
Face the class and say

141
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:32,175
you’re garbage.

142
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,675
Let me show you.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,725
Watch me.

144
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:46,350
I am garbage.

145
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,100
Your turn.

146
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,650
You’re garbage.

147
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,425
Here.

148
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:06,700
Ladies and gents,

149
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:08,425
I need some of you to help him.

150
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,475
Come on, you, and you.

151
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,825
Come here.

152
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,650
Come.

153
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,100
Gather before Fang Yan.

154
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,875
It’s Fang Yan, right?

155
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,450
Come, gather in front of him.

156
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,050
OK.

157
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,750
Now,

158
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:25,825
think about the most vicious language

159
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,025
and curse him.

160
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:28,500
Tell him

161
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,150
he’s garbage.

162
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:31,500
Start.

163
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,525
Fang Yan,

164
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:36,725
you’re no man.

165
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,025
Fang Yan,

166
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,250
you think you are cool?

167
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,550
You’re garbage.

168
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:43,875
Fang Yan...

169
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,725
Fang Yan, you think you’re
Prince Charming?

170
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:47,475
You’re just a dumb ass.

171
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,925
You’re garbage.

172
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,075
Yeah, your shoes are terrible.

173
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,225
- You have foot odor.
- Lump.

174
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,175
Fang Yan, say something.

175
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:52,875
Come on.

176
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,575
Fang Yan...

177
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,050
Foot odor.

178
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,075
Fang Yan, you look horrible.

179
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:57,975
Your foot odor is suffocating.

180
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,650
You think you are cool,

181
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,675
like a peacock.

182
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:01,475
Say something.

183
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,750
Fang Yan...

184
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,250
Fang Yan, say something.

185
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,249
Come on.

186
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright, Fang Yan, come here.

187
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,725
Come.

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,150
The rest of you can go back.

189
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,675
Lu Qiyi, stay with us.

190
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:12,550
Come here.

191
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,200
Come on.

192
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:14,950
Come here.

193
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,425
Tell me and everyone else

194
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,775
why you didn’t curse him.

195
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,625
Come on.

196
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,500
Curse him.

197
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,250
Curse him.

198
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,800
Fang Yan...

199
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,000
Fang Yan, you...

200
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,950
Fang Yan, you’re not a good student.

201
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,475
Now, Fang Yan,

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,150
help her spice it up.

203
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,625
Do her a favor, go.

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,675
Scholar,

205
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,250
curse me whatever you want.

206
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,650
I won’t be mad.

207
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,225
Come on.

208
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,450
Have you forgotten how to speak?

209
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,650
Are you stupid?

210
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:21,675
Then go home.

211
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,800
You’re not made for performance.

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Right,

213
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,275
what was that

214
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:30,150
at the admission exam?

215
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,375
I was pulled out of the scene, you know?

216
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,875
Without me,

217
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,725
could you possibly have been admitted?

218
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,401
Do you think you’re pretty,

219
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,350
or stylish,

220
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,500
or hot?

221
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,675
Look at yourself in the mirror.

222
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:43,850
Do you call it beauty?

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,550
You have no judge of beauty!

224
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,150
Lu Qiyi,

225
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,725
you’ll never become an actress.

226
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,500
You shouldn’t have
chosen performing arts.

227
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,575
You rascal!

228
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:23,650
Ladies and gents,

229
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,100
you should remember this feeling.

230
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,750
You feel

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,300
Lu Qiyi’s wrath, don’t you?

232
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,025
Well done with the slap.

233
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,650
Thank you, Fang Yan
for the perfect performance.

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,850
Ladies and gents,

235
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,450
revive your instinct.

236
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,525
That’s what we’re going to do
this semester.

237
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,150
Try to make it real.

238
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,625
Remember this feeling.

239
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:46,425
This class is meaningful.

240
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:47,475
OK.

241
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:48,875
So much for today.

242
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,425
Morning exercise at 6:00 AM tomorrow.

243
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:51,550
Dismissed.

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,900
Thank you, sir.

245
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:54,550
Bye.

246
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,450
Don’t cry.

247
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,800
Fang Yan was actually

248
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,025
helping you out.

249
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,825
Without his help,

250
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,725
you wouldn’t have got the emotion out,

251
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:17,500
would you?

252
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,500
Let’s go.

253
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:47,025
The guitarist is so cool.

254
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,325
He’s my type.

Why didn’t you tell me?

273
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,225

Qiyi,

278
00:14:58,475 --> 00:14:59,650
you know what the required course

279
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,525
that most students fail is?

280
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,475
It’s love.

281
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,675
Do you know how many

282
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,025
girls in their prime time like you

283
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:07,175
miss out on their Mr. Right in college

284
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:08,450
and regret all their lives?

285
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,150
It’s not that serious.

286
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,025
It is.

287
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,325
You’ve loved him for 10 years.

288
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,325
Ten years.

289
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,325
It’s not love.

290
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:15,825
No.

291
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:16,250
Yes, it is.

292
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,075
- Ten years.
- No.

293
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,825
Ten years.

294
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:18,300
No.

295
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,975
Girl,

296
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,925
from your face I read peach blossom.

297
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,625
Come on.

298
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:28,825
Allow me

299
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:30,825
(The Changes and Life)
to do a detailed reading.

300
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,875
Girl,

301
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:37,650
I see a peach blossom curse
in your fate.

302
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,800
Peach blossom curse?

303
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,675
I mean in the near future,

304
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:44,850
you’ll suffer in love.

305
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,150
Show me your hand.

307
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:03,800
Girl,

308
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,125
welcome to the Society of Changes.

309
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,050
Huh?

310
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:13,650
(Experimental Drama Society)

311
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,550
You may start.

312
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,800
Sir,

313
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,325
it requires 2 characters.

314
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:28,850
Yeah,

315
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,000
start.

316
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:35,550
Xiangzi.

317
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:36,850
Oh you.

318
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,375
What are you doing here?

319
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,925
I come to check on you.

320
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,675
You’re good, huh?

321
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,150
Gone like the dust

322
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:45,075
in the wind.

323
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,000
I’m here to see you.

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,850
What did you do?

325
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,250
You left me waiting on the alley.

326
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,050
You’re really something now.

327
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,000
Let’s talk about it

328
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,350
at the crossing.

329
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,850
No.

330
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,700
Can’t we talk here?

331
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,050
Keep it low.

332
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,675
The neighbors are asleep.

333
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:01,625
I’m always loud.

334
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,225
No wonder you’re avoiding me.

335
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,800
There’s a poisonous hooker here.

336
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,750
Stop!

337
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,950
You don’t like what I say?

338
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,725
Be frank.

339
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,625
What are you doing here?

340
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:14,775
I’m in delicate condition.

341
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:15,750
Delicate how?

342
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,700
This.

343
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:20,875
What do you think this is?

344
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:21,675
Huh?

345
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:25,400
Stop.

346
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,750
What are you doing?

347
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,300
Dual personality?

348
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:32,025
Didn’t you want me to start?

349
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,850
Did you introduce yourself?

350
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,150
Do I need to?

351
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,200
If you don’t introduce yourself,

352
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,225
who knows who you are?

353
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,550
This is commonsense.

354
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,925
Do I have to tell you?

355
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,125
Next.

356
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:46,050
You’re being unreasonable.

357
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,050
I said next.

358
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,050
I wanted to make a name

359
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,450
with Experimental Drama Society.

360
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,800
After today,

361
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,400
it’s not gonna happen.

362
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,100
You shouldn’t have picked at him.

363
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,425
Guys,

364
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,575
I wanna ask a serious question.

365
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:36,525
A serious question.

366
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,400
Who do you think

367
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,625
is the most beautiful girl in our class?

368
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,050
I think Kaixin is pretty.

369
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:55,500
You two are perfect together.

370
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,675
Do you like her type?

371
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,675
My dad said moral quality is the key.

372
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,675
Moral quality aside,

373
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,075
the men in our class

374
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,825
are so disappointing.

375
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,775
Take Du Ang as an example,

376
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,950
he’s so catty,

377
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,546
especially when he speaks.

378
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,075
And Li Sanshang

379
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,925
is a mute.

380
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:18,900
In my opinion,

381
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,125
a man of his personality

382
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,850
doesn’t belong with our class.

383
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:23,975
What about you?

384
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,450
Do you think any man in our class

385
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,975
has anything to do with handsome?

386
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,725
I think Fang Yan is cool.

387
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,950
No, no.

388
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,750
He’s kind of hypocritical to me.

389
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:40,550
I don’t think

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,450
anyone is extraordinary in our class.

391
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,000
Stop.

392
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,650
That’s very hypocritical.

393
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:46,725
Extraordinary? How?

394
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,450
Don’t set the mark too high, dude.

395
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,825
How do you like Bai Qiao?

396
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,000
I think she’s gorgeous.

397
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:57,225
Didn’t you say moral quality is the key?

398
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,825
My dad said that.

399
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,250
None of the men in our class

400
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,500
are half the man the guitarist is.

401
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,900
Who is the guitarist?

402
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,375
You should ask Qiyi.

403
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,425
I smell a story.

404
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,625
Start talking!

405
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,300
When will I have the chance to meet him?

406
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:34,200
Zimo,

407
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:36,350
are there any handsome men

408
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,225
in the class of directing?

409
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:51,050
The girl I like hasn’t come.

410
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,200
You’re demanding.

411
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,850
I’m not demanding.

412
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,650
In love,

413
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,350
fate plays a crucial role.

414
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,450
How do you like Qiyi?

415
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,775
I think she’s fun.

416
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,100
Cut it out.

417
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,900
Stop thinking about girls.

418
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,750
Go to sleep.

419
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:22,900
Alright.

420
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,050
Good night.

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,250
You’re up, Qiyi.

422
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,775
Mm-hmm, morning, Kaixin.

423
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,175
Morning.

424
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,575
Qiyi.

425
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,100
Yes?

426
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,850
Your lotion is moisturizing.

427
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,825
And it smells good.

428
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,150
What brand is it?

429
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,675
I have no idea.

430
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,200
My mom bought it for me.

431
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,500
Have you heard?

432
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,275
All freshmen go through a trial
each year.

433
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,850
The School of Directing is friendly.

434
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,625
The trail we’re facing

435
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,850
is torture.

436
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
It’s said

437
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,600
the seniors

438
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:30,625
are all as vicious

439
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,825
as wild animals.

440
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,400
They’d lock us in a dark room

441
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,650
and torture us.

442
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,725
What’s worse,

443
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,800
they’d punish us with half squatting

444
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:44,675
for all day long

445
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:47,425
until we do it right.

446
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:50,550
And others like standing on one foot,

447
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,775
cutting our hair,

448
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,375
Thomas Flare, etc.

449
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,275
It’s so scary

450
00:22:58,575 --> 00:22:59,875
that I’m already starving.

451
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:01,450
Look, Qiyi,

452
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,575
I’m going to buy some breakfast.

453
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:03,850
You can

454
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,275
shudder in fear alone here.

455
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,075
Could you open up sooner?

456
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:19,750
We have a problem.

457
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,500
The freshmen...

458
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,775
Comrade,

459
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:23,250
bliss or doom,

460
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:24,400
it’s all fate.

461
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,575
What will happen will happen.

462
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,600
The freshmen are required
to gather downstairs.

463
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,625
I’m a senior student of performing arts.

464
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,075
I’m Ma Xiangyu.

465
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,300
Let me tell you.

466
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,100
The SUA has a few traditions.

467
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,850
First, treasure sharing.

468
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,825
Senior,

469
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,325
what’s treasure sharing?

470
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,350
Be quiet!

471
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,575
Why don’t you tell me?

472
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,925
Senior,

473
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,250
my family has a piece of jade.

474
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,525
But I cannot give it to you.

475
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,075
The treasure I mean is
the four fundamentals,

476
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,725
your strengths.

477
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,175
In SUA,

478
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,850
you should be generous with your talent.

479
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:06,900
You ought to share with us

480
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,125
and show us.

481
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,475
What is this?

482
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,300
It’s still on my foot.

483
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,150
I think the phone is older than you.

484
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,300
Dude, your foot

485
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,450
is unbelievably steady.

486
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,150
I’m sorry.

487
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,050
I...

488
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,200
It’s OK.

489
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,550
Never mind.

490
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,375
Sorry, sorry.

491
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,500
It wasn’t my intention.

492
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,125
Never mind.

493
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,125
Leave it.

494
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:53,350
You must be freshmen.

495
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,875
Yes.

496
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,325
I’m from the class of performing arts.

497
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,150
So is she.

498
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:57,975
Really?

499
00:24:58,225 --> 00:24:59,825
I’m a senior in performing arts.

500
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,225
Really?

501
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:01,750
Yeah.

502
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,525
Nice to meet you.

503
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:04,375
Nice to meet you, too.

504
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,425
If you need any help,

505
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:07,425
just say the word.

506
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:08,175
Great.

507
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:09,075
- Thanks.
- OK.

508
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,850
Alright, I should go clean up.

509
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,725
Mm-hmm.

510
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:12,225
Bye!

511
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:13,875
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

512
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:19,175
She’s so nice.

513
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,350
Well, let’s call it a day.

514
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,050
The three who haven’t gotten
your student passes, stay.

515
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,900
We forgot our student passes.

516
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:07,850
What?

517
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:13,825
What did I tell you?

518
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,600
You’re back.

519
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,425
Yeah.

520
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,350
Have you had breakfast?

521
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,475
Not yet.

522
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,625
Qiyi,

523
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,300
I wanna take a nap.

524
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
Don’t wake me up.

525
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:35,950
Go have breakfast on your own.

526
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:40,250
Bai Qiao.

527
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,150
Yeah.

528
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,800
Where were you last night?

529
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,300
I went to see a friend.

530
00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:48,325
I saw him driving you back.

531
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:49,150
Yeah.

532
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,750
He drove me back.

533
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:52,125
Bai Qiao,

534
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,550
next time before you go out alone

535
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,750
to drink,

536
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:56,975
let me know.

537
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:57,500
Qiyi,

538
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,975
I feel dizzy.

539
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,325
I have to get some sleep.

540
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,775
What did I tell you?

541
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:18,325
You said...

542
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:18,900
Sanshang.

543
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,025
Senior,

544
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,875
look,

545
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,425
you’re senior

546
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:26,450
to all of us.

547
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,475
Please forgive us.

548
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,275
Forgive?

549
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,000
For what?

550
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,125
You’re gonna

551
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,350
distribute leaflets for me.

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
If you don’t distribute all of them,

553
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,950
forget about getting these back.

554
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,450
OK.

555
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,575
Let’s go to the Student Affairs
for a replacement.

556
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:44,400
Come on.

557
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,050
Go back.

558
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,900
You know,

559
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:54,150
we came to SUA a year earlier than you.

560
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,500
It’s disrespectful

561
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:59,575
to leave like this.

562
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:00,675
Senior,

563
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:01,975
don’t be angry.

564
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,475
We’ll do it. OK?

565
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,075
We’re newcomers.

566
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:07,900
Stay low.

567
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,500
If you don’t want to do it,

568
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I’ll do it for you.

569
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,525
By the way,

570
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,400
put on the costumes.

571
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,650
Do you have to do this?

572
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,150
Sanshang!

573
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,800
Sanshang!

574
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:04,275
Let’s go. Come on.

575
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,300
Be careful.

576
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,555
- Careful.
- Here he comes again.

577
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,925
Wanna go? Have you finished?

578
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,025
What do you want?

579
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:12,325
You haven’t finished.

580
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,025
Do you have any respect for rules?

581
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,000
Don’t you see my friend fell?

582
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,300
It’s no big deal.

583
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,075
As one of our school traditions,

584
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,100
no one lags behind.

585
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,875
You can’t go until the work is done.

586
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:25,525
Move!

587
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:28,325
Boys,

588
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,325
I was starving and weak last time,

589
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:32,175
so you took the upper hand.

590
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,325
But today, it’s not gonna be so simple.

591
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,275
Guys.

592
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,600
Fang Yan. Fang Yan.

593
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,050
Fang Yan.

594
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,150
Senior, look.

595
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,900
You’re a generous man.

596
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:44,625
I’ll buy you

597
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,275
ten Haagen-Dazs ice cream balls.

598
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,825
Cut the nonsense out.

599
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:49,750
What do you want?

600
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:50,850
- What do you want?
- What is this?

601
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,750
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

602
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,125
Are you gonna fight?

603
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,925
Are you gonna fight?

604
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:55,800
Answer me!

605
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:57,375
No, no, no.

606
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,100
We’re building bond.

607
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,800
Then build it in your dormitory.

608
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,500
Ten ice cream balls.

609
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,400
No problem.

610
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,000
- Come with us.
- Get out of here!

611
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:07,375
Go.

612
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,175
Come on, lean on me.

613
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,450
Doctor.

614
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,275
Doctor.

615
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:25,975
Yeah.

616
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:26,875
Be careful.

617
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,500
I... I need something for the cold.

618
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,925
Doctor,

619
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:31,725
my friend is injured.

620
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,850
