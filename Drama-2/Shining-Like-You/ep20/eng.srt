Qiyi.

25
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,180
I wanna talk with you.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,980
It’s too late today.

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,500
We may...

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,700
You two may talk.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,220
I’m going upstairs.

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,460
Bye.

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,820
Go ahead.

32
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,180
Can we talk over there?

33
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,260
Kaixin.

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,500
What brings you here?

35
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,420
If you don’t forgive me,

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,340
I won’t leave.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,860
I hate you.

38
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,220
I won’t leave then.

39
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,460
You say you hate me.
That means you don’t.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,620
You ask me to leave,
but you don’t mean that.

41
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,780
Sanshang.

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,940
What brings you here?

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,275
What happened to you two?

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,275
Ouch.

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,300
Are you alright?

46
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,860
Qiyi.

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,940
We haven’t talked

48
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,500
like this

49
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,460
for a while.

50
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:07,975
Um.

51
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,780
I actually have nothing to talk about.

52
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,940
I just wanna sit with you for a while.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,830
Um.

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,740
Qiyi.

55
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,500
Stop thinking about

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,540
what happened at the site.

57
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,740
I’m fine.

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,820
Are you dating Fang Yan?

59
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,060
I think,

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,380
you asked for it.

61
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,100
What could I do?

62
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,180
Those kids are driving me crazy.

63
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,660
I had a nightmare last night.

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,460
They became little demons and bit me.

65
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,300
I’m tortured by kids in class,

66
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,700
and lectured by the principal
after class.

67
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,060
Look. He lectured me until now.

68
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,940
So why do you go there?

69
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,340
I just wanna make some money.

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,580
And my residence issue can be settled

71
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,780
if I formally become a teacher.

72
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,540
But you shouldn’t

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,460
have classes with Xiaoyu.

74
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,420
You even rehearsed the Sleeping Beauty.

75
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,620
In my opinion,

76
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,740
the punch by Kaixin

77
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,940
is a light punishment already.

78
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,580
If I knew she’d be upset,

79
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,500
I wouldn’t do that rehearsal.

80
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,580
It’s alright.

81
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,900
Don’t worry.

82
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,580
Come.

83
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,100
Let’s have some drinks.

84
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,725
Let’s go.

85
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,420
Fang Yan.

86
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,420
What do you think

87
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,940
should I do?

88
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,540
What should you do?

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,860
It’s simple.

90
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,900
Just apologize if it’s your fault.

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,020
Even if it’s not,

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,820
you should still apologize.

93
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,620
Listen to me.

94
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,860
Girls are different from us.

95
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,740
They tend to be jealous.

96
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,260
If Qiyi is with another man,

97
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,020
will you be jealous?

98
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,660
Why should I?

99
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,020
You are kidding.

100
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,580
I am

101
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,980
popular with girls.

102
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,940
I like you,

103
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,500
maybe because I’m short-sighted.

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,620
You are blind.

105
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,940
Yeah, I’m blind.

106
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
It’s so late.

107
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,180
Haven’t you slept?

108
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,020
I’m chatting with Qiyi.

109
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,420
Am I in your way?

110
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,860
What is it? I’m in.

111
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,980
Since you have time to chat,

112
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,660
you should ask Qiyi

113
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,340
why she was upset today.

114
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,620
Since you have time to care about her,

115
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,340
you’d better think about
your play tomorrow.

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,340
OK. I’m going to sleep.

117
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,650
- Qiyi.
- Qiyi.

118
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,580
What?

119
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,740
I am really sleepy.

120
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,180
I gotta get up early tomorrow.

121
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,020
It’s 11:00 PM.

122
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,060
I’m going to sleep.

123
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,660
You said you’d drink with me.

124
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,620
I’ll go with you if he won’t.

125
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,380
Who said I wouldn’t?

126
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,820
Let’s go together.

127
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,980
Go.

128
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,500
Coming.

129
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,700
Lotus seed porridge.

130
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,740
It’s nutritious,

131
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,100
and can bring you good luck.

132
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,660
Stop quarreling, guys.

133
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,900
Have the porridge.

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,340
What did you mean by that?

135
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,620
What...

136
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,500
What do you mean?

137
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,980
You know what I mean.

138
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,420
I don’t know what you mean.

139
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,580
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,300
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

141
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,500
You went too far.

142
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
Do you know it?

143
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,580
Did I?

144
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,180
You promised me
you wouldn’t pursue Qiyi.

145
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,100
You broke your promise.

146
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,780
It’s her choice, not up to me.

147
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,980
Qiyi has told me

148
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,540
you two are not together.

149
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,540
I thought you could do better.

150
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,140
Tell me.

151
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
What do you want?

152
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,580
Do you dare to drink with me again?

153
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,020
Who gets drunk, who loses.

154
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,020
Who cowers, who is a bastard.

155
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,700
Sir.

156
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,820
One box of beer.

157
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,060
Two boxes!

158
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,140
You come to drink with me.

159
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,060
Three boxes!

160
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,980
Gosh.

161
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,380
Why did I have such a shameless dream?

162
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,060
Buddy.

163
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,460
Buddy.

164
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,460
Du.

165
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,460
We’ve been through weal and woe.

166
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,580
What’s mine is yours.

167
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,340
Buddy.

168
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Qiyi

169
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,340
is mine,

170
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,340
isn’t she?

171
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,100
Yes.

172
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,860
Mine.

173
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,820
Du.

174
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,780
Lu Qiyi.

175
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,620
She is your...

176
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,580
She’s mine.

177
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,220
Go away.

178
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,380
She’s mine.

179
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,580
Qiyi. Qiyi.

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,900
(Nancheng Shunlian
Real Estate Co., Ltd.)

195
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,220
(House Lease Contract
Lessor: Huang Haiguang Lessee: Bai Qiao)

196
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,900
I’ve reviewed the contract.

197
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,420
This company is indeed illegal.

198
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,420
We’ve received many reports,

199
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,940
and handled it many times.

200
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,380
Now they cheat for money again.

201
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,540
Sir.

202
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,620
I didn’t lie to you.

203
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,980
I’ve never rented the house out.

204
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,940
I don’t know that company

205
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,300
you mentioned.

206
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,220
But...

207
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,140
I’ve paid the rent.

208
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,100
What is it to do with me?

209
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,140
You didn’t pay me.

210
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,940
Ma’am, you don’t know them.

211
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,380
How did they get your key?

212
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,220
I wanna ask that as well.

213
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,820
My house was suspended for some time.

214
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,940
Days ago, my neighbor told me

215
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,660
the lights were on.

216
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,740
That confused me.

217
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,140
Today I came

218
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,380
and found two people in my house.

219
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,980
Ma’am.

220
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,580
This girl got cheated.

221
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,940
She’s so poor.

222
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,860
Just let her stay for one night.

223
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,700
No.

224
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,940
Absolutely not.

225
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,820
She can go to a hotel.

226
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,780
We’ll move.

227
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,860
Mom.

228
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,460
Sorry.

229
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,100
I got you to suffer with me.

230
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,740
It’s fine.

231
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,300
It’s about dawn.

232
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,220
It’ll be fine at dawn.

233
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
It’s alright.

234
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,180
Mom.

235
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,940
I’m so useless.

236
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,500
I can’t even find you a residence.

237
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,580
You have to suffer with me.

238
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,100
Don’t cry, my girl.

239
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,180
Don’t cry.

240
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,780
Don’t cry.

241
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,900
Bella.

242
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,300
I’ll go back to my hometown. Alright?

243
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,860
I’m fine now.

244
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,220
I can find a job in my hometown.

245
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,780
No.

246
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,980
Mom.

247
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,940
Believe me.

248
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,340
You still have me.

249
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,420
Tomorrow I’ll borrow money
from friends.

250
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,460
I’ll make money and pay them back.

251
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,060
Everything will be fine.

252
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:12,150
(Sanshang)

253
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,140
Mom.

254
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,980
Mom.

255
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,780
Mom.

256
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,380
Where did you go?

257
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,580
You scared me!

258
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,740
Are you alright?

259
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
I’m fine.

260
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,100
Things here are too expensive.

261
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,540
I went to buy you some food,

262
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,020
but I didn’t take money.

263
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,860
Tell me next time. I’ll go instead.

264
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,020
I won’t get lost.

265
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,140
Are you cold?

266
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,860
Here. Put it on.

267
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,500
I’m not cold.

268
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,100
I’m not cold.

269
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,540
Come. Sit down.

270
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,500
Qiyi.

271
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,980
Ms. Tang.

272
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,620
Senior.

273
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,180
Qiyi.

274
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
I come to see you guys.

275
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,540
How is your crew life?

276
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,700
Everything is good.

277
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,940
Your face looks thin.

278
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,140
Do you have much work?

279
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,940
Not very much.

280
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,100
The blood vest is well made.

281
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,540
Where is Mr. Sun?

282
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
He’s at the site.

283
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,260
Okay.

284
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,620
We’re going to him.

285
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,500
You may get prepared.

286
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,100
Okay.

287
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,060
This is for you.

288
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,860
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

289
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,660
We’re leaving.

290
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,660
Goodbye, Ms. Tang.

291
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,420
Goodbye, Senior.

292
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,180
Hi, Bai Qiao.

293
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,140
Hi, Qiyi.

294
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,060
Qiyi.

295
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,820
How is your play going?

296
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,500
Pretty good.

297
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,260
How are you doing?

298
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,750
I’m fine.

299
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,500
Well.

300
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,660
Could you lend me some money?

301
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,380
Sure.

302
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,780
How much do you need? Tell me.

303
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,860
5,000,

304
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,020
or less if you don’t have that much.

305
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,260
Bai Qiao, I don’t really have that much.

306
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,940
Can you take 2,000 for now?

307
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,060
I’ll find a way for the other 3,000.

308
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,100
Okay.

309
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,500
Thanks.

310
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,220
Did something happen to you?

311
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,300
I’m fine.

312
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,740
I’ll talk to you later.

313
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,780
Qiyi.

314
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,940
Please keep it a secret for me.

315
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,220
Rest assured.

316
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,700
I’m hanging up then.

317
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,020
Take care.

318
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,620
Bye.

319
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,300
What are you watching?

320
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,220
Art students are dancing.

321
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,140
It’s wonderful.

322
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,140
You watch it every day.

323
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,660
I think,

324
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,540
life is more fun than plays.

325
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,860
How so?

326
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,380
Not to mention

327
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,780
the gossips of the stars.

328
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,060
Even the supporting actors

329
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,020
would pay any price

330
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,180
to gain more shots

331
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,220
in a play.

332
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,260
These things can make over ten dramas.

333
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,180
Listen.

334
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,700
Yesterday,

335
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,220
an actress

336
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,820
paid me 50 yuan

337
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,660
to drive another actress

338
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
to a place

339
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,900
where there was no taxi.

340
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,660
Is it true?

341
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,740
Of course.

342
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,300
That actress couldn’t return.

343
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,780
So the actress who paid me

344
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,220
could act in her stead.

345
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,260
Right?

346
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,940
I think

347
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,660
life is more fun than plays.

348
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,940
What are you doing?

349
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,620
You’ll be fined 2,000 yuan

350
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,700
if you play games here.

351
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,580
Tieniu.

352
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,020
Coming. Director.

353
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,060
Take them to change clothes.

354
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,260
Yes.

355
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,900
Come with me.

356
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,420
Hurry.

357
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,420
Qiyi.

358
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,020
Stand behind me when filming.

359
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,300
Don’t block the camera from me.

360
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,460
Ladies.

361
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,860
Ready to get into the water.

362
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,300
Director.

363
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,140
Qinqin feels unwell.

364
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,900
She can’t get into the water.

365
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,620
Are you unwell?

366
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,060
Director, I’m fine.

367
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,300
I’m fine.

368
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,100
Qinqin.

369
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,820
You’re having a period.

370
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,060
Yesterday your belly hurt terribly.

371
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,380
You’d better not get into water.

372
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,380
You’ll catch a cold.

373
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:19,540
Director...

374
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,500
So troublesome.

375
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,420
Director.

376
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,660
Something is wrong with an actress.

377
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,500
Miss Song feels unwell
and can’t get into the water.

378
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,940
Okay.

379
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,420
Well,

380
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,100
it’s fine. Go take a rest.

381
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,780
Xiaolan can say the lines instead.

382
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,970
Director, I’m really fine.

383
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,540
You are unwell.

384
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,260
Go get some rest.

385
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,340
Qiyi.

386
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,940
Go through the lines with the director.

387
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,180
- Okay.
- Hurry.

388
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,925
(Prison)
Hurry up! You hear me?

389
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,500
Lu Qiyi.

390
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
Why did you do that?

391
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,020
You know

392
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,700
this play means a lot to me!

393
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,100
Aren’t you having a period?

394
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,220
But you shouldn’t take my place!

395
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,020
The director asked me to do it.

396
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,260
And I did that for your health.

397
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,220
What’s the big deal with a period?

398
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,180
As long as I can act,

399
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,180
I would do anything.

400
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,220
Would you do anything?

401
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,700
Yes.

402
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,340
I would do anything.

403
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,740
Even cheating a friend?

404
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,060
I gotta prepare for it.

405
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,620
Or I won’t act.

406
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
You can’t just leave.

407
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,180
What to do then?

408
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,260
Let the director shoot again?

409
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,780
Qinqin.

410
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,620
I’m honest,

411
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,020
but you shouldn’t bully me.

412
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,900
Let go of me.

413
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,700
Let go of me.

414
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,620
Let go of me.

415
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,660
Stop it.

416
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,020
What are you doing?

417
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,780
It was newly made.

418
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,700
What happened?

419
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,820
Look, director.

420
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,780
It was newly made.

421
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,620
She just sat on it.

422
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,400
So,

423
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,740
Qinqin,

424
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,220
did you cheat Qiyi first?

425
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,180
No, I didn’t.

426
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,980
I admit

427
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,940
I asked her to buy medicine for me.

428
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,180
But I didn’t think

429
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,620
it would take so long.

430
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,940
It was the director who asked me

431
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,660
to act.

432
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,380
You’re lying.

433
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
No, I am not.

434
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,980
Qiyi.

435
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,060
How do you prove that

436
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,300
she is lying?

437
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,700
If I guess it right,

438
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,260
she isn’t having a period.

439
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,580
For such deeds,

440
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,580
an actor shall be fired from the crew.

441
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,980
Thus,

442
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,020
we must

443
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,700
figure out the truth.

444
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,420
I’m really having a period.

445
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,780
I’m not lying.

446
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,020
Take it easy.

447
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,420
We just want the truth.

448
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,420
How is it?

449
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,620
Song Qinqin didn’t lie.

450
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,060
Director.

451
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,225
She’s your student.

452
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Handle it yourself.

453
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,780
Song Qinqin.

454
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,180
You may leave.

455
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,140
See you, sir.

456
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,750
Fang Yan.

457
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,740
How is it going?

458
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,820
It’s all my bad.

459
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,620
Qiyi...

460
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Qiyi is gonna be fired.

461
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,620
Mr. Sun.

462
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,020
Director.

463
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,820
You can’t fire Qiyi.

464
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,300
You may leave first.

465
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,380
We will discuss

466
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,020
and make a decision.

467
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,300
This matter...

468
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,140
Get out!

469
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,980
Qiyi.

470
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,460
I wanna be alone.

471
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,300
See you, sir.

472
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,700
Look at you.

473
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,940
You never free me from worries.

474
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,140
I left for half a day

475
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,260
and now you got in trouble.

476
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,220
It’s fine.

477
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,340
I’m gonna

478
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,380
reason with Mr. Sun.

479
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,700
Did you guys drink last night?

480
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,300
Yes.

481
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,100
I got drunk.

482
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,220
I don’t even know how I went back.

483
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,980
I still have a hangover.

484
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,140
Don’t worry.

485
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,940
Mr. Sun is reluctant to fire you.

486
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,300
If he fires you,

487
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,220
he won’t have a better actress like you.

488
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,380
You know.

489
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,460
I wish I could bear with it.

490
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
As bark is vital to a tree,

491
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,220
so is dignity to a person.

492
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,340
Zimo has told me.

493
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,700
You were very cool today.

494
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,420
You were overwhelming.

495
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,940
You were awesome.

496
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,140
Right?

497
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,100
Well.

498
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,860
You are indeed my woman.

499
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,420
Hey, I’m not!

500
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,940
Alright.

501
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,540
You are Fang’s woman.

502
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,860
Don’t talk nonsense.

503
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,380
Back then,

504
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,780
I thought, as long as I worked hard

505
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,780
and acted well,

506
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,340
people would recognize me.

507
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,260
But in the crew,

508
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,300
I find things are different.

509
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,580
There you go again.

510
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,860
Life is short.

511
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,060
Happiness matters the most.

512
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,500
Why bother thinking that much?

513
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,140
Right?

514
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,620
Moreover,

515
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,900
you are way better than me,

516
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,500
hundreds of times better than me.

517
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,580
You are the supporting role.

518
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,780
You are better than me.

519
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,060
You are mocking me.

520
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,020
I know my ability and limits well.

521
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,220
People don’t say it,

522
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,340
but the whole crew knows it.

523
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,580
They think I pulled some strings.

524
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,500
I didn’t pull any strings.

525
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,860
But I have no idea

526
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,940
how I became the supporting role.

527
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,180
Maybe you are very potential,

528
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,340
like a genius.

529
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,260
Are you praising me?

530
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,900
Yeah.

531
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,540
I’ll take that as a compliment.

532
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,820
I’m hungry.

533
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,060
I’m gonna eat

534
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,820
and take a nap.

535
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,060
There’s an important scene
in the afternoon.

536
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,660
I need to renew my energy.

537
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,500
Stop thinking about that.

538
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,300
Alright?

539
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,060
Go for it.

540
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:41,125
Yeah.

541
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:41,650
Yeah!

542
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,140
Thank you, Du Ang.

543
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,700
Don’t be so polite to me.

544
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:46,815
I’m going.

545
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:47,325
Um.

546
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,540
Go ahead.

547
00:28:48,775 --> 00:28:49,540
Your coat.

548
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,380
Take the coat.

549
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,780
♪White clouds in blue sky♪

550
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,580
♪Below clouds the horses run♪

551
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,740
I don’t wanna nag you,

552
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,980
but you know

553
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,460
Lu Qiyi isn’t that kind of girl.

554
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,980
Why do you keep silent?

555
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,340
I’ll leave if you don’t say anything.

556
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,740
I’m really leaving.

557
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,220
Come.

558
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,060
Sit.

559
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,420
Sit.

560
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,900
If Lu Qiyi is fired,

561
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,340
how will you get
an excellent actress like her?

562
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,460
Ms. Tang.

563
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,420
Director.

564
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
The title page again.

565
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,100
Director.

566
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:00,775
Um.

567
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,420
Anything else?

568
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,060
I don’t think

569
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,300
Qiyi is a liar.

570
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,500
I didn’t say she lied, did I?

571
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,220
So she won’t get fired?

572
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,060
Look.

573
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,660
He’s quite a good senior.

574
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Don’t you see?

575
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,740
Of course she won’t.

576
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,820
Go get back to your business.

577
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,500
Yes.

578
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,180
Director, I’m going to work.

579
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,580
You’re good, Sun.

580
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,375
What’s wrong with you?

581
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,300
Why patting me?

582
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,220
I didn’t see you wrong.

583
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,140
You’re manly.

584
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,180
They were chosen by me.

585
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,900
I’ll surely be responsible for them.

586
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,580
But

587
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,780
what will you do?

588
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,620
Will it be bad for you?

589
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,420
Don’t worry.

590
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,780
This thing

591
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,420
won’t stump me.

592
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,380
What’s the matter?

593
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,980
Look.

594
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,020
Lu Qiyi didn’t lie.

595
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,580
How did you know I’m here?

596
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,100
Did Lu Qiyi tell you?

597
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,140
I sent a WeChat message with her phone.

598
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,700
Liar.

599
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,300
Bai Qiao.

600
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,420
Can you give me one minute?

601
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,740
What’s the matter?

602
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
My mom is waiting for me.

603
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,580
Why do you live in such a place?

604
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,460
Do I have to report everything to you?

605
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,580
Okay.

606
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,380
I won’t ask

607
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,620
if you don’t wanna tell me.

608
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,300
But I know

609
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,180
you’re short of money.

610
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,940
No, thanks.

611
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,340
Take it as help from a friend.

612
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,700
Li Xiao.

613
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,860
Can you do me a favor?

614
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,420
Tell me.

615
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,860
I’m begging you.

616
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,100
Don’t be so kind to me afterwards.

617
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,580
The more you do,

618
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,380
the more fragile I’ll get.

619
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,260
You make me feel

620
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,580
I still have one person to rely on.

621
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,460
But I know,

622
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,660
no one is reliable.

623
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,140
You can rely on me.

624
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,140
Bai Qiao.

625
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,660
Can you give me another chance?

626
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,780
Senior.

627
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,620
I have no time

628
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,980
for your miserable acting.

629
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,620
Sorry.

630
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,460
My mom is waiting for me.

631
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,340
Don’t come to me anymore.

632
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,575
Yesterday

633
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,125
an actress

634
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,300
paid me 50 yuan

635
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,780
to drive another actress

636
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,060
to a place

637
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,220
where there was no taxi.

638
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,300
Is it true?

639
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,380
Of course.

640
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,620
That actress couldn’t return in time.

641
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,780
So the actress who paid me

642
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,260
could act in her stead.

643
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,060
This thing ends here.

644
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,780
Don’t mention it ever again.

645
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,740
You may leave.

646
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,540
See you, Miss.

647
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,700
See you, director.

648
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,060
Now I’m relieved.

649
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,000
I’m going.

650
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,180
Are you really going?

651
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,060
Listen.

652
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,860
Zhang Yang said
the song has been finished.

653
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,780
But it was Wang Hai who contacted him.

654
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:40,525
Oh.

655
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,300
I’ll tell a new producer to handle it.

656
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,060
Good.

657
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,740
Bye.

658
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,420
Bye-bye.

659
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,060
Zhang Yang, right?

660
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,625
Yes.

661
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

662
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:04,020
Please sit.

663
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,580
I ordered this for you.

664
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,225
Thanks.

665
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:07,820
What about you?

666
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,700
I won’t drink.

667
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,780
I’ve listened to the song.

668
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
It’s very good.

669
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,340
Ms. Tang said you’re a music genius.

670
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
You live up to your reputation.

671
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,180
I’m flattered.

672
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,180
Are you content with the music style?

673
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,740
The style is up to the director.

674
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,940
Today,

675
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,740
I come to talk about another thing.

676
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,860
Please go ahead.

677
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,900
I wasn’t the producer before.

678
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,260
I came to this crew not long ago.

679
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,620
So I don’t know well

680
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,060
about the details.

681
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,380
I’d like to know

682
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,420
what Wang Hai talked about with you.

683
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,340
The pay wasn’t detailed,

684
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,860
but I could have my signature.

685
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,060
The pay won’t be a problem.

686
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,980
Rest assured.

687
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,540
But...

688
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,500
But you can’t have the signature.

689
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,020
Why?

690
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,100
Here’s the thing.

691
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,060
Before Wang Hai came to you,

692
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
we had already contracted

693
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,180
with a famous composer.

694
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,580
So, we don’t know why Wang Hai

695
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,220
still contacted you.

696
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,500
But I’ve listened and it’s a good song.

697
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,500
If the director agrees,

698
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,180
we can consider buying it.

699
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,500
I don’t want money.

700
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,020
I just want my name on it.

701
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,620
It’s just a song.

702
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,020
Isn’t it a good deal

703
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,220
to trade your song

704
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,860
for a future platform and resources?

705
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,300
How is it?

706
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,260
Would you think about it?

707
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,700
Mr. Liu.

708
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,820
I’m sorry, but no.

709
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,780
If I compromise this time,

710
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,300
I’d always compromise in the future.

711
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,420
The opportunity hasn’t come.

712
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,660
That means I’m not ready yet.

713
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,980
I’ll work harder and do better.

714
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,860
