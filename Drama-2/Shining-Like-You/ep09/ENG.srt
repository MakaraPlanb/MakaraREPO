Qiyi.

25
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:54,150
I was hot-headed in the morning.

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,625
Don’t take it personally.

27
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,125
Since when does my pal
start to apologize?

28
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,575
Put the music on.

29
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,850
I disagree.

30
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:15,900
Li Xiao,

31
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,325
I know it’s not right.

32
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,475
But

33
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:20,900
there’s nothing else I can do.

34
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:22,875
Bai Qiao,

35
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,000
are you hiding something from me?

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,050
I told you I couldn’t do this.

37
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,600
The participants in this competition

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,300
are all musical-loving students
across the country.

39
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,625
It’s a fair competition.

40
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,575
It’s no longer a fair game.

41
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,475
What do you mean?

42
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,025
Lu Qiyi has already approached Mr. Sun.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,175
Du Ang is also canvassing support
for her.

44
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,175
Is it fair for them to do that?

45
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:46,950
Li Xiao,

46
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,600
we can win.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,875
But I can’t even take
the first step now.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,525
Please, Li Xiao.

49
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,225
I can’t agree.

50
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,050
I need the scholarship for the winner.

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,275
What’s wrong?

52
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:16,525
Are you OK?

53
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:19,750
Hurry!

54
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:20,950
Come on.

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,550
Get up. Sit.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
I’ll get you some ice packs.

57
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,500
You were so careless.

58
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,350
If a girl seldom comes back to her dorm,

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,125
it means she’s with a man.

60
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,650
Unfortunately,

61
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,375
there’s a 99.9 percent chance

62
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,600
that the man is Li Xiao.

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,525
No way!

64
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,075
Hey!

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,625
What are you gonna do?

66
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:37,025
Put it down.

67
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:41,250
Be a good girl.

68
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:03,700
Bai Qiao,

69
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,175
I posted the message about you.

70
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,025
I’m so sorry.

71
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,825
I already knew it.

72
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,525
Then why did you turn against Qiyi?

73
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,800
Does it have anything to do with you?

74
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,400
Anyway, it’s my fault.

75
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,475
I’m really...

76
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,225
Zhao Jie,

77
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,975
think about who to vote for tomorrow.

78
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:07,925
Qiyi,

79
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,975
I’ve invited your father

80
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,950
to the Musical Festival.

81
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,850
He said he’d never watched you perform,

82
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,125
and didn’t know if you’d do great
in performance.

83
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:18,925
As to whether you’ll stay or not,

84
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,500
it all depends on your performance.

85
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,525
Qiyi,

86
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,275
if you don’t act now,

87
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,625
you’ll lose the competition.

88
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,325
Qiyi,

89
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:48,200
is your foot better?

90
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,275
Much better.

91
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,175
Good luck.

92
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,175
Qiyi,

93
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,675
tell me the time and location on WeChat.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
I’ll go and watch.

95
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,000
Hello, sir.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,025
I’m Zouyang Zimo
from the School of Directing.

97
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,450
May I join your class today?

98
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,425
Sure.

99
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,125
Take a seat.

100
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,925
Thank you, sir.

101
00:07:35,675 --> 00:07:36,600
Are you ready?

102
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,400
Qiyi,

103
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,050
how about

104
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:43,650
we quit the lift today?

105
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,325
I’m good.

106
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,050
Let’s stick to the plan.

107
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,000
We made a deal.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,275
Don’t vote for Qiyi.

109
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:55,375
Hey,

110
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:57,025
who will you vote for?

111
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,900
Whoever is the best dancer.

112
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:02,150
Vote for Qiyi.

113
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,225
Sanshang,

114
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,125
how’s it going?

115
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:07,675
It seems the wire is broken.

116
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
Sir,

117
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:11,975
the wire is broken.

118
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,700
I’ll go to the supermarket and buy one.

119
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,100
I’ll go with Sanshang.

120
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,925
Kaixin,

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,200
can you hurry up?

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,825
We’ll make it on time.

123
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,000
I want some juice.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,150
Just a second.

125
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,375
Be right back.

126
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:31,975
Sanshang.

127
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,650
Hi!

128
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,625
It’s been a long time.

129
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,725
You know,

130
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,375
I’ve been so busy lately

131
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,625
that I didn’t have time to go to you.

132
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:41,625
Sanshang,

133
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,725
what are you talking about
with my girlfriend?

134
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,125
Oh, Sanshang,

135
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:48,875
are you free this afternoon?

136
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,975
- I’d like to...
- I have plans.

137
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:50,800
I have to go.

not to tell the others?

180
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,325
I haven’t agreed yet.

181
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,300
Think about who to vote for tomorrow.

182
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:07,800
Sir, I abstain.

183
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,275
Why?

184
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,425
I’m sorry.

185
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,250
I posted the defaming message
about Bai Qiao.

186
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:28,550
I know it has caused

187
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,050
a lot of trouble for everyone,

188
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,525

191
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,475
But here in SUA,

192
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,575
I realize I’m nothing.

193
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,700
No matter how hard I tried,

194
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,100
I’m still poorer.

195
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,050
No one would notice me.

196
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:57,200
The competition is so fierce

197
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,075
that I can’t breathe.

198
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,725
I’m...

199
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,825
I’m really suffering.

200
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,400
And I don’t know

201
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,475
why I did such a thing.

202
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:06,975
I...

203
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,175
I’m really sorry.

204
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,625
I know you may not forgive me.

205
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,600
But I still wanna ask you all

206
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,825
to give me a chance.

207
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:20,025
I won’t do it again.

208
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:21,875
I’m truly sorry. Sorry.

209
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:25,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

210
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,875
this is our normal life,

211
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:32,700
which fans grievance.

212
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,925
To make long-term achievements,

213
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
in addition to hard work,

214
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,600
you need to keep
your original aspiration.

215
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,675
Only by that can your dream be realized.

216
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,225
What’s more,

217
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,650
respect for each of your opponents.

218
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:56,175
Because they will make you stronger.

219
00:16:58,925 --> 00:16:59,525
Zhao Jie,

220
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:01,125
you can go back.

221
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:02,225
Thank you, sir.

222
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,475
Mr. Sun,

223
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,300
you haven’t voted.

224
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,750
Right.

225
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,775
Mr. Sun,

226
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,450
be the tiebreaker.

227
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,775
OK.

(Lu Qiyi 7)

230
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,500
Bai Qiao was perfect in technique.

231
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,550
But the key to performance

232
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,475
is sincere emotion.

233
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:59,850
So I voted for Lu Qiyi.

234
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,875
(Li Xiao: I didn’t expect this result.)

00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,325
(If you need money, I can help you.)

236
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,400
I’ll wire the money in a few days.

237
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,050
OK, I got it.

238
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,050
Don’t worry.

239
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,175
I promise I’ll wire the money.

240
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,875
OK.

I’m not an expert in dance or music.

300
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,000
So I won’t

301
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:27,525
comment on technique.

302
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,175
But in terms of the performance,

303
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,600
I can only give you a 59.

304
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,850
Why?

305
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,725
Why?

306
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,275
I can tell

307
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,450
you and your partner

308
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,825
intended to present a love story.

309
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,250
But from your eyes,

310
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,400
I couldn’t see love.

311
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:54,725

312
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,625

313
00:26:56,775 --> 00:27:00,700
hugging, holding hands and locking eyes

314
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,375
are enough.

315
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,825
But what touches the audience

316
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,825
are your sincerity and the details.

317
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:18,875
In front of your loved girl,

318
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,650
do you dare look into her eyes?

320
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:30,200
Will your heart race?

321
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,075
You don’t feel this love.

322
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,525
How can you convince us?

323
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,500
What do you think?

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,100
I also think

326
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,250
your female partner’s performance

327
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,700
is more appealing.

328
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,350
She’s not as skillful as you,

329
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:54,325
but

330
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:56,800

332
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,825

The taxi is here.

379
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:00,125
Let me see you out.

380
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:01,550
It’s OK.

381
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,300
Qiyi,

382
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,425
call home when your money runs low.

383
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,450
Don’t stay up late at night.

384
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:19,800
Go to bed early.

385
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:25,375
Goodbye.

386
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:38,175
Qiyi,

387
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,625
don’t worry about it.

388
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,600
Dads love their daughters.

389
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,075
I’m sure he’ll let you stay.

390
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:47,425
It’s no longer in my hands now.

391
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:50,550
Hey,

392
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,300
do you know what happened to Sanshang?

393
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:55,025
He’s out of love.

394
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:56,950
It’s all because of that Xiaoyu.

395
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,400
She’s never taken Sanshang
as her boyfriend.

396
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,200
She exploited Sanshang’s feelings

397
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,725
and shamelessly called it
to experience life.

398
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:07,400
How infuriating!

399
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,075
I mean why Mr. Sun wants
to see Sanshang.

400
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,500
He didn’t answer the phone.

401
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,500
Well, in that case,

402
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:15,600
he must have missed it.

403
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:17,875
Mr. Sun isn’t a human trafficker.

404
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,775
Kaixin,

405
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,425
do you know what you need most?

406
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,500
Yes.

407
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,925
Womanliness.

408
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:25,500
No.

409
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:26,375
Intelligence.

00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:34,025

420

Cool!

421
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,800
Sanshang

422
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,225
has made great progress.

423
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:08,300
Though some flaws
in the points of articulation,

424
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,025
his presence was great.

425
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:12,925
Next week,

426
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,700
you’re going to take the mid-term exam.

427
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,000
I’d like to highlight

428
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,350
a few points about the mid-term exam.

429
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,125
First...

430
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:23,850
Excuse me,

431
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Ms. Zhang.

432
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:28,175
Sanshang, come out with me.

433
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,450
Come on. Let’s go.

434
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,687
Unless you want to be photographed
by the paparazzi,

435
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:09,825
get in the car.

436
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,150
I’ve got something for you and your mom.

437
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:23,975
No, thanks.

438
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,300
I bought

439
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:30,025
these clothes abroad.

440
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,625
All the kind you young people like.

441
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,025
If there’s nothing else,

442
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:36,375
I have to go.

443
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,325
What?

444
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:43,875
Still mad about yesterday?

445
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,750
Feeling embarrassed

446
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:49,125
about being criticized in public?

447
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:51,675
Fang Yan.

448
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,875
Don’t be a child.

449
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,225
Fang Yan!

450
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,925
Qiyi.

451
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:01,500
Yes?

452
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,525
Where are you going?

453
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,950
To the library.

454
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,175
How can you focus

455
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:06,350
on the study at this moment?

456
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,125
Sanshang is missing.

457
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,775
It’s not that serious.

458
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:13,200
Should I ask Xiaoyu about it?

459
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,250
I think you should

460
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,625
call Mr. Sun first.

461
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,300
Yeah.

462
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,700
Mr. Sun.

463
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:23,825
Sanshang.

464
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:26,175
Hello?

465
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:26,825
Li Sanshang.

466
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:27,425
You...

467
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,925
Sanshang’s dad passed away.

468
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:46,675
He said

469
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:48,975
he’s dropping out of school.

470
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,075
What the heck is on Li Sanshang’s mind?

471
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,350
He asked me to help him pack up.

472
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,975
I knew something was wrong.

473
00:38:33,975 --> 00:38:34,550
No,

474
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,750
we can’t let Sanshang
drop out like this.

475
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,475
Don’t be frustrated.

476
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:55,325
We’ll work out something.

477
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,650
Yeah.

478
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,225
Let’s think about where Sanshang can go

479
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,025
and go looking for him.

480
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,525
Sanshang’s gone home.

481
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:16,575
He’s grieving.

482
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,900
Could he do anything stupid?

483
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:20,850
Don’t scare yourself.

484
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,575
Kaixin,

485
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,050
is Sanshang’s home far from here?

486
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,575
No.

487
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,350
I’ve searched for it.

488
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,300
It’s only 200 km away.

489
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,075
Then let’s go.

490
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:32,775
It’ll take

491
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:33,800
at least 2, 3 hours to get there.

492
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,625
Alright. Let’s go.

493
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:35,325
