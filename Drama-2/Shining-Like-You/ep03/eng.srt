Mr. Sun is caught up with something,

39
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,250
so I’m filling in for him.

I’m a senior

41
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,175
and your TA.

42
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,975

We’re having this class meeting

49
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,225
to elect a monitor

50
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:14,250
who’ll be in charge of
all the class activities.

51
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,650

Li Xiao,

53
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,525
I nominate Lu Qiyi.

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,525
She’s perfect for the job.

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,125
Any objections or other nominees?

56
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,975
Good choice, I gotta say.

57
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,225
Her college entrance exam score

58
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,900
is over 640/750,

59
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,275
ranking first in our school.

60
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,675
Monitor, please take the class

61
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:47,700
to collect your textbooks later.

62
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:50,400
Enjoy the next four years

63
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,075
and make best of yourselves!

64
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,150
On top of that,

65
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,125
carry on our school’s proud tradition,

66
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,100
that is, art for art’s sake.

67
00:04:58,725 --> 00:04:59,825
Stick to your profession.

68
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:02,575
Dismissed.

69
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,225

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,625
I’m on my way to pick up something.

73
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,750
Are you avoiding me?

74
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,250
No.

75
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,750
Unexpectedly,

76
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,000
we end up in the same university.

77
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:33,350
Yeah.

78
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,900
Sorry,

79
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,325
please excuse me.

80
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,325
I gotta go.

81
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:09,300
Qiyi.

82
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:13,800
You got guts

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
that you messed with a senior.

84
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey, look,

85
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,875
who tore up

86
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:28,525
those clothes?

87
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:30,675
Stop pretending!

88
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,525
Tell him.

89
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,875

90
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:37,925

91
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:40,650
I saw that it...

92
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:43,125
It was him.

93
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:46,775
Look,

94
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,050
I can stitch them up.

95
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,675
Stitch your lips first.

96
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,025
Calm down.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,750
Hey, man,

98
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,975
it’s all a misunderstanding.

99
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:01,500
Here are 100 bucks.

100
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,525

Mr. Sun,

144
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,825
you know what your students did?

145
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:38,375
This semester has just begun

146
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:39,875
yet we almost lost the cafeteria

147
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,125

159
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,500

160
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,650
Get out.

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,975
where are you going?

197
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,675
Are you taking out trash?

198
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:40,000
Bring me a bag of pads while you’re out.

199
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,750
Why should I buy pads for her?

200
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,775
Why did she use my toner?

201
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,925
Do I look like her takeaway girl?

202
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,675
Why didn’t she bring some for me?

203
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,000
Why is she so mean to me?

204
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:15,725
Are you OK?

205
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,725
Bai Qiao,

206
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,525
am I an oddball?

207
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:24,625
No.

208
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,875
Did anyone say that?

209
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,625
No one likes me.

210
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,975
You’re oversensitive.

211
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:38,525
Qiyi,

212
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,050
our lifestyles are different

213
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,175
and so are our personalities.

214
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:47,125
Those differences do cause

215
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,425
friction among roommates,

216
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,600
you know.

217
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:52,750
Take Hao Kaixin as an example.

218
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,125
She’s direct and bluff

219
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,382
which makes you feel offended sometimes,

220
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,625
but she never means that.

221
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,200
Really?

222
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:03,325
Mhmm.

223
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:05,775
So...

224
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,750
So she’s not acting like that
because she dislikes me?

225
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:15,925
Of course not.

226
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,575
Then again,

227
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,950
if she doesn’t like you,

228
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,500
just treat her the same.

229
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:25,925
Qiyi,

230
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,850
you only need

231
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:29,850
one true friend.

232
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,600
Here, take this.

233
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,950
No, I can’t.

234
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,950
Why?

235
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,775
Take it.

236
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:44,025
Didn’t Hao Kaixin empty your bottle?

237
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:44,600
Come on.

238
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,400
I really can’t.

239
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,325
That’s too nice of you.

240
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,125
I mean it, Bai Qiao.

241
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,175
Alright.

242
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,400
I’ll keep it for you.

243
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,000
You know where it is if you need it.

244
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,050
Thank you.

245
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:55,875
No big deal.

246
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,425
Let’s go.

247
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:58,125
Come on.

248
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:03,700
(Kaixin: Orientation
at Basketball Center. Now!)

249
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,700
What are you?

250
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,250
What’s that thing you’re wearing?

251
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,925
What’s on your flip-flops?

252
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,225
Curse dolls.

253
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,975
They’re for bullies.

254
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
How old are you?

255
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,925
Dress like an adult!

256
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,275
Hello.

257
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,725
We met this morning.

258
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:41,400
Don’t pretend we’re close.

259
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,900
Are all the girls

260
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,200
in the acting class here?

261
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:49,050
No.

262
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,025
Lu Qiyi and Bai Qiao aren’t.

263
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,500
We asked you to come over

264
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,975
to get to know you

265
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,325
and your potential.

266
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,600
OK.

267
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:09,200
Now,

268
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,450
you’re gonna show us what you got.

269
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,225
You may leave

270
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:14,300
if you nail it.

271
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,100
Not bad.

272
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,375
Wait over there.

273
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,325
Next.

274
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:31,350
♪Yo♪

275
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,275
♪Descendants of the mountains Yo♪

276
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,050
What the hell?

277
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,025
Are you choking me?

278
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:42,725
Strangling me?

279
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,475
Jerk face!

280
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,454
Let go of me!

281
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,500
Want me still?

282
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,075
Impossible!

283
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,925
Unless you’re dead!

284
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:55,850
You may begin.

285
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,325
Hold on!

286
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,100
Why don’t you

287
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,825
tell us a joke?

288
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:09,975
We could get some laughs.

289
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,050
Anything will do.

290
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:14,975
Think carefully.

291
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,000
One day, two bananas were strolling.

292
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,450
The front one felt hot

293
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,375
and took off its jacket.

294
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,950
Then the other one slipped and fell.

295
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,950
Qiyi,

296
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,550
so two bananas, huh?

297
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,450
Bananas. That’s funny.

298
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:02,050
Good.

299
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,225
You nailed it,

300
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,475
so off you go.

301
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,900
Seriously?

302
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:07,325
That was lousy!

303
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:12,025
OK.

304
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,825
Next.

305
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,875
What can you do?

306
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,350
She’s a national champion
of martial arts.

307
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:25,925
Impressive!

308
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,700
Show us a few moves.

309
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,000
I’m having that thing.

310
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,700
- What thing?
- What?

311
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:38,650
Floods.

312
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:40,000
Floods?

313
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,675
Women’s thing.

314
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:42,450
That time of the month.

315
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,450
Period?

316
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:44,175
Yep.

317
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:47,075
Stand straight.

318
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,800
You were perfectly fine this morning,

319
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,925
and now you’re sick?

320
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,050
Who can prove it?

321
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,000
Anyone?

322
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,150
I can.

323
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,625
I was buying pads for her just now.

324
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:23,900
When I become a senior,

325
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,625
I won’t torture new students.

326
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,425
Qiyi,

327
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,700
why did they ask us to stay

328
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,225
and let everyone else go?

329
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,325
Ow!

330
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,375
Kaixin, does it still hurt?

331
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,175
Go back

332
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:51,225
if you’re uncomfortable.

333
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:53,075
I’ll finish the cleaning.

334
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,025
I’m fine.

335
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,350
Let’s do it together.

336
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,225
Hi, girls.

337
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,775
Bai Qiao, Zimo!

338
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,950
We figured you need extra hands.

339
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,875
Thank you.

340
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,225
You acting students get a big room.

341
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,025
Thanks.

342
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,100
Thank you.

343
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,075
Hao Kaixin!

344
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,625
Stop it!

345
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,975
Hao Kaixin! Hao Kaixin!

346
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:21,150
Hao Kaixin!

347
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,960
It’s not my fault!

348
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,825
Be careful.

349
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,375
Stop running around.

350
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,375
Hey, get the cleaning done first.

351
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,600
Tonight is gonna be our bonding night.

352
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:32,150
Bond how?

353
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
I’m gonna buy you dinner.

354
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:35,700
Really?

355
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,050
You’re an angel, Bai Qiao!

356
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,975
Let’s go to a fancy restaurant.

357
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:44,700
Hi.

358
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,225
Were you

359
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:50,050
mad at me

360
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,125
just now?

361
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:55,750
No.

362
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,150
What’s so funny?

363
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,750
Hao Kaixin,

364
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,475
I’m gonna teach you a lesson.

365
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:05,500
You ask for it! And you!

366
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,725
Be gentle.

367
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:11,100
- Put that thing away.
- He’s gonna kiss you!

368
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,825
Qiyi, a little help here!

369
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,100
I’ll go first.

370
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,325
Honestly,

371
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:30,150
I’m always too direct

372
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:33,750
and sometimes I speak without thinking.

373
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,975
I hope

374
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,225
you can bear with me.

375
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,550
Girls,

376
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,400
I’ve meant

377
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,675
to say this to you

378
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,950
that how lucky we are

379
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,950
that the four of us become roommates.

380
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:05,700
We might have disagreements
now and then.

381
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:09,525
When that happens,

382
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,775
I hope we can agree to disagree

383
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,000
and put behind our differences.

384
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:20,725
Xoxo!

385
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,750
Well,

386
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
I was no longer mad at you.

387
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,275
Truth is, I am sensitive sometimes.

388
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,375
I hope you can understand.

389
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,225
And I apologize

390
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,625
for that in advance.

391
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:45,775
I’m so glad

392
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:47,425
that we’re sharing a room!

393
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,100
- Love you!
- Me too.

394
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,950
Love you back!

395
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:52,725
From this moment on,

396
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,175
- the four of us...
- we live

397
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,200
happily ever after.

398
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:20,400
Count off.

399
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,100
One.

400
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,575
Two.

401
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:22,525
Three.

402
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,300
Four.

403
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:24,075
Five.

404
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,650
Six.

405
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,075
Seven.

406
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:25,775
Eight.

407
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:26,450
Nine.

408
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,143
Ten.

409
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:27,750
Eleven.

410
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:28,650
Twelve.

411
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,250
Thirteen.

412
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:29,825
Fourteen.

413
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:30,400
Fifteen.

414
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,075
Sixteen.

415
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,950
Mr. Sun,

416
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,925
all 16 of us are here!

417
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:38,025
School clubs were recruiting
new members yesterday.

418
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,575
What did you sign up for?

419
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,925
Welcome to the Society of Changes!

420
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:51,875
Mr. Sun,

421
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,750
I... joined
the Society of Changes and Life.

422
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,250
Quit it. Quit it now.

423
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,900
Li Xiao.

424
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,475
Yes.

425
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,675
Start morning exercises.

426
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,375
Yes, sir.

427
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:08,800
Qiyi, back in line.

428
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:12,700
Listen up!

429
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:14,450
At ease!

430
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,200
Attention!

431
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:18,225
Stand straight.

432
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,800
Feet shoulder-width apart.

433
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,325
Relax shoulders, chests and throats.

434
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,975
Straighten up waists, backs and necks.

435
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:26,800
Good.

436
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:31,100
We’ll start with an easy tongue twister

437
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
to test your articulation.

438
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,900
Ready.

439
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,075
How much wood
would a woodchuck chuck...?

440
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,400
Begin!

441
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,300
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck

442
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,550
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

443
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,800
He would chuck, he would,
as much as he could,

444
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,475
and chuck as much wood
as a woodchuck would.

445
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:50,525
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck

446
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:52,575
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

447
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,525
Easy-peasy.

448
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:55,200
Nothing new.

449
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,250
OK.

450
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:01,100
Good.

451
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:03,175
Let’s try another one.

452
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,650
If you must cross a course cross cow

453
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,075
across a crowded cow crossing,

454
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,525
cross the cross coarse cow

455
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,275
across the crowded cow
crossing carefully.

456
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,500
Ready. Go.

457
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,600
If you must cross a course across cow...

458
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,775
Cross across...

459
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,225
Course cross cow crowded...

460
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:22,800
If you must cross a course cross cow...

461
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,825
Cow cross course...

462
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:24,625
Cow cow cow...

463
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:25,525
Cow... coarse cross...

464
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,300
Cow cross course across cow.

465
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,525
Course cross cow across course.

466
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,125
From one there comes two.

467
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,525
From two there comes three.

468
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,225
From three there come all things.

469
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:48,750
Welcome, Qiyi.

470
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,575
Let me introduce her to you.

471
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:03,350
Glasses off.

472
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,250
You can finally meet her in person,

473
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,675
Lu Qiyi, a new acting student
and our new member.

474
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,500
Welcome aboard,

475
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,250
and we’re now a major club.

476
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,550
Sorry,

477
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,600
if I may.

478
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,975
I’m here

479
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,475
to withdraw from your club.

480
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,800
What?

481
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,450
I...

482
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,050
Qiyi,

483
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:44,350
may I ask why?

484
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,575
You haven’t tried

485
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:49,700
any of our activities.

486
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:52,475
How can you be sure
this isn’t your thing?

487
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,450
All for one!

488
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,875
The Ultimate Formation!

489
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,200
Hi, it’s you.

490
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,875
So,

491
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,050
Know-it-all,

492
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:33,025
do you know

493
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:34,575
how to start a school club?

494
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,725
You need to apply first.

495
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:39,725
Hand in the application form

496
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:40,725
to Mr. Zhang.

497
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,725
You do know everything.

498
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,650
It’s right in the student handbook.

499
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:48,200
Thanks.

500
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:49,000
Wait!

501
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,000
Do you

502
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,925
really think

503
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:56,425
