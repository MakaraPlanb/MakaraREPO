00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,820
Just us?

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,620
Is it enough?

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,540
It has to.

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,060
We’re all we got.

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,980
We don’t have a choice.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,220
Let’s start practicing.

30
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,980
We’re all here.

31
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,060
Is this enough for you now?

32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,420
Not even close.

33
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,675
Hey.

34
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,180
Is this the rehearsal hall?

35
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
Where is Qiyi?

36
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,300
Yeah.

37
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,740
We’re going to the station.

38
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,060
Is there time for that?

39
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,380
Qiyi is becoming

40
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,780
more and more unpredictable.

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,740
See…

42
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,460
Qiyi.

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,780
Where have you been?

44
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,450
Hey!

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,420
What’s wrong with her?

46
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:40,820
She…

47
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,580
I’ll go check.

48
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,940
Lu Qiyi.

49
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,060
The whole family is worried about you.

50
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,780
You can choose anything good

51
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,140
and yet you choose acting!

52
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,820
Do you know how hard this is?

53
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,380
Do you know
how complicated this industry is?

54
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,100
Everyone is worried about you!

55
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
You’re letting us down!

56
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,420
Qiyi.

57
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,300
This is it.

58
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,900
Go back to school.

59
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,900
Qiyi.

60
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,700
You’ve shown me how hard you’ve worked.

61
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,580
We’ve decided

62
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,660
to give you a chance,

63
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,820
but

64
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,740
acting is not easy,

65
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,980
and your mother and I can’t help you,

66
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,260
so

67
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,780
you’ll have to do everything
on your own.

68
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
We just hope that

69
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,740
since you’ve chosen this path,

70
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,620
you’ll go on with determination.

71
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,260
Take care of yourself.

72
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,620
Don’t worry, Dad.

73
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,660
Qiyi.

74
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,140
I saw your shining light.

75
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Your graceful dance

76
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,540
is very impressive to me.

77
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,020
Keep up the good work.

78
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,100
It needs you to work harder.

79
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,020
Qiyi.

80
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,900
Take good care of yourself.

81
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,980
I am rooting for you!

82
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,900
Go for it!

83
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,875
(After the tax scandal, Su Wen was
seen in a hotel with a college girl.)

84
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,850
(The girl is a student
of Southern University of the Arts.)

85
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,100
(Su Wen is no longer an eligible
bachelor in the entertainment industry.)

86
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,477
The so-called good man of the industry…

87
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:28,650
The scenes are exceptionally exciting.

88
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,780
Check your phone.

89
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,420
The group messages.

90
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,620
This girl…

91
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,860
Is it Bai Qiao?

92
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,540
It’s Bai Qiao.

93
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
Shouldn’t she be in the hospital?

94
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,277
(Su Wen’s scandal is intensifying.
He was in a hotel with a college girl.)

95
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,417
(They had intimate physical contact,
which was extremely flirtatious.)

96
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,417
(The girl is a freshman
at School of Performing Arts in SUA.)

97
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,140
Du!

98
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,020
Check the news.

99
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,420
I already have.

100
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,575
Wait.

101
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Is that Bai Qiao?

102
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,940
It is her.

103
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:11,255
Wait.

104
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,860
Why aren’t you surprised at all?

105
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,460
I was.

106
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,420
Hello?

107
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,400
Qiyi.

108
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,540
Where is Bai Qiao?

109
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,820
She’s...

110
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,700
I don’t know.

111
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,940
If she contacts you,

112
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,660
let me know right away.

113
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,140
Yes, sure.

114
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Is that Li Xiao?

115
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,940
He must have seen the news.

116
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,060
How’s it going?

117
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,100
Here, have some water.

118
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,260
Thank you.

119
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,675
What do you think?

120
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,015
The kids are good.

121
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:07,675
Mm-hmm.

122
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,865
I liked this girl.

123
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,780
But the news came out last night.

124
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,700
I’ll think about it.

125
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,100
Such a shame.

126
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,180
The rest of the kids

127
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,740
can audition for tomorrow.

128
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,380
All of them?

129
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,620
The Jujiu crew is offering me
an audition.

130
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:31,820
I…

131
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,740
Did you get the message?

132
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,980
No.

133
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,460
Hello?

134
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,780
Did you get the audition notice?

135
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,340
Yes, I did.

136
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,380
It was so sudden.

137
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,660
How did I get selected?

138
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
I just found out that

139
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,580
the audition is tomorrow at our school.

140
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,740
Are you free tonight?

141
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
I want to practice for it.

142
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,340
I don’t think I’ll be there tonight.

143
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,540
You have a good time.

144
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,260
Why?

145
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,180
Where are you?

146
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,820
Let’s meet and talk.

147
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,260
Are you okay?

148
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,140
Yes, I’m fine.

149
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,780
Why shouldn’t I be?

150
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
I feel like you’ve been
so preoccupied lately.

151
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,700
Don’t worry about me.

152
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
You’re thinking too much.

153
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,220
Then why don’t you
want to go to the audition?

154
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,740
I don’t want to go.

155
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,820
It’s a great opportunity.

156
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,740
Don’t you know me?

157
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,580
I’ve never cared about that.

158
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,460
There’s been a lot going on lately.

159
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,180
Have you seen the news?

160
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,300
You mean the thing about Bai Qiao?

161
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,300
Do you know where she is?

162
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,140
She’s with her mother.

163
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,340
She’s in the hospital.

164
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,060
Which hospital?

165
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,420
People’s Hospital.

166
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,580
Qiyi.

167
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,980
I’ve got something to do.

168
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,140
I need to go.

169
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:27,980
Fang Yan.

170
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,500
You must call me

171
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,300
if you need anything.

172
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,425
Sure.

173
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,460
Be safe.

174
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,125
Hey, hey.

175
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,940
Look.

176
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,340
He’s quite handsome.

177
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,420
Yeah.

178
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,860
Turn around.

179
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:55,400
Wow!

180
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,740
So handsome!

181
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,140
I want to know what his major is.

182
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,420
Then what?

183
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,740
He must be waiting

184
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,220
for his girlfriend.

185
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,420
Oh, my!

186
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,860
So hot.

187
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,380
Sanshang.

188
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,300
Kaixin.

189
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,700
You look great today.

190
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,020
Oh, right.

191
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,020
Did you get the audition notice?

192
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:30,825
Yes.

193
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,300
You did?

194
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,620
That’s great!

195
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,580
We can audition together.

196
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,460
Let’s go then.

197
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,860
Sanshang, you’re so handsome.

198
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,180
I think we’d make a good match.

199
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,140
I know that girl.
She’s in the School of Performing Arts.

200
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,150
School of Performing Arts?

201
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,675
Yes.

202
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,420
Have you seen the news?

203
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,020
They say

204
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,140
the girl who was caught
on camera with Su Wen

205
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
is also in the School
of Performing Arts.

206
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,220
Really?

207
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,620
What a complicated industry!

208
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,180
Let’s go.

209
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,060
Let’s go.

210
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:06,620
Mom.

211
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,534
We just can’t get enough

212
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,820
of the exciting private lives
of celebrities.

213
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,740
This man is the one who played…

214
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,740
Some rich man drama, right?

215
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,575
It’s just a big surprise
to the fans of Su.

216
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,300
Why did you turn off the TV?

217
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:27,540
It’s too noisy.

218
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
My mother is not feeling well.

219
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:31,775
Oh.

220
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,310
(Fang Yan: I am waiting
for you downstairs.)

221
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:39,740
Aunt.

222
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,180
I’m going out for a while.

223
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,780
Feed my mother some water, please.

224
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:44,020
Go ahead.

225
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,660
I got this.

226
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,100
Why are you here?

227
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
What is this?

228
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,500
Are you concerned about me?

229
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,620
What’s your relationship with Su Wen?

230
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,220
So it’s Su Wen you care about?

231
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,420
He’s your idol?

232
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,700
What is your relationship?

233
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,420
Nothing.

234
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,180
Then why did you go to see him?

235
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,580
I don’t need to tell you this.

236
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,460
You two…

237
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,420
How long has it been?

238
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,020
So that’s how you see me?

239
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,740
You misunderstood.

240
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,020
Misunderstood?

241
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,220
I didn’t do that kind of dirty thing.

242
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,660
Give this to your mother.

243
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,660
Thank you.

244
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,300
I’m leaving.

245
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,980
Fang Yan.

246
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,780
You do care about me, don’t you?

247
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Don’t go back

248
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,420
to school lately.

249
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,660
Find a place
to get out of the limelight.

250
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,380
(Su Wen’s scandal is intensifying.
He was in a hotel with a college girl.)

251
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,940
Here you are.

252
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,300
Look at you.

253
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,660
You always come back
without telling me in advance.

254
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,580
I don’t have time to buy food,

255
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,940
so I have to let you eat noodles.

256
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,940
I love everything my mom makes.

257
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,900
Try it.

258
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:29,025
Here.

259
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,340
Mom.

260
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,500
Have you seen the news?

261
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,300
What news?

262
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,740
Come on, seriously?

263
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,400
This?

264
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,460
What about it?

265
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,540
This is fake news.

266
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,740
I didn’t believe it.

267
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,340
Can you tell me about you and him?

268
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,700
I want to hear it.

269
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,260
You finally want to hear it?

270
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,740
I’m just curious.

271
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,580
How did you meet him?

272
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,780
How did you get separated?

273
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,460
And why do you keep seeing each other

274
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,540
even though you’re divorced?

275
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,380
When we were caught here,

276
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,060
everything was different.

277
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,620
Everyone wore a mask.

278
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,980
No one could trust anyone.

279
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,140
No one could trust anyone.

280
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,620
Even if they were friends.

281
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,500
Even if they were close relatives.

282
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:08,025
(Hello, Li Sanshang! Congratulations
on passing the written test for

283
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:11,625
the drama teacher recruitment at
Nancheng Experimental Primary School!)

284
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:15,250
(Please come to our school on time
for the secondary examination.)

285
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,422
(Su Wen’s scandal is intensifying.
He was in a hotel with a college girl.)

286
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,860
So

287
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,220
you two broke up peacefully?

288
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,575
Yes.

289
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,780
I tried to explain it to you before,

290
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,660
but you didn’t want to listen.

291
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,140
Your father and I

292
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,060
didn’t split up
because we didn’t get along,

293
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,380
but because we were living in

294
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,700
different environments.

295
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,540
We couldn’t accommodate each other,

296
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,780
and we just couldn’t
adapt to each other’s lives.

297
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,660
I almost broke down.

298
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,980
Actually, now that I think about it,

299
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,860
we did this

300
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,020
because your father wanted
to protect us.

301
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,420
Mom.

302
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,460
Have you considered remarrying him?

303
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,900
It’s hard if your father

304
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,620
is still in that world of fame.

305
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,380
Well…

306
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,460
Have you thought
about finding someone else?

307
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,580
Mr. Sun.

308
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,420
Why isn’t your favorite student here?

309
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,980
It’s hard to tame a wild horse.

310
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,940
Xun.

311
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,580
I’ll give out the lines.

312
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,780
Hello? Sanshang.

313
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,740
We’re all here.

314
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,620
Where are you?

315
00:27:58,925 --> 00:27:59,420
You…

316
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,500
Thank you.

317
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,180
Sir.

318
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,260
Sir. Did I get the wrong lines?

319
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,100
It can’t be.

320
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,580
Your name is written here, isn’t it?

321
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,540
But they’re not the same
as the ones I prepared.

322
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,580
All the lines for the audition

323
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,020
are subject to the ones
given out on the spot.

324
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
Hurry up and get ready.

325
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,060
Shall we?

326
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,780
Sure.

327
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,500
OK.

328
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,860
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

329
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,020
My name is Hao Kaixin,

330
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,580
from the School of Performing Arts,

331
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,140
Southern University of the Arts,
enrolled in 2018.

332
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,260
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

333
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,180
My name is teacher…

334
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,740
My name is Zaychiud

335
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,180
Uzhda Uriyangkhadai.

336
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,660
Let’s begin.

337
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,820
Why are you pulling me?

338
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,000
I’ll just fight them!

339
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,620
What if you lose?

340
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,340
So what?

341
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,300
I’m not afraid of death.

342
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,900
I’d give up my life to save them!

343
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
If you die, how can you save people?

344
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,780
What do you think we should do?

345
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,420
We can’t just leave that bird.

346
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,780
Bird?

347
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,500
That one about Ju or something.

348
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,540
That’s called Jujiu.

349
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,180
When we were caught here,

350
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,980
everything was different.

351
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,980
Everyone wore a mask.

352
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,380
No one could trust anyone.

353
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,940
Even if they were friends

354
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,620
or close relatives.

355
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,700
When the whip is lashing at our body,

356
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,100
when the bamboo stick is
about to break our fingers,

357
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,500
we will think about

358
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,300
how we can live.

359
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,100
In that case,

360
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,580
we can only persist.

361
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,825
We can only believe it!

362
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:11,925
Mm-hmm.

363
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,380
Okay. Okay.

364
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,860
There’s a problem with the investors.

365
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,140
We’ll go first.

366
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,340
You continue the audition here.

367
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,780
Okay.

368
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,860
We’re leaving now.

369
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,020
See you, Xun.

370
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,540
Take care, Sun.

371
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,940
Start your talent show.

372
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,220
Don’t you see the Yellow River
pouring from the sky,

373
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,980
rushing to the sea, and
never turning back?

374
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,060
OK!

375
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,300
Okay, everyone.

376
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,940
That’s all for today.

377
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,580
The audition is over.

378
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,500
Sir.

379
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,900
Sir, I haven’t acted yet.

380
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,260
No, sir.

381
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,660
A lot of us haven’t got the chance yet.

382
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,260
What did I just say?

383
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,025
The audition is over.

384
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,540
Dismiss.

385
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,525
Kaixin, wait for me.

386
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:28,075
Mm-hmm.

387
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,780
Sir.

388
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,940
Wait a minute.

389
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,500
What is it?

390
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,140
Sir.

391
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,860
Can I try again?

392
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,620
The audition is over.

393
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,220
You’re the one who didn’t play.

394
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,540
I’m sorry.

395
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,740
I still have things to do.

396
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,900
You’re a pretty girl.

397
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,660
I’ll tell you what.

398
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,780
Give me your phone number.

399
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,460
I’ll let you know

400
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,700
if there’s another role that suits you.

401
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,700
Sure.

402
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,740
Thank you, sir.

403
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,260
Okay.

404
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,740
Bye, sir.

405
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:15,475
Bye.

406
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Sanshang gave up
such a good opportunity.

407
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,060
I’ll have to ask him to explain.

408
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,380
Qiyi.

409
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,180
It’s okay.

410
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,860
Didn’t Mr. Wang Hai say

411
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,860
that there are other opportunities?

412
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,180
How about

413
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,020
I go visit Mr. Sun with you?

414
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,020
It’s okay. You don’t have to go.

415
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,620
Isn’t this Bai Qiao?

416
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,900
You’re already famous.
Why do you come back?

417
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,100
Get out of the way.

418
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,860
What’s wrong?

419
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,260
You did it

420
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,020
and you don’t want us to talk about it?

421
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,400
Where are you going?

422
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,180
Are you angry?

423
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,740
Do not be angry.

424
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,420
It’s all about fame.

425
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,660
We can understand that.

426
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,300
But you did a great gold-digger’s job

427
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,820
dating Su Wen.

428
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,100
Oh, right.

429
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,380
Mr. Sun said, “To learn the art,

430
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,780
you have to learn
to be a decent human being first.”

431
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,620
A woman like you

432
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,540
shall not stay in the class.

433
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,525
Hey.

434
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,020
That is Su Wen’s girl
in the scandal, right?

435
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,060
She’s really from our school.

436
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,660
I’ve heard that

437
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,100
she was often picked up
by a limousine

438
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,020
and stayed out all night,

439
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,420
so she did find a sugar daddy.

440
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,780
But this man

441
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,060
is a big shot.

442
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,020
I’m afraid he’s not the only one.

443
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Come on, come on!

444
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,725
Look, everyone, the star is here!

445
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,740
Right, Bai Qiao?

446
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,380
It’s really a shortcut to success.

447
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,500
You’re famous now.

448
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,140
Bai Qiao!

449
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:50,875
Ah?

450
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,700
Pick them up.

451
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,340
No way.

452
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,975
Pick them up!

453
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:57,900
Sure.

454
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,900
I’ll do it.

455
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,540
Don’t be angry.

456
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,500
I’m picking them up.

457
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,620
Picking them up! For you!

458
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,580
What are you doing?

459
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,380
What are you doing?

460
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,020
What are you doing?

461
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,850
Apologize to Bai Qiao!

462
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,900
What I said is the truth!

463
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,025
What am I apologizing for?

464
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:14,220
Leave it.

465
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,325
What are you doing?

466
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,820
You bullied someone
and then you wanted to leave?

467
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,740
It can’t be that easy!

468
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,780
(Producer Wang Hai)
Who did I bully?

469
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,775
Everyone is watching.

470
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,820
They know who the bully is.

471
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,460
You’re the ones bullying me!

472
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,940
I’ve got big eyes.

473
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,850
I can see for myself.

474
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,020
It’s you who are bullying me!

475
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,380
What can you do to me?

476
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,300
I won’t apologize.

477
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,540
I won’t apologize!

478
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,140
Apologize to Bai Qiao now!

479
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,460
I won’t apologize!

480
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,540
Stop it!

481
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,940
I don’t want to talk to this person.

482
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:47,740
Let’s go.

483
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,500
Bai Qiao.

484
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,140
Go!

485
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:50,940
What are you looking at?

486
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,820
Hao Kaixin, you…!

487
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,225
Li Xiao.

488
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:25,150
(Producer Wang Hai)

489
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,780
What’s the matter?

490
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,620
How long are you going to hide from me?

491
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:48,220
I’m not.

492
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,300
Then why didn’t you answer my calls?

493
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,140
My phone is dead.

494
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,460
Bai Qiao.

495
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,380
Can you stop lying?

496
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,020
Don’t you have anything
to explain to me?

497
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,660
Explain what?

498
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,980
One minute you say
you’re going back to the dorm,

499
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,980
the next you say
you’re meeting a friend.

500
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,820
Is it funny
that you lied to me like that?

501
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,980
No.

502
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,940
What’s with the photos?

503
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,660
There’s nothing to explain.

504
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,740
I just want to ask you,

505
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,340
what are we really?

506
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,180
Li Xiao.

507
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,860
We are nothing

508
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,380
more than friends.

509
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,340
Friends?

510
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,980
Bai Qiao.

511
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,250
I feel like I don’t know you anymore.

512
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,420
Why do you have
Wang Hai’s business card?

513
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:18,780
Li Xiao.

514
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,460
I, Bai Qiao, earn money
with my own hands.

515
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,860
I’ve never wronged anyone.

516
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,250
Then can you tell me

517
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,140
what is going on here?

518
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,740
Li Xiao.

519
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,540
You keep saying you like me,

520
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,740
but you never trust me.

521
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,380
Why is Lu Qiyi not on the list?

522
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,420
You mean that girl?

523
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,860
She missed the audition.

524
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,620
Invite her to the group meeting

525
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,660
at noon the day after tomorrow.

526
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,220
Okay.

527
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,100
Are there any questions
about the other people?

528
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,900
No.

529
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,740
Make an appointment with
Mr. Sun for me tomorrow night

530
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,540
at the usual place.

531
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,100
Copy that.

532
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,340
If there’s nothing else,

533
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,775
I’ll leave now, Xun.

534
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,900
Hello?

535
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,820
Is this Lu Qiyi?

536
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,575
Yes.

537
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,620
And you are?

538
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,980
I’m Wang Hai, the producer
of the film, Jujiu.

539
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,140
I met you today

540
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,900
and thought you were very good,

541
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,940
so I asked the crew for a new role

542
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,140
that would be

543
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,380
perfect for you.

544
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,580
Really?

545
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,620
Thank you.

546
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,000
How about this?

547
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,620
Come to the second audition

548
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,140
tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

549
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,020
Okay.

550
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,660
I’ll send you the address later.

551
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,460
Okay, okay.

552
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,140
Thank you so much.

553
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,660
Okay. Bye.

554
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,875
What’s up?

555
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,000
Producer Wang called

556
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,300
and said there was a new role

557
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,300
that would be perfect for me.

558
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,500
Really?

559
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,220
But he said I have to
audition again tomorrow,

560
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,380
so I should go to see him at 12:00 PM.

561
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:50,775
Are you sure?

562
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:51,980
Twelve o’clock at night?

563
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,980
I don’t know.

564
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,300
You must have heard wrong.

565
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,500
It can’t be at night.

566
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,060
Maybe at noon.

567
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,500
That’s right.

568
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,940
Why don’t you

569
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,060
go at noon tomorrow?

570
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,460
If there’s no one there,

571
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,260
you can come back and go back at night.

572
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,540
It’s safer this way.

573
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,020
Right.

574
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,100
I’m smart, right?

575
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,300
So smart.

576
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,420
50 yuan for one piece.

577
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,825
- Zhuowen.
- Yes?

578
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,300
Can I talk to you?

579
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,300
Hey, hey, hey!

580
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,100
Is that for you to sit?

581
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,740
Are you looking for trouble?

582
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,950
Stand here!

583
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,450
Stand still!

584
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,820
This brat!

585
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,900
Listen…

586
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,500
This kid…

587
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,625
You have watched him grow up.

588
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:42,100
Yes.

589
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,075
He’s got a lot of problems.

590
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,925
But he’s good

591
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:48,660
at what he does.

592
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,900
He’s not a bad boy.

593
00:40:50,175 --> 00:40:50,860
Right?

594
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,740
His appearance is not good.

595
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,620
Well, he doesn’t get that from me.

596
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,340
Not that bad.

597
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,820
Not that bad, right?

598
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,660
This is not his fault.

599
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,860
Well, I know

600
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,820
he can’t audition for an actor.

601
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,220
How about you let him
go to the shooting site with you

602
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,420
and experience it,

603
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,525
you know, as an intern?

604
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,220
What do you think?

605
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,980
This kid grew up

606
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,180
with me

607
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,660
in the crew.

608
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,300
He is familiar with all types of work.

609
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,780
He did the executive director
a few times.

610
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,180
So…

611
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,300
I’m sure he can be

612
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,820
your assistant, right?

613
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,740
Ma.

614
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,265
Yes.

615
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,940
His professional ability
is certainly good.

616
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,950
It’s just…

617
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,500
What?

618
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,820
He and the kids in our class…

619
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,550
You…

620
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,460
Well…

621
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,300
I told him about this before.

622
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,940
Ma!

623
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,300
Show us your attitude.

624
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,100
Mr. Sun.

625
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,660
I had a little fight with Fang Yan
and the others before,

626
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,580
but that was only at school.

627
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,500
Once we leave the school,

628
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,620
we represent SUA.

629
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,380
I promise you that

630
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,060
I will be an honest person,

631
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,500
work honestly,

632
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,780
take good care of the younger students,

633
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,980
and resolutely carry out
all the director’s orders.

634
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,860
Good.

635
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,580
Then there’s no problem.

636
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,140
Yeah!

637
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,820
I’ll talk to the investors later.

638
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,580
Great!

639
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,740
Look at you.

640
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,540
That’s great.

641
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,260
You and I don’t need this.
