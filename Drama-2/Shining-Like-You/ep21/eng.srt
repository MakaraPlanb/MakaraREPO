24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,200
Director.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,475
Here you are.

26
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,830
Have a sit.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,320
You haven’t eaten yet, right?

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,400
No, I haven’t.

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,420
Wait for five more minutes,

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,620
then you can eat.

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,420
Thank you, director.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,260
Then let’s talk for a while first?

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,940
Don’t you have anything to say to me?

34
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,025
Director, I’m sorry.

35
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,675
It’s my fault today.

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,425
Why is it?

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,660
I shouldn’t have argued with
Song Qinqin about the scene.

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,380
I was too impulsive.

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
You really think so?

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,980
Do you really think you’re wrong?

41
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,800
Be honest with me.

42
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,100
Part of me thinks I’m wrong,

43
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,740
and the other part...

44
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
What?

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,875
Forget it.

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,380
No one would believe me anyway.

47
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,025
I do.

48
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,780
Really?

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,020
I do believe you.

50
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,420
But

51
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,380
what you did today was not right.

52
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,580
There are plenty of people

53
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,780
like Song Qinqin in the crew.

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,380
If you haggle with others,

55
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,660
what’s the difference between
you and them?

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,700
You could have chosen
not to act like her.

57
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,110
What’s the difference between

58
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,460
your behavior today and hers?

59
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,460
But Mr. Sun,

60
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,200
if it were you,

61
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,375
what would you have done?

62
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,250
If it were me,

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,800
I would not have given them

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,860
the chance to bully me
from the beginning.

65
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,540
One step wrong, all steps wrong.

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,375
The first step is very important.

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,700
Since your first step is already wrong,

68
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,080
you can’t use the same tactics

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,180
to get back at others.

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,740
If you do that,

71
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,425
you’ll become like them.

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,125
I understand now.

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,620
I’m sorry, Mr. Sun.

74
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,325
Qiyi.

75
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,260
You must remember two words,

76
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,075
big heart.

77
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,180
As long as you have a bigger heart
than ordinary people,

78
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,460
you can go farther than others.

79
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,930
As I told you

80
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,340
in class that

81
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,740
you have to be a decent person first.

82
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,050
Do you understand?

83
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,350
I do, Mr. Sun.

84
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,750
Eat it.

86
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,400
Hi.

87
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,250
You can’t just stay home
and write songs.

88
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,380
You have to get out more to feel life.

89
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,580
To make music,
you have to have fun first.

Yes!

126
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,510
That’s right.

127
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,200
To make music, you have to

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,350
have fun first.

129
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,975
Zhang Yang.

130
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,375
You don’t belong here.

131
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,510
Leave with me.

132
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,975
Let’s go see the world outside.

133
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,410
What? Still hesitating?

134
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,425
Let’s go.

135
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,650
Go.

137
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,900
Have you seen Du Ang?

138
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,675
No.

139
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,190
I’m so angry.

140
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,410
I don’t know where he is.

141
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,420
He hasn’t put on his makeup yet.

142
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,140
Then I’ll go look for him.

143
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,090
I’ll do that.

144
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,020
Call him.

145
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,875
Du Ang!

146
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,400
Get up.

147
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,150
Wake up!

148
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,700

Oh, my!

150
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,725
Go to put on your makeup.

151
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,650
Come on, come on.

152
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,290
You dare to pull down my pants!

153
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,975
I…

154
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,825
Get up!

156

Mr. Sun.

See?

158
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,700
Xun is waiting because of you.

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,330
Xun, I’m sorry.

160
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,100
I’m late.

161
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,500
Fine, let’s begin.

162
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,050
The prop dude.

163
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,040
I don’t get my gun, bro.

164
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,540
Can I have my gun?

165
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,075
Du Ang.

166
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,525
Come here.

167
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,225
It’s not my fault.

168
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,520
My son.

169
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,370
What is it, Mr. Sun?

170
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,360
What did you just call him?

171
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,125
The prop dude.

172
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,100
Who taught you to call him that?

173
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,660
Don’t they all do that in the crew?

174
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,910
In my crew,

175
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,760
we say “Mr.” or “Ms.”.

176
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,575
Do you understand?

177
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,200
Go ahead.

178
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,940
Sir, can I have my gun?

179
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,600
Come on, let’s shoot when you’re ready.

180
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,325
You’re ready?

181
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,925
OK, rolling.

182
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,020
(Main title: Jujiu)
Okay, scene six. Roll one.

183
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,180
Three, two, one.

184
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,150

187
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,540
Do you want to stay

188
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,380
for a cup of tea?

189
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,060
No, no, no, Miss Peony.

190
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,610
If we have offended you,

191
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,500
please forgive us.

192
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,350
We are…

193
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
We… the…

194
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,075
Cut!

195
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,675
One more time.

196
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,300
One more time!

197
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,900
OK. Rolling!

198
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,800
OK. Scene six. Roll Two.

199
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,380
Three, two, one.

200
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:48,650
Action!

201
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,580
Calm yourself down.

202
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,940
Take your time.

203
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,940
Okay, okay.

204
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,140
Sorry, Xun.

205
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,625
One more time.

206
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,925
Rolling.

207
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,550
Take it away.

208
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,275
OK. Shoot.

209
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
OK. Scene six. Roll three.

210
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,820
Three, two, one.

211
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,850
Action!

212
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,460
Secretary Gao.

213
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,740
Are you tired after the search?

214
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,300
Do you want to stay

215
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,020
for a cup of tea?

216
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,225
Miss Peony.

217
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,980
We’re just following the routine.

218
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,380
What about the search results?

219
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,260
Do I need to call

220
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,460
Commander Wang?

221
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,740
No, no, no, Miss Peony.

222
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,125
Cut. Cut.

223
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,590
Cut!

224
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,400
Du Ang!

225
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,500
What’s going on?

226
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,640
Just a few lines.

227
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,500
Can’t you memorize them?

228
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,940
Try to get it right.

229
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,925
I can do it. I can do it.

230
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,620
Let’s take a break.

231
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,575
Take a break. Come on.

232
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,175
Fang Yan.

233
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,600
You go and practice lines with him.

234
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:19,975
Dude.

235
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,770
Help me out.

236
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,675
I’ll help you with it.

237
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,225
Don’t worry.

238
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:24,925
Um.

239
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,160
No, no.

240
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,180
Eh… Following the routine. Right.

241
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,860
What about the search results?

242
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,760
Do I need to call

243
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,100
Commander Wang?

244
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,380
Is this gonna work?

245
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,825
Du Ang, is it OK?

246
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:50,640
- Yeah?
- Are you OK?

247
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,200
No problem.

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
- OK, yeah?
- Yeah.

249
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,425
Slow down.

250
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,560
- OK.
- Don’t be nervous.

251
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,525
OK, rolling.

252
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,925
(Main title: Jujiu)
Scene six. Roll five.

253
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,180
Three, two, one.

254
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,300
Action!

255
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,060
Secretary Gao.

256
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,260
Are you tired after the search?

257
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,660
Do you want to stay

258
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,460
for a cup of tea?

259
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,940
Miss Peony.

260
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,340
We’re just following the routine.

261
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,140
What about the search results?

262
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,140
Do I need to call

263
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,300
Commander Wang?

264
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,640
No, no, no need.

265
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,260
Miss Peony.

266
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,730
If we have offended you,

267
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,700
please forgive us.

268
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,580
There are instructions from above.

269
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,900
We are ordered to catch Jujiu.

270
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,380
Jujiu… Secretly…

271
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,950
Cut, cut, cut.

272
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,175
Mr. Sun.

273
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,700
I can’t do this.

274
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,925
What’s wrong with you?

275
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,700
I’m telling you,

276
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,100
you must act well for me.

277
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,975
Get ready!

278
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,470
Hurry up!

279
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,580
I really can’t do it.

280
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,800
Go!

281
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,350
Go!

282
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,475
Roll it!

283
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,180
Rolling.

284
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,370
If we have offended you,

285
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,300
please forgive us.

286
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,250
We…

287
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,770
Cut!

288
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,990
The operation has a new…

289
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,720
Cut!

290
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,680
We got an order.

291
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,900
We must catch the secret…

292
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,540
Cut!

293
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,920
You’re such a generous woman…

294
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,160
Cut! Cut! Cut!

295
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,210
- I… I…
- Cut! Cut! Cut!

296
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,180
I… I…

297
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,950
Cut!

298
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,390
It’s my fault!

299
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,230
It’s my fault! It’s my fault!

300
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,680
Cut! Cut!

301
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,400
It’s my fault! It’s my fault!

302
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,650
- It’s my fault! It’s my fault!
- Cut! Cut!

303
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,540
Amitabha.

304
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,980
Young Master.

305
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,910
Young lady.

306
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,180
It’s 4 AM. You’re here so early.

307
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,620
Great Master.

308
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,660
I’m here for the first incense.

309
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,220
Amitabha.

310
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,700
Du Ang.

311
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,180
This is for you.

312
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,700
It’s for inner peace.

313
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,740
The relationship is not right.

314
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,220
It’s hard.

315
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,550
Du Ang.

316
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,340
This is for you.

317
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,180
The master in the temple
has done the consecration.

318
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,020
The given situation is not right.

319
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,580
You don’t need to
worry about the shooting.

320
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,300
Take it with you.

321
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,100
Buddha will bless you.

322
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,460
The overall concept is not right.

323
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,580
Forget it, forget it.

324
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,950
Here!

325
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,580
Where is the guy in this room?

326
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,350
When I cleaned,

327
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,220
there was no one in the room.

328
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,900
Then where did he go?
Do you know?

329
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,120
I don’t know.

330
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,220
Thank you.

331
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:00,525
Hey, Qinqin.

332
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,300
Drink this.

333
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,700
A girl must learn to love herself.

334
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,300
Thank you.

335
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,500
Song Qinqin.

336
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:19,820
Yes?

337
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,680
Congratulations

338
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,380
on your wrap.

339
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,660
I still have two scenes.

340
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,580
Things changed.

341
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,700
They’re deleted.

342
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,210
Go back.

343
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,060
The car is at the door.

344
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:33,630
Okay.

345
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,275
Thank you, Director.

346
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,480
Qiyi.

347
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,510
Keep it up.

348
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,540
Bye, Qinqin.

349
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,120
Bye.

350
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,600
The car with
the license plate number 19.

351
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,380
Qiyi.

352
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,420
Have you seen Du Ang?

353
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,540
No, why?

354
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,225
I can’t find him.

355
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,860
He’s in big trouble.

356
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,300
Xun.

357
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,580
I heard there was a problem
with the crew today.

358
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,150
What happened?

359
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,975
The second leading male role, Du Ang,

360
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,375
has left the crew.

361
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,725
Left?

362
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,400
What does he want?

363
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,425
Director Sun.

364
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,180
You must be kidding me.

365
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,600
In the middle of filming,

366
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,700
you lost your actor.

367
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,620
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

368
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,780
We will find a way to

369
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,300
get him back as soon as possible.

370
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,130
Get him back?

371
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,940
How?

372
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
How long will it take?

373
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,180
Xun, don’t forget.

374
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,370
I invested

375
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,260
in this film because of you.

376
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,800
We’ve adjusted the plan.

377
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,380
It won’t delay the shooting.

378
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,620
As soon as he returns,

379
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,420
we’ll shoot his scene first.

380
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,220
Director.

381
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,660
Is that going to work?

382
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,140
Under the current situation,

383
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,380
we can’t afford to wait.

384
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Then what should we do?

385
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,610
I suggest

386
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,425
we replace him.

387
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,860
Let’s reshoot the previous scenes.

388
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,125
Let’s replace him.

389
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,540
Are you still angry?

390
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,580
I was wrong the other day.

391
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,825
What makes you say that?

392
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,060
You were clearly helping me.

393
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,580
I didn’t understand
the situation and got angry.

394
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,780
And?

395
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,450
And…

396
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,225
Oh.

397
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,060
I should have told you everything.

398
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,050
Fang Yan.

399
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,850
I hope you can tell me everything

400
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,420
in the future, okay?

401
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,125
Because no matter what happens,

402
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,700
I want to bear it with you.

403
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,175
You have my word.

404
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,580
Actually, I wasn’t doing well either.

405
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,540
I should have understood you better.

406
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,820
Are we

407
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,580
good now?

408
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,540
What’s wrong?

409
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,780
I was wondering where Du Ang would go.

410
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,530
If he doesn’t come back,

411
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,580
what’s going to happen to the shooting?

412
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,820
He’s always like this.

413
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,180
Maybe he’ll be back soon.

414
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,180
Don’t worry about it.

415
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,500
Du Ang replied to my WeChat.

416
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,140
He probably won’t come back.

417
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,750
(Du Ang: I’m safe. Don’t worry.
But I’m afraid I can’t act this time.)

418
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,375
(Say sorry to Mr. Sun for me...)

419
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,620
You want me to convince
all the investors?

420
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,180
In the current situation,

421
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,940
only a replacement

422
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,420
is the most practical solution.

423
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,010
Then why didn’t you discuss it with me

424
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,100
before you popped out the suggestion?

425
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,030
It just suddenly came to me.

426
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,030
Who do you want to choose?

427
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,930
Fang Yan.

428
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,500
Fang Yan.

429
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,300
When I said Du Ang had problems,

430
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,060
it was you who insisted

431
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,450
and made me believe in him,

432
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,450
so I tried to
convince all the investors

433
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,340
not to replace him,

434
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,860
and now you want to replace Du Ang.

435
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,460
Fine.

436
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,030
Even if I can convince all the investors

437
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,700
to replace Du Ang with Fang Yan,

438
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,180
can you guarantee that
Fang Yan will manage to do it?

439
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,900
This is the shooting site,

440
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,600
not a classroom for you to teach.

441
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,975
Zhuowen,

442
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,820
it’s too risky to replace
someone on the fly.

443
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,480
If he leaves,

444
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,260
let’s get him back, right?

445
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,380
What if we can’t get him back?

446
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,390
What do you mean?

447
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,580
Du Ang won’t come back.

448
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,110
Why?

449
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,220
Bella.

450
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,920
You’re going out?

451
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,550
Mom.

452
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,260
Yeah?

453
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,220
I’m not going out.

454
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,820
I’ll stay here with you.

455
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,980
Lie down.

456
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,980
Bella. Do you feel cold?

457
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,420
No, you don’t.

458
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,900
No, you don’t.

459
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,340
Your mouth is bleeding.

460
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,320
Are you in pain?

461
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,240
Mom,

462
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,450
I’m fine. I’m fine.

463
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,980
Don’t go out.

464
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,660
Don’t go out.

465
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,100
You’ll get caught.

466
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,940
Can’t get back.

467
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,460
Can’t get back.

468
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,090
Don’t go out.

469
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,025
(Do you want to make money?
The driver’s been waiting for you.)

470
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,475
(What are you doing, Bai Qiao?
Get down there. Hurry!)

471
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,100
Don’t go out.

472
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,450
(Delete)

473
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,580
Who is it?

474
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,750
It’s so late.

475
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,150
Why are you here?

476
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,170
Such a big thing happened,

477
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,225
of course I’m here.

478
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,450
Don’t worry about it.

479
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,020
Can I not worry about it?

480
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,220
You’ve...

481
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,875
You’ve lost your student.

482
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,225
I heard that the investors

483
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,625
are giving you a hard time.

484
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,900
I’m the one who lost my actor.

485
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,340
So it’s normal for them
to give me a hard time.

486
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,620
That’s not possible.

487
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,340
I know Du Ang.

488
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,410
He can’t run away just

489
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,300
because you scolded him.

490
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,020
It doesn’t matter now.

491
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,140
The most important thing now
is to solve the problem.

492
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,250
You know why Du Ang left, don’t you?

493
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,780
You have to carry
all the pressure yourself.

494
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,900
As long as I can solve the problem.

495
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,950
How?

496
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,480
I know what I’m doing.

497
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,240
You…

498
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,375
Who is it?

499
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,025
It’s so late, you...

500
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,740
Well…

501
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,500
She’s just arrived.

502
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,580
So has she.

503
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,820
Sun Zhuowen!

504
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,225
Did you already know why Du Ang left?

505
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,100
It’s not Du Ang’s fault.

506
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,500
Blame it on Wang Hai.

507
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,100
Ms. Tang!

508
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,080
It’s so late.

509
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,140
Don’t go back to school.

510
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,180
I’ve asked someone to get you a room.

511
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,180
Please go to the front desk
and get your room card.

512
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,780
Thank you.

513
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,970
Tomorrow…

514
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,660
Don’t worry.

515
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,260
I’ll help him

516
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,825
at the conference tomorrow.

517
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,300
Thank you.

518
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,075
Actually, you don’t have to thank me,

519
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,420
because no matter what happens,

520
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,820
I will stand with him.

521
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,740
Go and get some rest.

522
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,260
I’m leaving.

523
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,204
Dear.

524
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,350
Hmm?

525
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,780
When I’m done with my work,

526
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,140
I’ll take you to some place
near the water.

527
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,780
It’s really beautiful.

528
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,520
It’s amazing.

529
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,450
Really? Where is it?

530
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,125
It’s a secret.

531
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,500
Anyway, it’s a place

532
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,980
where the sun is warm,

533
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
the sea and the moon are bright.

534
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,220
There are birds and fish.

535
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,060
We can walk on the beach

536
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,260
watching the waterfowl on the sea.

537
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
At night,

538
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,940
we can listen to the sound

539
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,820
of the waves in our huts.

540
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,620
Very cozy.

541
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,250
(Jinsha Village)

542
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,100
I’ve talked to Mr. Zhang this morning.

543
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,790
He has no problem
with the change, right?

544
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,800
Yes.

545
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,260
After careful consideration,

546
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,900
I agree to change the actor,

547
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,850
but

548
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,500
it’s definitely not gonna be Fang Yan.

549
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,060
Do you think

550
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,240
he doesn’t fit the image

551
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,500
or are you worried
about his acting skills?

552
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,780
Mr. Zhang, here’s the thing.

553
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,440
Fang Yan was

554
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,340
our decision after
careful consideration.

555
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,020
First of all, Fang Yan
fits the role perfectly,

556
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,220
and his professionalism
is also excellent.

557
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,210
Secondly,

558
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,560
he is Mr. Sun’s student.

559
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,860
Director Sun knows him very well.

560
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,180
This way we can save
a lot of communication costs.

561
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,220
If we replace him with other actors,

562
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,740
I’m afraid we’ll have to
spend a lot of time bonding.

563
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,940
Xun.

564
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,860
I can understand your feelings.

565
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,070
But the young actors need

566
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,340
time to bond.

567
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,900
If we choose actors
with rich experience,

568
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,740
they won’t need that much time.

569
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,775
Do you understand?

570
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,440
Xun.

571
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,540
This time you have to be on my side.

572
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,100
When you said that Sun

573
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,060
wanted to use new actors,

574
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,100
I didn’t stop him,

575
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,220
and I supported him.

576
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,260
Now what?

577
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,300
This is a crew,

578
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,940
and it’s not a school.

579
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:12,930
Besides,

580
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,380
we don’t have so much time

581
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,860
to teach with Director Sun, right?

582
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,570
Okay, I’ll give you

583
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,660
some information about
the actors in a couple of days,

584
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,440
so you can choose from this range

585
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,400
and decide who you want.

586
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,280
Mr. Zhang, how about this?

587
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,940
Come and watch Fang Yan’s act.

588
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,480
After all,

589
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,170
the director is directly responsible

590
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,060
for the quality of the film.

591
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,390
No need.

592
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,540
The director just needs to make

593
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,340
the film according
to our requirements.

594
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,820
If I’m still directing this film,

595
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,460
I ask you to respect
my choice and decision.

596
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,875
Director Sun,

597
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,980
it’s not that I don’t trust you.

598
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,250
It’s because your student

599
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,940
has already made trouble once.

600
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,980
Today,

601
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,500
I’m giving you my word.

602
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,570
If the film is not shot well,

603
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,340
or not completed as scheduled,

604
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,980
I will not take a penny.

605
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,020
And

606
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,100
I will never direct
any play again in my life.

607
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,860
Mr. Zhang.

608
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,060
I’ve decided to support
Director Sun this time

609
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,590
because Fang Yan is the best candidate

610
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,660
in terms of professionalism

611
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,580
and cooperation.

612
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,660
Would you like to reconsider it?

613
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,120
Fine.

614
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,900
But I need to see
Fang Yan’s audition.

615
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,980
Are you sure you can
get Fang Yan to agree?

616
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,260
He will.

617
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,390
Have you heard?

618
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,540
They’re going to replace the actor.

619
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,460
Du Ang will be replaced by Fang Yan.

620
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,140
Do you know Fang Yan?

621
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,660
He’s the son of the famous star Su Wen.

622
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,260
Someone surely
pulled some strings behind.

623
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,490
Maybe Du Ang left

624
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,780
just because he knew about this.

625
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,070
Can you guys stop
talking behind people’s backs?

626
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,530
Fang Yan is relying on his own ability.

627
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,610
He didn’t rely on his connections

628
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,850
or his father.

629
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,620
You can’t talk nonsense like this

630
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,180
without any evidence.

631
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,025
Wait a minute.

632
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,460
After Du Ang left,

633
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,860
the son of the big star
got the role immediately.

634
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,340
What kind of coincidence is that?

635
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,020
Can you stop talking nonsense?

636
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,730
What is your relationship?

637
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,060
You’re so loyal to him.

638
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,820
Fang Yan, let’s go.

639
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,560
Fang Yan.

640
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,520
Are you sorry

641
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,550
you didn’t get the role this time?

642
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,740
I think it’s just

643
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,820
not the right time yet.

644
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,500
What if it is?

645
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,630
If Du Ang doesn’t come back,

646
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,100
someone has to take over the role.

647
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,800
No,

648
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,470
I can’t do it.

649
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,660
Why?

650
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,580
Anyone can take his role,

651
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,980
but not me.

652
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,160
Fine.

653
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,940
If you’re not replacing Du Ang,

654
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,580
your good friend,

655
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,760
will you play the role?

656
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,020
So,

657
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,420
that’s not the real reason,

658
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,840
is it?

659
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,970
Fang Yan, are you there?

660
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:05,925
(Fang Yan: Yes, what’s up?)

661
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,420
I just met Mr. Sun.

662
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,020
He seems to be under a lot of pressure.

663
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,700
Why did you turn him down?

664
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,740
If Du Ang really doesn’t show up,

665
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,380
you’re the only one who can help him.

666
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:46,580
(Fang Yan: Get some rest.)

667
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,740
(Qiyi: I believe in you.)

668
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,780
Come, come, come.

669
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,110
Sit, sit, sit.

670
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,350
Watch the game.

671
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,240
Fang Yan.

672
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,460
If you take me as your teacher,

673
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,660
tell me the real reason.

674
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,300
The Fang Yan I know

675
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,740
dares to challenge me in class,

676
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,060
and he dares to challenge

677
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,820
the Experimental Drama Society.

678
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,810
If he’s needed,

679
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,540
he’ll step up.

680
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
If he doesn’t,

681
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,820
there must be some special reason.

682
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,170
Fang Yan.

683
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,580
Besides the fact that
Du Ang is your friend,

684
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,620
what other reason is there

685
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,460
for you not to accept this role?

686
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,740
Here.

687
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,340
I just want to know

688
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,220
what you’re most afraid of.

689
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,780
Mr. Sun.

690
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,300
I don’t know
if I can play the role well.

691
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,540
I don’t want to
take Du Ang’s place either.

692
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,740
Because

693
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,660
I may not be better than Du Ang.

694
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,100
I may not be able to

695
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,140
meet everyone’s demands either.

696
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,220
Why would you think that?

697
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,780
Here.

698
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,470
Look.

699
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,100
At this point in the competition,

700
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,660
the winner is basically decided, right?

701
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,750
Yes.

702
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,820
Normally,

703
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,020
it’s impossible to catch up.

704
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,860
But why do you think
they are still fighting

705
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,100
so hard when they have already lost?

706
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,740
Maybe

707
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,725
they want to prove their worth.

708
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,170
That’s right.

709
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,220
The crew’s situation
is similar to a ball game.

710
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,780
When no one is optimistic about us,

711
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,710
we can only rely on ourselves,

712
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,660
trust our teammates

713
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,380
and fight until the last minute.

714
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,140
Even if we’re going down,

715
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,740
we must fight hard.

716
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,240
Look, look, look!

717
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,980
Look, they won!

718
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,420
There are miracles if you persist.

719
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,610
Fang Yan.

720
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,420
Would you like to be my teammate?

721
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,820
But in terms of performance,

722
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,380
I can only give you
a score of fifty-nine.

723
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,540
You didn’t move yourself,

724
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,060
and then how can you move us all?

725
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,620
Fifty-nine.

726
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,540
At the musical festival,

727
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,060
Mr. Su Wen’s comment was very pertinent.

728
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,500
Think about

729
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,340
what your problem is.

730
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,340
Not convinced?

731
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,060
Prove it to me.

732
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,640
At least you should act

733
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,780
like the son of Su Wen.
