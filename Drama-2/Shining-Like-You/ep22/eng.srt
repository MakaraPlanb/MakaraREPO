(Personal Resume Mao Jiacheng)

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,540
Xun,

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,340
this is the information of the new cast
sent by Mr. Zhang.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,340
Do you want to have a check?

28
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,700
Leave them.

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,740
But Mr. Zhang said

30
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,500
if he couldn’t see

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,540
Fang Yan’s audition tomorrow,

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,420
I’m afraid these actors

33
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,780
would come directly.

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,460
Tell Mr. Zhang

35
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,500
that he will see it tomorrow.

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,740
Stop there.

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,580
Why are you here?

38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,540
Aren’t you afraid of the paparazzi?

39
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,580
I’m here to meet my son.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,540
Why should I be afraid?

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,780
Wanna drink anything?

42
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,580
Whatever you have.

43
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,940
Take a seat.

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,940
How have you been?

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:06,975
How is the filming going?

46
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,060
How is the filming going?

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,140
Not bad.

48
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,580
Good.

49
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,180
Yan,

50
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,020
I have to thank you for
what happened last time.

51
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
You make me feel

52
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,980
I have not lost you as a son.

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,600
All this time,

54
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,820
we haven’t really
talked to each other.

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,580
I always thought you were

56
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,260
too young to understand

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,140
and I didn’t know what to say.

58
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,860
But after what happened last time,

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,500
I think

60
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,140
you’ve grown up.

61
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,460
People will always grow up.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,620
Yes.

63
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,020
I never expected that

64
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,300
the person behind the last incident

65
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,580
was a good friend of mine.

66
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,580
We used to work in one crew

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,900
and run a company together.

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,180
We used to be so close like brothers.

69
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,380
But in the end…

70
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,700
So,

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,260
this business is very complicated.

72
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,780
You may

73
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,100
hurt yourself

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,125
and your family.

75
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,420
and your family.

76
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,860
That’s why I left you and your mom.

77
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,940
I don’t understand.

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,300
I’m not asking for your understanding

79
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,140
on the emotional side of things.

80
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,740
But that’s why I especially

81
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
do not want you to become an actor.

82
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,700
I’m afraid

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,100
you may lose yourself

84
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,420
and your most precious things.

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,260
Understand?

86
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,660
But now I insist on being an actor.

87
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,020
You’re quite disappointed, right?

88
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,620
No.

89
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,900
I feel proud that

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,020
now you become an actor.

91
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,100
I always thought

92
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
you just wanted to prove to me

93
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,260
and defeat me.

94
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,020
But, I missed something.

95
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,380
You must like this job a lot.

96
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,140
I should respect your choice.

97
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,340
Fang Yan,

98
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,740
I failed as a father.

99
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,420
But, I’m glad that

100
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
you met a

101
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,340
very good teacher.

102
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,140
Follow Mr. Sun and study hard.

103
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,500
You’ll definitely achieve something.

104
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,900
Yan,

105
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,660
Before,

106
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,620
I was terribly wrong.

107
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Mr. Sun,

108
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,380
thank you.

109
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,350
Oh.

110
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,380
If you hadn’t told me this,

111
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,460
I wouldn’t have thought to go to Su Wen.

112
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,460
Let’s go.

113
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,460
Jujiu.

114
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,580
One day I will find you.

115
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,940
And when I do,

116
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,300
I will have a good talk with you.

117
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,900
OK. Pass!

118
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,075
Fang Yan, good job.

119
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,025
Thank you, sir.

120
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,660
OK. Next scene!

121
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,380
Fang Yan,

122
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,660
have some water.

123
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,900
How do you feel?

124
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,540
Not bad.

125
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,140
Hello, Ms. Tang.

126
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,460
Qiyi,

127
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,060
call Kaixin to meet at the gate
of the film city

128
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,900
for the interview.

129
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,650
OK, Ms. Tang.

130
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,675
Bye.

131
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,940
Another year, seeing the grass prosper.

132
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,220
Still in here,
welcoming dear students harbor.

133
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,220
Good job this time.

134
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,300
Oh, please.

135
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,020
You speak like a dictionary every day.

136
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,380
Of course I learned some.

137
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,500
One more try.

138
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,420
Mountains rise beyond the mountains.

139
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,380
A big dog just passed by in two seconds.

140
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:40,060
It’s “there are always stronger ones”.

141
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,780
Look at you.

142
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,975
What a nerd.

143
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,260
(Modern Acting Company)
The acting company is to recruit again.

144
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,420
Yeah.

145
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,350
(Welcome to the world of art)

146
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,850
Excuse me, let me say something first.

147
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,925
Boys and girls,

148
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,100
let me introduce.

149
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,420
The two gentlemen here

150
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,100
are from the Modern Acting Company.

151
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,100
They are our interviewers today.

152
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,180
Welcome.

153
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,260
Take seats, please.

154
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,580
Our school has

155
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,700
a long-term cooperation
with Modern Acting Company.

156
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,340
Every year, they will select a group

157
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,580
of outstanding students from our school

158
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,860
and send them abroad for further study.

159
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,900
They’ll sign a contract
with them after graduation.

160
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,060
This is also our school’s Eyas Program.

161
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
Understand?

162
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,460
This is a rare chance.

163
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,100
Seize the opportunity, OK?

164
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:52,980
Alright.

165
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,900
Now let’s start the interview.

166
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,020
Then the parade began.

167
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,460
The emperor walked at the front

168
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,780
of the procession with great dignity.

169
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,900
Those who stood in the street said

170
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,100
how beautiful and well-fitting

171
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,740
the emperor’s clothes were.

172
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,100
Suddenly,

173
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,380
a child shouted…

174
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:21,500
His Majesty is not wearing anything!

175
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,340
How come you look so happy today?

176
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,860
Anything good happened?

177
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,860
Kaixin will come to me later.

178
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:45,425
(Resume: Hao Kaixin)

179
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,780
Students whose names were just called,

180
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,075
thanks for your coming.

181
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,220
You may leave now.

182
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,620
Go for it.

183
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,940
It’s okay. You can make it.

184
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,820
Wait a second.

185
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,540
The girl in black dress.

186
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,460
Me?

187
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,650
Yes. What’s your name?

188
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,140
Lu Qiyi.

189
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,980
Oh, sorry.

190
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,860
We just misplaced your resume.

191
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,820
You’ve been selected.

192
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,540
Kaixin!

193
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,180
I was scared!

194
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:35,450
(Resume: Hao Kaixin)

195
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,020
Which one of you is Hao Kaixin?

196
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,540
Me.

197
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,260
My apology.

198
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,780
Your resume is also misplaced.

199
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,540
Thanks for your coming.

200
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,980
Hao Kaixin?

201
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,220
Thanks for your coming.

202
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,140
You may leave now.

203
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,200
Come on. What are you waiting for?

204
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,460
I told you that you were ugly.

205
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,975
You would be selected

206
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,620
if you look prettier.

207
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,580
Watch your words!

208
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,460
You do your best.

209
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,220
I’m leaving.

210
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,380
Kaixin.

211
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,220
The kids were so funny just now.

212
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,980
I think you’re funnier.

213
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,060
Why are you here?

214
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,900
Didn’t you say you went home?

215
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,340
I’m here for the internship.

216
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,140
Come here.

217
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,420
What are you doing?

218
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,900
Why didn’t you tell me?

219
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
And you’re with him.

220
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,260
Why should I tell you?

221
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,900
You’re my girlfriend!

222
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,140
To be.

223
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,820
I have a boyfriend now.

224
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,780
Didn’t you say
you two had no relationship?

225
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,700
Now… Now we have.

226
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,620
Jiang Xiaoyu.

227
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,140
Don’t come to me again.

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,780
Jiang Xiaoyu.

229
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,700
We’ll see.

230
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:50,020
Kaixin,

231
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,500
you’re here.

232
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,060
Li Sanshang is pretty.

233
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,180
Why does he like the ugly Hao Kaixin?

234
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,460
They will break up sooner or later.

235
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,140
I have a boyfriend now.

236
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,100
My apology.

237
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,700
Your resume is also misplaced.

238
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,500
Thanks for your coming.

239
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,660
I want to play the female lead!

240
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,660
She can only go to the crew

241
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,940
to do stand-in,

242
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,180
be a sandbag or something.

243
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:49,975
In the entertainment industry,

244
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,800
how to survive without a pretty face?

245
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,780
You are the martial arts stand-in.

246
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,540
Don’t let the camera catch your face.

247
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,525
Qiyi is more suitable.

248
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,580
I think Qiyi is better.

249
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,250
Indeed.

250
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,900
Maybe I can never play the
leading role in my life.

251
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,300
Didn’t you say
you two had no relationship?

252
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,460
Now… Now we have.

253
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,100
(Bus Ticket Office)

254
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,900
Excuse me. To Jinsha Village.

255
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,180
The earliest bus. How much?

256
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,140
It’s seven now.

257
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,260
There is no bus to there now, girl.

258
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,340
No bus?

259
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,925
Yes.

260
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,220
How about tomorrow?
The earliest bus tomorrow.

261
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,950
The earliest one tomorrow

262
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,740
is at five in the morning.

263
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,420
Five in the morning?

264
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,055
Yes.

265
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,060
Thank you.

266
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,740
You’re welcome.

267
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,665
Lady, the ticket is sold out.

268
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:49,675
- Wanna share a car?
- Hi. Where are you going?

269
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,400
I’ll give you a discount.

270
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,310
(Hotel)
Our hotel is cheap.

271
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,820
Kaixin.

272
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,140
Kaixin, are you there?

273
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,180
Where is she?

274
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,020
Hello, Sanshang.

275
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:46,875
Qiyi,

276
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,220
is Kaixin back?

277
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,220
I’m looking for her.

278
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,580
She is still not back this late?

279
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,660
I made Kaixin angry again.

280
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,700
OK. Don’t worry.

281
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,940
I will tell her when she is back.

282
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,980
Help me to calm her down, please.

283
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:00,375
OK.

284
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,450
I will. Don’t worry.

285
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,220
Bye!

286
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
So scary!

287
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,700
Sanshang, what’s wrong?

288
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,940
Kaixin didn’t answer my call.

289
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,140
Then, go to see her.

290
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,980
I asked.

291
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,620
She is not in the crew.

292
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,260
Sanshang,

293
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,420
what do you want to do in the future?

294
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,180
I want a stable life.

295
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,700
Like being a teacher in the school.

296
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,940
Don’t you want to be an actor.

297
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,700
Sure I do.

298
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,260
But I want to give the one I love

299
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,660
a stable life more.

300
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,420
Sanshang.

301
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,420
Actually I think

302
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,820
you’re an interesting person.

303
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,260
Don’t you think I’m a dork?

304
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,540
Yes, you are.

305
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
That’s why you’re interesting.

306
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,460
You’re different from many people
in our school.

307
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,380
You think simply.

308
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,140
But you’re reliable.

309
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,900
You make others feel safe.

310
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,620
It’s the first time someone
praising me like this.

311
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,940
Actually,

312
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,940
I envy Hao Kaixin.

313
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,180
She met such a nice person like you.

314
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,060
I’m not that nice.

315
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,860
You’ll meet a better person definitely.

316
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,420
I think Ma is nice to you.

317
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,220
I don’t like him.

318
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,650
Oh.

319
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,060
Sanshang,

320
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,540
have you ever flown a kite?

321
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,975
Ah?

322
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,620
If the kite wants to fly,

323
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,660
there must be a person on the ground
to hold the string.

324
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,100
Or, the kite will fall.

325
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,289
Yes.

326
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,460
You’re the one who flies the kite.

327
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,700
I’m not good at flying kites.

328
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,220
When I flew a kite before,

329
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,420
either it would hang in the trees
or the line would break.

330
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,460
Alright.

331
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,460
You’re really a dork.

332
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,700
If Kaixin wants to fly a kite,

333
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,700
I’m willing to do it with her.

334
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,620
How is it?

335
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,340
Girl,

336
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,380
have you decided?

337
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,420
I… Do I really need to cut my bones?

338
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,260
Can I just get face slimming injections?

339
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,820
I have told you

340
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,940
clearly before.

341
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,780
Now your biggest problem

342
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,780
is the shape of your face.

343
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,340
The shape of your face

344
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,580
has nothing to do with
your facial muscles.

345
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,220
It’s a problem of your jaw bone.

346
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,740
Girl,

347
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,740
since you’re already here,

348
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,820
just be brave

349
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,740
and make the difficult first step.

350
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,540
Maybe I should think about it.

351
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,260
You told me that you like acting.

352
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,020
You want yourself to be prettier.

353
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,940
Nowadays,

354
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,260
it’s all about the face.

355
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,740
Alright.

356
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,125
Well, is this surgery

357
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,460
really safe?

358
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,780
Whether at home or abroad,

359
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,300
we are the first class.

360
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,380
Alright,

361
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,140
I’ll do it.

362
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,900
OK.

363
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,860
Girl,

364
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,420
I know you can do this.

365
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,400
Let me

366
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,380
give you a hospitalization procedure.

367
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,580
I want to play this!

368
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,600
No more playing.

369
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,860
- You have played just now.
- The toys!

370
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,150
Toys!

371
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,700
Toys!

372
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,675
I want the toys!

373
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,675
Kids, wanna some sweets?

374
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:49,900
- Wait.
- Time for sweets!

375
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,540
Go back to your seats

376
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,700
if you want sweets.

377
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,740
I’ll give them to you.

378
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,420
OK?

379
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,060
Come on.

380
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,300
Fill in the blanks.

381
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,540
Name, and your phone number.

382
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,220
Oh. By the way,

383
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,220
the most important thing is

384
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,140
number and name of your

385
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,820
emergency contact.

386
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,220
Time for sweets!

387
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,700
You can only have one each.

388
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,675
(Kaixin)

389
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,660
Sanshang.

390
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:28,875
Yes?

391
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,100
I can also get one?

392
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,980
Of course.

393
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,740
I’m not a kid.

394
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,700
But you can also get a reward.

395
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,380
Wait.

396
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,580
Let me help you.

397
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,625
(Connected Kaixin)

398
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,620
Wait.

399
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,820
Let me help you.

400
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,675
(Signature: Hao Kaixin)

401
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,100
OK.

402
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,820
Wait for a moment here.

403
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,860
I’ll go to

404
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,340
arrange surgery and
hospitalization for you.

405
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:03,125
Excuse me.

406
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,620
Hello, sir.

407
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,980
Do you know if there is a family

408
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,860
named Du around here?

409
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,500
Due?

410
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,340
D-U, du.

411
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,300
Du.

412
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:17,060
Which family do you mean?

413
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,500
There are many of them.

414
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,460
One over here

415
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,420
and one over there.

416
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,140
And a family out there fishing.

417
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,540
Which one do you want?

418
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,460
Their surname is Du.

419
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,580
And the son is called Du Ang.

420
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,660
Do you know him?

421
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,950
Duang?

422
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,100
Duang?

423
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,620
No. Not duang.

424
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,580
It’s Du Ang.

425
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,700
Du…

426
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,969
Ask someone else. I’m busy now.

427
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,700
I’m going to pick up my goods.

428
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:39,780
That’s it.

429
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,140
Thank you.

430
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,500
Sir, excuse me.

431
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,820
Do you know if there is a family

432
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,500
named Du around here?

433
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,700
You mean the one who sells toy guns?

434
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,900
Yes, right!

435
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,220
Do you know where their house is?

436
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,205
It’s far.

437
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:00,260
Oh.

438
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,940
Well.

439
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,780
Go right to the south.

440
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,060
You can see a shabby house.

441
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,900
That’s their house.

442
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,900
There?

443
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,820
Yes. Over there.

444
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,100
Thank you, sir.

445
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:08,580
Miss,

446
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
it’s pretty dangerous there!

447
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,340
Why are you here?

448
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,060
Sorry.

449
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,380
Someone was following me just now.

450
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,220
How do you know I am here?

451
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,180
I won’t go back

452
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,060
even if you find me.

453
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,020
Hey, look at you.

454
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,420
You don’t even ask how the crew

455
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,900
is doing now.

456
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,060
You don’t even ask

457
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,140
how everyone is worried about you.

458
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,180
The first thing you’re telling me

459
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,380
is that you’re not going back.

460
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,060
You didn’t ask me why I am here.

461
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,300
You just asked me to go back directly.

462
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,700
I won’t go back.

463
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,860
I feel ashamed to go back.

464
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,660
Du Ang,

465
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,180
we have all

466
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,660
known your situation.

467
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,420
Du.

468
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,780
Mom, why are you here?

469
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,860
Son, don’t be afraid.

470
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,340
I’m here

471
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,660
to back you up.

472
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,060
How dare they

473
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,780
replace you with someone else?

474
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,860
I think you’re doing well.

475
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,820
Mom,

476
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,660
just let them be.

477
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
I didn’t do a good job.

478
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,460
I accept it.

479
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,620
No way.

480
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,780
Mr. Sun,

481
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,060
you’re reasonable.

482
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,620
Let me tell you the truth.

483
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,260
You can replace

484
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,940
anyone in the crew

485
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,580
except for my son.

486
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,860
He is different from others.

487
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,100
Why am I different?

488
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:05,900
Wait.

489
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,340
Mrs. Du,

490
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,180
this should be decided by the crew.

491
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,460
I can’t make the call.

492
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,300
What?

493
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,060
Mom, let it go.

494
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,500
Let’s go home. Come on.

495
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,220
Shut up.

496
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,100
I don’t care.

497
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,220
You can’t replace my son.

498
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,940
I paid Wang Hai so much money

499
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,020
just to make my son play the role.

500
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,980
Now Wang Hai is missing.

501
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,340
But you can’t deny it!

502
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,940
Mom,

503
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,975
what did you say?

504
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,340
Mrs. Du.

505
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,650
Please calm down
and tell us the detail.

506
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,740
Du Ang,

507
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,100
you know,

508
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,140
after you left,

509
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
Mr. Sun has been

510
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,420
under so much pressure.

511
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,900
An actor with bad acting skills

512
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,180
could even play the supporting male.

513
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,180
When he was scolded by others
for his bad acting skills,

514
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,300
he was constantly thinking about

515
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,340
how he could improve his acting skills

516
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,420
and how he could play the role well.

517
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,260
But suddenly someone told him

518
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,460
that he didn’t deserve the role

519
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,100
because it was bought with money

520
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,540
and it’s a fact.

521
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,620
How do you think he should feel?

522
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,260
I know Fang Yan is playing my role.

523
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,220
Mr. Sun is also fully capable of

524
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,100
making the crew work properly.

525
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,980
In fact, it’s the same

526
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,140
with or without me.

527
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,875
But…

528
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,420
But,

529
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,780
don’t you think your behavior

530
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,220
is particularly irresponsible?

531
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,340
What is being responsible?

532
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,380
When I was a child,

533
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,220
my parents were always out on business,

534
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,820
often away from home.

535
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,300
When they finally came home,

536
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,420
they had to discuss business

537
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,180
and didn’t care about me.

538
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,220
Even when I was injured outside,

539
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,900
no one

540
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,100
could notice it when I got home.

541
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,700
I remember sitting

542
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,940
on the beach with my friends,

543
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,700
watching the fishermen
collect their boats.

544
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,700
We went into the sea to catch fish.

545
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,420
We sang and danced

546
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,220
and had a lot of fun.

547
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,580
When the evening came,

548
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,780
their mothers and fathers

549
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,980
took them home one by one,

550
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,060
leaving me sitting alone

551
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,940
on the beach,

552
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,420
waiting for my mom and dad.

553
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,460
But they didn’t come.

554
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,260
I envied those kids so much

555
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,780
because they had their moms
and dads with them.

556
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,380
I would be satisfied if my parents

557
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,580
could celebrate my birthday for me once.

558
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,660
It’s cold out here.

559
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,260
You should go back now.

560
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,740
Du Ang,

561
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,580
there are people caring about you.

562
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,540
I got this from the temple.

563
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,260
The master said

564
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,980
it could protect the inner peace.

565
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,060
Take it with you.

566
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,220
Why are you giving me this?

567
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,180
I…

568
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,580
I…

569
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,500
I won’t take it

570
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,020
if you don’t tell me.

571
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,820
Du Ang!

572
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,540
I adore you!

573
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:42,171
♪I reached out my hand♪

One day at dusk,

602
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,340
there was a flock of big beautiful birds

flying out of the bushes.

607

00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,660
And long, thin necks.

610
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,820

611
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,140
They were so beautiful…

612
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,820
They were so beautiful…

613
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,100
That the ugly duckling envied them.

614
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,700
That the ugly duckling envied them.

615
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,980
They flew especially high.

616
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,740
They flew especially high.

617
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,220
The ugly duckling thought

618
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,220
how wonderful it would be
if he could do the same.

619
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,020

00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,460
He would love to go and talk to them.

624
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,780
But he is afraid that

625
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,140
he will be bullied
because of his ugly appearance.

626
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,900

660
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,980
Take this artist manual back

661
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,820
and read it carefully.

662
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,060
Discuss it with your family.

663
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,260
And think about it yourself

664
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,460
whether this is what you want or not.

665
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,380
It’s not in a hurry.

666
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Come back for the signing
when you’re ready.

667
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:53,275
OK.

668
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:55,060
I gotta go.

669
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,900
See you, Ms. Tang.

670
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,820
What do you want to have?

671
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:12,780
Chief,

672
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,140
didn’t you go to act in a film?

673
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,800
Saturday night at 7:00 PM,

674
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,620
our club officially resumes activities.

675
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
Nice!

676
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,580
Hello, Mrs. Chief.

677
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,700
Come on, let me get you some food.

678
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,275
Qiyi,

679
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,140
how is your interview?

680
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,660
I haven’t got the result.

681
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,980
I may have to wait for some time.

682
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,980
Well, I think

683
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,940
there will be no problem.

684
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,460
Oh, right,

685
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,100
should we go to see Kaixin?

686
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,900
I asked her mom.

687
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,740
She is still not willing to meet us.

688
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,700
Sanshang goes there every day
and still fails to see her,

689
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
let alone us.

690
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,020
Yeah.

691
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,940
If we have cared about her more,

692
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,780
it might not become like this.

693
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,780
Sanshang said

694
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,660
Kaixin will remove
the bandage tomorrow.

695
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,260
Does she know what happened
to her face?

696
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,220
Her mother didn’t dare
to tell her.

697
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,700
I think we should go to see her.

698
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,460
Even if we can only see her
from the window.

699
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,600
OK.

700
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,620
Let’s go together tomorrow.

701
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,500
I’ll take Sanshang with us.

702
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,660
I gotta go now.

703
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,500
Enjoy.

704
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,775
What…

705
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,100
Why is he in such a hurry?

706
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,860
Don’t you know that?

707
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,340
After he left the crew last time,

708
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,620
his father got really angry

709
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,820
and stopped paying his tuition fee.

710
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,700
Now he needs to earn the money.

711
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,220
Didn’t he tell you?

712
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,260
From the beginning until now,

713
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,420
I haven’t officially thanked you yet.

714
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,300
If you have to say that,

715
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,300
I don’t dare to drink this.

716
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,900
Well,

717
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,460
let’s talk about our next plan.

718
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,580
I don’t want to talk about work.

719
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,620
What else?

720
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,100
Is there nothing else

721
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,620
to talk about

722
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,020
between us except work?

723
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,300
Zhuowen,

724
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,020
you always wanted to escape.

725
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,500
I understand.

726
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,420
But now

727
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,820
everything turns to be fine.

728
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,220
Can we

729
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,300
get back together like before?

730
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,780
What’s past is already the past.

731
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,460
You can look back to it.

732
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,140
But it cannot go back.

733
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,700
Why?

734
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,540
Everyone objected to it,

735
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,340
but I insisted on choosing you.

736
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,500
I chose not only you

737
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,380
but also your students.

738
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,860
That’s why

739
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,300
I’m really

740
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,380
grateful.

741
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,580
Thank you.

742
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,820
I’ll drink it up.

743
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,380
Thanks.

744
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,460
If so, I’m leaving now.
