24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,375
What about now?

25
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,340
(Gentle and Pleasant Breeze)
In your face!

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,180
You’re going all out, aren’t you?

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,380
Chess game is like teaching.

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,950
Sometimes,

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,300
when you think you’re losing it,

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,540
one right move

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,780
might change everything.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,140
Similarly,

33
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,100
with proper guidance,

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,340
even those troublemakers

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,540
will shine in their own way.

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,580
Zhang,

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,780
you’re unusually chatty today.

38
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,860
I’ve been thinking about

39
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,300
our new students this year.

40
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Those kids

41
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,140
ran laps half-naked in public,

42
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,740
and they went straight to see Huang Bo

43
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,380
when their friend had to quit school.

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,820
Fang Yan surprised me most

45
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,060
because he never gives up.

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,420
Few in their generation

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,500
know exactly

48
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,140
what they want.

49
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,140
Agreed.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,540
But Lu Qiyi is one of them.

51
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,140
That young lady

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,980
is as persistent as your generation.

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,060
Actually, she reminds me of Li Xun.

54
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,380
Those kids all have their dreams.

55
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,300
And you?

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,900
What about yours?

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,740
It can’t be

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,900
playing chess with an old man

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,460
for the rest of your life, right?

60
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:29,150
Yeah?

61
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,860
Bravo!

62
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,780
OK. Gather round!

63
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,820
Today’s training is very productive.

64
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,820
Take five

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,660
and do it one more time, OK?

66
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,700
Sure.

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,140
I’ll be right back.

68
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,300
Where are you going?

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,260
To thank Mr. Sun.

70
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,180
OK. Go ahead.

71
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:20,925
Hi.

72
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,620
Don’t bring us snacks

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,860
next time.

74
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,980
You’re always welcome here.

75
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,775
It’s nothing.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,420
Fang Yan.

77
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,460
Let’s talk outside.

78
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,420
See you.

79
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,555
Qiyi.

80
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:43,075
Yeah?

81
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,610
Have you convinced your folks?

82
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,180
Not yet.

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,180
They need to see how well I can do.

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,940
But first,

85
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,580
I gotta pass the make-up exam.

86
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,380
Oh, no, sorry,

87
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,860
I almost forgot.

88
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,340
Those who missed exams would get an F.

89
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,650
What?

90
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,900
Why?

91
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,900
Most seniors skipped exams

92
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,100
for their shooting

93
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,460
and that drove the Dean so mad

94
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,940
that he said whoever didn’t show up

95
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,275
would all get an F. No make-ups.

96
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,260
Uh...

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,340
I’ll go talk to Mr. Sun.

98
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,940
He can’t help you with that.

99
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,175
Then...

100
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,980
Then I’ll go see the Dean.

101
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,140
Yep, he’s the one in charge.

102
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,140
By the way,

103
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,900
Fang Yan was a no-show, too.

104
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,420
You two can go to his office together.

105
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,220
I understand

106
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,860
your situation,

107
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:44,660
but

108
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,540
the school has made it clear

109
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,700
that if you missed the exam,

110
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,380
you failed it.

111
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,500
Is there

112
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,340
nothing I can do?

113
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,340
I see.

114
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,875
Thank you, sir.

115
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,325
I’m sorry for the trouble.

116
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,000
Hey.

117
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,860
Hold on.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,740
Come here.

119
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,060
What do you think of Mr. Sun?

120
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,060
Mr. Sun?

121
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,420
I mean, do you want him

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,740
to be a director?

123
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,050
Here’s the thing.

124
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,460
He had quite a career in directing

125
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,250
before coming here to teach.

126
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,340
We’ve always hoped

127
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,220
that he’ll pick up his old job.

128
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
You kids are his students.

129
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,700
Maybe he’ll listen to you.

130
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,860
Try to talk to him

131
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,340
to come back to the industry.

132
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,900
He wouldn’t listen to us

133
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,740
but he cares nothing
more than his students,

134
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,820
especially your class.

135
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,420
Look,

136
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,980
if you

137
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,820
manage to talk him into doing it,

138
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,260
I’ll arrange

139
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,180
your make-up.

140
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,740
Really, sir?

141
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,140
OK.

142
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,420
Yeah?

143
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,600
Deal.

144
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,950
Deal.

145
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,375
Qiyi, how have you been?

146
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,650
Any progress with Mr. Sun?

147
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,980
Keep in touch, girl.

148
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,420
Li Xun,

149
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,700
we need to talk.

150
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,540
Du Ang.

151
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,220
There you are.

152
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,940
What do you think?

153
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,460
Pretty cool, huh?

154
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,940
Is that iron setting enough

155
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,140
for you to say “I like you, Qiyi”?

156
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,820
Of course not.

157
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,460
More stuff is on the way.

158
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,300
You know what?

159
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,060
I’m gonna sing to Qiyi

160
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,420
right outside

161
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,460
this iron gate

162
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,540
where we first met.

163
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,140
Awesome!

164
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,700
Hey,

165
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,425
she’s still in the dark, isn’t she?

166
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,980
Trust me, dude.

167
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,980
I’m good with secrets.

168
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,475
Zimo,

169
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,580
I have a difficult job for you,

170
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,525
that is, to be my camera girl.

171
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,700
This grandstanding

172
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,780
is very your style.

173
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,575
No doubt.

174
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,325
Whatever.

175
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,220
I know you’re envious and jealous.

176
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,220
What’s up?

177
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,325
I wanna have my bandage removed.

178
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,700
I’ll go to the Health Center with you.

179
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,420
Du Ang,

180
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,980
we’re gonna take her bandage off.

181
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,820
Be right back.

182
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:23,700
OK.

183
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,700
I can go with you.

184
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,260
No, you can’t!

185
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,420
Zimo,

186
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,980
you’re sweet and nice.

187
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,340
I need you for behind-the-scene shots.

188
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,580
OK. Give this iron gate a close-up.

189
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
Come with me.

190
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,660
Let’s reproduce that scene.

191
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,300
You know what Qiyi was doing
when I saw her?

192
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,550
She was like this,

193
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,180
sitting... over the gate.

194
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,980
Legs spread,

195
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,740
facing this side.

196
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,650
Here you are, Mr. Sun.

197
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,780
No, thanks.

198
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,780
That’s too kind of you.

199
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,660
I don’t need it.

200
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:06,140
Like a drink from your colleague

201
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,220
would ruin you as a director.

202
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,580
Who says I’m gonna be a director?

203
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,420
You aren’t?

204
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,460
Everyone is saying it.

205
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,250
It’s a great opportunity

206
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,820
and you’ll be working with
that A-Lister, Li Xun.

207
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,220
Ms. Tang,

208
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,620
that’s false information.

209
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,740
I won’t direct.

210
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,900
Honestly,

211
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,700
we kind of hope you’ll do it.

212
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
I always believe

213
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,900
you have what it takes

214
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,820
to be a director.

215
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,020
Ms. Tang,

216
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,060
what makes you think that?

217
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Didn’t you direct that...

218
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,940
Ms. Tang,

219
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,940
I’ll take your drink.

220
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,460
It’s about time

221
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,380
for your class.

222
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,420
I’m going.

223
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,860
Mr. Sun,

224
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,075
I always tell my students

225
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,980
that if you love what you’re seeing,

226
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,900
then fight for it.

227
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,125
Grab the chance,

228
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
or it’ll be too late to regret.

229
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,875
I know.

230
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,900
Alright. Forget about that.

231
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,620
I’ve said enough.

232
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,775
See you after class.

233
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,300
Fang Yan?

234
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,980
Ms. Tang.

235
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,020
Are you here to see Mr. Sun?

236
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,625
Not exactly.

237
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,060
I should go.

238
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,100
Wait!

239
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,580
You got a minute later?

240
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,860
Li Xun.

241
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,175
How did it go?

242
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,540
You didn’t know

243
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,100
it’d be that hard
to convince him, did you?

244
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,700
I know him all too well.

245
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,940
He’s stubborn as a mule

246
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,300
all these years.

247
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,220
He doesn’t

248
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,180
listen to anyone.

249
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,125
Unless

250
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,700
he opens his heart to others,

251
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,550
no one can go near it.

252
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,775
Li Xun,

253
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,700
I don’t get it.

254
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,740
You’ve talked to him

255
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,940
and so have the others.

256
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,420
Even the Dean asked me to try it.

257
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,100
We all want so bad

258
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,980
for him to be a director again.

259
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,660
Why is he against the idea so firmly?

260
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,300
I don’t know

261
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,580
if you have looked into him.

262
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,500
Well,

263
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,100
with new info popping up every day,

264
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,860
old news about him must’ve been
buried deep on the Internet.

265
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,250
Back in the day,

266
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,850
when he first appeared

267
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,200
as a new director in the industry,

268
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,740
he was in luck

269
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,300
that his very first work was a success.

270
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,660
After that, investors fought for him

271
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,975
to direct their films.

272
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,125
He waited and waited.

273
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,660
Finally, he could do a film he liked.

274
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,460
He asked his friend,

275
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,100
a rising star, in person

276
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,550
to be the lead.

277
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,050
Sadly,

278
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,700
during the filming,

279
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,700
something happened.

280
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,550
Mr. Sun,

281
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,450
at this point,

282
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,620
only your students can help you.

283
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,950
Watch out!

284
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,980
What are you doing here?

285
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,100
Eyes on the road.

286
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,580
Or you could get hit.

287
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,620
Why are you here?

288
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,740
To look for someone.

289
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,420
Just focus on your thing.

290
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,900
I certainly will.

291
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:03,900
Hey!

292
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,400
Why are you following me?

293
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,860
I’m not.

294
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,460
I’m in front of you the whole time, no?

295
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,460
I don’t care who you’re here to see,

296
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,500
but from now on,

297
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
stay away from me

298
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,340
and I’ll do the same to you.

299
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,220
I’m going...

300
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,900
I’m going that way.

301
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,900
Are you sure?

302
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,620
100 percent sure!

303
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,220
Go ahead.

304
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,260
You first.

305
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,500
Hey!

306
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,100
What do you want?

307
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,900
I can explain.

308
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,540
We’re looking for the same person.

309
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,580
How do you know that?

310
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,220
Ms. Tang told me.

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,975
(Du Ang: I’m gonna
make a big move tonight!)

312
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:16,791
(Du Ang: Qiyi, meet me at the iron gate
at 8:00 PM! It’s important!)

313
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,469
(Qiyi: OK.)

314
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,586
(May God of Wealth bring us fortune.
Guests are always welcome.)

315
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,420
Who are you here for?

316
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,460
- Mr. Lu Tao.
- Mr. Lu Tao.

317
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Are you here together?

318
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,950
- No.
- Yes.

319
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Do you know each other?

320
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:58,420
- No.
- Yes.

321
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,820
Who is it?

322
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,020
How can I help you?

323
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,400
Come in.

324
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,200
Dean.

325
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,740
What’s up?

326
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,740
It’s you.

327
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,260
That’s too polite of you to knock.

328
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,420
Take a seat.

329
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:23,075
Thanks.

330
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,380
What can I do for you?

331
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,900
Read this first.

332
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,180
What is it?

333
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,020
Your student,

334
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,660
Li Sanshang’s application for a grant,

335
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,900
has been signed off.

336
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,020
Thank you. Thank you very much.

337
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,660
I owe you one.

338
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,780
Me?

339
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,420
Not me.

340
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,140
You should thank Ms. Tang.

341
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,300
She fought hard for you.

342
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Ms. Tang?

343
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,880
Yeah.

344
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,525
Uh...

345
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,300
She...

346
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,140
Why...

347
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,820
My iron leg

348
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,940
has already started to miss side kicks,

349
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,380
back kicks and spin kicks.

350
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,700
Even when the bandage is off,

351
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,420
it’s still too soon
to kick anyone in any way.

352
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,325
(Treatment Room)

353
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,900
I’m gonna remove your bandage.

354
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,860
Wait.

355
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,340
Can we... can we take a rain check?

356
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
A rain check?

357
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,340
No, I’m afraid.

358
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,660
Besides,

359
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,260
you can’t wear the bandage too long.

360
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,180
Xiaoyu is right.

361
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,740
Let her take it off.

362
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,660
I’m doing it.

363
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,820
All done.

364
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,020
So, Sanshang,

365
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,675
is she your girlfriend?

366
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:25,475
What?

367
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:26,770
She...

368
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,180
Yeah.

369
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,100
He’s sweet and caring.

370
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,580
Good to know.

371
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:36,800
By the way,

372
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,775
be careful when you walk

373
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,500
without the bandage.

374
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,420
Are you upset?

375
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,420
Why should I be?

376
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,540
Don’t get me wrong.

377
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,620
I only said that

378
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,540
to get back at her for you.

379
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,740
It didn’t mean anything.

380
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
I know.

381
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,250
Hey,

382
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,140
Xiaoyu,

383
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,820
have you made your decision?

384
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,860
Yeah.

385
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,900
I have.

386
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,600
So?

387
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,740
I don’t like you.

388
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:19,525
Wait!

389
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,820
Why?

390
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,300
There’s no reason.

391
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,460
Think again.

392
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,020
You...

393
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
Please!

394
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,980
Jiang Xiaoyu,

395
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,460
I will make you mine!

396
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,620
Ms. Tang.

397
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:36,275
Yeah?

398
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,980
Let’s grab a bite together.

399
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Yeah... sure.

400
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,980
Where to?

401
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,500
What do you think?

402
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,780
This place

403
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,060
isn’t too bad, yeah?

404
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,250
I didn’t know

405
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,900
they had such a quiet place in town.

406
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,940
There you are.

407
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,420
Let me introduce you to each other.

408
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,540
Ms. Tang, my coworker at school.

409
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,940
The owner of this bar,

410
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,140
Mr. Fu.

411
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,340
Hello.

412
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,500
Nice to meet you, Ms. Tang.

413
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,220
Mr. Fu,

414
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,580
the usual three, please.

415
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:30,325
Got it.

416
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,020
Have a seat.

417
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,260
Enjoy yourselves.

418
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,020
Thanks.

419
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,860
How do you feel?

420
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,200
Do you like this place?

421
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,975
Yeah.

422
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,100
It’s quite nice.

423
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,740
Ms. Tang,

424
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,660
taste it.

425
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,350
No.

426
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,580
You’re doing it wrong.

427
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,460
Look at me.

428
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,700
Watch and learn.

429
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,060
Your turn.

430
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,980
Is it good?

431
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Now, I see

432
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,820
why you did three shots together.

433
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,980
It’s too small for a cup.

434
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,660
One shot barely gave you anything.

435
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,940
And you only got the taste
after three of them.

436
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,460
Ms. Tang,

437
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,660
you’re clever.

438
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,300
Sometimes,

439
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,060
films and drinks are alike.

440
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,460
They can both get you drunk.

441
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,020
“Of all the gin joints,

442
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,660
in all the towns in all the world...

443
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,940
She walks into mine”.

444
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,100
Casablanca!

445
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,660
To the classic!

446
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:27,460
I’m surprised that you like it, too.

447
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,260
Try the food.

448
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,460
Pick it up.

449
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,300
Yeah?

450
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,300
Mr. Sun,

451
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,975
Fang Yan... Fang Yan is in danger!

452
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,225
What?

453
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,940
Fang Yan!

454
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:07,900
Hey!

455
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,100
He’s there!

456
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,225
Fang Yan,

457
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,380
get down!

458
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,140
You could die!

459
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Get off now!

460
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,620
Sir,

461
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,020
what happened to Lu Tao was an accident.

462
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,980
You would’ve stopped him

463
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,420
if you had been there.

464
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,980
But nobody saw that coming

465
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,060
or could prevent it beforehand!

466
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,100
It wasn’t your fault!

467
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,260
Sir!

468
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,420
Mr. Sun!

469
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,900
We know why you quit directing.

470
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
But that thing happened a long time ago.

471
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,580
Why can’t you

472
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,300
put it behind and move on?

473
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,340
Is this all part of your plan?

474
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,775
Are you in it, too?

475
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,820
What the hell are you up to?

476
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,060
What do you know?

477
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,660
Do you have any idea how it feels

478
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,900
to have someone crippled
permanently

479
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,220
and see a rising star fall forever

480
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,540
because of that?

481
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,250
You don’t!

482
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,800
But I do!

483
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,380
Because I caused all that!

484
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,020
I’m a sinner!

485
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,940
Who are you to tell me to move on?

486
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,740
Do you have the right to lecture me?

487
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,740
Yeah.

488
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,580
They don’t.

489
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,500
But do I?

490
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,020
Tao...

491
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
You’ve refused to see me

492
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,820
over the years.

493
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,380
I’ve let go of the past

494
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,820
but clearly, you haven’t

495
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,220
and you’re using it to torture yourself.

496
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,060
Now that we’re here,

497
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,460
can we have a heart-to-heart?

498
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,140
I’ve never blamed you

499
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,980
for what happened.

500
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,220
Never ever.

501
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,300
Back then,

502
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,500
even if you hadn’t asked me,

503
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,740
I would’ve jumped again

504
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,660
until we got the perfect shot.

505
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,460
Have you

506
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,860
forgotten about our dream?

507
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,180
That we’d never

508
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,075
give up on the pursuit of art
no matter what.

509
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,820
But...

510
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,420
But you didn’t follow through.

511
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,060
You left your career
and everything for me.

512
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,940
It’s time to come back
and pull yourself together,

513
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,950
you hear?

514
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,780
I’m so sorry!

515
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,820
I really am!

516
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,420
Don’t ever give up your passion again.

517
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,420
True friends

518
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,020
will always

519
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,820
have each other’s backs.

520
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,020
I know you can do it.

521
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,020
Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

522
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,740
Thanks a lot.

523
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,380
Let’s go get them some water.

524
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,380
Hurry!

525
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:05,925
OK.

526
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,625
Kaixin,

527
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,100
can you text Qiyi?

528
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,420
Copy that.

Pretty good.

570
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,420
I drink fine, eat fine

571
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,620
and sleep fine.

572
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,460
But, hey,

573
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,060
if you still see me as your friend,

574
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,420
then take this film

575
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,340
and do your best.

00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,940
gonna be a director again.

579
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,860
I know you best.

580
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,820
When I just learned

581
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,660
about my leg,

582
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,220
I was devastated.

583
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,740
Truth be told,

584
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,980
I even considered suicide.

585
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,980
But then it hit me

586
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,180
that we’re all actors,

587
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,660
playing various roles

588
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,700
in our life.

589
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,220
At first,

590
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,860
I could play my role standing,

591
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,620
walking,

592
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,420
running,

593
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,740
jumping,

594
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,740
and whatnot.

595
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,020
But then,

596
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,140
my storyline changed

597
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,700
and so did the given situation

598
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,540
that I could only be in a wheelchair

599
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,780
or use walking sticks.

600
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,020
But all that was fine.

601
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,900
Art for art’s sake.

602
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,460
I had to accept the change of fate.

603
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,940
Even if I couldn’t be up again,

604
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,020
I had to continue playing my role

605
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,140
to perfection.

606
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,140
And,

607
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,420
do you know why?

608
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,780
Because I hate to

609
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,220
lose my faith again.

610
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,180
Despite my physical disability,

611
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,940
I can still be a good actor.

612
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,540
But look at you.

613
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,325
You threw away

614
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,380
your faith

615
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,500
and years-long dream over my broken leg.

616
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,220
Is it really worth it?

617
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,350
Is it?

618
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
I poured out my heart to you,

619
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,940
but you still feel nothing.

620
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,220
In that case,

621
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,340
I guess I’ll have to beg you.

622
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,420
I’ll do it.

623
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,940
If that’s what you need.

624
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,900
I’m...

625
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,540
standing up to beg you.

626
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,700
Tao... Don’t...

627
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,860
Will you do it or not?

628
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,500
What are you doing?

629
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,020
Be careful, Tao!

630
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,420
Yes or no?

631
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,060
Stop it!

632
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:57,780
Tao...

633
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,740
Will you do it or not?

634
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,300
I’ll do it!

635
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,820
I’ll do it, man!

636
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,300
You will?

637
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,260
I’ll direct that film.

638
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,180
I heard that.

639
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,380
Yes, that’s right.

640
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,100
You’re a man.

641
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,740
Every word you say counts.

642
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,620
A promise is a promise.

643
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,420
It is. Sit back.

644
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,420
- Come on!
- Sit.

645
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,300
Drink up!

646
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:32,559
(Du Ang: It’s late.
Let’s meet some other day.)

647
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,780
Sorry,

648
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,660
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

649
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,380
Sorry...

650
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:11,660
Congrats

651
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,500
on the success of your club.

652
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:14,940
Thanks.

653
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,700
You sound awfully cold

654
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,620
given that we had so much fun together

655
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,940
back in the old days.

656
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,540
We did

657
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,660
but the past is the past.

658
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,340
Fang Yan,

659
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,140
I’m not asking for too much

660
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,140
except for better treatment

661
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,260
when we’re together.

662
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,180
Could you at least treat me as a friend?

663
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,940
I could.

664
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,580
Could you do the same?

665
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,340
Please

666
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,540
don’t do such things for me again.

667
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,140
Fang Yan,

668
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,260
I like you.

669
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:24,140
I was drawn to you when we first met.

670
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,940
Don’t you have any feelings for me?

671
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,220
I’m sorry.

672
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,500
I’m in love with someone else.

673
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,540
Are you OK?

674
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,940
Why did you drink so much?

675
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,060
I’m fine.

676
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,780
Bai Qiao,

677
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,100
what happened?

678
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,175
Is something bothering you?

679
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,100
Why don’t you go take a shower?
