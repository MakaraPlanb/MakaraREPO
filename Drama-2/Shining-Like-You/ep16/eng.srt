Kaixin!

Sanshang!

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,780
Are you hurt?

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,940
They won’t let me go until I pay for it.

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,580
Isn’t this Bai Qiao?

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,540
You came with so many pals of yours.

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,775
Ox,

31
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,940
we came with money.

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,620
50,000 yuan.

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,820
Not a penny less, right?

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,740
We’re all students.

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,900
We don’t have much money.

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,900
We can only scrape together 20,000 yuan.

37
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,620
Can you please...?

38
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,660
No.

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,060
No money,

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,380
no one leaves.

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,260
Easy, easy.

42
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,980
You’re all students

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,125
on a tight budget.

44
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:21,580
However,

45
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,060
it is Kaixin’s fault.

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,180
The hospital just called.

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,940
The actor is hurt badly.

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,580
Aside from the medical cost,

49
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,420
his absence for one day

50
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,100
incurs a lot of costs.

51
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,060
50,000 yuan is really the best I can do.

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,800
I didn’t even touch him.

53
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,100
Ridiculous!

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,380
You didn’t touch him?

55
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,060
Are you saying he fell?

56
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,460
Yes, he did!

57
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,060
He lost balance after the kick

58
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,260
and fell down.

59
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,125
Ox,

60
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,980
how about this?

61
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,340
They’re both responsible for it.

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,060
Here is 20,000 yuan.

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,420
Take it

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
as our apology.

65
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,140
20,000 yuan?

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,620
Then...

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,340
We’ll take Kaixin with us.

68
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,275
Kaixin.

69
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,100
Stop!

70
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,460
You think this is your home

71
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,700
where you can come and go as you wish?

72
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,780
You college students

73
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,460
are so unreasonable.

74
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,020
You don’t compensate

75
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,100
the person you hurt.

76
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,740
I’m telling you.

77
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,540
You hurt Agentai.

78
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,380
And for that,

79
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,460
you won’t have a future in Showbiz.

80
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,500
Look,

81
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,380
either you pay us 50,000 yuan

82
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,220
or none of you leave.

83
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,900
Cut the nonsense, you sissy.

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,860
Murder!

85
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,580
Get them!

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,340
Now!

87
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,580
As the saying goes,

88
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,180
“There are plenty of fish in the sea.”

89
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,820
Why should I set my eyes
only in my class?

90
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,660
How do I fall for Lu Qiyi?

91
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,100
I’m silly, aren’t I?

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,860
What’s so great about her?

93
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,460
She’s just fair-looking,

94
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,860
with fair skin

95
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,260
and a pure heart.

96
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,620
A little cute

97
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,275
and dorky.

98
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,540
What’s so great about that?

99
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,340
Right?

100
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,620
Fang Yan, on the other hand,

101
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,220
is a wicked man.

102
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,220
He swore to me

103
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,180
there was nothing
between Lu Qiyi and him.

104
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,675
But the next day,

105
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,140
the next day

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,460
they were holding hands.

107
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,900
How do you think I can swallow this?

108
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,925
He likes to undermine others,
doesn’t he?

109
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,700
And he undermines his pal.

110
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,220
It’s disgusting, isn’t it?

111
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,140
Do you think it’s disgusting?

112
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,475
What?

113
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,420
Ask him.

114
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,580
I can’t.

115
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,300
It’s awkward.

116
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,580
You dare not to?

117
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,980
Then stop whining.

118
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,380
Who said I dare not to?

119
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,980
I... I’ll ask him right now

120
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,980
if he enjoys taking others’ girlfriends,

121
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,660
especially...

122
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,340
especially his pal’s.

123
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:48,300
(Fang Yan)

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,475
Hello?

125
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,420
Aren’t you guys rehearsing?

126
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,820
OK, I got it.

127
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,425
Alright.

128
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:05,660
Let’s go.

129
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,420
They’re in trouble.

130
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,660
Come on!

131
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,700
I’m sorry.

132
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,340
There’s an emergency.

133
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,180
I can’t stay for the birthday party.

134
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,940
I’ll call you later.

135
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,425
Hello?

Where’s Mr. Sun?

139
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,540
Students in his class are in trouble.

140
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,620
Mr. Sun, please take a seat.

141
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,820
Xun will come soon.

142
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,420
OK.

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,940
Where were you?

165
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,420
We have a big problem here.

166
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,660
But I couldn’t reach you!

167
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,980
I’m sorry.

168
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,380
You’re sorry?

169
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,140
The university repeatedly

170
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,340
stated that

171
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,700
freshmen are not allowed
to act in TV works.

172
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,140
Look at your students.

173
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,340
They acted

174
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,580
and had a fight with people
outside the campus.

175
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,740
It’s gone viral on the Internet.

176
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,500
How am I supposed to clear up
the mess for you?

177
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,340
How? You tell me.

178
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,140
Dean,

179
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,020
the students are young and ignorant.

180
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,020
I’m responsible.

181
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,220
I neglect their discipline.

182
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,625
OK.

183
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,650
Fortunately,

184
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,820
none of the students are injured.

185
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,180
If anything happens to them,

186
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,060
mark my words,

187
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,540
you’ll regret it.

188
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,780
Yes.

189
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,580
I’ll reflect on it.

190
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,460
So,

191
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,020
what’s the punishment to them?

192
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,675
Expulsion.

193
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:49,300
Huh?

194
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,300
What?

195
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,060
You’re worried now?

196
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,300
I’ll talk to the principal.

197
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,780
Alright. Stop.

198
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,460
I’m just kidding you.

199
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:59,860
You scared me.

200
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,380
They won’t be expelled.

201
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Because investigation concludes

202
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,580
it isn’t the students who started it.

203
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,220
However, it’ll go into their profiles.

204
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,300
That’s for sure.

205
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,660
Actually, it’s

206
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,140
not all your fault,

207
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:16,245
is it?

208
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,275
Mr. Sun,

209
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,540
your big comeback,

210
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,660
well,

211
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,340
coincides with this incident.

212
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,860
And you have to teach.

213
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,500
How about this?

214
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,660
I’ll have another teacher

215
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,780
take over your class.

216
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,740
So you can focus on the shooting.

217
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,100
No, no, no.

218
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,500
You can’t change the teacher

219
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,620
at the end of the term.

220
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:37,900
- What’s your plan then?
- No, we can’t.

221
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,250
Don’t worry.

222
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,620
Such things will never happen again.

223
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,660
I promise.

224
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,380
All right, then.

225
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,700
I know it’s not your fault.

226
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,820
The students in your class

227
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,580
are all rogue.

228
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,460
They’re good actually.

229
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,820
Alright,

230
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,340
in fact,

231
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,540
I’ve spoken to the principal for you.

232
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,300
Light punishment
for you and the students.

233
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,820
Write a review sometime.

234
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Thank you, sir.

235
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,340
Don’t thank me.

236
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,820
You should thank Ms. Tang for this.

237
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,580
Late night,

238
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,975
she picked up the students
at the police station,

239
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,420
and put in a good word for you
with the principal.

240
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,260
Yeah.

241
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,220
I’ll express my gratitude someday.

242
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,340
Someday?

243
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,900
Can you spare more thoughts

244
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,420
on your private life?

245
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,980
Zhuowen,

246
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,140
Ms. Tang is not young anymore.

247
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,220
Don’t let her wait in vain.

248
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,020
Well, if that’s all, I have to go.

249
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,660
Sir...

250
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,020
Woah, you wanna change the subject?

251
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,180
Listen,

252
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,940
your class is disqualified
from the show.

253
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,020
Come on.

254
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,860
My hands are tied.

255
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,580
The principal gave the word.

256
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,940
You should be glad they’re not expelled.

257
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,220
They’re fortunate.

258
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,300
I’m out of here.

259
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,740
Think about what I said.

260
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,300
(Huatian Apartment)

261
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,060
What is it?

262
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,260
Where were you last night?

263
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,900
Last night...

264
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,100
I waited for you all night.

265
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,820
You know?

266
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:01,420
Recently,

267
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,780
I’ve been feeling a little off
about you.

268
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,780
I came to find
you were out several nights.

269
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,380
Bai Qiao,

270
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,100
are you hiding something from me?

271
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,780
No, I’m not.

272
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,740
Will you look at me?

273
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,660
No matter what your problem is,

274
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,220
I hope you won’t lie to me.

275
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,540
I’m fine.

276
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,660
I’m really fine.

277
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,700
Last night,

278
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,580
it was something about my classmates.

279
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,180
Really?

280
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,900
Really.

281
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,220
I have to go.

282
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,700
Bye.

283
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,180
They’re all gone.

284
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,660
The most remarkable figures
are now around us.

285
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,340
Why is the end-term show

286
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,500
canceled all of a sudden?

287
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,660
Despite the battle-worn golden armors
in the desert,

288
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,260
we’ll not return
until Loulan is conquered.

289
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,580
The freshmen this year are so naughty.

290
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,580
I wonder how this is gonna end.

291
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,660
They blame me, don’t they?

292
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,820
Don’t be mistaken.

293
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,500
It’s not your fault.

294
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,100
But,

295
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,060
if I hadn’t called the police,

296
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,260
the end-term show wouldn’t
have been canceled.

297
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,660
They’ll understand.

298
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,860
What I’m worrying about now is

299
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,300
what you’re supposed
to tell your family.

300
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,460
I haven’t told them
the show’s been canceled.

301
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,020
Do you have any ideas?

302
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,940
I think a disaster is waiting for me.

303
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,140
I gathered you here

304
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,180
to rehearse for a play.

305
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,460
You have the script in your hands.

306
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,740
Read it.

307
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,460
Isn’t this the musical

308
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,380
Qiyi’s team has been practicing?

309
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,140
Yes.

310
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,140
Go through the script and lines.

311
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,860
The music will be here soon.

312
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,620
We’ve been preparing for this all term.

313
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,940
We’re finally going on stage.

314
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,980
When’s the performance, chief?

315
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,460
Tomorrow.

316
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,580
Tomorrow?

317
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,260
You must be kidding.

318
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
I’m not.

319
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,780
We’re on a tight schedule.

320
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,940
I’m counting on your hard work.

321
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,580
We’re still short of a lead singer.

322
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,260
It’s so difficult.

323
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,860
I’m more like an extra.

324
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,340
You know I can only dance.

325
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,820
Singing is really not my thing.

326
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,060
Come on.

327
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,340
Chief,

328
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,820
as you know,

329
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,980
I’m tone-deaf.

330
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,260
Li Shuang,

331
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,580
don’t you always want to
perform on stage?

332
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,660
Give it a try.

333
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,060
In just one day,

334
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,380
I can’t even remember the lines,

335
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,500
not to mention singing.

336
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,780
You guys can’t do it.

337
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,540
I’m even worse.

338
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,860
Anyway, just give it a try.

339
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,020
Don’t worry.

340
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,540
We all believe in you.

341
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,475
Hey,

342
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,780
here’s the music.

343
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,820
Right on time.

344
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,780
Have a try.

345
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,580
Let’s hear it.

346
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,980
Thank you, Du Ang.

347
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,300
Don’t thank me.

348
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,980
We’re not done yet.

349
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,220
Li Shuang.

350
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,900
Let’s hear it.

351
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,975
(Style Show Costume Rental)

352
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,420
Kaixin.

353
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,060
Hmm?

354
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,420
I searched it on the Internet.

355
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,420
This company’s rent is the lowest.

356
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,020
I’ll go have a look.

357
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,340
I’ll go with you.

358
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
Is your leg gonna be OK?

359
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,425
Yeah.

360
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,500
I might not be able to act,

361
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,060
but I can certainly walk.

362
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,380
You’d better rest in the dorm.

363
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,500
By the way,

364
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,100
Fang Yan’s idea is lame

365
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,220
to have his club members perform

366
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,580
for your family to watch.

367
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,900
I heard from Sanshang

368
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,940
that there’s no girl in his club.

369
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,460
They don’t have any girls in the club?

370
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,940
Don’t you know that?

371
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,740
Do you think Bai Qiao can do it?

372
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,380
Bai Qiao?

373
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,820
I don’t think

374
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,540
she’ll do you the favor.

375
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,460
♪Sol-ti-do♪

376
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,100
No, no, no.

377
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,180
The pitch is too high. I can’t sing.

378
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,540
Don’t worry.

379
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,620
Try again.

380
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,700
I really can’t do it.

381
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,020
The time is too short.

382
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
I’ve never been on stage before.

383
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,540
I don’t even know how to move on stage.

384
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,460
Forget it.

385
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,980
It’s really hard for you.

386
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,460
How can we give up?

387
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,420
If you give up,

388
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
what’ll happen to Qiyi?

389
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,700
Have you thought about it?

390
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,700
What can I do?

391
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,900
She’ll have to quit SUA.

392
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,860
Quit?

393
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,940
Who?

394
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,020
No one.

395
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,740
By the way, Li Shuang,

396
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,980
what was on your mind?

397
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,660
Why did you apply
for the School of Fine Arts?

398
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,940
I like fine arts.

399
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,860
Did your parents support you?

400
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Of course not.

401
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,580
My parents both served in the army.

402
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,220
They’re very conservative.

403
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,300
They wanted me to
go to a military academy.

404
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,980
Luckily, I never passed
the academic exams.

405
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,220
Then I took the admission exam
for Fine Arts

406
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,340
and I passed it.

407
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
They thought at least
I could go to college

408
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,220
and it was a famous one,

409
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,780
so they agreed.

410
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,740
In fact, we have a classmate

411
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,020
who has a similar experience with you.

412
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,660
But she’s way better
than you in academics.

413
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,220
She scored over 640/750 in CEE.

414
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,300
Over 640?

415
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
That’s sick.

416
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,140
She could have gone to
Southern Foreign Studies University.

417
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,300
But she chose our
School of Performing Arts.

418
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,780
Her parents

419
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,060
don’t approve of it.

420
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,580
They want her to quit SUA till now.

421
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
She wanted to convince her parents

422
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,180
with her performance

423
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,700
in this show.

424
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,540
You know what happened later.

425
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,060
It seems

426
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,540
she’ll have to quit.

427
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,460
Actually, I had a hard time

428
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,260
winning my family’s support.

429
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,740
They thought fine arts

430
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,820
have no prospect.

431
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,980
I feel sorry for you two.

432
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,860
Chief,

433
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,300
I’d like to try it again.

434
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,100
Thanks, man.

435
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,300
Pick a color.

436
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,075
This one.

437
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,220
It suits your skin tone better.

438
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,650
OK.

439
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,460
Come in.

440
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,980
Bai Qiao,

441
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,980
I want to ask for a favor.

442
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,820
What kind of favor?

443
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,260
Shall we...?

444
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,260
We can talk right here.

445
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,100
My parents are coming to watch my show.

446
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,500
Fang Yan and his club are
rehearsing for a play.

447
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,420
They’re short of an actress.

448
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,060
Qiyi,

449
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,860
you’re so naive.

450
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,580
Even if I agree to help you,

451
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,100
do you think those amateurs

452
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,220
can do a play?

453
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,820
As a friend, I wish I could help.

454
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,260
But sorry,

455
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,800
I have plans.

456
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,820
I gotta go.

457
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,150
Hey.

458
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,860
Hai,

459
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,660
I’m coming right now.

460
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:50,929
Hey.

461
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,050
Hey.

462
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,260
Hi, welcome.

463
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,060
Mr. Zhang!

464
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,100
Where is he?

465
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,420
Hello? Mom.

466
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,900
OK.

467
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,140
I’ll be right back.

468
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,375
Lunchtime!

469
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,900
You’re busy.

470
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,940
Take a break.

471
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,900
Do me a favor.

472
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Do me a favor.

473
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,020
Man, can you do me a favor?

474
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,580
You’ll be paid.

475
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,340
Do me a favor, please.

476
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,500
Help me with some tunes.

477
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,740
Come on. Help me out.

478
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,580
How many?

479
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,125
Just a few.

480
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,740
Maybe next week.

481
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,060
I need to compose a few songs.

482
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,260
It’d be too late.

483
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,475
Tonight.

484
00:24:58,475 --> 00:24:59,060
That’s not possible.

485
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,740
I’ll raise the pay.

486
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,780
It’s not about money.

487
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,020
It’s about time.

488
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,300
No, it’s not.

489
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,620
It’s about Qiyi.

490
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,180
Her parents are coming
to watch her show tomorrow.

491
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,940
What’s wrong with the tunes?

492
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,140
Mr. Zhang.

493
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,950
(Application for Campus Facilities)

494
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,525
(Applicant: Little Target Drama Club
Activity: Song-and-dance show)

495
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,075
(Facility: Small Auditorium
Person in Charge: Fang Yan)

496
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,980
Hey, Ma.

497
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,740
Mr. Zhang.

498
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,460
So,

499
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,780
you came to apply
for a campus facility again?

500
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,220
Yes.

501
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,460
Great.

502
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,580
Which celebrity did you invite
this time?

503
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,300
No one.

504
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,620
The term is coming to an end.

505
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,740
I’ll give the new members a try
on stage.

506
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,510
Oh.

507
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,780
So I need your approval.

508
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,220
I did a count.

509
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,180
It’s the third application, isn’t it?

510
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,860
Yes, right.

511
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,540
The third one.

512
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,220
OK.

513
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,740
Your applications outnumber

514
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,180
those from other societies together.

515
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,260
Please approve it.

516
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:06,925
Don’t worry.

517
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,060
As long as it’s not reserved,

518
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,540
I’ll approve your application.

519
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,020
Which day is it?

520
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,780
Tomorrow.

521
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,540
Tomorrow?

522
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,075
Yeah.

523
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,460
It’s not booked.

524
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,420
No problem.

525
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,000
OK.

526
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,940
Alright.

527
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,740
Thanks.

528
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,860
Bai Qiao said nothing else and left?

529
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,820
Maybe she’s really up to something.

530
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,900
She’s got her makeup on.

531
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,740
I can’t believe
you two were good friends.

532
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,420
She turned down such a small ask.

533
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,700
Well, I can help you.

534
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,780
With the limp leg?

535
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,700
Forget it.

536
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,180
I’ll think of something else.

537
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,700
What’s going on up ahead?

538
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,580
Let’s go and have a look.

539
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,700
Fellows!

540
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,100
Let’s stay out of it.

541
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Be my witnesses.

542
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,300
Come on!

543
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,380
I can’t miss it.

544
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,260
- I started the car slowly.
- Come on.

545
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,260
She came straight towards my car

546
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,600
before I drove out.

547
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,020
Luckily, I flatted the brakes

548
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,860
and stopped the car.

549
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,380
My car didn’t touch you.

550
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Don’t try to blackmail me.

551
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,540
I’m trying to find my Bella.

552
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,780
Hey, ma’am,

553
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,900
do you understand what I’m saying?

554
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,580
I said my car didn’t even touch you.

555
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,940
Why are you talking about your dog?

556
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,860
18501172266.

557
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,980
Bella.

558
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,740
1850117...

559
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,700
It’s blackmailing.

560
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,660
I’ll give you 2,000 yuan,

561
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,580
so I can go.

562
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,380
I’m looking for Bella.

563
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,660
Be my witnesses.

564
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,020
This is my business card.

565
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,220
I’m not a hit-and-run kind of guy.

566
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,260
I really have to go now.

567
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,460
I’ve got a big deal to close.

568
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,260
My client’s been waiting for me
for over half an hour.

569
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,380
Take it.

570
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,380
I want my Bella.

571
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,620
18501172266.

572
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,420
What are you doing?

573
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
1850117...

574
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,740
We can’t leave her sitting on the road.

575
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,900
Haven’t you heard?

576
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,380
There are a lot of
blackmailers these days.

577
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,175
- Besides,
- Bella.

578
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:53,675
aren’t you in a hurry to rent costumes?

579
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
There’s still time.

580
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,140
Kaixin,

581
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,620
record it with your phone.

582
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,220
Huh?

583
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
I mean

584
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,500
record it with your phone.

585
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,260
It’ll prove that I go to help her.

586
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,300
- Oh.
- Bella.

587
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,700
Ma’am, are you OK?

588
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,860
I’m looking for Bella.

589
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,825
Get up, ma’am.

590
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,580
Kaixin, come and help.

591
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,050
Sure.

592
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,340
I want Bella.

593
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,540
Ma’am, get up first.

594
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,575
Let’s get you up.

595
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,620
We’ll take you to the hospital by taxi.

596
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,100
Let’s go, Kaixin.

597
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,780
Who is the patient’s family?

598
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,980
Neither of us is.

599
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,660
We met her on the road.

600
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,420
How is she?

601
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,820
The patient is fine.

602
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,300
Just a few minor injuries.

603
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,740
But the patient is suffering
from intermittent amnesia

604
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,260
caused by cerebral thrombosis.

605
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:41,300
How about this?

606
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,980
Let’s all try to contact her family.

607
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:45,075
Sure.

608
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,460
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you, Doctor.

609
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,580
Bella.

610
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:54,860
I want Bella.

611
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,980
Bella, my Bella.

612
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,580
Ma’am.

613
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,820
Are you feeling better?

614
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,660
I’m looking for Bella.

615
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,540
Ma’am.

616
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
You’re in the hospital.

617
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,620
Bella isn’t here.

618
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,860
Bella’s at school.

619
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,180
Ma’am.

620
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,300
Can you tell us

621
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,860
what’s Bella’s full name?

622
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,860
Bella.

623
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,620
At school. Bella.

624
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,450
Or you can tell us her contact.

625
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,340
So we can help you find her.

626
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,220
18501172266

627
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,340
01172266

628
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,700
(Bai Qiao)

629
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,140
Oh, thank God!

630
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,580
I want Bella.

631
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,540
Bella’s at school.

632
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,925
I want Bella!

633
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:07,420
Ma’am.

634
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,225
Bella’s at school!

635
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,575
Bella!

636
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,380
Hey,

637
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:12,780
it’s your sister-in-law!

638
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Bella’s at school.

639
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,660
Bella. I want Bella.

640
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,460
Ma’am, calm down.

641
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,260
I want Bella.

642
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,275
I want Bella.

643
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:20,780
It’s OK.

644
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Bella’s at school.

645
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,060
Bella. Bella’s at school.

646
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,300
I want Bella.

647
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,940
Bella’s at school.

648
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,300
Bai Qiao is so lucky to have you

649
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
as her friends.

650
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,780
My sister-in-law has a hard life.

651
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,940
After Bai Qiao’s father passed away,

652
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
she got sick

653
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,400
and has been delirious.

654
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,300
Her memory is getting worse and worse.

655
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,250
But fortunately,

656
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,500
Bai Qiao is a good daughter.

657
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,340
She never asks her for a penny,

658
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,940
and instead, she wires
us money each month

659
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,700
to support our life.

660
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,475
Well,

661
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,260
recently, my sister-in-law

662
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,260
has been talking
about coming to Bai Qiao.

663
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,820
I thought she was just missing her.

664
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,100
So I didn’t put it on my mind.

665
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,700
However,

666
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,940
she came to Nancheng all by herself.

667
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,060
I was so worried,

668
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,260
and I couldn’t find her

669
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,700
anywhere in the city.

670
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,900
Thanks to you girls,

671
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,020
or I wouldn’t

672
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,100
know what I could do.

673
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,500
Ma’am, don’t mention it.

674
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,260
We are good friends with Bai Qiao

675
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,860
in college.

676
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,450
Great.

677
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:42,620
Mom!

678
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,020
Mom!

679
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,900
Are you alright?

680
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,700
Why didn’t you tell me
you’re in Nancheng?

681
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,180
She came on her own.

682
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,700
I didn’t know.

683
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,620
You didn’t know?

684
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,460
Haven’t you been taking care of her?

685
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,060
How did she get out and come here alone?

686
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,740
Bai Qiao, calm down.

687
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,500
Your aunt was also worried

688
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,740
when she found your mom missing.

689
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,780
Bai Qiao,

690
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,740
don’t worry.

691
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,260
Look,

692
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,580
your mom is safe, isn’t she?

693
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
Safe?

694
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,900
She had a car accident.

695
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,140
How could you even say that?

696
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,940
Aunt,

697
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,380
I gave you all the money you asked.

698
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,300
I’m begging you.

699
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,780
Please take good care of my mom.

700
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,100
I came to see Bella.

701
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,180
Mom,

702
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,740
I’m Bella.

703
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,020
You’re unlike her.

704
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,940
Mrs. Bai,

705
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,420
take a good look.

706
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,260
It’s Bai Qiao,

707
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,820
your Bella.

708
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,580
Mom.

709
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
You’re thinner.

710
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,700
Mom!

711
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
You’re thinner. Thinner.

712
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,220
You’re thinner.

713
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,380
Thinner.

714
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,980
Qiyi,

715
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,340
thank you and Kaixin for taking my mom
to the hospital.

716
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,300
Don’t mention it.

717
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,900
But I don’t want

718
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,620
anyone to know about this.

719
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,100
I understand.

720
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,100
Don’t worry.

721
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,220
I’ll make sure Kaixin shut her mouth.

722
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,580
Qiyi!

723
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,660
How did it go with your performance?

724
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,980
We’re going to rent the costumes.

725
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,475
We’re running out of time.

726
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,620
We have to go now.

727
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,340
Qiyi,

728
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,540
do you find an actress
for the supporting role?

729
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,820
Kaixin can fill in.

730
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,580
But I’m worried about her foot injury.

731
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,300
I’ll be fine.

732
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,140
I can even walk normally.

733
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,860
You’d better be careful with it.

734
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,980
I have time tomorrow afternoon.

735
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,140
Let me know before the final rehearsal.

736
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,125
Well, I should go back in.

737
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,850
Qiyi,

738
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,380
now I know

739
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,980
why Bai Qiao is so busy every day.

740
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,420
Yeah.

741
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,700
She’s under too much pressure.

742
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,650
Hi, Miss.

743
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,700
(Costume Rental)

744
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,540
Hold on.

745
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,140
We want to rent some costumes.

746
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,100
Rent?

747
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:46,900
Sure.

748
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,740
Come in.

749
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,700
Let’s go.

750
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,700
Did I distract you

751
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,860
from something at school
by calling you here?

752
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,460
No, Mom.

753
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,575
I know

754
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,140
you’ve always had a problem
with your father.

755
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,325
But he’s old now.

756
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,060
He has nobody,

757
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,300
except for his only son.

758
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,620
You don’t have to say it, Mom.

759
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,140
I understand.

760
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,325
Wrong mood.

761
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,460
There.

762
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,380
Is it a bad quote?

763
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,940
What are they doing here?

764
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,700
It’s not strong enough.

765
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,540
Yeah.

766
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,820
The emotion isn’t enough.

767
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,380
Didn’t Fang Yan say

768
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,180
he went to Mr. Zhang

769
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,380
to apply for a theatre?

770
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,980
Give Fang Yan a call.

771
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,940
When you come through the door...

772
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,020
Fang Yan’s phone is off.

773
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,020
Such a disappointment.

774
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,260
I’ll call Mr. Zhang.

775
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,460
Hello?

776
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,180
Mr. Zhang,

777
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,580
this is Du Ang.

778
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,660
May I ask you

779
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,500
if Fang Yan went to you in the morning

780
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,540
to apply for a facility
for club activity?

781
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,820
No.

782
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,780
Your senior, Ma Xiangyu came over

783
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
a while ago.

784
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,100
I didn’t see Fang Yan’s application.

785
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:40,775
(Facility: Small Auditorium
Person in Charge: Fang Yan)

786
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,660
Fang Yan?

787
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
This is not good.

788
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,020
Mr. Zhang said

789
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,700
the application form was thrown
in the trash.

790
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,700
He didn’t see it.

791
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,200
He approved

792
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,140
Ma Xiangyu to use the theatre
for two days.

793
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,575
Huh?

794
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,820
Then we don’t have a venue.

795
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,300
Are we still going to perform?

796
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,500
Let me ask when they’ll finish.

797
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,425
Ma.

798
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,425
Mr. Ma,

799
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,180
as the saying goes, better make friends
than make enemies,

800
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,780
right?

801
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,660
On the contrary,

802
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,020
I just don’t want

803
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,820
to reconcile with you.

804
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,740
Mr. Ma,

805
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,380
we’re in urgent need this time.

806
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,500
Please be a good man

807
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,580
and do us the favor, OK?

808
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,340
It won’t take long.

809
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,780
Two hours.

810
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,660
OK?

811
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,450
Hey, hey, hey.

812
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,860
Listen to me.

813
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,260
I’ll treat you all to Haagen-Dazs.

814
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,540
Like the last time, ten ice cream balls.

815
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
Even a hundred balls won’t do.

816
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,020
Mazda!

817
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,580
- Du Ang.
- You...

818
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,650
This is a dead end.

819
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,180
We’ll think of something else.

820
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,940
Or we can apply for another venue.

821
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,875
Another venue?

822
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,540
There’s no light.

823
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,940
Let’s rent one.

824
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,780
You wanna rent a venue?

825
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,540
It’s too expensive.

826
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,980
I have money.

827
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,300
I can’t let you pay for it.

828
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,700
Do you want to go home with your dad?

829
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,350
I have to go pick them up
at the station.

830
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:08,900
Hey,

831
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,020
you go pick them up.

832
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,940
I’ll rent a venue.

833
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,220
I don’t want to lie to them.

834
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,500
What will you tell your parents then?

835
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:18,700
The truth.

836
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,175
I’m sorry

837
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,700
for letting you practice for nothing.

838
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,140
Tell Sanshang and Li Shuang

839
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,620
they don’t need to come.

840
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,650
The patient’s family?

841
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,625
Yes, I am.

842
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,020
The patient’s basically stable now.

843
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,740
The main cause is asphyxia
caused by asthma.

844
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,775
It’s lucky he received immediate rescue.

845
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
Or I couldn’t imagine what would happen.

846
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,660
You can go in and see him.

847
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,525
Thank you, Doctor.

848
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:07,300
You’re welcome.

849
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,780
Fang Yan,

850
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,975
get in and see him.

851
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,420
Qiyi,

852
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:42,100
you’re so bold now.

853
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,860
Brother, look,

854
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,260
within 6 months,

855
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,940
she’s involved in

856
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,660
a group fight.

857
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,420
I told you.

858
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,980
We should stay away from Showbiz.

859
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,275
Well,

860
00:40:56,325 --> 00:40:57,600
we can’t let our parents know.

861
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,975
Go take a look.

862
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,580
I just did.

863
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,660
They’re both asleep.

864
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,220
How about this?

865
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,275
I’ll take them around Nancheng
for sightseeing tomorrow.

866
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,060
Change the tickets.

867
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,525
And brother.

868
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:13,065
Mm-hmm.

869
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:13,860
Think again

870
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,180
about Qiyi’s future.

871
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,420
I told you before

872
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,300
two proposals.

873
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,140
One is to send her to the U.S.

874
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,060
If you choose this one,

875
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,940
you have to get on
with the application now.

876
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,420
The other is

877
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,300
to prepare
for the civil service examination.

878
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,420
It’s getting late.

879
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,260
You should get some rest.

880
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,540
I’m going back to the dorm.

881
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,020
Stay here tonight!

882
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,020
Share a bed with your mom!

883
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,780
Qiyi,

884
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,820
let’s share a bed tonight.

885
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,700
Hello, Sanshang.

886
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,180
I already know about the venue.

887
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,380
Tell the members to gather at the club.

888
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,900
I’ll be right there.

889
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,250
Mr. Sun asked

890
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,460
the class to gather in the classroom
in the morning.

891
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,620
OK, I got it.

892
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,620
Everyone, sit down.

893
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,540
Now, listen to my command.

894
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,380
Close your eyes.

895
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:14,980
Qiyi,

896
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,780
get in the middle.

897
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,625
Now,

898
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:32,075
clear your mind

899
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,100
and feel it.

900
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,025
I stepped off

901
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,575
the stage

902
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,820
due to some setbacks.

903
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,980
For a few years,

904
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,460
I didn’t have the courage

905
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,300
to get on it again.

906
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,140
The university punished you

907
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,340
because there are rules.

908
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,540
But for you,

909
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,940
the stage is sacred.

910
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,460
We have to be respectful
of performing arts.

911
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,100
Look back.

912
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,660
Think about the admission exam.

913
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,060
Ask yourselves.

914
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,060
Do you really love the stage?

915
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,100
Are you sure

916
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,380
you’re qualified to stand on it?

917
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,420
I hope

918
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,260
you’ll give a good thought to it.

919
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,620
Find the answers.

920
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,200
