00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,950
What are you doing?

25
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:47,075
Do you know that
you sleepwalked last night?

26
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,475
You’ve scared me all night long.

27
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,750
It’s okay.

28
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,000
Kaixin,

29
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,925
do you know how to take a leave
in our school?

30
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,125
You need to take a leave?

31
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:14,375
The school just started and you
want to take a leave now?

32
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:17,950
Is it hard to?

33
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:20,225
Anything happened?

34
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,800
How are you doing
the acting homework

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,700
Mr. Sun left?

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
I haven’t prepared for it yet.

37
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,600
Then you’d better finish it first.

38
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:36,950
Qiyi,

39
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:38,425
you’re the monitor.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,975
You should lead by example.

41
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,675
Senior, I got it.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,475
Now, we’ll do

43
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,475
(One day ago)
imagination and perception exercises.

44
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,100
Imagine that

45
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,850
you are now walking in the desert.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,600
The surface temperature is 45 degrees,

47
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,350
and you are tired and thirsty.

48
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:08,600
Now you come to a glacier in the Arctic,

49
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:12,200
where the temperature is getting
lower and lower.

50
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,225
And now, you come to a wetland.

51
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:17,150
Suddenly you fall into a fish tank!

52
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,575
It bursts!

53
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:20,650
The water is losing.

54
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,600
You’re about to die of dryness.

55
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,525
Now you become

56
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,450
a seed.

57
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,750
It’s raining.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,750
And you begin to awaken.

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,425
You’re bathed in sunlight

60
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,525
and you begin to sprout,

61
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,425
grow taller

62
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,750
and become stronger.

63
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,825
Qiyi,

64
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,900
what are you?

65
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,675
A towering tree.

66
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,100
I think it looks like a sapling.

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,575
Here is your homework.

68
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,250
After the class,

69
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,950
go to experience a different life

70
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,825
and find another side of you.

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,750
What is another side of ourselves?

72
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:16,225
Qiyi,

73
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:17,650
I think

74
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,950
you can try some maniac roles.

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,025
Being a lunatic?

76
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,725
Are you stupid?

77
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,175
Here, eyes slant 47.5 degrees.

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,475
Twist lips twice.

79
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:06,925
Giggle twice.

80
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:09,325
Qiyi,

81
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,725
you’re still watching
schizophrenic movies?

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,525
Do you know that you’re

83
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,350
going crazy?

84
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,475
She got silly.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,125
I… I used the ultimate.

86
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,125
Go lead them here.

87
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:27,775
I’m destroying the turret.

88
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,375
The soldier is attacking you.

89
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,275
Hey, come on.

90
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,050
Don’t touch it.

91
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,500
Stop it.

92
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:34,600
Du Ang,

93
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,050
you’re the assassin.

94
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,200
You have to do sneak attack.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,825
Or how should we play?

96
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:39,725
It’s your job.

97
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,175
I destroy the turret.
You do sneak attack.

98
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,050
Inhibitor!

99
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,900
Inhibitor!

100
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,550
Go back! Go back!

101
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:52,700
Download one for me, too.

102
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,400
Go play your Gluttonous Snake.

103
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,175
Life is always about

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,075
making all your efforts wasted when

105
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,650
it is about to reach the peak.

106
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,425
What does it mean?

107
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,575
You don’t understand?

108
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,900
Sanshang,

109
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,000
I found that you never

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,150
open yourself.

111
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,225
Sanshang,

112
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,600
tell us.

113
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,375
Which point have you

114
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,775
reached with that girl?

115
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,000
What point?

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,725
Come on. Come here.

117
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,650
You haven’t even held her hand,
have you?

118
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:47,350
Sanshang,

119
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,263
now I know what your another side is.

120
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,125
It’s okay.

121
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,625
Let me take you out today.

122
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,725
I promise I will get your
another side out.

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,975
Go get changed!

124
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,300
Qiyi,

125
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,675
have you seen my Little Kaixin?

126
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,400
Isn’t it on your bed?

127
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,100
No.

128
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,725
Here it is!

129
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:27,775
Kaixin!

130
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,175
Little Kaixin!

131
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:40,225
Kaixin,

132
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
if you can be more tender,

133
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,425
you can finish Mr. Sun’s
homework directly.

134
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,175
Qiyi,

135
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,750
do you think the reason why Li Xiao

136
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,725
doesn’t like me is because
I got no womanliness?

137
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,125
How about this?

138
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,775
You help me to get femininity.

139
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,925
I teach you how to protect yourself.

140
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,400
Little Kaixin!

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,875
My poor little thing.

142
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
Forget about it, Qiyi.

143
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,950
You have no femininity either.

144
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,525
I decided.

145
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,325
I will conquer Li Xiao

146
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,400
with my personality charm.

147
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:33,775
Bai Qiao!

148
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,150
(I am honored to be able to share
my learning experience with you all.)

149
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,150
(I feel very happy and hope
I can improve myself with you all.)

150
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:47,775
Beautiful!

151
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:54,450
Turn around.

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,950
Um.

153
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,750
It’s done.

154
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,125
Bai Qiao,

155
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,350
you’re so great.

156
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,600
But, what’s this?

157
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:11,700
This?

158
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,350
Just a small injury.

159
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,800
I got many of them.

160
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,500
It’s a small problem.

161
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,175
I can help you to cover it
with my concealer.

162
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,000
OK.

163
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,425
I gotta go.

164
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:21,150
I have something to do.

165
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,200
Bye.

166
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,525
Qiyi.

167
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,125
Um?

168
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,650
Can I

169
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:27,700
make a call

170
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,475
to Li Xiao now?

171
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:31,375
Now?

172
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,175
Isn’t it too much of a hurry?

173
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:35,525
And, have you thought about…?

174
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,275
Hello.

175
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:37,675
Senior,

176
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,050
I’m Kaixin.

177
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,100
How about a lunch together?

178
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,275
What?

179
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,300
You’re busy now.

180
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,550
How about this afternoon?

181
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:47,800
Or tonight.

182
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,025
Or tomorrow.

183
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:51,700
OK. OK.

184
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,625
Anywhere will do.

185
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,700
Anything will do.

186
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,850
Um. OK.

187
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,325
See you later.

188
00:10:58,725 --> 00:10:59,325
Yeah!

189
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,225
Qiyi,

190
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,100
come with me

191
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,875
to buy a present for him.

192
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,075
I think

193
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,925
you’d better choose by yourself.

194
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,750
And, I still have homework to do.

195
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:12,975
Alright.

196
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,800
I will let you go today.

197
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,175
Take care.

198
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,075
Have you got the feeling?

199
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,625
You can’t be crazy

200
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,925
if you only act like this.

201
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,600
The art comes from life.

202
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,025
If you want to act well,

203
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:46,775
you have to experience it.

204
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,100
I have a documentary assignment
to shoot this week.

205
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,375
It’s about something that
no one else has shot before.

206
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:54,950
Come with me?

207
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,525
No.

208
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,150
You don’t dare to?

209
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,100
I dare.

210
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,375
But I just won’t go.

211
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:10,650
Bai Qiao.

212
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,325
Um?

213
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,200
Actually, there is something

214
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,525
I always want to tell you.

215
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:16,700
Go ahead.

216
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,800
I started to like you when I saw you

217
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:25,675
at the ball that day.

218
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:36,975
Don’t feel stressed.

219
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,775
Let me know when you’ve
thought about it.

220
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,325
I’m going to graduate soon.

221
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,725
Although I’ve filmed some drama before,

222
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,600
to be honest,

223
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:50,875
I’m still quite confused
about the future.

224
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:55,025
I can’t promise you anything now.

225
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,150
But I will definitely try
to give you happiness.

226
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,700
I love you. I love you.

227
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:21,950
Bai Qiao.

228
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,925
Bai Qiao?

229
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,225
What’s on your mind?

230
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,575
Nothing.

231
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:34,050
I was once here

232
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,625
before with a friend.

233
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,500
Friend?

234
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,775
Who is it?

235
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,150
Just a friend.

236
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,075
I hope you will consider

237
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:53,675
what I have said to you today

238
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:54,925
after you return.

239
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,800
But, don’t feel stressed.

240
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,550
I don’t want to
make things difficult for you.

241
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:02,950
Thank you.

242
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,050
I will consider it.

243
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:11,225
Shang.

244
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,000
Please.

245
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,150
Sir.

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,575
Come on.

247
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:31,725
Easy.

248
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:32,600
Take it easy.

249
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:33,875
Relax.

250
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,325
Let’s go.

251
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:35,100
You can make it.

252
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,025
This is not for fun.

253
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,625
How is this place?

254
00:14:57,775 --> 00:14:58,675
Not bad.

255
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:00,450
Just too dark.

256
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,425
It won’t be dark if you
take off your sunglasses.

257
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,350
Who is that?

258
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,875
Is it Zhang Yang?

259
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,775
I think he is.

260
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:24,825
No wonder he stays outside all night.

261
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,975
Turns out he got a new girl.

262
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:30,475
I think he is here for serious business.

263
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,700
Bro,

264
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,625
no one comes here for serious business.

265
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,950
Not everyone is here to experience

266
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,750
a different life like you.

267
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,350
Zimo,

268
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:56,550
didn’t you say

269
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,275
you know someone here?

270
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,275
The security guard I know quit his job.

271
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,625
Come down here then.

272
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,675
Let’s go back.

273
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:07,325
My phone is running out of power.

274
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,750
I need to charge it.

275
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:10,025
You…

276
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,100
Qiyi,

277
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,250
do you still want to become

278
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,650
a good actress?

279
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,625
Do you still want to play
the lunatic role?

280
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:29,400
But, it’s too late today.

281
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,025
You don’t dare to climb over the gate,
do you?

282
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,725
I…

283
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,675
You don’t dare to climb it!

284
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,979
You… Hold me up.

285
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:44,125
I’m holding you. I got you.

286
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,075
I… I’m coming down.

287
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,175
How is it?

288
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,750
Stop laughing.

289
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:51,775
Isn’t it exciting?

290
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:52,925
It hurts.

291
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,550
Is there anyone?

292
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,700
It’s okay.

293
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,550
- Dog! Dog!
- Blackie.

294
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,075
Dog!

295
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,225
It’s okay.

296
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,500
It won’t bite.

297
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,100
If it doesn’t bark, it must be fierce.

298
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,100
Blackie.

299
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,500
See?

300
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,325
It’s okay.

301
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,500
It’s so cute.

302
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,375
- Blackie.
- Blackie.

303
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:19,350
How old are you?

304
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,575
Blackie.

305
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:21,875
Blackie.

306
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:23,725
Someone is there!

307
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,500
What’s wrong?

308
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,275
Over there, six beauties.

309
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,100
Bro,

310
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,025
here is your opportunity.

311
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,550
Go.

312
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,800
How to?

313
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,100
Use this.

314
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,275
Rotate it.

315
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,450
Got it?

316
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,675
Come on.

317
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,650
Come on.

318
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:23,525
Stand up.

319
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,325
Come here.

320
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:00,875
Hurry up.

321
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,300

Zimo, this way!

325
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,575
The short-haired girl.

326
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,850
Yes, you.

327
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,075
Hello.

328
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,125
Can you turn on the light for me?

329
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,425
What brings you here?

330
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,625
Sorry.

331
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,475
I entered the wrong place.

332
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Then, you’d better not get out.

333
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,275
Because some people
will pass by here soon.

334
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:20,800
I think someone just came in.

335
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,050
Let’s look elsewhere.

336
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:25,525
Since you are already here,

337
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,650
have a seat.

338
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,175
You know what?

339
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,575
Everything that happened today

340
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:46,346
has already been written into my script.

341
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,650
In other words,

342
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,825
you are just a character in my script.

343
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,975
Your appearance has already
been set by me.

344
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,725
Why does someone always
interrupt our conversations?

345
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,100
What?

346
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,400
I love you. I love you.

347
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,175
I love you.

348
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,075
By the way,

349
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,100
let me introduce.

350
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:43,925
This is the well-known

This is

356
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,075
the famous financial IT guy,

357
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:58,600
named Francis.

358
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,825
Francis!

359
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,900
Since we come to play,

360
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,350
we have to have fun!

361
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,250

You’re…

364
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:15,375
the doctor?

365
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,550
Of course.

366
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,950
Congratulations

367
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,700
on passing the test.

368
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,600
You’re testing me?

369
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,950
Doctor, I am taking medication
every day on time.

370
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,575
I… I…

371
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:35,625
My condition is almost stable

372
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:37,275
and I’ll be discharged soon.

373
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:37,800
Sorry.

374
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,925
I entered the wrong room.

375
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:39,700
I’ll leave now.

376
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:42,575
You are not a patient of this hospital.

377
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,475
Don’t be nervous.

378
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,175
I’ve been following you for a long time.

379
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,150
In fact, you’re not important.

380
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,000
You’re just

381
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,050
a cameo in my script.

382
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,850
I created this script.

383
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,375
I created the whole world.

384
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:06,650
So,

385
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I can see your future.

386
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,400
You may not believe what I’m saying.

387
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,700
Come on, let’s play a game.

388
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,925
Hide now,

389
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:23,125
because there will be a fat nurse

390
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:23,900
coming in.

391
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,700
She won’t find us.

392
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,425
When she goes out,
she will lock the door.

393
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,750
Game on.

394
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,425
You can turn on the light now.

395
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,725
Now you believe what I’m saying, right?

396
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:00,175
What’s going to happen next?

397
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,625
The hospital bell will ring

398
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,850
and the lights in the hallway
will be turned off.

399
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,125
Doesn’t this happen

400
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,625
every day at this time?

401
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:08,575
You’re using a red-colored phone.

402
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:09,650
You climbed over the fence.

403
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,700
And you’re not alone.

404
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,950
Now the glass in the hallway
will be broken.

405
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,475
The dog at the door will be barking.

406
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,325
Do I need to keep verifying?

407
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:22,675
No, thanks.

408
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,475
Doctor,

409
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,150
my phone was out of power.

410
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:30,850
Do you have a rechargeable battery?

411
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,750
I want to contact

412
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:33,075
the classmate who came with me…

413
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,575
Welcome to my world.

414
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,325
It’s time.

415
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:43,325
We should leave now.

416
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,550
Where are the girls?

417
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,125
They already left.

418
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:47,250
Let’s go!

419
00:24:47,475 --> 00:24:48,300
Go!

420
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,350
Come on, Sanshang.

422
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:54,400
Excuse me,

423
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,575
who pays the bill, please?

424
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,275
Sorry,

425
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,000
we left too quickly.

426
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,800
I will pay.

427
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:07,200
9,180 yuan in total.

428
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:09,500
What?

429
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:10,500
How much?

430
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,625
9,180 yuan.

431
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,175
That’s too expensive!

432
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,900
Because you ordered fine wine.

433
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,200
Cash or card?

434
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,025
I know you’re in a hurry.

435
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,350
I can take you out.

436
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:30,400
But you have to follow my instructions.

437
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,900
What about my friend?

438
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,000
She will find a way.

439
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
Why are you helping me?

440
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,275
Actually, you’re helping me.

441
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,275
I’m helping you?

442
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,325
To finish my script.

443
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,200
What do you need me to do?

444
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,100
Come with me to a place.

446
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,100
Give us a discount.

447
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:45,100
Sorry, I can’t.

448
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,900

Sorry, please wait a second.

453
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,475
Men should be fierce.

454

It’s okay. It’s okay.

OK?

462
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:16,025
Give me a discount.

463
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,700
Are those girls just now

464
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:26,575
your cappers?

465
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,025
Kid,

466
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,075
be careful of what you said.

467
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,175
I’m not a kid!

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,625
Stop it!

471
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,100
Go.

472
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:41,575
Leave!

473
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,450

Why is she gone?

475

By all rights,

476
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:49,800
the door should be locked.

477
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:51,075
But…

478
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,575
Stop.

479
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,000

It’s him.

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,675
What’s wrong?

487
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,200

489
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,725

Boss, it’s them.

495
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:28,375
They don’t want to pay.

496
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,675

Mr. Wang,

498
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,350
it’s been a while.

499
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:38,250
Are you alright?

500
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:38,850
Xinfei,

501
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,975
what brings you here?

502
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:42,650
They are all my friends.

503
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,350
Put this on my account, okay?

504
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,600
So, this is a misunderstanding.

505
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,625
Withdraw!

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,975

507
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,125
We should call the police.

508
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,475
It’s too late.

509
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:56,625
What to do now?

510
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:01,050
