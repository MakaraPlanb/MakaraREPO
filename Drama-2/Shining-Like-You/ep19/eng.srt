Hey, girl.

25
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,425
- Come play with me.
- What are you doing?

26
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:41,525
- Stop!
- Come on.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,420
Hands off!

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,180
Fang Yan!

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,820
Are you nuts?

Fang Yan!

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,300
- Stop!
- Fang Yan!

I…

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,660
Fang Yan!

Don’t!

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,919
Fang Yan.

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,180
Take Qiyi back.

37
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:56,905
- Go.
- Let’s go.

38
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,260
- He is nuts.
- Let’s go.

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,420
Go!

40
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:03,315
You rascal!

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,728
Director,

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,740
I just wanted to show her something new.

43
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,636
In the crew, she’s a little…

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,860
Director!

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,260
What are you doing?

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,660
Can you stay away from people like him?

47
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,660
Don’t you know what’s on his mind?

48
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,020
What happened to your head?

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,580
Are you stupid or something?

50
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,940
Don’t you know it’s dangerous?

51
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,540
Can you stop making people worried?

52
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,939
Can you stop being self-assertive?

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,860
I...

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,860
Am I self-assertive?

55
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,460
Please, for every decision you make,

56
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,660
talk to us first.

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,660
Or let me know first, OK?

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,780
Did you talk to me about your things?

59
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,420
All your things.

60
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,300
Things about your dad.

61
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
Things about Wang Hai.

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,660
And things you are doing now.

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,420
I learned all these from others.

64
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,740
What do you expect me to feel?

65
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,500
Here you are.

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,212
The man who framed Fang Yan’s father

67
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,060
is in your crew.

68
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,060
Producer Wang Hai.

69
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,050
Fang Yan is looking for evidence.

70
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,275
But it’s very difficult.

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,150
If you want to help him,

72
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:30,300
find a way to get close to Wang Hai.

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,180
Try to get some evidence.

74
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,860
Qiyi.

75
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,660
Hurry up!

76
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,940
All right.

77
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,722
I’ll keep my hands off

78
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,540
your business.

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,100
Qiyi!

80
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
Hello.

81
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,460
Hello, is this Li Sanshang?

82
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,140
Yes, it’s me.

83
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,020
I’m the vice-principal of
Experimental Drama Primary School.

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,820
Hello, principal.

85
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,740
I’m calling you

86
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,580
because after our assessment,

87
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
we believe you’ll make a good

88
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,900
drama teacher at our school.

89
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
You’re down-to-earth.

90
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,380
You’re motivated.

91
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,580
The most important thing is

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,860
you’re exceptionally unsophisticated.

93
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,580
We all believe

94
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,340
you have greater potential than

95
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,340
other more experienced candidates.

96
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,220
I look forward to your performance.

97
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,140
Really?

98
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,180
Is it real?

99
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,428
Yes.

100
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,540
Come to our school tomorrow.

101
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,700
And we may discuss the details.

102
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,580
Okay. Okay

103
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,820
Goodbye, principal.

104
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
Come on, man!

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,660
Come on!

106
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:02,155
(Nancheng People’s Court
decided the acts)

107
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,275
of Wang Hai, Liu Xiaowei
and others of taking false photos,)

108
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,318
(and faking news constitute
fabrication and smearing)

109
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:05,385
(which seriously damaged
the reputation of Su Wen.)

110
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:06,800
(The perpetrators were requested to stop
the infringement, make public apologies)

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,358
(and compensate the plaintiff for his
economic losses and moral damages.)

112
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,140
Mom.

113
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,420
Bella.

114
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,540
Let me help you.

115
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,092
Sis.

116
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,060
Time to take pills.

117
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,060
Well...

118
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,020
Auntie, don’t take it personally.

119
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,140
She didn’t recognize who you are.

120
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,420
Mom.

121
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,420
This is auntie.

122
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,140
When I was at school,

123
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,020
she was taking care of you.

124
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,700
How could you forget?

125
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,620
Mom.

126
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
Take these pills.

127
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,860
Come on.

128
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,420
How do you know I’m here?

129
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,500
About all these...

130
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,260
Why didn’t you tell me?

131
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,140
Did Qiyi tell you this?

132
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,220
I just want to visit your mom.

133
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,780
You did.

134
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,860
Now you may go.

135
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,740
Bai Qiao.

136
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,860
Anything else?

137
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,140
I’m sorry.

138
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,380
I said those things out of anger.

139
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,460
I wish you could forgive me.

140
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,300
You were right.

141
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,300
I am a total liar.

142
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
I do everything to get

143
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
what I want.

144
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,900
Are you still mad at me?

145
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,380
I’m too busy for that.

146
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,140
Take the money please.

147
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,300
No, thanks.

148
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,060
Take it.

149
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,380
Pay for your mom’s treatment.

150
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,820
If it’s not enough,

151
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,180
I’ll find a way.

152
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,060
I’ll pay you back.

153
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,500
Fang Yan.

154
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,180
What are you doing here?

155
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,580
I was looking for you.

156
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,540
Time for meal.

157
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,540
Qiyi.

158
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,420
Who’s the girl next to Fang Yan?

159
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,940
She’s cute.

160
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,580
Qiyi.

161
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,100
Come on.

162
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,500
Try this.

163
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,900
Your favorite fried fish.

164
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,140
Stewed beef.

165
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,740
Vegetable.

166
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,140
Don’t eat that.

167
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,260
Come on.

168
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,460
What are you waiting for?

169
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,260
Go ahead.

170
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
It’s getting cold.

171
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,540
Fang Yan.

172
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,340
Good for you.

173
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,060
Nice job as the director’s assistant!

174
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,940
A successful career and love life.

175
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,460
There’s even

176
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,340
a cutie to dine with you.

177
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,580
Chopsticks for you.

178
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:55,140
Hey.

179
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,660
Qiyi.

180
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,500
I need some air.

181
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,260
Qiyi.

182
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,860
Qiyi.

183
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:06,420
Hey, Fairy.

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,100
Come sit here.

185
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,260
Thanks, I’ll just sit here.

186
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,540
Come here. I’m asking you.

187
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,620
Three.

188
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,340
Two.

189
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,380
Come sit here.

190
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,260
Come on, come here.

191
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,260
Look.

192
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,500
Your favorite dishes…

193
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,100
Well, I guess you’ll like them.

194
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,380
Stewed beef and fried fish.

195
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,980
I’ll just eat this.

196
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,780
Well,

197
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,860
forget about that.

198
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,260
Try this.

199
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,380
What about you?

200
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,700
Give me a minute.

201
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:05,957
Here you are.

202
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:07,147
Thanks.

203
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,140
You were right.

204
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,580
We need to give those kids more chances.

205
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,060
Qiyi

206
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,980
has done a great job.

207
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,340
But Du Ang.

208
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,740
He’s a mediocre actor.

209
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,700
I don’t really understand why

210
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,060
you chose him to play this role.

211
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,580
Isn’t it your decision?

212
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,220
Certainly not.

213
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,380
Wang Hai told me

214
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,380
he was highly recommended by you.

215
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,660
By the way,

216
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,820
I found someone to take Wang Hai’s job.

217
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
His name is Liu Ping.

218
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,020
He doesn’t have much experience.

219
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,340
But he’s reliable.

220
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,980
When will he join us?

221
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,580
He’s working on some stuff

222
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,300
and will be here soon.

223
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,220
OK.

224
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,660
Stop it.

225
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,180
Stop!

226
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,180
Watch out!

227
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,980
Watch out!

228
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,140
Mr. Li.

229
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,620
Are you sleepy?

230
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,980
Mr. Li.

231
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,380
Please come with me.

232
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,620
Qiyi, Qiyi.

233
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,180
What are you doing?

234
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,800
(Qiyi: Waiting for my scene.
What’s wrong?)

235
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,180
I’m so bored.

236
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,780
You’re all working,

237
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,900
except me.

238
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,940
I stay in the hotel room all day,

239
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,540
doing nothing

240
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,380
but eating and sleeping.

241
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,700
I’m so bored.

242
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:25,130
(Qiyi: Why not hang out with Sanshang?)

243
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,260
I already called him.

244
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,820
He didn’t pick up the phone.

245
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,980
Li Sanshang.

246
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,420
You don’t pick up the phone.

247
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,140
Principal.

248
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,700
I’ll find a way.

249
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,900
Mr. Li.

250
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,540
You need to

251
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,940
find effective teaching methods.

252
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,860
You’re on probation for the first month.

253
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,780
If you fail,

254
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,220
I cannot hire you.

255
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Principal, I...

256
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,180
I’ve found you a partner.

257
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,780
She also graduated from your university.

258
00:13:58,901 --> 00:13:59,714
Really?

259
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,180
Hello.

260
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,460
Hello.

261
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,820
Fang Yan was your classmate?

262
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:29,860
Yeah, we were in the same class.

263
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,180
He’s a nice guy.

264
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,220
If it wasn’t him,

265
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,980
I may not be able to play in this play.

266
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,980
Really?

267
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,540
Then why didn’t he want to join us?

268
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,700
I heard that

269
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,020
the director was your teacher.

270
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,940
I talked to him over and again.

271
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,540
Then he finally took the assistant job.

272
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,140
Actually,

273
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,300
I really admire you guys.

274
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,220
I’ve never learned acting.

275
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,940
From the age of 15,

276
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,500
I started to work at Hengdian

277
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,780
as a background actress.

278
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,260
Just silent roles,

279
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,540
walking in the background.

280
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,780
I even played a corpse once.

281
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,020
Sometimes the extras

282
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,740
fought like cat and dog

283
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,380
for a single line.

284
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,100
Your cases are different.

285
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,580
You received professional training

286
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,860
and took acting jobs after graduation.

287
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,940
We did receive professional training.

288
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,380
But it’s not easy for us either.

289
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
Everyone thought

290
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,940
we will automatically take acting jobs.

291
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,740
But it’s not true.

292
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,700
Graduates before us said

293
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,500
over half of them found other jobs

294
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,620
which are totally irrelevant to acting.

295
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,220
So, we are lucky

296
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,300
to do what we love.

297
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,900
Qiyi, you’re right.

298
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,020
Are you memorizing your lines?

299
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,780
There’s a big scene in the afternoon.

300
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
I’m a little nervous.

301
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,740
Although

302
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,700
our characters are similar,

303
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,060
yours is much more important than mine.

304
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,220
And you have more lines.

305
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,460
The director likes you a lot.

306
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,300
Do you need me to rehearse with you?

307
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,180
Great!

308
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,409
You’re back.

309
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,740
Auntie.

310
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,980
Please come with me.

311
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:41,113
OK.

312
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,460
What is it?

313
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,900
Is there anything wrong?

314
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,820
No.

315
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,340
Please take this.

316
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:56,313
All right.

317
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:58,581
All right.

318
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,500
Auntie.

319
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,820
Thanks for your help.

320
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,420
I still need you to take care of my mom.

321
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,980
This is too...

322
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,460
I’ll pay for her medicines with those.

323
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,700
The money for the next month.

324
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,980
I’ll pay you on time.

325
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,140
OK.

326
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,500
I’ll go buy some food.

327
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:21,526
OK.

328
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,700
Hello.

329
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,220
There’s something I want to tell you.

330
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,300
What’s wrong?

331
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,950
(When I put my feet on his tummy,
I felt he was colder.)

332
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,471
(So I want to say)

333
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:40,850
(I love him so much.)

334
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,875
(I really love him.)

335
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,469
(I wish my parents will agree that
we get together.)

336
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,469
(OK. It’s your turn now.)

337
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,100
(In fact, I feel like)

338
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,925
(You owe her an apology by saying that.)

339
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,650
(She betrayed her family because of me.)

340
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,352
(She betrayed…)

341
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:52,953
Water.

342
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,425
(It’s been so many years.)

343
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:56,425
(I didn’t give her a happy life.)

344
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,300
(How should I put it?)
Water.

345
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,694
(I feel like I’m so sorry.)

346
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,380
Didn’t I give you water?

347
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,900
(I didn’t buy her any clothes.)

348
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,397
(I remember we went shopping.)

349
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,125
(She wanted to buy a jade bracelet.)

350
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,198
(100 Seconds)
(It’s not very expensive.)

351
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:09,200
(100 Seconds)
(But I didn’t buy it for her.)

352
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,980
After your mom is discharged,

353
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,540
don’t ask your auntie to look after her.

354
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,620
A few times when you were not around,

355
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,260
she was like a different person.

356
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,100
She was quite mean to your mom.

357
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,540
She didn’t ask her to take pills.

358
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
I’m afraid

359
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,620
it will be bad for your mom’s condition.

360
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,820
You really need to think about it.

361
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,450
(So she made you a romantic man.)

362
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,699
(It’s not romantic to show it off.)

363
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,795
(Why did you put your hand inside?)

364
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,378
(I got it.)

365
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,229
(No, go back.)

366
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,060
Are you trying to kill yourself?

367
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,660
Did you do it on purpose?

368
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,340
Did you or did you not?

369
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,020
And

370
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,060
your daughter.

371
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,500
She paid me so little

372
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
and asked me to do a lot.

373
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,140
Aren’t you embarrassed?

374
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,540
Sis.

375
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,740
Sis.

376
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,740
Why are you so careless?

377
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,300
Mom.

378
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,383
Are you all right?

379
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,820
Let me give you some water.

380
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,060
You need to look after her carefully.

381
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:30,914
OK.

382
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,860
Bella.

383
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,500
I didn’t do it on purpose.

384
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,340
I wasn’t on purpose.

385
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,020
Please go back.

386
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,420
Didn’t you hear it?

387
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,260
Do you want me to dig out

388
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,060
how you abused my mom?

389
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,620
I... didn’t abuse her.

390
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,220
You didn’t?

391
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,620
Why is she scared to see you around?

392
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:03,980
If you didn’t,

393
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,220
what did I see just now?

394
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,420
I paid you a lot every month.

395
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,300
You didn’t take good care of her.

396
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,580
Why did you even abuse her?

397
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,980
She suffers a lot.

398
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,300
Aren’t you afraid of karma

399
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,700
for abusing her?

400
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,020
I...

401
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,060
Karma?

402
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,300
She tried to run away all the time,

403
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,540
asking to see her daughter.

404
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,660
She hits people

405
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,340
and destroys things.

406
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
I have to take care of such a madwoman.

407
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,500
What can I do?

408
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,020
What can I do?

409
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,180
Get out.

410
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,700
Get out now!

411
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,300
Are you serious?

412
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,940
All right.

413
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,860
I am leaving.

414
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,740
I want to see

415
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,380
if you can find any caregiver except me.

416
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,580
By the way.

417
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,980
The money you paid

418
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,100
is not even enough for meals.

419
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,860
Mom.

420
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,620
I won’t leave you again.

421
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,780
I’ll be here for you.

422
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,180
I won’t let anyone bully you.

423
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
You girls are here.

424
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,900
Get prepared.

425
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,940
Don’t roam around.

426
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,380
Especially you, Qiyi.

427
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,940
You’ll act with Xun.

428
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,300
Don’t make mistakes.

429
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,580
All right.

430
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,900
Get it together.

431
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,620
OK.

432
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,140
What’s wrong with you?

433
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,380
I’m on my period.

434
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,380
Why did you have so much cold water?

435
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,980
It just came.

436
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,060
I didn’t expect it would come today.

437
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,020
Does it hurt badly?

438
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,260
I can’t bear it.

439
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,780
Wait.

440
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,060
Let me get you some warm water.

441
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,180
No, thanks.

442
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,300
I need to take pills.

443
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,940
Do you have them with you?

444
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,700
Qiyi.

445
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,860
Can you buy some for me, please?

446
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,460
But it will be our turn soon.

447
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
There are four more scenes.

448
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,220
We can make it.

449
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,140
Never mind.

450
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,780
I’d better just put up with it.

451
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,140
Let me check around.

452
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,100
Call me when it’s our turn.

453
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,580
Thank you, Qiyi.

454
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,300
No problem.

455
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,220
I have to go.

456
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,860
Hey,

457
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,580
what’s wrong?

458
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,780
Hello,

459
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,700
I’m an actress.

460
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,860
I am filming a play here.

461
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,980
Is there any pharmacy near here?

462
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,380
How far is the nearest one?

463
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,940
There is.

464
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,900
There is one about 1km away.

465
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,380
It looks like an emergency.

466
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,180
Let me give you a ride.

467
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,100
It just takes a few minutes.

468
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,020
OK.

469
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,340
Please hurry up.

470
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,060
I don’t have much time.

471
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,780
All right.

472
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,780
Come on, get in.

473
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,140
Sit back.

474
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,220
Sir.

475
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,100
How long does it take to get there?

476
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,420
Almost there.

477
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,460
Sir.

478
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,620
Pull over right here.

479
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,660
I’m getting off.

480
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,980
Sir.

481
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:25,060
Sir.

482
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,180
Can you pull over?

483
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,660
Stop! Right now!

484
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,660
If you don’t stop,

485
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,860
I’ll jump now.

486
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,380
You picked the wrong car.

487
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,740
Now you want to get off?

488
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,020
Is it possible?

489
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,740
What do you want?

490
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,420
Just look around.

491
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,460
I can do whatever I want.

492
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,420
You... don’t you dare it!

493
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:45,980
If you ever touch me,

494
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,820
I’ll yell for help.

495
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,540
Help!

496
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,879
Help!

497
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,740
What’s wrong?

498
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,060
You scared me.

499
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,940
I almost hit someone.

500
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:08,100
Hey!

501
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,300
Aren’t you going to the pharmacy?

502
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,180
I’m not going.

503
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,620
You haven’t paid me.

504
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,380
Interesting.

505
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,900
Hello, Senior.

506
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,020
Lu Qiyi.

507
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,340
Where did you go?

508
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,380
It’s your scene now!

509
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,540
I need you to be here in five minutes.

510
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,060
All right, I’ll be there soon.

511
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,460
Hello!

512
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,100
100 years
after the princess fell asleep,

513
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,740
a prince will kiss her to wake her up.

514
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,220
Today is the day after 100 years.

515
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,540
Let’s give them our best wishes.

516
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,020
My dear princess.

517
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,980
Why don’t you wake up now?

518
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,660
My dear princess.

519
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,860
Why don’t you wake up now?

520
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:17,820
Hey prince.

521
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,980
Are you stupid?

522
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,820
Cheat.

523
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:27,605
What?

524
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,900
Cheat.

525
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,300
The witch!

526
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,260
The witch is here!

527
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:53,514
Go away, witch!

528
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:07,180
Kaixin!

529
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,620
Kaixin!

530
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,540
Wait.

531
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,980
We were just acting.

532
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
Do you think I’ll buy it?

533
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
Go back to your princess.

534
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,980
It’s just acting.

535
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
Why didn’t you tell me she is here?

536
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,460
I...

537
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,380
She just took the job.

538
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,940
Li Sanshang.

539
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,460
Now I know why you didn’t join the crew

540
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,260
but came here instead!

541
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,580
Principal.

542
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,020
Mr. Li.

543
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,740
It’s class time.

544
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,380
What are you doing here?

545
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,860
I’m sorry.

546
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,340
A moment, please. I’ll go back there.

547
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,700
Kaixin.

548
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,700
Don’t be mad at me.

549
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,580
Wait for me.

550
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,260
I’ll get back to you after class, OK?

551
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,540
You either go with me

552
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,940
or never see me again.

553
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,300
Don’t be angry.

554
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,220
I’ll go back to class.

555
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,300
I am sorry.

556
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,420
Sorry, director.

557
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,660
I’m late.

558
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,660
Lu Qiyi.

559
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,100
Didn’t I ask you to wait here?

560
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,420
I went to buy medicine for Song Qinqin.

561
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,380
Medicine?

562
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,620
I mean, can you pick another time?

563
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,420
If the shooting is delayed,

564
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,940
can you afford it?

565
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,500
I am sorry.

566
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,380
I’m sorry, director.

567
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,780
I won’t do that again.

568
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
If it’s not Song Qinqin who memorized

569
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,820
your lines and played your part,

570
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,660
the crew had to wait for you.

571
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,740
What did you say?

572
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,540
Ma Xiangyu.

573
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,300
Why did you yell at her?

574
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,340
Look at you.

575
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,900
In this crew,

576
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,340
it’s not your turn to point fingers.

577
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,860
Qiyi.

578
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,740
Leave him alone.

579
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,300
Let’s go.

580
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,420
Director.

581
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,140
I am really sorry.

582
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,220
I won’t do it again.

583
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,380
I’ll go get changed.

584
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,620
Get changed?

585
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,780
Let Song Qinqin get changed.

586
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,180
You won’t play the part.

587
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,940
Qiyi.

588
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,980
Don’t take it personally.

589
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,940
He was blamed by the director

590
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,180
for bad crew management.

591
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,020
Where are you going?

592
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
I’ll get changed.

593
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,420
Come on, let me take you for dinner.

594
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,940
Mom, come in.

595
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,660
Come here.

596
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,940
Mom, take a seat.

597
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,940
Where are we?

598
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,180
Mom,

599
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
from now on,

600
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,420
this is our home.

601
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,700
Mom, wait here.

602
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,420
Mom.

603
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,180
When I have fewer classes in the rest
of this semester,

604
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,820
I’ll spend more time with you.

605
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,700
When I am not around,

606
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,460
remember to eat and drink.

607
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,900
Take care of yourself.

608
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,820
I’ll put breakfast here.

609
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,820
I’ll also bring lunch for you.

610
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,900
Later,

611
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,340
I’ll buy you a TV.

612
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,860
If you’re bored,

613
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,900
you can watch TV.

614
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,140
Bella.

615
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:12,978
What?

616
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,300
Sorry to put you to trouble.

617
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,420
No.

618
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,220
Mom.

619
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,860
What did you say?

620
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,780
Have I put you to trouble?

621
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,580
No.

622
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,100
I must have.

623
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,420
No.

624
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,740
What about

625
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,220
I go home?

626
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,700
No, you can’t.

627
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,780
Mom.

628
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,860
I’ll never let anyone bully you anymore.

629
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,420
No one bullied me.

630
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,610
They’re all nice to me.

631
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,340
Mom.

632
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,860
Please stay here.

633
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,460
I want you to stay with me.

634
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,780
I must have put you to trouble.

635
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,300
Where are we?

636
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,180
All right. Here we are.

637
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,300
Hey! Fairy,

638
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,260
why are you here?

639
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,900
What are you doing here?

640
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,060
We’re here for dinner.

641
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,900
Take a seat.

642
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,620
Waitress.

643
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,820
Order, please.

644
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:17,820
Let me take a look.

645
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,020
Who’s that?

646
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,980
Open the door.

647
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,700
Open the door!

648
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,300
Who’s that?

649
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,660
Who lets you stay at my house?

650
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,260
Get out now!

651
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,860
Get out!

652
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,980
Get out!

653
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,420
Bella.

654
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:51,900
Get out!

655
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,540
Bella. Bella.

656
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,020
Get out now!

657
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,900
- Get out, get out!
- Bella.

658
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,940
Get your hands off.

659
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,620
Get out now.

660
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,900
I’ll call the police.

661
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,700
Call the police?

662
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,420
This is my house.

663
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,540
I’ll sue you for breaking
into my house.

664
00:36:17,484 --> 00:36:18,853
It’s so late.

665
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,860
Still so many people out there.

666
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,580
Instead of going home alone,

667
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,340
why not have some porridge

668
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,380
to warm up first?

669
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,540
Why don’t you eat it?

670
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
No appetite.

671
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,780
Just have some.

672
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,621
It’s tasty.

673
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,380
Really.

674
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,100
Qiyi.

675
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,140
What happened today?

676
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,300
I went to buy medicine for Song Qinqin.

677
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,540
Why did it take you so long?

678
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,580
There are no pharmacies nearby.

679
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,988
What’s wrong with her?

680
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,020
She got her period, menstrual cramps.

681
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,020
She’s as healthy as a horse.

682
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,300
It doesn’t look like so.

683
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,820
Maybe she got better.

684
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,466
Never mind.

685
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,700
Don’t think about it.

686
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,138
When it’s finished,

687
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,580
let me take you to an interesting place.

688
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,258
What place?

689
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
Jinsha Village.

690
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,140
Where is this?

691
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,060
Before my dad became a water gun vendor,

692
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,020
we used to live there.

693
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,260
We may walk on the beach during the day.

694
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,860
Watch birds on the sea.

695
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,580
At night,

696
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,620
we may stay in the cabin

697
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,420
and hear the sound of waves.

698
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,260
You’ve no idea how relaxing it is.

699
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,180
Can I keep this?

700
00:37:56,832 --> 00:37:57,416
What?

701
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,460
Can I keep it as a gift?

702
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,860
Take this one too.

703
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,580
May I?

704
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,780
Sure.

705
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,700
Ma’am, have some water, please.

706
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,300
We actually rented this house.

707
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,580
Rent?

708
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,060
Who rented it to you?

709
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,580
I’ve never rented it out.

710
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,980
I just called the agency.

711
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,900
The line was busy.

712
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,940
You called the agency,

713
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,300
and the line was busy?

714
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,620
Are you kidding me?

715
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,096
No.

716
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,940
I was not kidding.

717
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,180
There must be some misunderstanding.

718
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,020
By the way, it’s midnight now.

719
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,260
Where shall I go?

720
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,580
What about this?

721
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,700
How about tomorrow?

722
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,220
Wherever you go,

723
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,140
it’s none of my business.

724
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,980
But you have to move out today.

725
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,500
Ma’am, look.

726
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,980
This is the contract I signed with
the agency.

727
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,020
You signed with the agency?

728
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,460
It has nothing to do with me.

729
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,780
I’m telling you again.

730
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,860
I’ve never rented it out.

731
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,420
You must move out now.

732
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,020
If you didn’t rent it,

733
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,700
could it be your family?

734
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,820
Why don’t you ask them?

735
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,300
It’s the middle of the night.

736
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,820
And you just broke in?

737
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,460
It’s a legal contract.

738
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,700
It’s legally binding.

739
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,580
Besides,

740
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,980
you said it’s your house.

741
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,940
But you didn’t show me your proof.

742
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,740
How do I know if it’s true?

743
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,860
What do you mean?

744
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,980
You mean I lied to you?

745
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,100
No, Ma’am.

746
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,300
It’s not what I meant.

747
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,128
Then what?

748
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:31,555
I...

749
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:32,115
Bella.

750
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,580
Let’s go.

751
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,620
I mean, you’re a grown-up.

752
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
Your daughter is unreasonable.

753
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,660
Are you unreasonable too?

754
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,740
You liars.

755
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,140
Look at the mess.

756
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,820
Ma’am!

757
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,940
I’m not leaving today.

758
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,180
If you don’t get out,

759
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,340
I’ll call the police.

760
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:50,347
What?

761
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,180
Get out!

762
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,580
You just wait right here.

763
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,820
Mom.

764
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:12,900
Bella.

765
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,180
