Get up, guys!

25
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,450
You’re late for morning exercises.

26
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:55,325
Zimo, it’s me.

27
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,750
Yank Kaixin and Bai Qiao up.

28
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Morning, Mr. Sun.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,700
Li Xiao.

30
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:07,575
Is it just you?

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,450
Where are the others?

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,100
Uh...

33
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,750
What time is it?

34
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:11,775
Where are they?

35
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:14,425
I’m asking you!

36
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,000
What are they doing?

37
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:44,325
Today,

38
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,625
we’ll start with a beach scenario.

39
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,700
Now,

40
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,700
imagine that you’re all on the beach.

41
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,150
You may work with your partners.

42
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,675
There’s no limitation,

43
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:57,750
but

44
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,900
you need to convince me.

45
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:02,250
I expect to see a real-life beach scene.

46
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:03,075
Action!

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,500
(Li Sanshang, what’s the deal?
Who was the girl you hugged last night?)

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,350
(Come back! Talk to me!)

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,900
What are you doing?

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,500
Are you a sea turtle or what?

51
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:42,750
Back in line!

52
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,950
What kind of beach scenario was that?

53
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,700
Are you kidding me?

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,325
I don’t get it!

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,525
Think, people!

56
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,475
If you were on the beach,

57
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,600
what would you wear

58
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,975
and what would you do?

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,550
Use your brain.

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,350
Try again!

61
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,300
Roast starfish!

62
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:10,750
Roast squids!

63
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,325
Roast kelps!

64
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:13,950
Roast crabs!

65
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:17,750
Do you like

66
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,600
this place?

67
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:21,600
I do.

68
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,400
Really.

69
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:23,675
Are you cold?

70
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,200
I’m good.

71
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,850
Sanshang,

72
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,296
are those your grandpa’s shorts?

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,100
What are you two doing?

74
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,300
What’s your relationship?

75
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,291
We’re...

76
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,325
- A couple!
- A couple?

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,925
You don’t look like one.

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Think again.

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,050
What would a real couple do?

80
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:07,400
And you?

81
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,150
You should’ve built your role

82
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,300
before playing it out.

83
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:15,975
Immerse yourself in the given situation.

84
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,275
Go on.

85
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,925
While you’re swimming,

86
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,550
bigger waves are hitting you.

87
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,050
Suddenly, a huge one catches you!

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,475
Wu Rida,

89
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:38,800
you’re a shark.

90
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,800
Shark!

91
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,804
It’s coming at you!

92
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,575
Run!

93
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:01,775
Xiuwen,

94
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,000
come here. Come.

95
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:07,875
You aren’t afraid at all?

96
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,550
Are you some superhero?

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,375
And who’d dress like that on the beach?

98
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:15,200
Are you shy?

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,350
Or still reserved?

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,900
Hey, guys, give him a hand.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,650
No, no, no.

102
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,500
Take off your clothes!

103
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,000
Don’t!

104
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:31,750
Stop!

105
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:37,675
Go away!

106
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:41,750
Put it back on.

107
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:44,375
Mr. Sun.

108
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:46,975
Why didn’t you call it off?

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,975
We’re in the middle of a scene.

110
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,200
Listen,

111
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,750
you don’t get to decide when to stop.

112
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,850
Only the director can.

113
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,575
Xiuwen is introverted.

114
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,700
Why did you give him a hard time?

115
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,425
When they were stripping him off,

116
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:00,475
why didn’t you do anything?

117
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:01,075
Fang Yan...

118
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:04,400
Let me ask you something.

119
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,600
When you went to the beach to swim,

120
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,124
what would you normally wear

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
and do?

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,125
Nowadays,

123
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,550
actors do non-physical performance

124
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,850
against the green scene a lot.

125
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,572
If you can’t even pull through

126
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:21,875
the basic scene practice,

127
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,500
better quit acting now!

128
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:30,025
But still, we deserve respect.

129
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:30,725
Respect?

130
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,350
Fang Yan,

131
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,125
respect goes both ways.

132
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,875
You skipped morning exercises.

133
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,600
I asked you not to sign up
for school clubs

134
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,350
so you’d focus on your study.

135
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:46,575
And what did you do?

136
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,775
You started your own club.

137
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,825
What’s more,

138
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:52,825
last night,

139
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,800
you must’ve had a lot of fun,

140
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,975
drinking and dancing, right?

141
00:07:59,325 --> 00:07:59,900
Very well.

142
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:01,675
Keep that up.

143
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Go have fun.

144
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,325
Go ahead.

145
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:06,375
Enjoy yourselves.

146
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,275
Mr. Sun...

147
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,050
Li Xiao.

148
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,800
I’ll go check on him.

149
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,800
So what’s that all about?

150
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,425
Mr. Sun is mad at us!

151
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,775
Let’s go get him back.

152
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,075
Fang Yan,

153
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,075
that was disrespectful

154
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,350
to a teacher!

155
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,775
He was speaking for Xiuwen.

156
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:42,950
And you!

157
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:44,775
Would it kill you to show some skin?

158
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,225
Be a man, will you? Come on!

159
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,475
To be fair,
he didn’t know Mr. Sun would...

160
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:48,475
Enough! Shut up!

161
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:49,650
And what did you do?

162
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:52,500
Mr. Sun...

163
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,975
Stop! Break it off!

164
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:54,800
Go apologize to him!

165
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,100
Silence!

166
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,425
Calm down.

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,450
That’s loud.

168
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,725
Mr. Sun stormed off.

169
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:03,925
The most important thing

170
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:05,800
is to get him back.

171
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,125
It’s all your fault!

172
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,225
What did I do?

173
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:09,250
You don’t know?

174
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,000
Hadn’t it been for you,

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,875
we wouldn’t have come late

176
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,225
and Mr. Sun
wouldn’t have left in anger.

177
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,125
I sent messages
through group chat yesterday.

178
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:14,950
Yes, you did.

179
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,950
You did do that.

180
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,950
But when did you send them?

181
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,975
Couldn’t you tell us in person?

182
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,919
But you all went dancing last night.

183
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,450
We were busy

184
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,300
having fun.

185
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,400
Who had time to check the phone?

186
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,350
Did you?

187
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,050
And you?

188
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,075
I didn’t.

189
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,850
I saw her message.

190
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,725
Stay out of it!

191
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:30,650
We didn’t ask you!

192
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,375
What’s wrong with you, Hao Kaixin?

193
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:31,975
What are you doing?

194
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:33,225
Knock it off!

195
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,350
Don’t touch me!

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,300
Are you nuts?

197
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,800
Stop it, all of you!

198
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,225
No more fighting!

199
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:45,325
You started it!

200
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,125
Zip it!

201
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:56,475
Now you’re crying?

202
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:57,325
Shut your pie hole!

203
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,031
Can you two stop?

204
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:02,900
Are you picking a fight?

205
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,450
What’s the matter with you?

206
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:05,625
Shut up, shrew!

207
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:12,175
Hey, man.

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,750
You were bold in class.

209
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:22,675
Which girl did it?

210
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,875
Does she have a friend?

211
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,800
Don’t be shy!

212
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Wait for me, man!

213
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:44,850
Where are you going?

214
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,050
To see Mr. Sun.

215
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:47,800
And do what exactly?

216
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:49,475
Apologize to him.

217
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:50,900
Like that would change anything.

218
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,100
Besides, you did nothing wrong.

219
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,875
I mean,

220
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,425
they all saw your messages.

221
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,350
But after a long night of partying,

222
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,875
they couldn’t get out of bed so early.

223
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,250
Is that what you’re gonna tell Mr. Sun?

224
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,700
Look,

225
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,375
he’s in a fit of anger.

226
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,150
Give him some time to cool down.

227
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,075
Come on.

228
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:07,175
Let’s go.

229
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,250
Bravo, Ms. Tang.

230
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:39,275
Once they see your demo,

231
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,800
you’ll bring back

232
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,350
another international award for us.

233
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,325
That’s exactly

234
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:45,625
what I’m striving for.

235
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,450
Speaking of which,

236
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,650
I’ll leave the post-production to you.

237
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,725
No problem. You got it.

238
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:52,700
Director Fang,

239
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,850
my students are waiting.

240
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:56,600
I gotta run.

241
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:57,700
OK. Sure. Go ahead.

242
00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:58,350
See you.

243
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,475
Thanks for the help.

244
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,125
Don’t mention it.

245
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,050
Appreciated.

246
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:07,325
Breathe.

247
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,775
One, two, three, four,

248
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:16,050
five, six, seven. Continue.

249
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:20,975
Two, two, three, four,

250
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,250
five... yeah, six...

251
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,500
Chin up. Good.

252
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:26,700
Eight... OK. Bend.

253
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,700
One, two...

254
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,322
Open your thigh.

255
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:36,275
Bend.

256
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:38,725
Stretch your body.

257
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:39,900
Like this. Good.

258
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,850
Stretch your body.

259
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,525
Yes.

260
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,225
Straighten your leg.

261
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,650
Ms. Tang,

262
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,125
stretch my body

263
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,475
and bend, right?

264
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:53,300
Cut it out!

265
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,750
Bend!

266
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:07,950
Ms. Tang.

267
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,425
Hi.

268
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:09,600
Overtime?

269
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,700
Hey,

270
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,550
I heard about your little situation.

271
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,100
Kids now

272
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,800
are getting worse and worse.

273
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:32,550
Not exactly.

274
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,825
You don’t know that for sure.

275
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,500
Well, I mean,

276
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,125
it’s too soon

277
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:40,175
to jump to conclusions.

278
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,850
We’ll see.

279
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,050
I can give you a hand if you want.

280
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,925
Oh?

281
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,225
So you got a plan?

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,050
Don’t worry too much.

283
00:14:58,175 --> 00:14:59,375
When Mr. Sun shows up at the door,

284
00:14:59,375 --> 00:14:59,975
let’s...

285
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,225
Li Xiao.

286
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,650
Where’s Mr. Sun?

287
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,100
I’ve talked to him more than once,

288
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:11,475
but...

289
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,625
Self-practice for now.

290
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:21,950
Li Xiao.

291
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,975
Li Xiao.

292
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,850
Is Mr. Sun giving us up?

293
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,775
I’ve never seen him this furious.

294
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,025
Hey,

295
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,900
I’ll try to talk to him again.

296
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,350
And you guys see what you can do.

297
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,550
OK.

298
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Thank you.

299
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:45,525
See you.

300
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,450
Wait.

301
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,250
Sorry about last time.

302
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,350
I didn’t mean to ruin your shirt.

303
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,000
This one is for you.

304
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,475
I hope it fits.

305
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,575
Again, I’m sorry.

306
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,700
My shirt?

307
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,675
I should go.

308
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:00,700
Bye.

309
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:01,725
Bye.

310
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:09,500
I’m sorry. My bad.

311
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,525
I didn’t mean to...

312
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:19,275
Qiyi,

313
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,675
you knew Zhang Yang?

314
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:23,750
Our parents are pretty close.

315
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,700
So childhood sweethearts then?

316
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,250
Are you blushing?

317
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,800
I’m not!

318
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,875
It’s the heat.

319
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,300
From the outside or the inside?

320
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,500
You know, I can hook you two up.

321
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,875
Don’t!

322
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:40,975
Why?

323
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:41,750
I’m experienced.

324
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,125
Think of me as Cupid.

325
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,450
My arrows

326
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,575
always make happy couples.

327
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:47,200
Mr. Sun...

328
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,829
Oh my God!

329
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:50,700
Big dog!

330
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:52,650
Qiyi,

331
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:53,525
it’s OK.

332
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,125
Don’t worry. It won’t bite.

333
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,125
I... I’ll protect you.

334
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:01,900
You go see Mr. Sun.

335
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,150
I’ll take care of this dog.

336
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,150
Good luck.

337
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,350
Yeah. The same to you.

338
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,925
Go away!

339
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,450
My turn.

340
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,425
That was close!

341
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:38,675
Mr. Sun...

342
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,750
I’m sorry, sir.

343
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,825
It’s my fault.

344
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,925
They missed morning exercises

345
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,575
because of my delayed messages.

346
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,125
I’ll take full responsibility for it.

347
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,500
But please come back and teach us.

348
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:56,400
Qiyi,

349
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,975
let me ask you a question.

350
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:00,900
Are all of you

351
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,475
ready to be professional actors?

352
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,025
I told you

353
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,575
what the most important thing is

354
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,900
to be an actor

355
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,600
in my very first lecture.

356
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,825
Go back

357
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,175
and review that with your peers.

358
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,375
Good day, Mr. Sun.

359
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,400
(Gentle and Pleasant Breeze)

360
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,250
See you, Mr. Zhang.

361
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:44,900
Mr. Sun,

362
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:51,200
I see what you’re playing.

363
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:11,075
OK. Class,

364
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:13,100
let’s talk about philosophy.

365
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,875
Let’s start with the definition.

366
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,450
Philosophy is the linguistic form
and summary of the world-view,

367
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,625
in which it covers a key concept,

368
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,375
dialectical materialism.

369
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,850
(Is Mr. Sun gonna come back?)
So what is dialectical materialism?

370
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:28,575
Marxist dialectics emphasizes

371
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,675
universal connection

372
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,325
and development.

373
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,825
(What if he stops teaching us?)
There are three basic laws.

374
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,525
(Bai Qiao, what did Li Xiao say to you?)
What are they?

375
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,475
First, Law of Unity
and Struggles of Opposites.

376
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,525
(@Bai Qiao)
Second, Law of the Negation of Negation.

377
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:47,700
Third, Law of Transformation
of Quantitative to Qualitative Change.

378
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,825
(@Bai Qiao)
Please note that those three laws

379
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:51,575
are interrelated.

380
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:53,100
- Rich brats like her...
- They can be...

381
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,737
- are a mystery.
- quite useful in our daily life.

382
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,175
In terms of dialectics...

383
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,721
- Rich brats?
- what are the methods?

384
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,950
- But I heard...
- That is...

385
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,375
- she always stays out all night.
- induction and summary.

386
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:02,400
You should be able to use them.

387
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,050
No way!

388
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,625
Really?

389
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,584
They’re crucial in philosophy.

390
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,525
- Kaixin.
- Second...

391
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,100
You and Bai Qiao are roommates.

392
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,124
- What do you know?
- You can also...

393
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,025
- Is she out a lot at night?
- go for concretization.

394
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:14,775
What?

395
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:15,325
As a result...

396
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:16,100
Is she?

397
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,024
(Ethics before skills.)
It’s dialectical.

398
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:17,900
So what if she is?

399
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,100
What’s that to do with you?

400
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,200
Science and philosophy...

401
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,000
- Wow!
- As for the specialized sciences...

402
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:23,925
- Ask Qiyi if you don’t believe it.
- and philosophy…

403
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,925
The former refers to...

404
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,450
(Person Rules)
Be a good person

405
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,950
to be a good actor.

406
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,475
You should know ethics before skills.

407
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,374
That’s not always the case.

408
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:37,590
There are exceptions.

409
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,150
Yes or no?

410
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:39,175
- But philosophy...
- Huh?

411
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,525
Well, it’s about

412
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,450
general laws of the whole world.

413
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:46,125
That’s what it is. So...

414
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,600
Yeah! Good job!

415
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,775
I thought we were acting!

416
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:30,700
Go on! Well done!

417
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,437
Go, go, go!

418
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:37,200
Come on!

419
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,800
Knock him down!

420
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:51,225
That’s right!

421
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:55,150
The first lesson in acting

422
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,775
is to liberate your nature.

423
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,825
And wrestling

424
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,700
happens to be a perfect method

425
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,850
to help you feel physical contact.

426
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,175
What are you doing?

427
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,350
Fang Yan,

428
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:09,400
run!

429
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,575
Stop! Stay where you are!

430
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,500
Don’t move!

431
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,175
Or you’ll get demerits!

432
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,075
Who’s in charge here?

433
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,575
Step forward!

434
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:20,850
Do it!

435
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,725
Run!

436
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:26,500
Fang Yan!

437
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,000
Get out!

438
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,125
Stop!

439
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,975
Stop there!

440
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:30,225
Come back! Stop!

441
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,150
Who tipped them off?

442
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,775
Stop!

443
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:45,300
I told you not to do it
in the classroom.

444
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,400
And look what happened!

445
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,650
Stop complaining.

446
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,950
Without a venue,

447
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,725
we might have to close the club.

448
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,100
Is it that bad?

449
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,475
Yes, it is.

450
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:00,650
I...

451
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:12,875
Freshmen and sophomores
take tomorrow’s acting class together.

452
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,850
Mr. Sun is leaving us for real.

453
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,425
(Gallery)

454
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:25,875
Joining us today

455
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,225
is Lin Wei from the School of Music.

456
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,575
OK.

457
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,500
Let’s start off

458
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,700
with some gentle exercises.

459
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:40,925
Are you playing Chinese chess?

460
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,125
OK.

461
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,850
What are you doing?

462
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,450
I...

463
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,475
I’m giving him advice.

464
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:48,575
And that is?

465
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
To play the Elephant.

466
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:52,525
No, I’m not doing that.

467
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,075
I’m going with the Horse.

468
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,900
He knows nothing.

469
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:54,975
I see. Not bad.

470
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,975
Think before you act.

471
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,550
We can’t stand here and do nothing.

472
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,475
Is Ms. Tang ignoring us?

473
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,875
Someone needs to talk to her.

474
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,625
Who will that be?

475
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,100
Don’t move.

476
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,350
- OK.
- Ms. Tang.

477
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:20,125
Good.

478
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,950
That’s better.

479
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,425
Ms. Tang,

480
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,875
may I make a request?

481
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,425
What is it?

482
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,550
Ms. Tang.

483
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,875
Ms. Tang,

484
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,000
what the seniors are doing

485
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,600
have greatly inspired us.

486
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,250
So,

487
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,925
can we join them?

488
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:57,575
Is that what you want?

489
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,875
Yes!

490
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:01,050
Are you ready?

491
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,550
We are!

492
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:04,275
OK.

493
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:05,350
Cut!

494
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,150
Now, I want all of you

495
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:15,450
to be statues.

496
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,125
OK. Three, two, one.

497
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:18,725
Action!

498
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,900
Very well.

499
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,075
From now on, you can’t move.

500
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,150
Hold it for 10 minutes.

501
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,800
If you can’t, just sit down.

502
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:28,550
Don’t disturb the others.

503
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:29,675
Be quiet.

504
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,800
Statue is the must-have training

505
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,800
contrasting the control of your body

506
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,200
and the release of inner feelings.

507
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,950
It’s like silence music,

508
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,525
a mute cry from the heart.

509
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,950
I can’t do this anymore.

510
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,325
Be quiet.

511
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:54,600
Others are still in the zone.

512
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,450
Even when the music stops,

513
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,750
your body freezes,

514
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,475
your heart is still singing.

515
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,975
What’s up?

516
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,850
Are you Li Shuang, an art student?

517
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:16,800
Yeah.

518
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,050
Come with us.

519
00:27:27,475 --> 00:27:29,600
It hurts, Mister!

520
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,100
Sanshang,

521
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,625
come and massage me.

522
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,550
Be gentle with me, Mister.

523
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,775
Help me up.

524
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,925
She’s worse than men.

525
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,650
That was sheer torture!

526
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,800
Come to think of it,

527
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:51,275
Mr. Sun is a little bit better than her.

528
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,700
Just a little bit?

529
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,775
He’s so much better!

530
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,100
Yet you cried like a baby in his class.

531
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,800
That’s right.

532
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,775
I was scared.

533
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:05,675
Let’s go.

534
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
May I have your attention, please?

535
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,500
I have something to say.

536
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,550
I’m sorry.

537
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:22,050
I owe you an apology.

538
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:24,325
You failed to attend morning exercises

539
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:26,975
due to my negligence.

540
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,825
I made a mistake there.

541
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:29,700
Yes, you did.

542
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,900
I went to see Mr. Sun

543
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,450
and apologized to him

544
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,926
but that wasn’t enough to get him back.

545
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,200
So I’m thinking

546
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,950
he’s expecting changes as a whole.

547
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,625
Like what?

548
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,475
Do you remember

549
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,525
what he said

550
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:51,950
in his first lecture?

551
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:53,450
I do.

552
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,350
Don’t be late. Dress properly.

553
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,600
No jewelry.

554
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,375
He couldn’t be set off

555
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,275
by this thing I’m wearing, could he?

556
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:08,475
It’s just a lucky charm.

557
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,800
Get to the point.

558
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:13,600
What do you want?

559
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,300
Mr. Sun once said,

560
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:18,625
“ethics before skills”.

561
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,675
He’s developed his own teaching style.

562
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,250
If we have questions about it,

563
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,650
it’s OK to ask him in class.

564
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:31,875
But we cut morning exercises,

565
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:33,700
talked back to him during practice

566
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,525
and went dancing all night.

567
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,850
All that has crossed the line.

568
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,825
Is there anything we can do to fix it?

569
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,700
A signed petition by all of us

570
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,575
to invite him back

571
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,300
together.

572
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,550
A signed petition?

573
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,325
Will it work?

574
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,225
I’ll sign it.

575
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,450
So will I.

576
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,250
Me too.

577
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,675
Objection!

578
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,000
It’s a waste of time.

579
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,775
Exactly.

580
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:13,825
There’s no harm in trying.

581
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,300
Qiyi, where’s the petition?

582
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,025
I’ll sign it now.

583
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,225
Me too.

584
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,250
Fine, whatever.

585
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,550
What’s up?

586
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,025
Fang Yan,

587
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,000
help!

588
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,500
Bail me out of the Police Office.

589
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,100
I got caught.

590
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,700
I see.

591
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:35,000
I’m on my way.

592
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:36,200
Sign this.

593
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,050
Not now.

594
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,650
Maybe later.

595
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,800
I know where he’s going.

596
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,550
Follow me.

597
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,875
(Student’s Signature: Fang Yan)

598
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,650
Don’t you guys know

599
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:00,150
there are cameras everywhere?

600
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,150
We won’t do it again.

601
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,050
You better not!

602
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:07,475
You’re allowed to have your own club,

603
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,550
but do your activities outside.

604
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:14,675
Classrooms are for studying only.

605
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,958
When you saw us, you tried to run away

606
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,800
and you bit me.

607
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:22,100
What were you thinking?

608
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:24,275
Not to mention
those desks and chairs you broke.

609
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,025
We’ll pay for them.

610
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:29,375
I sense no remorse.

611
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:30,725
Listen,

612
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:32,825
the dean’s office
will hear from us soon.

613
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,225
They’ll take it from there

614
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,725
and deal with you.

615
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:38,150
From now on,

616
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,075
all the classrooms

617
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:42,625
are off-limits to your club.

618
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:47,425
What to do?

619
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,175
(Police Office)

620
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,125
How did it go, man?

621
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,175
Our club

622
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,975
can no longer use any classrooms.

623
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,475
Who was that snitch?

624
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:16,500
Little Target Drama Club

625
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,125
is on the verge of collapse.

626
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,500
Is there any way to save it?

627
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,350
A public rehearsal room will do,

628
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,950
but it’s hard to find one.

629
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,425
Hello?

630
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,450
Is anyone here?

631
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:15,775
Hey, hey...

632
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,275
I knew you’d come around.

633
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,325
No, I...

634
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,300
Qiyi,

635
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,825
I sensed the vibe between us

636
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,475
the first time we met.

637
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:34,000
Look,

638
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:37,450
if you agree to be my disciple,

639
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,300
I’ll keep my promise

640
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,025
and shield you from
the peach blossom curse.

641
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:43,775
Put this charm on your loved one

642
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,075
and you’ll be blessed.

643
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,250
But if you don’t...

644
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:52,150
“In the Peach Blossom Land
there is a peach blossom plot.

645
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:55,925
A peach blossom lover
lives in Peach Blossom Cot...”

646
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:57,075
I’ll do it.

647
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,925
You will?

648
00:33:58,775 --> 00:33:59,475
Only if

649
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:01,250
you do me a favor.

650
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,375
I got demerits.

651
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:11,875
Who’d know

652
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,275
our small club

653
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:14,775
would get into such big trouble?

654
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,625
I should’ve been there.

655
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,325
If I had,

656
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:18,725
none of this would’ve happened.

657
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,100
My old man always says,

658
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,250
“a good gain takes long pain”.

659
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,275
Last night was only an accident.

660
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,300
Don’t worry too much.

661
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Trust me.

662
00:34:30,575 --> 00:34:31,450
I assure you

663
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,225
it won’t happen again.

664
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:33,725
Yeah.

665
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:36,575
And we get extra credits
by joining the club.

666
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,925
It’s gonna take

667
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:41,725
a lot more than that

668
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:43,800
to cover my losses.

669
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:46,525
You can’t be on board

670
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,675
only for extra credits.

671
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,300
Your so-called club

672
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
doesn’t even have a rehearsal venue.

673
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,925
It’s a joke!

674
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,575
Not anymore!

675
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:12,525
Starting today,

676
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:14,375
Little Target Drama Club

677
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:16,350
has its own place.

678
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:25,100
(Petition Lu Qiyi Hao Kaixin
Li Sanshang Fang Yan...)

679
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,825
It’s done!

680
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:30,800
Here you are.

681
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:34,700
What’s that on your neck?

682
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:38,875
Hi, Bai Qiao.

683
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,250
A dog bite.

684
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,275
Is that all you got for Mr. Sun?

685
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,025
What else could we do?

686
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,250
I got a better idea.

687
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,200
Come.

688
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,325
Let’s go.

689
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:52,850
Come on.

690
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,500
(Gentle and Pleasant Breeze)
This time,

691
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:04,325
you’re doing down.

692
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,225
Or am I?

693
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,700
That’s mine!

694
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,000
Wait...

695
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,025
No taking back!

696
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:17,357
That’s the rule!

697
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:17,825
But... you...

698
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:18,800
You know it.

699
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:21,575
I didn’t see it coming.

700
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:24,375
(Fang Yan: Mr. Sun,)

701
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,650
(we’re waiting for you at the playground
to prove ourselves.)

702
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:27,525
Zhang,

703
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:28,950
come with me.

704
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,075
It’s showtime on the playground!

705
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,175
Not interested.

706
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,150
You don’t wanna

707
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,550
miss out on all the fun!

708
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,325
Is this Fang Yan’s genius idea?

709
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,525
What’s he doing?

710
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,749
