1
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,982
Stop. I am…

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,151
No!

3
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>If he so much as moves his hand,</i>

4
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:17,160
bring me his head in an instant.

5
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,974
Are you just getting home?

6
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,392
Yes, Father.

7
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,065
Would you care…

8
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,984
for a duel?

9
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,801
{\an8}This is a first.

10
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,889
{\an8}We never had the opportunity
to enjoy drinks together.

11
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,768
{\an8}Your swordsmanship has improved.

12
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,272
{\an8}Have you been honing your skills?

13
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,607
{\an8}While traveling in Ming,

14
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,027
{\an8}I needed to be able to defend myself.

15
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,125
{\an8}It brings me back to the day
when you first wanted lessons.

16
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,004
You said you met someone
you wished to protect.

17
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,302
Was Dam-i her name?

18
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,598
Were you able
to meet her when you returned?

19
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,102
They say she died.

20
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,938
Around that time,

21
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,398
she left the palace due to an illness.

22
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,907
Unaware of that fact, I suspected you.

23
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,409
I thought

24
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,371
that you had something to do with…

25
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,748
her disappearance.

26
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,791
No!

27
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,388
Do you still resent me?

28
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,099
It would be a lie to say that I do not.

29
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,351
However…

30
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,022
I have been trying to understand you.

31
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,527
How you stated
that you had to make that choice

32
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,570
for your family.

33
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,864
Although…

34
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,742
your choice still perplexes me.

35
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,753
EPISODE 15

36
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,309
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

37
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,228
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

38
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,939
Your Majesty!

39
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,985
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

40
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,030
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

41
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,907
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

42
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,826
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

43
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,369
Your Majesty!

44
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,039
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

45
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,915
Your Majesty!

46
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,847
May I ask who you are?

47
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,769
Please.

48
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,105
Please spare me.

49
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,399
Please spare me.

50
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,737
<i>So you witnessed
my husband's last moments.</i>

51
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,657
Someone murdered him.

52
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,661
Murder? What do you mean?

53
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,872
Why did my presence
make you fear for your life?

54
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,810
I thought Lord Sangheon had sent you.

55
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,899
My husband put me in hiding here
before he passed away.

56
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:08,029
He said there was a chance
that Lord Sangheon would send someone.

57
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,075
Could you inform me
of his involvement with Lord Sangheon?

58
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,709
To save my life ten years ago,

59
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,838
he asked Lord Sangheon for a favor.

60
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,675
In return,
he delivered a letter to someone.

61
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,970
The man who received it…

62
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,684
was executed for committing treason.

63
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,397
Lord Sangheon has been
holding that against my husband

64
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,607
all this time.

65
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,735
You should just kill me…

66
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,988
for this is all my fault.

67
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,659
Just to save my worthless life,
my husband…

68
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,411
Was the recipient of that letter

69
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,039
the Crown Prince's royal preceptor,

70
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,208
Kang Hwa-gil?

71
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,187
Listen.

72
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:29,902
Make sure you do not tell anyone
what you told me today.

73
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,998
What on earth are you doing?

74
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,709
Oh. It is nothing.

75
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,255
Scribe Jung,
here is this month's schedule.

76
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,591
Right. Thank you.

77
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,719
Hold on.

78
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,388
It looks like I have been excluded
from duties at His Majesty's office.

79
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,808
But that is what you requested.

80
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,186
You wished not to be
in His Majesty's presence.

81
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,814
The Chief Royal Secretary saw to it
that your request was granted.

82
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,323
I am humbled, Chief Royal Secretary.

83
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:01,952
However, I believe I have been
burdening Scribe Kim with extra chores.

84
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,622
I know it was I who requested it,

85
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,125
but the guilt has been eating away at me.

86
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,299
So from now on, I will take on
Scribe Kim's duties as well.

87
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,971
As of this moment, all entries for
the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat

88
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,598
will be mine to write.

89
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,027
{\an8}APPEAL TO THE KING

90
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,701
I've been waiting

91
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,954
for you to say that.

92
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,373
Had you taken any longer…

93
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,336
Even if you did…

94
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,298
I would have waited.

95
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,134
No matter how long.

96
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,690
Why are you looking at me like that?

97
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,277
Speak up if you wish.

98
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,696
Well, it is not worth saying.

99
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,491
Scribe Jung must not have a lot to do

100
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,704
considering how he had the time
to place lanterns along the path.

101
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,166
That is because the assigned eunuchs
have not done their job properly.

102
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,752
The path I take is barely lit,

103
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,047
but there are more than enough lanterns
near the court conference room.

104
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:41,051
That is because
it is where Lord Sangheon frequents.

105
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,096
You know I have
very little authority, Your Majesty.

106
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,400
Scribe Jung, what brings you here?

107
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,613
Why you are surprised is beyond me.
I am here to fulfill my duties.

108
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,491
Writing about His Majesty's daily life

109
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,743
is my duty as a scribe.

110
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,629
Is something wrong?

111
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,091
Please be at ease and be as you were.

112
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,822
I will go manage
the eunuchs now, Your Majesty.

113
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,162
I'll make sure they learn their lesson.

114
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,725
Are you sure all went well
with His Majesty that night?

115
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,478
You have been barely eating since.

116
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,148
Am I that ugly?

117
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,276
Pardon?

118
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,156
What on earth did I do wrong?

119
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,578
You can have this, Yu-gong.

120
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,540
I do not wish to raise concern
by dismissing food all the time.

121
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,336
Actually, I hear that His Majesty

122
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,923
does not have an amicable relationship
with his grandfather, Lord Sangheon.

123
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,676
Rather than it being your fault,

124
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,221
it could be
that he is keeping his distance

125
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,683
since your father is someone
who Lord Sangheon trusts.

126
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,268
That could be it.

127
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,606
It is my father he dislikes, not me?

128
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,776
Forgive me, Your Highness.

129
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,863
I just did not want you to blame yourself.

130
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,909
That means he might change his mind
depending on what I do.

131
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,494
Pardon?

132
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,456
Thank you, Yu-gong!

133
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,171
Who watches over this nation?
The Han Family or the Yi Family?

134
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,757
Dismiss Lord Sangheon from his position

135
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,677
for manipulating state affairs
by disregarding one's appeals to the King.

136
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,180
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!

137
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,099
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty.

138
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,810
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!

139
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,563
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,981
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!

141
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,066
Move!

142
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,985
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!

143
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,321
Dismiss Lord Sangheon, Your Majesty.

144
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,283
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!

145
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,495
-Your Majesty!
-Dismiss Lord Sangheon!

146
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,790
For some reason,

147
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,293
imprisoning them only seems
to be a temporary fix.

148
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,878
They just keep coming back.

149
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,340
I doubt they will give up any time soon,

150
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,467
so what should we do, Lord Sangheon?

151
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
When a dog barks after seeing something,

152
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,644
other dogs follow
despite not seeing it for themselves.

153
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,982
The scholars outside
are only following someone's lead

154
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,443
and are repeating the same words
over and over again.

155
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,445
It…

156
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,115
does not bother me.

157
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,789
However…

158
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:43,210
even feathers can sink a ship
if there are enough of them.

159
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,338
If the number of scholars gathering
gradually increases,

160
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,549
they might become a burden to you.

161
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,135
That is what I worry about.

162
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,972
That being said…

163
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,144
May I suggest
that we reinstate Lord Shin Yeong-su

164
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,271
back at the palace?

165
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,942
Shin Yeong-su who was stripped of his rank
and retired to the countryside?

166
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,820
I hear that he has become
a mentor to scholars.

167
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,282
Many look up to him

168
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,245
which is why he could help resolve
the issue at hand.

169
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,833
You are not wrong,

170
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,919
but he does not care about
state affairs anymore.

171
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,381
A man who was forced to leave

172
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,134
would have no interest in
coming back to the palace.

173
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,801
Good.

174
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,929
It means, "Even though
no one acknowledges your choices,

175
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,224
if you are able
to always take the path that is right,

176
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,602
you may also consider yourself
to be virtuous."

177
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,396
Have a good day.

178
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,232
-Thank you, Master.
-Thank you, Master.

179
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,114
My lord!

180
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,533
You have a visitor from Hanyang.

181
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,326
-Hanyang?
-Yes, my lord.

182
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,578
Goodness, you've learned quite a lot.

183
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,331
All right. Keep up the good work.

184
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,626
My goodness.

185
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,922
It sure has been a while, Master Yeosan.

186
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,472
But the weight of my sin
still remains heavy.

187
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,768
I could not possibly return
to a place within the palace.

188
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,063
Come on. Must you relentlessly decline?

189
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,024
Maybe you could help me save face.

190
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,569
If I return empty-handed,

191
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,863
it would leave me
in a predicament at the palace.

192
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,239
Besides…

193
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,996
I come bearing a royal order
from His Majesty himself.

194
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,124
And that would mean
it comes from the Chief State Councilor.

195
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,419
I have voiced my opinion.

196
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,796
Please let the Chief State Councilor know.

197
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,133
Please, Lord Shin.

198
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,053
I have relayed the order,
so deliver the refusal yourself.

199
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,265
Wait. Hold on.

200
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,391
Let's go!

201
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,755
<i>BULBIBULMYEONG</i>

202
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,940
If a boat filled with passengers
were to tilt to one side,

203
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,651
who do you think
would fall into the water first?

204
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:41,323
The first to be thrown overboard will be
the people who have no power or wealth.

205
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,574
That is why…

206
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,203
I stand here asking you…

207
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,375
to keep the boat well-balanced.

208
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,139
<i>BULBIBULMYEONG</i>

209
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,849
<i>Shin Yeong-su is hereby appointed</i>

210
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,894
as Inspector General
of the Office of the Inspector General.

211
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,022
Do not take your responsibilities lightly,

212
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,067
reproach and rectify any wrongdoings,

213
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,362
and supervise the officials
into seeking the right path.

214
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,675
I am humbled by
your boundless generosity, Your Majesty.

215
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,109
I did not think you would actually return.

216
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,362
Ignoring the summons from one's monarch

217
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,114
would also be an act of defiance.

218
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,452
What happened is in the past now,

219
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,122
so I hope we get along, Inspector General.

220
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,457
Of course.

221
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,675
Will this not have any repercussions?

222
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,761
The Inspector General

223
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,014
could surely get in the way
of your political endeavors.

224
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,601
I can always utilize him to my advantage

225
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,437
and have him serve a purpose.

226
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,158
The bird that stays grounded in silence.

227
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,161
Am I to believe it refers to Your Majesty?

228
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,959
I take it that the Chief Royal Secretary
safely delivered my message.

229
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,713
Then can I believe
what I assumed is correct?

230
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,423
Probably.

231
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,050
HIS MAJESTY MEETS
WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

232
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,512
Forgive me for saying this,

233
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:13,975
but I do not intend to be a piece
in your political games, Your Majesty.

234
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,191
It means that I will not
always blindly stand beside you.

235
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,986
If you take the wrong path,

236
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,532
I will be the first
to go in the opposite direction.

237
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,992
Will that be acceptable?

238
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,453
Of course.

239
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:39,417
It is for that reason
that I requested your reinstatement.

240
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,796
To rectify and reform the court

241
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,173
that is in my grandfather's grasp.

242
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,108
{\an8}DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

243
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,944
This proves the Minister of Taxation's
illegal activities.

244
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:12,117
It will be the first matter
you investigate as Inspector General.

245
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,826
Scribe Jung.

246
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,037
What you just heard--

247
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,413
Fret not, Your Majesty,

248
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,624
for I left it all out.

249
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,133
It describes a bird

250
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,385
that stays grounded
for three years in silence.

251
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,139
To make up for the time
it had to stay huddled,

252
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,767
it soars up above the clouds.

253
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,310
And when it cries,

254
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,270
it sends shocks across the lands.

255
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,691
You have waited for the right time
to achieve something great.

256
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:32,030
If you would allow it,
I would like to join you.

257
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,243
But this is my burden to bear…

258
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,246
and it entails risks.

259
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,831
Remember that day in the woods?

260
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,628
Everything we talked about that day

261
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,547
can no longer be promised.

262
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,008
So please…

263
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,721
allow me to at least
be by your side in this way.

264
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,861
We are now in the same boat,

265
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,239
so you cannot ignore my situation.

266
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,122
Then, promise me this one thing.

267
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,166
When I tell you to stop,

268
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,086
you must.

269
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,005
I order you as the King.

270
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,218
Then I will oblige, Your Majesty.

271
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,604
Minister of Taxation Park Won-hyeong
purposely unloaded rice meant for the army

272
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,356
to load his own cargo on the ship.

273
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,608
Head to where the ships bound
for Hamgil Province are docked

274
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,611
and raid the storage facility
frequently used by his people.

275
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,697
You will find the missing rice.

276
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,199
<i>Also, the Minister of Taxation
disobeyed the law</i>

277
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,203
<i>by bribing crewmen
to deliberately wreck the ship.</i>

278
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,956
<i>He must be captured
and brought to justice.</i>

279
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,249
<i>Do you understand?</i>

280
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,626
Search every corner!

281
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,003
-Yes, Inspector!
-Yes, Inspector!

282
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,424
-Goodness, what is the meaning of this?
-Oh, dear.

283
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,676
My goodness.

284
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,887
Identify yourselves!

285
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,974
We are from
the Office of the Inspector General.

286
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,392
What did you say?

287
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,401
Minister Park, you must come with us.

288
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,446
How dare you!

289
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,701
Do you think you can get away

290
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,079
with humiliating me like this?

291
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,539
The rice meant for soldiers
in Hamgil Province

292
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,542
was stacked in your personal shed.

293
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,713
That is preposterous.
I know nothing about this.

294
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,720
This clearly says otherwise.

295
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,138
DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

296
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:06,393
This ledger has records of you
utilizing the cargo ship for personal use.

297
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,979
Well, that…

298
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,486
The people have been
making clothes out of hay to stay covered

299
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,489
and eating bark from trees

300
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,158
just to appease their hunger,

301
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,035
but the Minister of Taxation

302
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,621
has been stealing from the nation
to feed his own belly.

303
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,289
Your Majesty.

304
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,126
I hear you have been using
cargo ships for personal matters.

305
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:35,004
You also hoarded the rice
meant for our soldiers.

306
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,464
I…

307
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:41,719
I doubt that even you will question
my decision to behead you.

308
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,513
All I did

309
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,099
was aid Lord Sangheon.

310
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,643
I had no other intention, Your Majesty.

311
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,561
I see.

312
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,856
So you were following
my grandfather's orders?

313
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,191
Pardon?

314
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,696
This is why one must never
trust another human being.

315
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,906
After all the trust

316
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,076
my grandfather put in you?

317
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,496
He will truly be disappointed
to hear that you pointed to him

318
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,498
as the mastermind.

319
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,461
It was a slip of tongue.

320
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,463
I am the one who--

321
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,256
You will take all the blame instead?

322
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,385
Well, that is…

323
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,725
Please have mercy on me, Your Majesty!

324
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,573
Allow me to present an option.

325
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,285
Leave the palace as ordered

326
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,914
and I will keep quiet
about you betraying my grandfather.

327
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,002
You are probably well aware of this,

328
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,630
but my grandfather is a ruthless man.

329
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,800
Rather than receiving punishment from him,

330
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,302
this will surely be in your favor.

331
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,097
I will obey any order you lay upon me,

332
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,391
so please let me at least keep my life--

333
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,060
You used the cargo ship

334
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,355
to secretly move weapons
to Hamgil Province.

335
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,065
Pardon?

336
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,443
Name the guild that
provides my grandfather with the weapons.

337
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,155
Do so, and I will keep my word.

338
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,500
My lord.

339
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,088
The Office of the Inspector General
raided Minister Park's residence.

340
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,005
What?

341
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,967
Minister Park must have hoarded
the rice that was unloaded

342
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,553
to make room for the weapons.

343
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:50,014
Weapons ready to be shipped
to Yeoyeon tomorrow are in storage nearby.

344
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,183
If they manage to find it--

345
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,769
-Burn them all.
-Pardon?

346
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,062
Was I not clear?

347
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,147
Yes, my lord. I will get it done.

348
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,083
What…

349
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,587
game are you playing?

350
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,841
The Inspector General
uncovered Minister Park's misconduct.

351
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,427
By exploiting the authority you possess,

352
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,262
he hoarded rice meant for our army.

353
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,056
Have you already forgotten

354
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,519
-how I told you not to do anything?
-Of course not.

355
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,731
But how could I sit idly by

356
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,191
while someone tarnishes your good name?

357
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,277
-It is why--
-Minister Park…

358
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,779
is one of my people.

359
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,742
Therefore, I should be
the one to punish him.

360
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,829
You have no saying in this matter.

361
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,297
Grandfather…

362
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,008
if word gets out about this,

363
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,594
we will face the grievance of the people

364
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,596
we barely managed to subside.

365
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,097
But that will not happen

366
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,476
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

367
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,523
Do not dare to challenge me.

368
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,569
This will be the last time I look past

369
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,613
your cheeky antics.

370
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,436
APPEAL TO THE KING

371
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,445
We could pay with our lives
if we get caught.

372
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,700
You are the last person
I expected to see here, Section Chief.

373
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,203
One must solve
the problems that one creates.

374
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,330
I am curious though.

375
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,834
Why are these necessary
when Minister Park has been arrested?

376
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,504
We are running out of time.

377
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,173
Please hurry.

378
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,216
Hurry.

379
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,221
Identify yourselves!

380
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,604
What are you doing here?

381
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,064
Well…

382
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,866
The alcohol must be getting to me.

383
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,827
Goodness. I'm seeing things.

384
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,371
-Goodness.
-He's drunk.

385
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,199
<i>Minister of Taxation Park Won-hyeong</i>

386
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,077
<i>has been caught
siphoning rice meant for the army</i>

387
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,579
<i>and storing them for personal gain.</i>

388
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,875
<i>While trying to cover up his crimes,
he also purposely wrecked the ships.</i>

389
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,961
<i>His disrespect for state property</i>

390
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,464
<i>is being investigated by
the Office of the Inspector General.</i>

391
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,468
<i>The people have been
making clothes out of hay to stay covered</i>

392
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,387
<i>and eating bark from trees
just to appease their hunger,</i>

393
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,348
<i>which is why</i>

394
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,352
<i>the Minister of Taxation's
selfish decision to steal from the state</i>

395
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,853
<i>leaves misery in its wake.</i>

396
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,856
<i>All those who serve at the royal court</i>

397
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:13,236
<i>must request
that Minister Park be impeached.</i>

398
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,279
You may write this in the diary.

399
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,366
"During the morning assembly,

400
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,869
the Chief State Councilor requested
that I dismiss

401
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,704
the Minister of Taxation from office."

402
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,458
The 35th stratagem listed
in <i>Sonjabyeongbeob</i>.

403
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,376
The <i>yeonhwan</i> stratagem.

404
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,677
"Utilize several schemes at once
to achieve your goal."

405
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,012
It was a clever one, might I add.

406
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,894
Are words all that I receive?

407
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,565
Rather than a compliment in words,
I would like a wish to be granted.

408
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,233
A wish?

409
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,446
All right. Let me hear it.

410
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,950
Well, it…

411
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,743
Before anything…

412
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,913
you must promise something.

413
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,334
Please promise that you will not be angry.

414
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,963
What could this wish of yours be?

415
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,967
Fine. Consider the promise made--

416
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,600
What…

417
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,519
What on earth are you doing?

418
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,979
You promised

419
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,440
to never get angry.

420
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,785
What is it this time?

421
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,080
It is a report from the Ministry of Rites.

422
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,539
Please take it to His Majesty.

423
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,961
Why are you giving this to me
when you could deliver it yourself?

424
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,171
His office is only a few steps away.

425
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,547
I am quite busy these days.

426
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,009
I thank you in advance.

427
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,803
All right.

428
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,682
What is with him these days?
Did he do something to upset His Majesty?

429
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,419
Just so you know…

430
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,423
I will not…

431
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,592
be leaving the palace.

432
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,974
And my feelings cannot be brushed away.

433
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,644
Right. I see.

434
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,440
Consider yourself heard.

435
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,493
Her Majesty the Queen
wishes to speak to you both.

436
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,386
So…

437
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,682
I asked to speak to you both

438
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,560
despite it being an inconvenience for you

439
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:19,023
because you are
His Majesty's closest friends

440
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,109
and are close friends yourselves.

441
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,657
I hope this
doesn't make you uncomfortable.

442
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,037
No, of course not.

443
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,209
We did learn from
the same mentor as young boys, but…

444
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,797
Yes, we have known each other
for quite some time.

445
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,930
May I ask why you summoned us here,
Your Highness?

446
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,265
Oh, well…

447
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:01,565
I was hoping to ease His Majesty's mind
from his worries regarding state affairs.

448
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:10,116
Is there anything
in particular that he likes?

449
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,493
I thought you two would know.

450
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,874
Anything will do.
So if you could please tell me…

451
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,386
His Majesty sometimes wishes
to appease his sweet tooth.

452
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,765
Perhaps candy or…

453
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,766
Candy?

454
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,727
No, peaches or dried persimmons.

455
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,895
Peaches?

456
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,439
PEACHES

457
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,567
His Majesty is fond of flowers,

458
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,819
so he would prefer
peach blossoms to peaches…

459
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,574
and flowers from persimmon trees
rather than the actual fruit.

460
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,575
PERSIMMONS, PEACHES

461
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,163
His Majesty enjoys going
on walks on his own.

462
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,457
Rather than walks,
he loves to sit in peace

463
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,542
listening to the sound of wind chimes.

464
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,420
It shows that he wishes
to spend time on his own.

465
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,213
PEACE, WIND CHIMES

466
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,758
Then what does he dislike?

467
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,802
Pardon?

468
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:21,020
He will probably dislike others
talking about him

469
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,813
behind his back like this.

470
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,359
That is true. He will not take it lightly.

471
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,195
The fact that we spoke about him--

472
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,448
We urge you to keep it a secret,
Your Highness.

473
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,991
Please.

474
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,078
He hates when people speak about him
behind his back.

475
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,706
I see.

476
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,797
No wonder you are good friends.

477
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,299
Do not worry.

478
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,760
Excuse me.

479
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,695
Please be careful.
Let us carry it for you instead.

480
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,786
What on earth is that big lump I see?

481
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,834
Your Majesty!

482
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,878
Your Highness?

483
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,738
It's not even ripe.

484
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,075
My Queen, what is all this?

485
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,496
I brought you some flowers
because I heard you like them.

486
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,999
"Some" flowers?

487
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,299
Thank you.

488
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,639
I hear you also have a sweet tooth.

489
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,103
They will rejuvenate you
after grueling hours at the office.

490
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,107
One only hopes
that you are in good health, Your Majesty.

491
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,615
<i>Join me.</i>

492
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,451
Avenge the late King

493
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:26,038
and help build the world
your father dreamed of.

494
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,977
I told you to stop!

495
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,859
I have failed to protect you too.

496
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,613
What is it that infuriated
and saddened you this much?

497
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,576
To the point that
you were suffering even in your dream.

498
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,159
THE LAST NIGHT OF THE YEAR

499
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,335
THE LAST NIGHT OF THE YEAR

500
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,306
It seems your honest heart-to-heart…

501
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,644
did not work as intended.

502
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,198
Your Majesty, Officer Yoon has sent word.

503
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,134
Why are you here?

504
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:35,519
I am the assassin who attacked you

505
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,563
at the royal hunting.

506
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,025
I needed to make room
for myself at the palace

507
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,986
in order to assassinate the late King.

508
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,906
All this time, I have deceived you.

509
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,785
And for that,
I will gladly accept any punishment.

510
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,958
I ran into him
while tracking the evidence related

511
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,459
to your father's murder.

512
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,378
He…

513
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,423
was able to witness
the late King's last moments.

514
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,098
You had already left the palace,

515
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,226
so you could have kept the truth buried.

516
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,563
What is your reason for coming clean?

517
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,028
The late King…

518
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,740
shared a piece
of this tally with my father.

519
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,578
I wish to carry on their desire.

520
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,384
"The last night of the year."

521
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,847
He is Kang Eun-seo,
the son of Preceptor Kang Hwa-gil.

522
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,726
His father was executed
after being framed as a traitor

523
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,103
by Lord Sangheon.

524
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,903
GANGNYEONGJEON

525
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,868
<i>What is it that you saw?</i>

526
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,204
Who…

527
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,707
murdered my father?

528
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,844
I have committed a mortal sin.

529
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,222
Please find it in you
to forgive me this once.

530
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,141
To what extent does His Majesty know?

531
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,355
Is he also aware of the weapons

532
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,524
set to be shipped to Yeoyeon?

533
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,695
Of course not.

534
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,031
All he knows is that
I hoarded the rice meant for the soldiers.

535
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,868
Until I reach out to you,

536
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,996
you will remove yourself from the palace.

537
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,665
Pardon?

538
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,334
Yes, of course.

539
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,463
I am humbled by your benevolence,
Lord Sangheon.

540
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,686
He is aware of my affairs in Yeoyeon.

541
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,106
Deal with him accordingly

542
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,650
so that word does not travel from him.

543
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:34,156
Is it absolutely necessary
to take it that far?

544
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,332
After making one mistake,

545
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,503
it is easy to make another.

546
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,424
It is why I cannot condone

547
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,886
even a single mistake.

548
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,156
Commander Jung, why…

549
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,376
Come back here!

550
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:31,963
Commander Jung.

551
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,257
Commander Jung?

552
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,572
Father.

553
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,411
You're home.

554
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,165
Yes, I see you are not in bed yet.

555
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,417
The night air is refreshing.

556
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,004
I see.

557
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,844
You do not seem well.
Is something troubling you?

558
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,012
I am tired, that is all.

559
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,359
He must have been exhausted.

560
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,159
I will stay here,

561
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:28,538
so excuse yourselves
and let His Majesty rest in silence.

562
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,333
-Yes, Court Lady Kim.
-Yes, Court Lady Kim.

563
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:01,196
Could there be anything
to use as a blanket?

564
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,660
Your Majesty?

565
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,000
Your Majesty, where are you?

566
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,205
His Majesty…

567
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,626
is so good-looking.

568
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,746
Your Majesty?

569
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,754
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

570
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,257
I was only trying
to dust something off your face.

571
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,926
Were you hurt?

572
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,303
No, I am fine.

573
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:09,235
Let's go. How about we
go to my quarters for some tea?

574
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,905
Of course, Your Majesty.

575
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,241
I actually come bearing
fragrant tea for you to enjoy.

576
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,243
I will request for it to be served.

577
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,737
What are you doing alone behind the tree?

578
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,115
What were you up to?

579
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,451
Yes?

580
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,174
Was there a reason the Queen came by?

581
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,220
She just came to see how I was doing.

582
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,974
Oh, I see.

583
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,314
You must have been very tired.

584
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,774
You were dozing off out in the open.

585
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,484
Pardon?

586
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,990
What I am saying is that you did
not even have a guard by your side.

587
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:22,076
The palace can be such a dangerous place!

588
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,582
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

589
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,254
Hold on.

590
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,841
Are you jealous right now?

591
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,636
Jealous?

592
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:43,473
It is only because
you could have been in harm's way.

593
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,393
I was worried.

594
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,230
I am right about you being jealous.

595
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,690
We are in your office.

596
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:56,402
Whatever you say must go in the diary,
so please choose your words carefully.

597
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,403
Your Majesty, the director of
the Office of Royal Decrees

598
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,321
has requested an audience.

599
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,907
Let him in.

600
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:06,472
Why did His Majesty want to see me here?

601
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,776
Your Majesty.

602
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,412
What…

603
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,956
What could this be about?

604
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:46,429
I would rather you not tease me,
Your Majesty.

605
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,890
Tease you?

606
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:51,768
I am quite serious.

607
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,394
Pardon?

608
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,688
I remember what you once told me.

609
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,357
That you would endure everything.

610
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,780
I will do the same.

611
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,702
I am ready to bear
the consequences of my feelings.

612
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:40,334
