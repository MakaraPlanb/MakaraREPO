1
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,856
{\an8}Just a little bit more. Push.

2
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,612
{\an8}You are doing great, Your Highness.

3
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,461
{\an8}Your Highness, you welcomed a prince.

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,354
Your Highness?

5
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,408
<i>Twins within the Royal Family
are an abomination.</i>

6
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,870
Who will accept a prince

7
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,706
that shared a womb with a girl?

8
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,751
But Father--

9
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,503
I accepted your daughter as Crown Princess

10
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,964
to honor the part you played
in putting me on the throne,

11
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,217
so how will you clean up this mess?

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,094
If my status is threatened,

13
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:20,181
you and everyone who sides with me
will pay the price with their lives.

14
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,184
I am sure you are aware of that.

15
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,774
Tonight, the only child
born into the Royal Family

16
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,735
is the eldest son of the Crown Prince.

17
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,240
No one will know that he was born a twin,

18
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,869
so please let your worry subside,
Your Majesty.

19
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,765
Please let her live, Your Royal Highness.

20
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,268
Being born a girl

21
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,688
should not be a reason for her to die.

22
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,232
Please do not take her life.

23
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,735
It is beyond my control.

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,405
But she is your daughter.

25
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:22,076
The daughter who was born on the same day
and at the same hour as your son.

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,371
The King has already given his order.

27
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,041
And the Royal Family concurs.

28
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,878
No, that is not the case.

29
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,882
What matters more

30
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,177
is her father,
the Crown Prince's decision.

31
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,012
So please tell me.

32
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,597
I wish to know what you want.

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,640
I am no different.

34
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,311
If it is not an asset to this country…

35
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,898
I will discard it.

36
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,410
<i>Terminate those
at the Royal Maternity Directorate.</i>

37
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,414
<i>Without my approval, not a single soul
will live to tell the tale.</i>

38
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,540
Identify yourselves!

39
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,525
Lord… Lord Sangheon?

40
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:22,989
You did well serving His Majesty,
Chief State Councilor.

41
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,872
Where is the Crown Princess?

42
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,292
She is in her chambers
along with the royal physician.

43
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,689
This is where
the Crown Princess recuperates.

44
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,649
How dare you cause a scene!

45
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,609
Enough!

46
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,088
It is a boy.

47
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,965
The eldest grandson of the King

48
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,595
you have been dreaming of.

49
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,515
Where is the girl?

50
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,599
The girl…

51
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,811
died.

52
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,942
The princess stopped breathing
seconds after she was born.

53
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,946
Burn it to ashes.

54
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,031
Yes, sir.

55
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,811
Your Highness.

56
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,524
Hurry. Please check on the baby.

57
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,525
Yes, Your Highness.

58
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,770
Burn all bodies
and dispose of the remains.

59
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,432
Her pulse is weak.

60
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,894
Please take her to a doctor
as soon as you leave the palace.

61
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,479
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,689
EPISODE 1

63
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,834
{\an8}<i>Only those who pass the parrot blood test</i>

64
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,503
{\an8}<i>will be eligible to serve His Majesty.</i>

65
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,875
-That's it!
-You can do it!

66
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,129
-Go!
-Your Highness!

67
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,597
Look at him charge vigorously.

68
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,683
He surely is a king in the making.

69
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,185
Do you not agree?

70
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,478
Of course.

71
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,154
-Over here!
-Stop him!

72
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:47,915
Get in there!

73
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,168
That is how you do it!

74
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,838
Nicely done!

75
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,440
I said we should go.
I'm leaving without you.

76
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,318
Just a second. I almost have it.

77
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,322
Don't blame me
when you are scolded for being late.

78
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,575
Hey, I-wol!

79
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,280
Can you give me the ball?

80
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,166
Thanks.

81
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,172
What is it?

82
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,758
Do I have something on my face?

83
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,137
No, it's not that.

84
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,767
How long does it take to fetch a ball?

85
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,548
A court maid who looks just like you?

86
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,551
I'm not making this up.
If we had the same hair,

87
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,929
anyone would believe that we were twins.

88
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,348
Aren't I right, Bok-dong?

89
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,308
Sorry?

90
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,894
It's true.

91
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,022
Never speak of this again.

92
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,400
A twin? Why would you say such nonsense?

93
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,028
I was fascinated, that's all.

94
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,280
You'd be startled too if you saw her.

95
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,573
I have heard enough.

96
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,452
How dare a lowly court maid
resemble the noble prince.

97
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,871
It's something no one should hear.

98
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,208
Don't you ever mention this again.

99
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,586
Do you hear me?

100
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,546
Yes, Mother.

101
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,020
You clearly told me
that my daughter left the Capital.

102
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,813
Yes, I'm sure of it.

103
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,108
The Crown Prince's left guard left her
at a small temple outside the Capital.

104
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,570
I must talk to him.

105
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,156
Meanwhile,

106
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,618
I would like you to look for
the girl my son saw.

107
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,827
Yes, Your Highness.

108
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,710
His Highness takes after you
in his cleverness

109
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,087
and boldness.

110
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,799
His tutors at the institute
see it as an honor

111
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,177
to be able to serve His Highness.

112
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,556
There is no need
to compliment him for my sake.

113
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,310
From what I hear though,
rather than reading books,

114
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,354
you're more interested in playing soccer

115
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,232
and enjoying outdoor activities
with eunuch trainees.

116
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,275
Is that true?

117
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,948
If my mentor is correct
about my taking after you, it'd be false.

118
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,742
If I didn't take after you, it'd be true.

119
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,827
What?

120
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,085
-You can't.
-Step aside!

121
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,089
How dare you barge in here.

122
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,966
Forgive my impudence, Your Royal Highness.

123
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,511
-Take him!
-Yes, sir.

124
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,724
-What is the meaning of this?
-Master!

125
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,351
Let go of him this instant!

126
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,230
His Majesty has ordered
the arrest of the royal preceptor.

127
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,817
What?

128
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,289
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

129
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,966
What is the reason
behind the royal preceptor's arrest?

130
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,307
He is the master
that your grandson trusts and is fond of.

131
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:43,228
So please revoke your royal command.

132
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,816
He has been disrupting the Royal Court
with his asinine appeals.

133
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,446
Someone like him should not be
in charge of His Highness' education.

134
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,240
His concerns for this nation and people

135
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,910
can't surely be viewed
as disrupting the peace.

136
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:02,122
He has slandered me
as well as other meritorious subjects

137
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:06,543
and has desecrated
His Majesty's bestowal of merits.

138
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,171
What could possibly be more of a crime?

139
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,719
<i>Regarding his punishment,</i>

140
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,390
<i>I'm truly worried about the shock
His Majesty's grandson might receive.</i>

141
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,851
<i>It is why I dare propose</i>

142
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,063
<i>that his quarters be closed
until the dust settles.</i>

143
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,815
<i>So be it.</i>

144
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,071
Are you okay?

145
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,739
It's not too late

146
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,075
to change back into your clothes
and head back.

147
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,161
Master has been absent for days.

148
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,958
Father and those at the institute
will not tell me anything about him,

149
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,336
so what else can I do but seek him
outside the palace walls myself?

150
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,632
Couldn't you at least
give me back my clothes?

151
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,764
The main gate is right outside.

152
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,308
This is the only way
I can make it out undetected.

153
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,106
Boost me up higher, will you?

154
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,943
That's it. Just a little bit more.

155
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,112
A little bit more.

156
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,454
-Down. Let me down.
-Sorry?

157
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,873
-Let me down.
-Oh.

158
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,683
I hear you have been asking for me.

159
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,643
You're finally here.

160
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,001
We look exactly the same.

161
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,295
Don't you agree?

162
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,381
That's true, but…

163
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,050
Bring the clothes.

164
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,427
But what if someone sees us?

165
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,304
As if that would happen.

166
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,805
Bring the clothes this instant.

167
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,493
Are you still not done?

168
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,079
I don't have all day,
so pick up the speed.

169
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,716
Now, hand me your clothes.

170
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,344
Sorry? How could you ask
for the shabby rags I wear?

171
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,972
Speak with more of
a lower and deeper tone.

172
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,766
-Sorry?
-Are they over there?

173
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,327
Halt.

174
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,459
I don't recognize her
as the King's grandson's court maid.

175
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,545
She's still in training
and only came to run an errand.

176
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,672
I was just showing her the way out.

177
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,258
You may exit right through this gate.

178
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,218
Where is His Highness?

179
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,845
He just exited the gate.

180
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,397
Your Highness, the Bureau of Special Foods

181
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,358
-has brought over some snacks.
-Hurry.

182
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
They may enter.

183
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,260
We have brought your favorite
<i>sikhye</i> and <i>maejakgwa</i>.

184
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,014
Duly noted. You may leave.

185
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,583
Would you like to join me?

186
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,168
No.

187
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,421
I mean, no, Your Highness.

188
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,594
Don't be like that and join me.

189
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,888
No, Your Highness.

190
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,120
It's sweet, isn't it?

191
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,039
I hear the King's grandson sent you.

192
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,959
How has he been?

193
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,504
Doesn't he resent me for leaving

194
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,631
without saying goodbye?

195
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,640
I was concerned, not angry.

196
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,393
As if you'd do anything
that would warrant resentment.

197
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,020
Your… Your Highness?

198
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,941
Your Highness, is it really you?

199
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,279
How are you here?

200
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,738
What on earth are you wearing?

201
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,286
Master, you're like a father to me.

202
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,788
His Majesty wouldn't allow me
to leave the palace,

203
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,957
so I had to improvise in order to see you.

204
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,631
Your Highness,

205
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,011
please forgive me for not being able
to serve you fully.

206
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,305
Master.

207
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,469
Gosh.

208
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,348
He studies this every day?

209
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,727
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

210
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,551
I hear you suffered
from an acute stomach illness.

211
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,803
Have you recovered?

212
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,606
Yes, I'm better now.

213
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,683
{\an8}According to your tutor, you completed
reading <i>Zuo Zhuan</i> all by yourself.

214
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,934
{\an8}Excuse me?

215
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,940
I mean, yes, I did, Your Majesty.

216
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,941
Right.

217
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,570
Then which sentence
touched you most deep down?

218
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,487
Sorry?

219
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,701
Oh, well…

220
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,708
Well…

221
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,213
What about you, Father?

222
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,800
I mean,

223
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,347
I wish to know which sentence
resonated through you.

224
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,902
<i>Injabulwoo, jijabulhok, yongjabulgu</i>.

225
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,821
"The benevolent shall not worry,

226
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,282
the wise will not be cajoled,

227
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,494
and the brave will not be afraid."

228
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,371
It's also written
in the <i>Analects of Confucius</i>

229
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:56,211
and it is also the first lesson
taught to me by the royal preceptor.

230
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,964
Owning what you studied

231
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,425
is of more importance
than reading the words.

232
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,347
So take your time
to read <i>Zuo Zhuan</i> once more

233
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,724
and ruminate on what the words mean.

234
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,481
Is something wrong?

235
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,194
No, I just think you're great.

236
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,250
What I meant was…

237
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,379
I mean, I was just admiring

238
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,131
the way you spoke, Father.

239
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,040
Your highness!

240
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,253
What took you so long?
You have no idea how worried I was.

241
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,385
The attire suits you.

242
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,429
Sorry?

243
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,347
You did well.

244
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:42,817
Father.

245
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:47,989
Shall we?

246
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,618
-We'll head out.
-Sure.

247
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,089
I can't believe
I'm at the palace for the banquet.

248
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,633
It's like I'm dreaming.

249
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,471
In the near future, you will also
be serving His Majesty within these walls.

250
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,224
Ji-un.

251
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,603
Hyun!

252
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,695
That is not how you address Prince Jaeun.

253
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:32,784
It's quite all right. I suggested
we speak comfortably as friends.

254
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,870
Hyun.

255
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,751
You'll be at the banquet hall, right?
I'll see you there.

256
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,673
-See you later.
-Later.

257
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,399
Wait here for a moment.

258
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,692
Yes, Father.

259
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,974
Hold on!

260
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,107
What… Hey!

261
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,569
Just a second.

262
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,215
What on earth? Where could she have gone?

263
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,453
"<i>Mokbaekyeoje</i>

264
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,498
<i>sibingeonryeya</i>.

265
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,211
<i>Beomgunjeukwi gyeongchulbyeongbing,</i>

266
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,632
<i>cheongsuguho yogyeolwoisu,</i>

00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,971

272
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,737
<i>Gi…</i>

273
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,031
It's <i>giya</i>.

274
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,460
Gosh. How did you get in here?

275
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,171
I'm sure the door was locked.

276
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,132
Do not get me wrong. I was only…

277
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,676
{\an8}<i>ZUO ZHUAN</i>

278
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,344
Is this <i>Zuo Zhuan</i>?

279
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,305
Do court maids read this book too?

280
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,726
Just a second.

281
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,814
Oh, no. My book!

282
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,902
I'm sorry.

283
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,533
Are you insane? What are you doing?

284
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,493
I borrowed it from a dear acquaintance.

285
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,703
I must give it back.

286
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,750
The pages will all be soaked by now.

287
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,251
I'll try and get you another--

288
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,795
Let go of me. I must give it back.

289
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:59,091
-Going in there is preposterous.
-Let go. Let go of me.

290
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,611
Young Master!

291
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,119
What do I do?

292
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,684
What are you doing?

293
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,938
Don't you train in the fighting arts?

294
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,607
How can you lose balance and topple over?

295
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,569
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

296
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,935
What are you doing?

297
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,983
I was trying to improve my balance.

298
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:21,984
Your balance?

299
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,491
A sword must not be used for leisure.

300
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,035
Its purpose is
to protect those you cherish.

301
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,247
Then, I'd like to receive
your guidance, Father.

302
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,726
Ji-un, my gosh!

303
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,700
<i>SIGOJIJOEYA</i>

304
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:19,417
THAT IS MY SIN

305
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,800
Here you go.

306
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,303
Wait, isn't this…

307
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,888
<i>ZUO ZHUAN</i>

308
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,937
I said I'd get you a copy, didn't I?

309
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,734
They're easily found in libraries,

310
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,278
so the dive was unnecessary.

311
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,336
Did you hang all of these yourself?

312
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,006
Sorry? Oh, yes.

313
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,133
It's not that much.

314
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,471
Hand it over.
At your speed, it'll take all day.

315
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,390
-No, it's fine. Let me.
-Just a second.

316
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,184
Is this how you do it?

317
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,019
It's really not necessary.

318
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,951
It's Dam-i.

319
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,953
Dam-i?

320
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,663
I was given the name

321
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,707
because I was found by the wall.

322
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:49,006
Then you've never met your parents?

323
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,185
Anyway, thank you for today.

324
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,521
What? Are you leaving already?

325
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,106
I-wol will be worried if I'm late.

326
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,069
-I-wol?
-She's the friend I work with.

327
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,372
Just a second.

328
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,463
Do you have plans for the festival?

329
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,423
Sorry?

330
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,826
So tell me.

331
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,538
Who was it that transcribed the book
while also adding footnotes?

332
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,999
It was transcribed?

333
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,294
His neat handwriting tells me

334
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,213
he's no average man.

335
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,466
This will be for my ears only.

336
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,884
Which family is he from?

337
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,014
That I do not know, Your Highness.

338
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,435
Romantic feelings for a court maid?

339
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,104
That could be quite dangerous.

340
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,356
Romantic feelings?

341
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,692
There's no need to be startled.

342
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,153
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

343
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,410
Your Highness, I bear horrible news.

344
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,748
According to the King's eunuch trainee,

345
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,667
His Majesty ordered the beheading
of the royal preceptor.

346
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:50,878
What?

347
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,146
There she is.

348
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,689
Dam-i, hurry on over.

349
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,494
Are you Dam-i?

350
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,996
Yes, I am.

351
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,542
Follow me.

352
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,876
Ever since my son mentioned you,

353
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,046
I've been wanting to meet you.

354
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,092
I hear

355
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,971
you lived for a long time
in a mountain temple without parents.

356
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,143
So how did you come to be a court maid?

357
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,603
Well…

358
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,065
Due to a fire half a year ago,

359
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,068
the chief monk passed away.

360
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,864
A lady took pity on me while
I wandered the streets and begged for food

361
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,198
and helped me get a spot.

362
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,496
It must have been tough.

363
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,960
Hasn't life been lonely for you?

364
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,300
You had to live deep
in the woods without parents.

365
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,472
Don't you resent those

366
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,309
who brought you into this world?

367
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,938
I had no family to begin with,

368
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,609
so I do not know what being lonely is
or what missing someone is like.

369
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:24,198
I guess that's why
I've never resented them.

370
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:29,995
Could you…

371
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,831
come closer toward me?

372
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:41,061
It was the King's grandson
who lent you that book?

373
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,064
That's right. I said I wanted to read it

374
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,816
and he lent it to me.

375
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,735
I'm amazed

376
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,405
that the young prince lent you his book

377
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,199
and that you wanted to read it.

378
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,868
Truth be told,

379
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,497
there's someone
who inspired me into wanting to read it.

380
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,708
Who would that be?

381
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,503
That would be a secret.

382
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,136
Today, I have found myself a new goal.

383
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,223
I will pass the state exam
with flying colors

384
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,183
and be by the Prince's side.

385
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,561
It is now my goal to serve him.

386
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,897
That came out of nowhere.

387
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,941
I find him admirable.

388
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,738
Wasn't it him
who granted your outing tonight?

389
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,865
We were only able to meet

390
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,492
thanks to His Highness' grace,

391
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,870
and I'd like to repay his kindness.

392
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,333
That reminds me. Here you go.

393
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,462
Open it.

394
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,137
YEON-SEON

395
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,139
Yeon-seon?

396
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,349
What's this?

397
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,101
Dam-i is a pretty name,

398
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,938
but I wanted to call you
by a more meaningful name.

399
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,651
Lotus flowers brought me to you,

400
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,362
so I thought the name would be fitting.

401
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,614
YEON-SEON

402
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,032
Yeon-seon.

403
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,412
It truly is a beautiful name.

404
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,873
Yeon-seon.

405
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,758
YEON-SEON

406
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,264
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes, sir.

407
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,505
Nicely done, Your Highness!

408
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,090
Your Highness!

409
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,139
Father.

410
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,016
Are you now heading home?

411
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,768
Why are you here at this hour?

412
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,688
Well, that's because--

413
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,022
Who is that girl?

414
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:40,365
I met her in the palace
when I visited for the banquet.

415
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,533
So she's a court maid?

416
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,755
<i>Burn it to ashes.</i>

417
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,249
{\an8}YEON-SEON

418
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,711
Yeon-seon.

419
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,723
<i>In three days, a banquet for the elderly
will take place outside the palace.</i>

420
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,643
Please meet me on the bridge
where we floated off our lanterns.

421
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,271
There's something I wish to give you too.

422
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,399
WAIT, STAY

423
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,517
Time is of the essence.

424
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:34,854
My son and the girl
must no longer be in close proximity.

425
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,815
Then…

426
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,610
Please prepare for her prompt departure.

427
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,404
You must hurry.

428
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,074
Yes, Your Highness.

429
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,314
Father.

430
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,370
Father, please.

431
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,168
How dare you fool me.

432
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,087
Until when did you think
you could hide this?

433
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,507
Have you forgotten the King's order
that twins are not allowed?

434
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,884
Please let her live.

435
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,344
She knows absolutely nothing.

436
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,139
She will soon be sent to Yanjing.

437
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,184
Just like I have been doing so far,

438
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,603
I'll make sure she stays a ghost.

439
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,439
So please…

440
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,443
Please let it slide
just this once, Father.

441
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,986
I won't let that girl

442
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,323
make me lose what I have built.

443
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,908
It doesn't matter where she goes.

444
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,659
As long as she lives,

445
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,080
I will find her and kill her.

446
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,748
As long as she lives,

447
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,543
the secret can always come to light.

448
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,509
Where is the girl named Dam-i?

449
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:37,602
<i>I heard that she was chosen to help out
at the banquet for the elderly</i>

450
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,771
that's taking place
outside the palace walls.

451
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,716
"Perpetrator Kang Hwa-gil
colluded with traitors

452
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,343
thus jeopardizing
the royal family and the nation.

453
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,387
The investigation

454
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,849
led to statements
that identified him as the mastermind.

455
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,604
It is why traitor Kang Hwa-gil
will hereby be executed by beheading."

456
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,516
Stop right there!

457
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,615
Please, Dam-i. This will be the last time.

458
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,119
But we were close to getting caught
by the Crown Prince that day.

459
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,913
He didn't realize it though.

460
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,832
Not even my father knew,

461
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,501
so we'll be fine.

462
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,336
But…

463
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:15,718
Actually, I have already made
important plans for that day.

464
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,890
My master is like a parent to me.

465
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,559
I can't let him die like this.

466
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:28,898
Please help me
so that I can at least say goodbye.

467
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,255
You're in grave danger. Please follow me.

468
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,674
Let go. I said, let go of me!

469
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,451
Did my father send you to find me?

470
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,578
Sorry?

471
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,918
Please let me go.
I have yet to bid my master farewell.

472
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,382
Your Highness, is that you?

473
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,018
My gosh!

474
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,603
It's an arrow!

475
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,524
Did someone just shoot an arrow?

476
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,985
What… What was that?

477
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,092
You must get to safety.

478
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,823
Please hurry back to the palace.

479
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,616
Why is he trying to kill me?

480
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,495
No, wait. Is it me he's after?
Or is it Dam-i?

481
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,876
If it's Dam-i, why would he want her dead?

482
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,422
I'll answer your questions
once you're back at the palace.

483
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,600
Hurry!

484
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,935
Stop. I am…

485
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,371
No!

486
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,309
<i>Will you wait for me?</i>

487
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,895
<i>I will. I won't leave until you come.</i>

488
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,539
{\an8}I'm afraid I must be
at the Office of Eunuchs.

489
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,708
Will you be all right on your own?

490
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:04,543
What?

491
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,088
Yes.

492
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,898
WAIT

493
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,875
Your Highness!

494
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,879
Stop right there, darn it.
I mean, Your Highness!

495
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:49,922
Stop!

496
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,759
Stop! I mean, please, stop!

497
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,388
Stop right there!

498
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,515
Your Highness, stop!

499
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,601
Your Highness!

500
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,530
Your Highness.

501
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,658
Your Highness!

502
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,703
Your Highness?

503
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,175
LONGING

504
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,002
{\an8}Please forgive me.
I was just following the Prince's order.

505
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,464
{\an8}<i>As of this moment, you are the Prince.</i>

506
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,383
{\an8}<i>I'll soon be going to Ming for my studies.</i>

507
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,302
{\an8}<i>I will do my best there
to keep this promise to you and return</i>

508
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,679
{\an8}<i>as a subject you will be proud of.</i>

509
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:05,683
{\an8}Don't do anything that you aren't sure of.
That’s the rule here in my quarters.

510
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,393
{\an8}Is the Crown Prince that temperamental?

511
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,894
{\an8}-We deserve to die!
<i>-You have no idea.</i>

512
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,231
{\an8}Just as you wish,
you will take your last breaths today!

513
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,358
{\an8}<i>Calling him a dog would be fitting.</i>

514
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:15,943
{\an8}<i>The Crown Prince
seems to be hiding something.</i>

515
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,280
{\an8}<i>For some reason,
there's a womanly mood to him.</i>

516
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:22,366
{\an8}<i>You… You're…</i>
