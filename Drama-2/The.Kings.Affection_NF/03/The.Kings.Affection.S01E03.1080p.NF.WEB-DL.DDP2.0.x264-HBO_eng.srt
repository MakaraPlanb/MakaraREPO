1
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,646
It was around here somewhere.

2
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,696
-Yeong-ji.
-Yeong-ji.

3
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,824
You have until the end of today.

4
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,077
If you fail, I can't promise

5
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,497
your shop or that girl will be safe.

6
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,551
I was only…

7
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,179
I didn't see a thing.

8
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,515
I was only digging for herbs.

9
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,403
I honestly didn't see a thing,

10
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,823
so please carry on
with whatever you were doing.

11
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,875
It's dangerous to be out here though.

12
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,920
Hear that sound?

13
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,006
His Majesty is out on a royal hunt.

14
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:39,886
Out here you may be mistaken
for a beast and be shot at.

15
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,722
Come with me.
I'll escort you out of these woods.

16
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,061
Leave. I don't need your help.

17
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,980
Come on. Don't be like that

18
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,233
and put your clothes back on.

19
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,635
If you don't want to,

20
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,263
I guess you may choose not to.

21
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,353
Are you…

22
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,106
on the run?

23
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,149
Are you a court maid…

24
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:36,943
or--

25
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,843
That was more
than I expected from a woman.

26
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,304
However,

27
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,683
this blade is quite sharp.

28
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,525
Damn, I know he went this way.

29
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,320
Darn it.

30
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,333
My bow is rather accurate today.

31
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,087
Could he have seen my face?

32
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,840
Whatever.

33
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,471
Wait. Isn't that…

34
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,233
Follow me.

35
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,820
It'll be the end if we get caught.

36
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,864
For you and also for me.

37
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,384
What is this?

38
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,264
What on earth is going on?

39
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,272
That way.

40
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,026
Identify yourselves!

41
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,655
-Get them!
-Yes, sir!

42
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,973
Giddyap.

43
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,323
Over there!

44
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,621
What now?

45
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,000
-Jump.
-What?

46
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,192
EPISODE 3

47
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,616
MERCHANT

48
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,817
What is it that you've been cherishing?

49
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,736
One might think it's your beloved.

50
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,321
It's nothing.

51
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,822
Come on, my lord.

52
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,533
What's of value should be shared,
Lord Jaeun.

53
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,622
But this is an ordinary brush.

54
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,459
It's too big for a fine writing brush
and too small for a middle-sized one.

55
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,211
Give it here. It's for someone I treasure.

56
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,215
The brush-maker must not
have done a good job.

57
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,261
It's not of an adequate size
for a man to use.

58
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,888
We must be here.

59
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,395
The Crown Prince has vanished?

60
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
He ran to the woods near the valley

61
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,733
and then disappeared.

62
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,070
-Goodness.
-My gosh. What on earth?

63
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,240
Until I deliver the news to His Majesty,
man your posts.

64
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,450
Yes, sir.

65
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,998
Could His Royal Highness have taken
advantage of the situation and ran off?

66
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,750
Do you not know who you serve?

67
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,087
He would never go anywhere
without telling us first.

68
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,839
Something must have happened to him.

69
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,553
Either that,
or he must be in a predicament.

70
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,597
-Goodness.
-You.

71
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,808
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

72
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,018
-Hold on.
-Yes?

73
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,606
What on earth is happening?

74
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,193
Take it just in case.

75
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,905
We must find the Crown Prince
before anyone else does.

76
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,032
Please do not worry.

77
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,785
What's with the ruckus?

78
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,956
Lord Jaeun!

79
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,334
I heard you went to Mokcheon
on business for the Ministry of Rites.

80
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,962
It ended faster than expected.

81
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,589
Anyway, is something the matter?

82
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,216
Where's His Royal Highness?

83
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,428
Well…

84
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,973
I'll fill you in later. Later!

85
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,308
I'll fill you in later!

86
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,651
What happened?

87
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,071
Could…

88
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,242
Could she be dead?

89
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,988
Father!

90
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,305
On the day I was born,

91
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,767
what did my father say?

92
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,772
My sweet boy.

93
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,232
Did he also agree

94
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,902
with those who wanted
to terminate my life?

95
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:28,659
That a girl was of no need
and should be killed?

96
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,704
Is that what he said?

97
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,414
The order came from the King.

98
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:40,087
His Majesty couldn't have gone against
his father, the preceding King.

99
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,537
Are you all right, Your Highness?

100
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,206
Hyun?

101
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,141
Your Royal Highness.

102
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,403
He will soon be caught
now that Commander Yoon went after him.

103
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,530
-But--
-Are you sure you're all right?

104
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,199
Were you harmed?

105
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:57,957
Hold on. How on earth are you here, Hyun?

106
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,501
We must head out of the woods
since it's not safe here.

107
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,962
Soldiers must be informed
of what happened.

108
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,130
But…

109
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,175
I'll need a minute, Hyun.

110
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,641
I didn't notice before,
but what happened to your attire?

111
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,646
Your Royal Highness!

112
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,606
Your Royal Highness!

113
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,527
Are you all right?

114
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,407
You should change into these first.

115
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,058
An assassin?

116
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,603
An assassin attacked the Crown Prince?

117
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,981
Yes, Commander Yoon went after him,

118
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,525
so we'll soon know of his identity.

119
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,988
Why are you still standing here?
Go after the assassin!

120
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,531
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

121
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,998
Are you sure you were unharmed?

122
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,833
That was a close call.

123
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,758
Your Majesty,
we should return to the palace.

124
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,177
It seems as though
danger lurks in these woods.

125
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,429
I will command
the royal carriage to be ready--

126
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,224
No one should leave
the royal hunting site.

127
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,189
Explain yourself, Left State Councilor.

128
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,109
Soldiers stand guard
here at the royal hunting site.

129
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,528
Without help from an insider,

130
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,448
how could an assassin
have made it to our vicinity?

131
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,328
Are you accusing us
of sneaking in an assassin?

132
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,290
Those who'd benefit
from His Royal Highness' falling

133
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,961
are undoubtedly all gathered here.

134
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,712
What?

135
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,092
-Your Majesty.
-Choose your words carefully.

136
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,303
It's why we must get
to the bottom of this.

137
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,807
Even if we have to
burn down the whole forest,

138
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,227
we must figure out

139
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,064
the identity of the assassin.

140
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,411
<i>A body most likely to be the assassin's
was found near Samil Peak.</i>

141
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,928
Move the body.

142
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,138
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,417
Isn't he a soldier
from one of the Five Central Armies?

144
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,129
Are you certain that this is the assassin
who came after the Crown Prince?

145
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,300
From what I hear, he had been disgruntled
with the Left State Councilor.

146
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,803
According to multiple sources,

147
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,432
he ran his mouth off while drunk,
openly suggesting the idea of murdering

148
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,977
not only the Left State Councilor
but also his grandson, His Royal Highness.

149
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,733
Now that the threat is no longer,

150
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,195
you should return
to the palace, Your Majesty.

151
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,658
See to it that
he wasn't working for anyone.

152
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,591
Why that…

153
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,470
This was clearly a conspiracy.

154
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,848
The Queen's people could have
arranged this for all we know.

155
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,270
The Queen has the King wrapped
around her fingers even tighter now,

156
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:16,275
which could lead to Prince Jehyeon
threatening His Royal Highness' status!

157
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,359
Minister No!

158
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,407
I only meant that it should never happen.

159
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,714
Yeong-ji!

160
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,507
Yeong-ji!

161
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,051
Yeong-ji…

162
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,729
Is the Samgaebang physician
still not back?

163
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,813
He's not.

164
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,983
I only have myself to blame

165
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,902
for trusting a hack
who has rumors for credentials.

166
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,450
He will come back.

167
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,996
Physician Jung always keeps his word.

168
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,833
And the rumors only
reflect his medical talent.

169
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,920
Your faith in him is admirable.

170
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,641
I didn't realize until now
how pretty you were.

171
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,730
Rather than killing you,
how about I brand you instead?

172
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,650
Get your hands…

173
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,904
off her.

174
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,530
-Ji-un.
-Ji-un!

175
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,623
Delivered as promised.

176
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,167
Your herbs.

177
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,088
I thought you would have run away.

178
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,800
Running away isn't in my books
especially if there's someone to protect.

179
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,010
Not so fast.

180
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,808
How can I trust that these herbs
are the remedy?

181
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,979
You wouldn't have waited for me
if you didn't have hope.

182
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,107
Aren't I right?

183
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,488
Are you okay? Do you have a fever?

184
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,575
I'm sorry for putting you through this.
Let's go home.

185
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,869
I hope there wasn't
any trouble on your trip.

186
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,914
You're worried about me
when you're tied up?

187
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,125
Worry about yourself first.

188
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,002
I couldn't help it, you know.

189
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,389
I couldn't sleep after hearing about
what happened at the royal hunting.

190
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,101
It gives me great relief
to see you in one piece.

191
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,646
We were blessed.

192
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,608
Prince Jehyeon was deeply concerned
for his brother's safety.

193
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm truly glad
the assassin was caught, brother.

194
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,451
I apologize for alarming you.

195
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,538
From what I hear,

196
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,500
the Queen was also present
at the royal hunting.

197
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,713
Yes, per His Majesty's request, I--

198
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,882
{\an8}A hen shouldn't cry
before the rooster does.

199
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,386
{\an8}You should have known
when and when not to be present.

200
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,099
I will keep that in mind, Your Majesty.

201
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,980
Your Royal Highness will someday
lead this nation and the people.

202
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,443
Please know that
you must be careful at all times.

203
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,321
I hope you understand what I mean.

204
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,823
I do, Grandmother.

205
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,213
It never ceases to amaze me

206
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,925
how disciplined
those of the Crown Prince's quarters are.

207
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,013
They're always exactly five steps away.

208
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,766
Sometimes, it even fascinates me.

209
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,770
The future leader of this nation

210
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,481
shouldn't let
small details go by undetected.

211
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:29,694
And that same rule applies to business
at the Crown Prince's quarters.

212
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,074
Once again, I am enlightened, brother.

213
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,673
How can he be this cold
to his one and only younger brother?

214
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,759
One may say
he brought the assassin on himself.

215
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,761
Mother, please.

216
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,055
I'm just saying.

217
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,892
Being born first
doesn't make him superior.

218
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,612
Good going, Your Royal Highness. I felt
the kick from even where I was standing--

219
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,449
Nothing good will come out
of being at odds with the Queen.

220
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,411
That has never been my intention.

221
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,580
It is the Queen
who sees me as an eye-sore.

222
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,626
Could the attack really
have been ordered by the Queen?

223
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,046
You know how one should watch
what they say within palace walls.

224
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,050
Your mouth not only lets in a lot
but also lets out a lot as well.

225
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,844
That was uncalled for.

226
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,138
That's what you get
for always crossing the line.

227
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,355
I must ask.

228
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,775
Why did you spare the man

229
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,569
who saw you at the royal hunting?

230
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:39,240
He could have been conspiring
with the assassin that came after you.

231
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,386
He was there to dig up herbs

232
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,222
which suggests
that he's a herb digger or physician.

233
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,849
If not, he was probably there to hunt.

234
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,436
I doubt he will ever
step foot into the palace,

235
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,065
which is why I chose
not to complicate matters.

236
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,151
I see.

237
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,332
Come on.

238
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,513
A court maid at the royal hunting?

239
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:48,893
She had fair skin, a delicate face,
and dark brown hair.

240
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,397
And her eyes…
They were the size of this jade.

241
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:57,235
Her sharp gaze seemed cold in some way,

242
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,530
but also quite determined
judging by how you look at it.

243
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,158
Could it be Hong-sim
who works at His Majesty's chamber?

244
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,492
Hong-sim?

245
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,370
It can't be her.
He just said she's determined.

246
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,206
-Maybe Eun-yeong at the royal kitchen.
-Could it be her?

247
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,334
It has to be Yeon-ok who serves
at the Crown Prince's quarters.

248
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,961
-Hong-sim, Yeon-ok--
-As if.

249
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:18,047
-Don't be ridiculous.
-It can't be her.

250
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,550
-What do you mean?
-He said she's determined.

251
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,929
Were all of those court maids
at the royal hunting?

252
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,184
Not just them.
Dozens more were probably there.

253
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:36,608
Is there a court maid
who never made it back?

254
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,985
Someone who could have drowned.

255
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,781
Don't be ridiculous.

256
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,367
Anyway, why do you ask?

257
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,747
Well…

258
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,333
No reason.

259
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,607
No…

260
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,741
Grandfather?

261
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,870
You aren't the eldest son
of the Crown Prince.

262
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,789
The one who should have died was you.

263
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,837
You should have died instead!

264
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,419
Your Royal Highness,
I thought you were in your chambers.

265
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,796
What are you doing out here?

266
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,008
Disturbance keeps finding me in my sleep.

267
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,678
Don't mind me

268
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,931
and turn in.

269
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,683
Was it the same nightmare?

270
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,852
It hasn't haunted you for a while now.

271
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:25,068
I'll have the royal pharmacy
bring you calming medication.

272
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,154
You should head back to your chambers.

273
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,825
Shush.

274
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,334
What is this about?

275
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,045
-It's him.
-Him? What do you mean?

276
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,097
How is he within the palace walls?

277
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,481
What do you plan on doing?

278
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,150
Wait here for me.

279
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,195
Pardon? Your Royal Highness!

280
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,012
Crouch down!

281
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,973
You scared the life out of me!

282
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,641
"You scared the life out of me!"

283
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,688
Anyway, did you ask around?

284
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,357
About that court maid
you saw at the royal hunting site.

285
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,234
You wanted to know if she was alive.

286
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,614
I don't know. There's a high chance
she wasn't a court maid after all.

287
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,618
I wonder who could have made you
want to visit the palace you try to avoid?

288
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,911
Just take this.

289
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,416
That hurts!

290
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,626
You didn't have to.

291
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,965
I've been dying to ask,

292
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,761
but rumor has it that you donate
your earnings to the poor. Is that true?

293
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,889
Says who?

294
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,893
Enough with the nonsense and lead the way.

295
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,146
Sure. We should go
before the gatekeepers change shifts.

296
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,951
Over there!

297
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,620
Where are you going?

298
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,926
Goodness, I see you're working late
even at night.

299
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,429
Chief Gu, is that you?
What brings you out at this hour?

300
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,140
What brings me out? Nothing much.

301
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,170
So tell me. I hope all is well at home.

302
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,547
Yes, all is well.

303
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,340
Anyway, it's been a while…

304
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,689
<i>Please spare me.</i>

305
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,526
I do not know anything.

306
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,904
Please spare me this one time.

307
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,660
End it with one strike.

308
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,079
It's painless that way.

309
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,123
I…

310
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,044
I cannot do it. I can't.

311
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,337
If you don't,

312
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,215
we're all as good as dead.

313
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,474
This is what you must do.
Today and from here on out,

314
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,352
it is what you must do.

315
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,440
But I…

316
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,652
I will forever play dumb.

317
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,946
I will never tell anyone.

318
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,783
I will never say
that Your Highness is a woman--

319
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,365
What are you doing here?

320
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,076
What's this?

321
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,786
Is that blood?

322
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,454
The shot came from over there.

323
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,333
This is bad. We must leave this instant.

324
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,168
Come on. Hurry.

325
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:02,191
The only ones who know of that door
are me and that boy.

326
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,904
So how could he…

327
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,053
-Ji-un.
-Ji-un!

328
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,721
Why haven't you turned in?

329
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,057
Well, that is…

330
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,817
We'll give you some space.

331
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,901
Right.

332
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,583
How did you know to find me here?

333
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,002
I heard you stopped by the house.

334
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,797
When did you return to the Capital?

335
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,841
I only went there to see Mother.

336
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,385
You should leave now.

337
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,931
I sent you to Ming
because you wanted to pursue knowledge,

338
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,392
but you return
with a bag full of pointless tricks.

339
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,144
They are not pointless.

340
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,606
They are skills that could save…

341
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,900
a person's life.

342
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,529
Skills that could have saved the lives…

343
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,283
of those you chose…

344
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,036
to harm.

345
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,999
How long will you let that day
waste your life and ruin your future?

346
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,751
How long…

347
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,214
will you continue
to disappoint me and your mother?

348
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,261
How long, you ask?

349
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,641
I will live with that memory
until the day I die.

350
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,394
The image of you slaying
that innocent girl…

351
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,856
will forever…

352
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,818
haunt me.

353
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,237
It's all in the past.

354
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,364
Move on.

355
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,617
Move on?

356
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,122
There was a time when I admired you.

357
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,420
I wished to be like you. But that ended…

358
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:36,136
when I found out that your honor
was built on injustice.

359
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,555
Injustice?

360
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,435
Your grandfather
who valued integrity over everything

361
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,272
gave me a life of injustice.

362
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,817
If justice means to be upright and moral

363
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,280
at the expense of one's own family,

364
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,534
then it's wiser
to forever reach an agreement

365
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,661
with injustice itself.

366
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,745
That…

367
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,959
That won't be me.

368
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,712
I won't live like you…

369
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,131
or Grandfather.

370
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,883
So do not interfere with my life again.

371
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,886
Don't come back to this place either.

372
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,413
No!

373
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,917
-Samgaebang?
-Yes.

374
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,836
Chief Gu who escorted him
out of the palace

375
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,091
has been introducing the court maids
to his services from time to time.

376
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,968
Must you do this personally though?

377
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,054
I could have sought him out alone.

378
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,973
I will see him with my own two eyes.

379
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,893
What if he really is Jung Seok-jo's son?

380
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,318
I will kill him.

381
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,781
Do you mean it?
He's the one you once had feelings for.

382
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,409
How is that any of importance now?

383
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,372
If it really was
Jung Seok-jo's son who saw me,

384
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,749
I must kill him…

385
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,586
since he's my biggest threat.

386
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,548
That's true.

387
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:27,057
It kills me to tell you that our physician
stepped out to tend to urgent business.

388
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,726
I'm afraid you'll have to head home.

389
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,270
Please be back, all right?

390
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,189
I'm sorry about this.
Please watch your step.

391
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:39,403
If you come back, I'll let him know
that you deserve his extra care.

392
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:43,115
-Put in a good word for us.
-Don't you worry and have a nice day!

393
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,628
Are you the scholar from the mountains
who booked an appointment the other day?

394
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,713
Well…

395
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,799
Yes, that's me.

396
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,886
Goodness gracious.
The wait was long, wasn't it?

397
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,973
I'm afraid our physician had
urgent business and didn't come in today.

398
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,144
I feel terrible
since you must have traveled far.

399
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,693
Please follow me.
You'll be able to see him at Hongwolru.

400
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,820
Hongwolru? The courtesan house?

401
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,241
Quiet! I see you're looking for a tavern.

402
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,619
I know a good one, so let me lead the way.

403
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,704
-Maybe next time--
-Come on.

404
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,123
-Let's get a move on it.
-But--

405
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,001
It's quite all right. Come on.

406
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,004
Let's go! This way.

407
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,089
Come on. There you go.

408
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,551
-Girls!
-Hello, sir!

409
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,346
Goodness. Let me introduce you
to today's guest.

410
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,307
He's a hotshot scholar
from the mountainous district.

411
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:18,544
My dear, do you have any idea
how much I've missed you?

412
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,170
My Lord!

413
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,673
Anyway, let's hurry inside.

414
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,759
-Come on.
-Goodness.

415
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,178
-My Lord!
-You adorable bunny.

416
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,846
Come on.

417
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,640
Oh, dear.

418
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,977
Jeez. Come on now.

419
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,229
All right. Where to?

420
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:51,201
It seems to me
that our delicate Crown Prince

421
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,996
has a weakness no one should know about.

422
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,040
A weakness, you say?

423
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,127
So, the Crown Prince
seems to be hiding something,

424
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,297
but I can't quite put my finger on it.

425
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,134
As the Royal Preceptor,
you must have inside information.

426
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,846
Gosh, what would I know?

427
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,180
Come on.

428
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,016
So hear this.

429
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,312
During the royal hunting,
I saw the Crown Prince with his hair down.

430
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:22,274
And what I saw was a woman
like this kind over here.

431
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,901
Do you have any idea
how taken aback I was?

432
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,654
Haven't you seen anything like that?

433
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,825
You said that, for some reason,
there's a womanly mood to him.

434
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,328
Isn't that what you told me last time?

435
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:39,750
That's… Well, I was only referring
to his style of writing.

436
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,711
His elegant penmanship and delicate lines
were worthy of such compliment--

437
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:49,468
Are you seriously going to keep
playing dumb with me?

438
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,263
I think that's enough, Lord Changun.

439
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,100
It's the last thing
you want anyone to hear.

440
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,604
You seemed to have had
a little too much to drink.

441
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,607
What? I had too much to drink?

442
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,241
Get over here.

443
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,243
Of course.

444
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:20,332
Do I seem like a drunk moron
babbling nonsense to you?

445
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,543
Of course not. That's not what I meant.

446
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,628
Not what you meant?

447
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:28,382
I guess that
I could have mistaken your words.

448
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:33,720
You must think nothing of me
when I'm a member of the royal family.

449
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,056
A member of the royal family!

450
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,726
Do I seem like a joke to you?

451
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:44,731
Am I a joke to you? Am I?

452
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,442
Yes, I guess
I could have mistaken your words.

453
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,195
Damn it.

454
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,324
Get up. It's all right, so get up.

455
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,368
Okay, let me see.

456
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,455
Let me take a look. You…

457
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,544
How dare you!

458
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,004
Say it again.

459
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,717
I dare you to say it again!

460
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,396
What is going on?

461
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,439
What on earth?

462
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,737
What? What is it?

463
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,114
Would you like to play as well?

464
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,658
What's there to spectate?

465
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,493
-Please.
-Gosh, no.

466
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,954
-Please don't.
-Let go of me.

467
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,831
Let go of me!

468
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,958
Damn it!

469
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,678
Quiet.

470
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:52,067
You… You're…

471
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,073
How dare you.

472
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,037
Haven't we met?

473
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,707
I mean, at the royal hunting site.

474
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,378
The royal hunting site?

475
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:18,093
But from what I recall,
you were definitely a woman.

476
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,344
No, wait.

477
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,389
You can't go out there yet.

478
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,767
Don't let my saving you go to waste.

479
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,312
Who saved whom, you say?

480
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,859
Haven't you heard the rumors?

481
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,570
He's known as the madman.

482
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,781
It's always best to walk around the turd.

483
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,746
Hey, hang on!

484
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,624
We should keep having our fun.

485
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,918
All right, let's go.

486
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,336
Let's party.

487
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,592
So here's where we meet, Uncle.

488
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,719
Look who it is.

489
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,180
What brings His Royal Highness here?

490
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,600
Your Royal Highness!

491
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,645
I see you're here too, Royal Preceptor.

492
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,857
A royal preceptor

493
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,987
having drinks in the day
with a member of the royal family?

494
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,072
How commendable.

495
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,784
Well, this isn't what it seems.

496
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,794
You and that temper of yours.

497
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:39,883
From what I recall, His Majesty
warned you not to assault others

498
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,801
by abusing your power and status.

499
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,762
Pardon?

500
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,223
But it wasn't some random assault.

501
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,392
This man insulted the royal family

502
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,395
and all I did was discipline him.

503
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,357
You disciplined him?

504
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,862
I'll keep this affair
out of His Majesty's ears.

505
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,573
He's been waiting to scold you.

506
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,119
The same goes for the Queen Dowager too.

507
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,710
That being said,
what brings you here of all places?

508
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,214
There are more than enough women
at the palace.

509
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,177
I'm not of your kind, Uncle.

510
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,515
I'm only here to meet a friend.

511
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,517
A friend?

512
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,991
I'm not in the mood for drinks anymore,
so we should leave.

513
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,585
That reminds me.

514
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,425
I saw improvement…

515
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,469
in your archery skills.

516
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,638
Pardon?

517
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,154
If you wish to be beheaded

518
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,115
as the man behind
the assassination attempt,

519
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,870
keep being cheeky.

520
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,005
Let's go.

521
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,658
-Physician Jung!
-Physician Jung, it's been so long.

522
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,911
-It worked like a charm.
-We've been waiting.

523
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,662
It's been too long.

524
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,915
Are you free today?
I'd like this side done too.

525
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,083
-Please?
-Hold on a second.

526
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,584
Now's not the time.

527
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:21,961
Later.

528
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,024
So, what was it
that you were about to say?

529
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,111
-Pardon?
-The royal hunting site?

530
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,862
I doubt anyone who isn't a soldier

531
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,241
or part of the royal family
could have been there.

532
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:55,537
Yes… Yes, of course. I wasn't there.

533
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,207
Only someone with a death wish
would have landed himself there.

534
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,053
What is your name?

535
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,479
My name is Jung Ji-un.

536
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,242
When did you return from Ming?

537
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,290
Do you remember me?

538
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,877
Yes.

539
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,213
Bits and pieces are coming together.

540
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,842
Many years ago,
you came to me to introduce yourself.

541
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,889
I'm honored, Your Royal Highness.

542
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,933
Never did I think
you were His Royal Highness though.

543
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,270
Please forgive my impudence.

544
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,234
Fine. Consider yourself forgiven.

545
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,988
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

546
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,034
Just as you were all those years ago,

547
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:19,621
you are still as kind and generous.

548
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,498
However,

549
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,502
if I ever see you again,

550
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,921
I will withdraw…

551
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,299
my forgiveness.

552
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:36,095
Keep what I said in mind.

553
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,848
Of course.

554
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,184
Of course, Your Royal Highness.

555
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,900
Your… Your Royal Highness! Jeez.

556
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,195
Your Royal Highness!

557
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,201
Is it him? Is it?

558
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,269
Follow me.

559
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,566
Quiet.

560
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,878
Court Lady Kim ordered me
to help you to bed.

561
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,383
I'm fine, so turn in already.

562
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,427
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

563
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,105
Can you afford to let him live?

564
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,233
Being Jung Seok-jo's son

565
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,861
makes him dangerous as you stated.

566
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:18,990
He's also someone who knows you
before you claimed this identity.

567
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,617
If he figures it out--

568
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,076
That won't happen…

569
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,662
for he will not

570
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,707
show himself to me again.

571
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,421
Besides, you saw for yourself.

572
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:38,551
He grew up to be
a pathetic excuse for a man.

573
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:43,931
However, he's the son of the man
who slew the young prince.

574
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:47,644
It's exactly why…
I can't complicate things.

575
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,358
Even if we do run into each other again,

576
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,278
he won't have any more doubts.

577
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,073
How so?

578
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,993
Anyone who knows Dam-i…

579
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,414
would never think that the Crown Prince

580
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,793
could ever be a girl.

581
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,328
-You called for me, Lord?
-Have a seat.

582
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,172
Is the man named Jung Ji-un your son?

583
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:03,261
Rumor has it
that he's a skilled acupuncturist.

584
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,599
I heard he saved
the Vice Minister of Rites of Ming.

585
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,605
It's true that he studied in Ming,

586
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,900
but I'm not aware of his actions there.

587
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,445
The envoy from Ming will soon visit.

588
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,948
I hear the Vice Minister of Rites
will also be among them.

589
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,994
It would be of great assistance

590
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,165
if your son could serve
the Crown Prince during the visit.

591
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,308
Forgive my actions from the other day.

592
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:51,934
It was uncalled for.

593
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,398
You shouldn't apologize to me

594
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:02,361
but to the girl
who you threatened to have branded.

595
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,280
Is she important to you?

596
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,742
I only thought she was a mere helper.

597
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,370
So?

598
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,833
Is that why you thought
she could be mistreated?

599
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,128
Mistreated in the form of

600
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,214
branding the face of an innocent?

601
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,724
Fine. I'll apologize to her as well.

602
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,939
Since you're here,
if it's all right with you,

603
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,651
I'd like to suggest you stay for tea.

604
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:50,743
What on earth?

605
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,791
Now I checked your face is well recovered,

606
01:03:56,874 --> 01:04:00,878
so I'll trust that you keep your word.

607
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,446
Wait!

608
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,916
What now? Is there more you wish to say?

609
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,090
I'm So-eun.

610
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,261
Shin So-eun.

611
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,806
Remember the name.

612
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,114
What on earth are you doing?

613
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:12,408
Why are you doing this?

614
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,286
No, please don't!

615
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,413
-Don't do this!
-Look here!

616
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,664
-Please--
-Move!

617
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,168
-Jil-geum!
-Yeong-ji…

618
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,920
Jil-geum!

619
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,504
What is the meaning of this?

620
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,756
Ji-un!

621
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,383
-There must be a misunderstanding. Let--
-Seize them!

622
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,053
What… What are you saying?

623
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,055
What is this?

624
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,306
-Ji-un.
-Take them!

625
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,474
Jil-geum! Yeong-ji!

626
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:37,808
Arrest them all.

627
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,645
-Ji-un!
-I demand a reason!

628
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,063
Why are you doing this?

629
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,147
-What--
-Ji-un!

630
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,482
-Come on.
-Don't struggle!

631
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,797
My name is Jung Ji-un.

632
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,822
There's no need to be alarmed.

633
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,075
Go ahead.
I'm sure it'll fit your grip perfectly.

634
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,162
Is that so?

635
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,439
It's as I said.

636
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:11,694
It's me, not you,
who knows what's best for you.

637
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:24,832
Your Royal Highness.

638
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,879
It is time for your lecture.

639
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,423
Oh, is it time already?

640
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,218
I'm afraid

641
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,554
I must get going.

642
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,099
A new lecturer starts today.

643
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,101
I hear one of your preceptors resigned.

644
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:49,315
I'm worried as to
the frequent swap in tutors.

645
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,443
Tell me about it.

646
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,654
There's no talent within the royal court.

647
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,661
Well, anyway…

648
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,498
thank you for the gift.

649
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,385
So tell me about my new lecturer.

650
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,430
All I heard is that he's a young talent
who caught

651
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,724
Lord Sangheon's attention from early on.

652
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:28,354
We'll see how long this one lasts.

653
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,777
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

654
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:57,133
I hear you come
with glorious recommendations.

655
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,759
I look forward to…

656
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,895
I will be your tutor starting from today.
I am Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

657
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,527
But you…

658
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,141
{\an8}<i>Wouldn't this be a problem?</i>

659
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:49,685
{\an8}<i>If, by any chance,
he finds out about you--</i>

660
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:50,811
{\an8}<i>That will never happen.</i>

661
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:55,191
{\an8}<i>Nothing can be easier
than making a lecturer resign.</i>

662
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,860
{\an8}<i>May I ask why?
Why do you want to kick me out?</i>

663
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,653
{\an8}<i>Samgaebang?</i>

664
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,948
{\an8}<i>They mean everything to me.
I will do anything to save them.</i>

665
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,033
{\an8}<i>A bet?</i>

666
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:07,036
{\an8}<i>Get the highest mark on the upcoming exam
given by all lecturers including myself.</i>

667
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,621
{\an8}<i>Why must I agree to that?</i>

668
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,332
{\an8}<i>I might change my mind
if you offered up your life.</i>

669
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,084
{\an8}I will bet my life on it.

670
