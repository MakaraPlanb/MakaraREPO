1
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,351
{\an8}The wound must be infected.
I need to see it.

2
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,028
{\an8}I…

3
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,118
{\an8}I will do it myself.

4
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,930
Your Royal Highness.

5
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,683
This is…

6
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,272
my secret.

7
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,953
What do you mean
His Royal Highness has disappeared?

8
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,038
While the procession
was crossing the woods,

9
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,791
Commander Yoon and his men
took His Royal Highness

10
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,669
while disguised as bandits.

11
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,504
Commander Yoon?

12
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,800
So His Royal Highness
still has not been found?

13
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,344
Commander Yoon is now
in Inspector Jung's custody,

14
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,804
so we will soon find him.

15
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:28,416
His Majesty must have ordered
to keep His Royal Highness alive.

16
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,004
Even after ordering
His Royal Highness' dethronement,

17
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,506
he used you to take him to safety.

18
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,431
I was surprised though.

19
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,184
Disguising him as
a woman was a neat trick.

20
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,312
Dam-i, was it?

21
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,941
I saw her in him.

22
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
Well…

23
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,530
I guess that is obvious
since they were twins.

24
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,824
Why go to such lengths…

25
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,120
to track him down?

26
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,413
As you said,

27
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,958
he is already a dethroned prince.

28
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,376
It's about time…

29
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,132
you let him go.

30
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,760
That is not my decision to make.

31
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,179
It is Lord Sangheon's.

32
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,395
A suspicious man and woman were seen
in the woods near Mount Hwanghak.

33
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,233
Stand guard here until I come back.

34
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,218
I should treat your wound first.

35
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:07,325
I will go and gather some firewood.

36
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,207
EPISODE 13

37
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,550
Over here! I found blood.

38
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,518
He could not have gone too far.

39
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,395
Search this area thoroughly.

40
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,313
His Royal Highness must be found.
Do you understand?

41
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,481
-Yes, Inspector.
-Yes, Inspector.

42
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,649
Carry on!

43
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,610
Is Lord Jaeun's location still unknown?

44
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,028
We are still searching.

45
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,206
Why are you not resting?

46
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,082
Is there…

47
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,294
something you need?

48
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,800
I did not want to be alone.

49
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,120
Why are you not asking me anything?

50
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,830
About me, I mean.

51
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,752
I know this came as a shock to you.

52
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,130
You probably resent me…

53
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,593
for deceiving you.

54
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,595
Yes.

55
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,890
I do feel resentment.

56
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,018
Not toward you,

57
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,521
but toward myself.

58
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,526
You had to manage

59
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,238
the hardships all by yourself.

60
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,535
I apologize…

61
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,455
for not realizing sooner.

62
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,674
We were born twins.

63
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,263
Me and my brother,
the eldest son of the Crown Prince.

64
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,725
After he died…

65
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,354
I had to take his place.

66
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,943
While deceiving people,

67
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,197
I lived a life that was not mine.

68
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,003
You may put off…

69
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,882
telling me about the hardships.

70
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,553
Right now, your health matters more.

71
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,099
So please do not force yourself
to tell me your story.

72
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,100
Not now.

73
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,865
No! No, Father. Please.

74
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,005
I may not be able

75
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,967
to tell you everything later on.

76
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,429
I will not hold that against you.

77
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,015
Because…

78
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,520
nothing has changed for me.

79
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,276
It is you that I am looking at.

80
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,530
And that is all I need.

81
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,324
As long as I am with you…

82
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,163
I do not need anything else.

83
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,539
You may hand that over.
I will take it to him.

84
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,126
Oh, of course.

85
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,022
Why did you help me?

86
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,901
It takes determination to take a life,

87
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,487
but I do not see that in you today.

88
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,655
Answer me.

89
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,324
Why did you have Commander Yoon tail me

90
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,451
and save me from trouble?

91
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,121
What is your reason for killing them?

92
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,792
Did you think murdering them
would solve everything?

93
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,088
Or was it just your way
of shedding pent-up anger?

94
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,135
<i>It is why traitor Kang Hwa-gil
will hereby be executed by beheading.</i>

95
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,388
Goodness.

96
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,101
As if you know anything.

97
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,686
You know…

98
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,105
nothing about me.

99
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,784
"The last night of the year."

100
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,705
It implies, "To discard what's old
before welcoming a new year."

101
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,000
Your father and I…

102
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,004
each shared a piece of that tally
as a token of our promise

103
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,923
to build a new world.

104
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,592
I…

105
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,346
failed to keep that promise,

106
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,059
lost a good friend in the process,
and became a helpless king…

107
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,354
who abandoned his own child.

108
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,357
But…

109
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,569
there never was a day
when I forgot about our promise.

110
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,032
And I will remember it
until the day I die.

111
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,827
The world your father and I dreamed of.

112
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,165
I will build that world.

113
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,595
Your Majesty,
your herbal tonic will be served.

114
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,988
I thought I heard you conversing

115
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,199
and assumed someone was here.

116
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
I was reading my book out loud.

117
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,918
I see.

118
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,323
Eun-seo.

119
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,994
Your father's grave is by the wide rock

120
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,206
halfway up Mount Gwanak.

121
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,964
You should visit him.

122
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Your Majesty!

123
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,084
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

124
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,087
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

125
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,382
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

126
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,884
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

127
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,928
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

128
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,847
Your Majesty!

129
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,307
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

130
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,602
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty!

131
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,397
Your Majesty!

132
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,632
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty…

133
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,677
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

134
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,889
-Your Majesty…
-Your Majesty!

135
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,391
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

136
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,018
Your Majesty!

137
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,813
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

138
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,776
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

139
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:03,076
Please come back, Your Majesty!

140
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,916
Please come back, Your Majesty!

141
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:14,713
Please come back, Your Majesty!

142
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,763
Just a moment.

143
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,893
Can we stay like this for just a moment?

144
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,115
Are you feeling better?

145
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,826
It…

146
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,663
still hurts a lot.

147
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,251
You will be all right…

148
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,046
since I will be by your side.

149
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,264
Being with me…

150
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,019
will make you a fugitive for life.

151
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:58,442
You will have to sever ties
with family and friends

152
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,278
and live in the shadows.

153
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,489
I would not mind that.

154
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,953
After all,

155
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,789
it is the life I have always dreamed of.

156
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,927
Once we leave this place
and arrive somewhere safe,

157
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,015
I will find us a small house first.

158
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,145
By the shore would be most preferable…

159
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,024
and I will need a fishing boat.

160
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,155
I will come home
around sundown and cook you dinner

161
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,158
with the fish that I catch.

162
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,827
Also…

163
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,705
we will go on an outing on market day.

164
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,625
There…

165
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,587
I will buy you a small gift

166
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,965
without you knowing.

167
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,805
Is there something you would like?

168
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,102
I will take my time

169
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:20,690
and think of what I would like
to receive from you.

170
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,176
You there. Could you give me some water?

171
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,059
Here you go.

172
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,994
Lord Jaeun!

173
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,912
Are you all right?

174
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,792
I followed the soldiers
guarding this place.

175
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,878
What happened?
Where is His Royal Highness?

176
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,504
We parted ways at the dock.

177
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,841
He most likely headed to Mount Hwanghak.

178
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,720
Jung Seok-jo went after him with his men

179
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,181
which is why we must find him first.

180
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,390
-We should go.
-Yes.

181
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,284
I found a bloodstain here!

182
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,791
Over there!

183
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,564
I told you to wait for me in the woods.

184
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,608
You must be exhausted.

185
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,321
Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong
will be worried about me.

186
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,572
Time is of the essence,

187
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,867
so it would be wiser to get moving.

188
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,249
Are you sure it is not because
you do not wish to be away from me?

189
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,711
Pardon?

190
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,633
You said the safe house
was on the other side of Mount Bukseong.

191
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,677
Yes.

192
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,722
It is where we will reunite
with everyone else.

193
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:07,816
Then you should change
into something less conspicuous first.

194
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,071
Here you go.

195
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,201
Thank you.

196
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,327
It is my pleasure.

197
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,387
Shall we?

198
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,308
I found a place where you can change.

199
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,102
Right. Of course.

200
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,436
I think it will be best if we split up.

201
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,521
His Royal Highness could have gone
to the safe house,

202
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,940
so why don't you check there?

203
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,693
I will search here a little more.

204
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,736
All right.

205
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,393
What is this?

206
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,436
I thought you might be hungry.

207
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,980
Try it. It will satisfy your palate.

208
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,572
Do the clothes fit well?

209
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,325
Yes.

210
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,913
I finally feel like
I am in the right clothes.

211
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,209
Please do not be too wistful.

212
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,839
Once we leave this place,
I will buy you pretty clothes every day.

213
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,802
Wear dresses or tie a ribbon
in your hair all you want.

214
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,679
No one will care.

215
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,770
Actually…

216
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,482
it still does not seem real to me.

217
00:28:55,316 --> 00:29:00,071
That I am leaving the palace
to finally live my own life.

218
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,871
Your Royal Highness,
could you wait here for just a moment?

219
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,582
I forgot to buy something.

220
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,626
-Buy what?
-Please enjoy that as you wait!

221
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,878
It will not take long.

222
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,204
Drop your sword
if you wish to save their lives.

223
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,167
How dare you.

224
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,656
-How dare you!
-Forgive me,

225
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,201
but it is time you returned to the palace.

226
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,290
What do you mean, the palace?

227
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,196
Grandfather, what brings you here?

228
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,615
His Majesty…

229
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,660
has passed away.

230
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,165
Your Royal Highness,
you must immediately return to the palace.

231
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,129
What are you saying?

232
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,257
What do you mean Father has passed away?

233
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,518
Is it true that the King passed away?

234
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,604
Yes. Did you not see
the soldiers moving out?

235
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,983
What good is there in being a king
if you die like the rest of us?

236
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,318
Talk about life being futile.

237
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,661
He was poisoned?

238
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,331
According to the physician
who last saw him,

239
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,794
his body showed discoloration
which indicates poisoning.

240
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,755
Who could have done such a thing?

241
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,192
This is nothing
to ponder over, Your Highness.

242
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,696
Please appoint a successor
to the throne and do not let this drag on.

243
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,449
This is a state funeral.

244
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,537
How dare you speak of it
in the presence of his coffin.

245
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,707
His Majesty's untimely death

246
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,878
on top of the Crown Prince's dethronement
is bringing forth social unrest.

247
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:54,092
You must decide who succeeds the throne
before there is an uproar, Your Highness.

248
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,011
-Please make a decision, Your Highness.
-Please make a decision, Your Highness.

249
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,310
Why is it
that Lord Sangheon is not present?

250
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,110
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

251
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,704
How is the Crown Prince here?

252
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:11,586
I was late because I had to escort
the Crown Prince, Your Highness.

253
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,317
Father…

254
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,081
Father.

255
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,959
MEMORIAL TABLET OF KING HYEJONG

256
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,324
A dethroned Crown Prince

257
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,702
who broke away from his road to exile
is back at the palace.

258
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:30,039
Please see to it that
the former Crown Prince is arrested

259
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,501
along with Lord Sangheon
who escorted him here.

260
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,546
You must demonstrate
the weight of the royal family.

261
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,468
He may be in exile,

262
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:48,474
but how can he be punished
for attending his own father's funeral?

263
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,645
Please let the Crown Prince
pay his respects

264
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,398
to his father.

265
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,568
Your Highness,
there are rules that must be followed.

266
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,321
If you cannot take action yourself,

267
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,700
I will order the soldiers instead.

268
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,453
To immediately arrest Lord Sangheon
and the Crown Prince.

269
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,830
Great Lord Changcheon!

270
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,015
I wish to speak with Her Highness alone,

271
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,892
so I would appreciate some privacy.

272
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,696
Despite the circumstances,
it was still wrong

273
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,656
to bring His Royal Highness back.

274
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,534
The throne remains unoccupied,

275
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:52,330
so you must promptly decide
who will succeed it, Your Highness.

276
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,998
Are you suggesting

277
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,084
that I reinstate a Crown Prince
who has been deposed?

278
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:01,756
Would you rather hand the throne over
to those who committed treason?

279
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,301
What are you saying?

280
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,012
Treason?

281
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,331
Where is Prince Jehyeon?

282
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,215
Gyeom.

283
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,971
Hwi.

284
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,854
Please forgive me.

285
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,525
I failed to hold back my tears
like you told me to do.

286
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,871
It is all right.

287
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,628
It will all be fine.

288
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,842
It will be fine.

289
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,775
Such insolence.

290
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,485
The deposed Crown Prince

291
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,072
walks within the palace walls
using the funeral as an excuse.

292
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,284
Is that why you wished to speak with me?

293
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,664
Lord Sangheon would not have
brought back the Crown Prince

294
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,459
unless he had an ulterior motive.

295
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:06,213
Rumor is spreading across palace grounds
that His Majesty was poisoned.

296
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,842
All I am saying is that

297
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,304
we could play right into
Lord Sangheon's hands.

298
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,638
We?

299
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,726
I do not think I follow.

300
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,940
{\an8}We joined forces
and had the scholars make an appeal.

301
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:29,361
{\an8}Many are speculating that
it drove a wedge between the King and me.

302
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,907
Before others try to use that
as leverage--

303
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,743
Some might get the wrong idea,
Great Lord Changcheon.

304
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,245
You were the one
who triggered the scholars' appeal.

305
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,249
All I did was inform you
of what had happened

306
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,376
so that Lord Changun's voice
could be heard.

307
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,546
Are you choosing to back out now?

308
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,133
As if I don't know what you truly desire.

309
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,554
You thought you would be next in line
with the Crown Prince out of the picture.

310
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,848
The Crown Prince
has Lord Sangheon in his corner,

311
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,435
so Prince Jehyeon
must have seemed like the easier target.

312
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,774
Someone who is aware of that

313
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:11,195
should also know
that actions have consequences.

314
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,405
What did you just say?

315
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,741
You must be well aware

316
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:20,037
of the one who has the most to gain
with the passing of His Majesty.

317
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,873
And what is clear to everyone

318
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,043
must be clear to Lord Sangheon as well.

319
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,550
10,000 BAGS OF RICE
100 HORSES

320
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,593
160 SHORT SWORDS
70 BOWSTRINGS

321
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,721
Great Lord Changcheon has amassed an army.

322
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,434
We both know what this implies.

323
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,943
He should be reprimanded
for amassing an army,

324
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,446
but it is not enough
to accuse him of treason.

325
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,490
Recently…

326
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:01,912
Great Lord Changcheon collided
with the late King

327
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,957
over his involvement
regarding the scholars' appeal.

328
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:12,715
His Majesty was well aware
of Great Lord Changcheon's army.

329
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,635
Great Lord Changcheon
must have feared the repercussions.

330
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,305
Could it be…

331
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,807
Are you saying…

332
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,436
that Great Lord Changcheon
had His Majesty poisoned?

333
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,900
The decision must be made.

334
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,280
Will it be Prince Jehyeon
whose forces committed treason or…

335
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,283
the deposed Crown Prince?

336
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,422
My Queen,
Great Lord Changcheon shall enter.

337
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,555
What happened?

338
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,309
I should have known better
than to work with Lord Wonsan.

339
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,229
How can he turn his back on me like this?

340
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,984
Rumor has it that
you poisoned the King to prevent

341
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,570
being reprimanded
for triggering the scholars.

342
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,530
What can we do about this?

343
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,407
Damn it.

344
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,536
You cannot go down like this.

345
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,789
Rally your troops, Father.

346
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,376
-Pardon?
-There is no time.

347
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,130
Write the letter. Do it now!

348
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,679
-You cannot do this.
-Please!

349
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,806
-You cannot enter!
-You cannot enter!

350
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,976
Explain yourselves!

351
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,146
They are traitors who murdered the King.
Arrest them immediately!

352
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,148
-Yes, my lord.
-What?

353
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,109
What is the meaning of this?

354
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,277
-How dare you.
-Let go of me!

355
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,655
-How dare you grab me.
-Let go of her!

356
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:03,158
-How dare you lay a hand on the Queen?
-How dare you!

357
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,410
Let go of me!

358
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,120
Let go!

359
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,123
How dare you lay your hands on me?

360
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,582
My Queen!

361
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,804
You had His Majesty's eunuch

362
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,807
put poison in his herbal tonic.

363
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,310
What…

364
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,108
Before one plans a war,

365
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,736
one should choose his opponents wisely.

366
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,281
Lord Sangheon…

367
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,786
-Take them away.
-Yes, my lord.

368
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,164
This is a set-up.

369
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,792
How dare you!
I will have your head for this.

370
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,752
-We are being framed!
-Your Highness!

371
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,921
Lord Sangheon!

372
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,381
Your Highness!

373
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,557
I am curious
as to why you came back though.

374
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,812
I only did so

375
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,191
to bid farewell to our father.

376
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,067
Hwi.

377
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,535
-Take him.
-Yes, my lord.

378
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:32,998
What is this?

379
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,584
Hwi!

380
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,752
Let go of me.

381
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,046
Hwi!

382
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,297
Let go!

383
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,682
Prince Jehyeon was arrested.

384
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,518
What is this about?

385
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,021
The Queen and Great Lord Changcheon

386
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:00,067
conspired to poison His Majesty.

387
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,861
But why?

388
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,865
Great Lord Changcheon had no reason to.

389
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:12,412
Reason is not a factor
when it comes to one's desires.

390
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,709
The throne cannot
be left vacant for too long,

391
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,837
so please collect yourself
as soon as possible.

392
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,676
What are you saying?

393
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,097
-Am I--
-The one who stands before me…

394
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:35,602
must sit on the throne.

395
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,362
But I have already been deposed.

396
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,783
The only eligible heir left
is Prince Jehyeon.

397
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,661
Please release him this instant.

398
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,038
I will return to where I belong.

399
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,505
I am afraid you may not.

400
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:09,261
You fled with the help
of your former tutor.

401
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,930
Dying as a fugitive

402
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,975
who went on the run
against His Majesty's orders

403
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,144
is the only other option you have.

404
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,274
Commander Yoon Hyeong-seol
will have his limbs cut off.

405
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,777
Your eunuch and court lady
will be beheaded.

406
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,488
And Jung Ji-un will be forced

407
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,283
to become a government slave.

408
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,498
Do you wish to see

409
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,170
how far I will go to make you the King?

410
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,842
Why…

411
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,305
Why must you go this far?

412
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,973
It's like I said.

413
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,269
There is no reason behind the actions
one takes to fulfill his desire.

414
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,190
Take the throne.

415
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:07,319
If you wish to protect your people,

416
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,489
you must have the power to do so.

417
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,744
Is no one out there?

418
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,626
Escort His Royal Highness to his quarters.

419
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,002
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

420
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,233
Your Royal Highness!

421
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,158
Step aside. How dare you.

422
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,828
We were ordered by Lord Sangheon
to escort him to his quarters.

423
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,204
Any contact is forbidden.

424
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,103
Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

425
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,230
Hyun.

426
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,149
I am glad to see you unharmed.

427
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,110
We will leave the palace.

428
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,904
Allow me to escort you.

429
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,577
Lower your sword.

430
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,840
Was harming Commander Yoon and those
who serve His Royal Highness not enough?

431
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,011
Must you treat him this way as well?

432
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:01,141
Do you not realize
that you standing here unscathed

433
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,520
is my last courtesy
toward a royal relative?

434
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,037
I heard that Lord Wonsan

435
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:26,666
contributed greatly to the deposing
of His Royal Highness.

436
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,672
This will be the last time that you

437
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:38,261
and your brother are given a pass
due to your royal status.

438
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,473
Do not forget that.

439
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,357
Let go of me.

440
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,817
-Hyun!
-Let go of me!

441
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,528
Your Royal Highness.

442
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,572
Your Royal Highness!

443
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,054
SHINMUMUN

444
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,814
You fool.

445
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,777
Where is His Royal Highness?

446
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,738
Do you have any idea what you have done?

447
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,574
I must meet the Crown Prince.

448
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,577
What did you hope
to achieve by aiding his escape?

449
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,744
Father!

450
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,622
I must…

451
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,126
meet His Royal Highness.

452
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,587
He is not someone
you can meet at will now.

453
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,841
What do you mean by that?

454
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,593
His coronation will soon take place,

455
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,469
so leave.

456
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,638
Are you saying…

457
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,851
he will become the King?

458
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,772
No.

459
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,526
No, that cannot be.

460
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,887
Hwi.

461
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,517
Was…

462
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:55,315
Was it really my grandfather
who poisoned our father?

463
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,735
It's not true, is it?

464
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,696
Please tell me it is not true.

465
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,830
All my life I have been scared.

466
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,502
I was scared that I might take your crown.

467
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,796
However…

468
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,840
I was wrong all along.

469
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,594
I was scared that the greed and desire

470
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,138
of my mother and grandfather

471
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,557
would land me here.

472
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,686
Because that would lead to my death.

473
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,730
The thought of it terrified me.

474
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,071
I am truly sorry, Gyeom.

475
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:45,949
I…

476
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,744
I thought the hardships only fell on me.

477
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,665
I thought it was only I who lived in fear.

478
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,838
It was I…

479
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,591
who led our father to his death.

480
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,889
I am to blame for his passing.

481
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,870
Do not worry.

482
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,498
I will save you.

483
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,793
You will not die.

484
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,295
Never…

485
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,091
will I let them take your life.

486
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,614
I will become King.

487
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,953
How you saved me from my demise…

488
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,456
and made me king…

489
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,128
will never be forgotten.

490
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,590
However…

491
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,885
I have a favor to ask.

492
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,179
I am listening.

493
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,518
Please let Prince Jehyeon live.

494
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,980
Also, ensure the safety of my people.

495
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,650
Give me your word.

496
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,320
If you do,

497
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,033
I will gladly become your puppet.

498
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,418
Will that be all?

499
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,884
I am humbled by your boundless generosity,

500
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:51,968
Your Majesty.

501
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,148
Halt!

502
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,467
Step aside.

503
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,463
Are you all right?

504
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:58,886
Your wound…

505
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,891
It must not be fully healed.

506
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,107
I am sorry.

507
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,652
I am…

508
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,615
truly sorry.

509
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,244
No.

510
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,539
Please tell me this is not true.

511
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:32,128
You promised me that we would be together.

512
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,424
It is still not too late.

513
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,843
You can still leave the palace.

514
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,721
Allow me to escort you, so please--

515
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,930
As of this moment,

516
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,270
you are not allowed by my side.

517
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,649
Forever.

518
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,287
Then…

519
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,124
at least…

520
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,921
allow me to tend to your wound.

521
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,642
Bow.

522
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,232
At ease.

523
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,069
Bow.

524
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,199
His Majesty shall now enter.

525
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,389
Let the morning assembly begin.

526
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:04,131
{\an8}I will stay by your side
only until your wound has healed.

527
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,259
{\an8}<i>-The only desire I have is
-Your Highness!</i>

528
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,762
{\an8}<i>-to produce a son and make you happy.
-Your Highness!</i>

529
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,931
{\an8}<i>Please continue to let me handle
these burdensome matters</i>

530
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,517
{\an8}so that you can give
your full attention to producing an heir.

531
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,102
{\an8}<i>I will keep that in mind.</i>

532
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,396
{\an8}<i>How is His Majesty? Has his wound healed?</i>

533
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,647
{\an8}<i>His wound?</i>

534
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,357
{\an8}<i>Did you know all along?</i>

535
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,694
{\an8}<i>Should anything happen to His Majesty,
I will lose my mind.</i>

536
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,531
{\an8}<i>-I hope you will end it.
-Hyun.</i>

537
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:32,618
{\an8}<i>His Majesty has become my whole world now.</i>
