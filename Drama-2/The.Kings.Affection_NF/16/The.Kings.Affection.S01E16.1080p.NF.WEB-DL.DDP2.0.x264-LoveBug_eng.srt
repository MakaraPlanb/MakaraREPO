1
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,316
{\an8}Why did His Majesty want to see me here?

2
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,620
{\an8}Your Majesty.

3
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,671
{\an8}What…

4
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,800
{\an8}What could this be about?

5
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,689
I would rather you not tease me,
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,733
Tease you?

7
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,611
I am quite serious.

8
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,238
Pardon?

9
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,532
I remember what you once told me.

10
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,201
That you would endure everything.

11
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,540
I will do the same.

12
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,546
I am ready to bear
the consequences of my feelings.

13
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,617
EPISODE 16

14
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,773
{\an8}DIARIES OF THE ROYAL SECRETARIAT
MONTHS 7 AND 8

15
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,200
DIARIES OF THE ROYAL SECRETARIAT
MONTHS 7 AND 8

16
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,379
"The late King's body became swollen

17
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,382
after a day and a half since his death."

18
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,425
"And his gums blackened."

19
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,554
After a day and a half?

20
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,190
"Great Lord Changcheon used poison
from the <i>busohwa</i> plant to murder…"

21
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,693
His body would have…

22
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,655
reacted immediately to <i>busohwa</i>.

23
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,752
Scribe Jung, we should hurry
and finish writing the diaries.

24
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,297
Where are you going? We have work to do.

25
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,800
Allow me to visit the library
in the royal infirmary for a moment.

26
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,594
Why do you need to go there?

27
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,595
Wait…

28
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,559
I guess I will finish them.
This is going to take a while.

29
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,128
Who goes there?

30
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,303
Check the back door.

31
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,679
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

32
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,142
Check if anything is missing.

33
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,518
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

34
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,607
There were no ledgers on weapon
transactions at the office of the guild.

35
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,736
It seems he did not leave
any evidence there.

36
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:07,033
I should search the base in Yeoyeon.

37
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,329
It must be there seeing
how it was not at the office.

38
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,333
It would be too dangerous.

39
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,087
The army base must have
tighter security than the office.

40
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,381
Do not worry, Your Majesty.
I will report back once I return.

41
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,219
Right. If you need to reach me
for an urgent matter,

42
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,722
send Kang Eun-seo as a messenger.

43
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,936
I will.

44
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,271
Please be careful.

45
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,861
<i>Busohwa…</i>

46
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,242
<i>Busohwa… </i>

47
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,873
<i>BUSOHWA</i>

48
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,876
"Consumption of <i>busohwa</i>
causes swelling in the stomach

49
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,256
and blackens the gums."

50
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,510
"These symptoms appear immediately."

51
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,098
Eunuch Hong, may I ask
what brings you here at this hour again?

52
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,018
Well, it is a great night
so I was taking a stroll again.

53
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,061
-Come with me.
-We cannot go with you.

54
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,647
Why not? Let me show you
a better spot. Come with me.

55
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,859
-We are busy.
-Come on. Stop being so stubborn.

56
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,235
I know a better spot.

57
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,130
<i>After making one mistake,</i>

58
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,675
it is easy to make another.

59
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,471
It is why I cannot condone

60
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,766
even a single mistake.

61
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,774
<i>Father.</i>

62
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,789
What are you doing here?

63
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,085
I would like to ask you the same thing.

64
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,555
Your Majesty, did the talk go well?

65
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,348
Let's go back.

66
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,478
Your mother must be waiting. Go home now.

67
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,622
Did you take care
of the Minister of Taxation?

68
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,540
Yes, my lord.

69
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,172
The Inspector General's daughter

70
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,177
and your son have been acquainted.

71
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,055
What do you think about their union?

72
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,933
Political alliances are formed
through matrimonies.

73
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,690
I suppose it would not be a bad idea
if the Inspector General approves of it.

74
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,237
Right. I hear there was

75
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,741
an intruder at
the office of the guild last night.

76
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,536
Someone broke into the office
that handled weapons transactions

77
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,040
right when the Minister of Taxation
was impeached from his post.

78
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,920
I need you to make a trip to Yeoyeon.

79
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,840
You are to bring back
all the ledgers that could be used

80
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,051
to prove the existence
of the private army.

81
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,637
Yes, my lord.

82
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,979
More people in the Ministry of Taxation
had been involved with the recent incident

83
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,816
so they are being investigated
by the Office of the Inspector General.

84
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,235
I believe you will have to appoint

85
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,529
a good number of people for the Ministry.

86
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,240
I understand.

87
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,080
Your Majesty.
Pyongan Province, Hamgil Province,

88
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,873
and Yeonbyeon will not have enough food

89
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,251
due to what
the Minister of Taxation has done.

90
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,313
Scribe Jung.

91
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,569
Scribe Jung. Please focus.

92
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,447
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

93
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,217
What has been on your mind all day?

94
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,305
Please forgive me.

95
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,932
I did not get enough sleep last night.

96
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,229
Her Majesty the Queen is approaching.

97
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,922
I heard that you came back together
with the Inspector General.

98
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,882
Yes, Your Majesty.

99
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,093
But what brings you to the palace?

100
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,138
Her Highness invited me.

101
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,059
She had been a close friend of mine
before I was married.

102
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,896
The Grand Queen Dowager
allowed me to invite her to the palace.

103
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:35,940
I see.

104
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:41,320
I am deeply indebted to you
for everything you have done for me.

105
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,697
Don't mention it.

106
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,454
You must have a lot to talk about
after not seeing each other for so long.

107
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,623
I should let you go to your quarters.

108
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,418
I will tell the Bureau of Special Foods
to serve you good tea and refreshments.

109
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,588
Thank you, Your Majesty.

110
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,591
Let's go.

111
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,027
Then I will head over to Seungjeongwon.

112
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,281
I hear you are in charge of
the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat.

113
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,241
You should get some sleep
if you are tired.

114
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,369
I am all right.

115
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,841
Scribe Jung.

116
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,051
Can I have a moment?

117
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,807
Yes, Your Highness?

118
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,978
Could you stop by my quarters
if you have some time to spare?

119
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,024
Pardon?

120
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,695
Your Highness.

121
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,034
There are some things I want to ask you
about life at the palace.

122
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,202
And I happen to run into you here.

123
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,080
It will only take a moment.

124
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,298
<i>I'm not sure
if I will meet the expectations.</i>

125
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:11,345
Do you have feelings for someone else?

126
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,223
Please forgive me.

127
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,897
Should I make a trip
to the Queen's quarters?

128
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,273
I can go and observe.

129
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,694
Observe?

130
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,071
The night when the lanterns were lit,

131
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,616
you and Scribe Jung shared a kiss.

132
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,326
I saw everything.

133
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,580
I do not know what you are talking about.

134
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,707
Goodness.

135
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,334
Do not worry.

136
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,422
I will not tell Court Lady Kim about this.

137
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,049
I will head over there now.

138
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,097
That is not…

139
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,148
I heard that
you have crossed paths before.

140
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,360
And here you are, running into
each other at the palace again.

141
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,697
Some bonds are indeed extraordinary

142
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,284
just like the bond
between His Majesty and me.

143
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,788
Yes, indeed.

144
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,083
The bond is indeed strange. No.

145
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,461
It is extraordinary.

146
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,055
His Majesty has sent some refreshments.

147
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,516
Lend me a hand.

148
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,404
How kind of him to send us refreshments.

149
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,156
Please tell him I am very grateful.

150
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,908
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,371
By the way,

152
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,000
you are at the best age to marry.

153
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,087
Why are you still alone?

154
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,004
Pardon?

155
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,051
Well, I…

156
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,065
Are you all right?

157
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,451
Thank you.

158
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,086
Your Highness,
that question may have been too personal.

159
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,214
Where are my manners?

160
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,174
I am so sorry.

161
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,219
My question was indeed too personal.

162
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,013
It is all right, Your Highness.

163
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,486
Will that be all?

164
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,405
Yes, Your Highness.

165
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,450
I will take my leave now.

166
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,163
Please thank His Majesty for me.

167
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,205
Yes, Your Highness.

168
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,101
Your Majesty.

169
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,773
So tell me.
Are they enjoying each other's company?

170
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,194
Yes. But you do not
have to worry about anything.

171
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,405
I was not worried.

172
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,541
You may leave.

173
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,251
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:25,474
I can see that His Majesty cherishes you.

175
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,101
He makes sure
to take care of you like this.

176
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,436
I suppose.

177
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,524
I hope you will also
meet someone nice soon.

178
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,152
And you too, Scribe Jung.

179
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,989
Right.

180
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,241
Your Highness.

181
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,244
Right.

182
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,664
There is something
I have been wanting to give you.

183
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,541
Wait here for a moment.

184
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,396
I did not know you would be here.

185
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,899
When did you return from Onyang?

186
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,150
Well…

187
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,446
I came back a while ago.

188
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,660
Actually, a lot has happened
since I returned.

189
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,126
Her Highness has misunderstood our history

190
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,753
and left us in private on purpose.

191
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,714
You seemed busy.

192
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,259
I will talk to Her Highness for you,
so you can take your leave.

193
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,434
Then could you speak to her on my behalf?

194
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,021
I have some people
to meet with outside the palace.

195
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,897
Right. You know them too.

196
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,525
Jil-geum and Yeong-ji,
my friends from Samgaebang.

197
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,278
I hope they are all well.

198
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,612
Of course.

199
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,158
They would still be standing
even if the world came to an end.

200
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,664
It was a pleasure to see you again.

201
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,462
Wait.

202
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,216
I was worried that…

203
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,014
I had made you feel uncomfortable
because I only thought about my feelings

204
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,933
the last time I saw you.

205
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,855
No. You do not need to feel that way.

206
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,111
You seem drawn
compared to the last time I saw you.

207
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,156
I heard your family had a tough time.

208
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,576
I am glad you are back.

209
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,579
Coming back to a place
where you had been hurt

210
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,665
must not have been an easy decision.

211
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,630
Leave your past behind you
and look after yourself.

212
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,008
And do not blame yourself either.

213
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,767
Goodbye.

214
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,681
Where is Scribe Jung?

215
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,434
Please forgive me.
I told him it was okay to take his leave.

216
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,145
Really?

217
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,400
Did I make you two feel uncomfortable?

218
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,572
No, Your Highness.

219
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,350
Why are you here?

220
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:42,522
The reception at the Queen's quarters
must still be ongoing.

221
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,443
There is something
I must take care of outside the palace.

222
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,237
I see.

223
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:55,285
So tell me. Did you enjoy the reception?

224
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,873
Yes, I enjoyed it.
Thank you for the refreshments.

225
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,292
They were not for you.

226
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,544
They were for the Queen.

227
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,881
I see.

228
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,094
What is the matter?

229
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,721
What do you mean?

230
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,391
Did I do something wrong?

231
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,695
What is that look on your face?

232
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,240
Well…

233
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,909
It is nothing.

234
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,410
Nothing.

235
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,668
Why are you smiling like that?

236
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,504
Well, I believe

237
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,258
you might be jealous right now.

238
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,801
It makes me happy.

239
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,636
What?

240
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,722
Why would I be jealous?

241
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,394
Do not get the wrong idea.

242
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,573
Please do not worry.
I will be back soon, Your Majesty.

243
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,754
Commander Jung wishes to enter.

244
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,010
Let him in.

245
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,273
Allow me to take a leave
for a few days to inspect security

246
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,400
at Prince Jehyeon's dwelling in Ganghwa.

247
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,693
All of a sudden?

248
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,030
Did something happen to Gyeom?

249
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,574
It is my seasonal inspection.

250
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,953
I see. You have my approval.

251
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,929
-Jil-geum.
-Hey.

252
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,932
What took you so long?

253
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,893
I have a lot of clients at the clinic.

254
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,936
So I cannot be gone for too long.

255
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,229
Sorry about that.

256
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,273
Fine. So what is this about?

257
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,486
I need to ask you for a favor.

258
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,655
-A favor?
-I need you to go to the herb markets…

259
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,785
and find out about this plant.

260
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,164
I do not think it is
a common herb in Joseon.

261
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,043
See if you can find any vendors
who are knowledgeable about herbs

262
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,712
-from Ming and the West.
-What is this?

263
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,548
Is this a poisonous herb?

264
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,262
Do this for me. Bye.

265
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,527
-Be careful.
-Yes, my lord.

266
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,206
I deserve to die!

267
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,918
My fingers got slippery
when I was trying to put it in.

268
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,254
So it is broken now.

269
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,674
Whom does it belong to?

270
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,595
Well…

271
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,433
this placenta chest belongs
to His Majesty.

272
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,876
<i>Twins?</i>

273
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,920
It is in my understanding
that umbilical cords

274
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,089
can take on this shape

275
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,967
when the umbilical cords of twins
get tangled inside the womb.

276
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,067
Do not speak to anyone
about what you saw today.

277
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,319
Yes, my lord!

278
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,454
They are the ones who banished
Prince Jehyeon all the way to Ganghwa.

279
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,916
Now, they are going to check
on him every season? How ridiculous.

280
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,714
We must hold off on our plan in Yeoyeon.

281
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,634
Send a letter to Eun-seo.

282
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,052
Eun-seo?

283
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,179
I am talking about Kim Ga-on.

284
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,433
I am not used to his real name.
I will do so, Your Majesty.

285
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,953
After all, Prince Jaeun
is a member of the royal family.

286
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,664
It seems he has stopped
coming to your quarters

287
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,250
after finding out the truth about you.

288
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,170
I reckon that he is doing so
out of consideration for you

289
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,464
in case you feel uncomfortable.

290
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,222
Hyun.

291
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,564
Your Majesty.

292
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,539
Have you been busy these days?

293
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,166
You have not come to see me lately.

294
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,671
What is it? Is something wrong?

295
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,051
Whenever I tell you this,

296
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,220
you always worry first and ask me

297
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,431
if something has happened.

298
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,984
Sitting here with you

299
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,945
reminds me of a day from a long time ago.

300
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,491
You were worried that I would be scared

301
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:55,371
to be in a new place, so you read
books for me until deep into the night.

302
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,207
You always enjoyed books.

303
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,126
And you still do.

304
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,171
The candy you gave me then

305
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,798
was the first I had ever tasted.

306
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,970
It was the first time
I tasted something that sweet.

307
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,850
When I had it in my mouth,

308
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,896
I was able to forget
all the fear I had about the palace.

309
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,523
I was happy.

310
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,485
I will bring you some more.

311
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,239
As much as you need.

312
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,746
Ever since I was young,

313
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,208
I felt the most comfortable around you…

314
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,837
and you were
the person I relied on the most.

315
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,217
-Your Majesty.
-So could you continue…

316
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,596
to treat me the way you used to?

317
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,351
When I see you
distancing yourself from me,

318
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,061
I do not know…

319
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:05,483
how to behave around you either.

320
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,530
If I ask you…

321
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,327
to remain as my good cousin
and closest friend…

322
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,456
by my side,

323
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,335
would I be asking for too much?

324
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,348
You could never ask too much of me.
Of course, I will do so.

325
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,228
You will forever be my king, Your Majesty.

326
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,819
What is this?

327
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,322
It is a present for you.

328
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,700
Why are you giving me this?

329
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,294
<i>When you find a lady you love
and get engaged,</i>

330
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,922
<i>please give that to your betrothed.</i>

331
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,082
Hello, Uncle.

332
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,852
<i>His Majesty will remove you
from your position</i>

333
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,979
and banish you to Gyeongsang Province.

334
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,356
What?

335
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,193
What…

336
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,863
I cannot believe this nonsense.

337
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,199
Why? What have I done wrong?

338
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,284
Why?

339
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,578
Tell him to just kill me.

340
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,164
No. I shall go over there
and kill everyone.

341
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,332
Then I shall end my life there!

342
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,715
I will help you get your revenge.

343
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,343
Put your life in my hands.

344
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,639
<i>I know something very useful.</i>

345
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,891
Hey.

346
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,686
<i>Useful enough
to bring down the Crown Prince.</i>

347
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,703
Something is off about Jung Seok-jo.

348
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,247
Go and tell Officer Yoon

349
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,042
to postpone his trip
to Yeoyeon for the time being.

350
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,089
Officer Yoon left last night in a haste

351
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,217
to check the border
in the northern region.

352
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,093
-Last night?
-Yes.

353
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,912
-What is it?
-A suspicious man has been spotted.

354
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,080
What?

355
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,958
TRANSACTION ON DAY 23
AT NAKDONG, GYEONGSANG PROVINCE

356
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,272
It seems I've arrived earlier
than you expected.

357
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,943
I warned you before

358
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,612
that I would not
turn a blind eye next time.

359
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,631
Do you still believe

360
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,717
what you told me before?

361
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,347
Do you still think that
this is the only path you can take?

362
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,018
<i>Have you ever regretted your decision?</i>

363
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:18,022
Your decision to stand by Lord Sangheon.

364
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,816
This was the only path I was given.

365
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,611
So I merely walked my path.

366
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,804
-Are you all right?
-How…

367
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,269
Intruders!

368
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,229
You must leave.

369
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,856
Come with me. Hurry!

370
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,652
Chase them! Go!

371
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,903
Get them!

372
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,159
-Get them!
-Get them!

373
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:18,999
Hurry.

374
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,960
Get them!

375
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,507
Get them!

376
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,386
Get them!

377
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,395
Get them!

378
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,162
Give me the ledger.

379
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,164
And I will spare your life.

380
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:02,251
Is that your last favor as a friend?

381
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,045
Take it.

382
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,764
No!

383
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,780
Go!

384
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,241
Stay alive.

385
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,932
Stop!

386
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,254
Seok-jo…

387
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,757
The sky is beautiful.

388
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,049
Here is what I think.

389
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,176
I bet you spent
the whole night training alone.

390
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,094
I am certain of it.

391
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,597
I think you need some more training.

392
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,098
Come on.

393
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:04,933
You…

394
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,561
Goodness.

395
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,815
Seok-jo. Look at the sky.

396
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,276
How beautiful.

397
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,861
Goodness.

398
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,631
Hyeong-seol.

399
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,180
No.

400
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,448
I believe he was unable
to take the ledger.

401
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,369
And Officer Yoon…

402
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,456
died on the spot.

403
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,339
After paying a price like that,

404
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,216
I am sure

405
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,302
His Majesty will learn
a lesson from all of this.

406
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,356
-Ji-un, over here!
-Hey, Jil-geum.

407
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,610
Did you find what I asked for?

408
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,364
You said the corpse got swollen
and changed color after a day and a half.

409
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,410
I think this might be it.

410
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,956
<i>SONANGCHO</i>

411
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,417
A RARE, POISONOUS PLANT
THAT FLOWERS EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS

412
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,925
Your Majesty.

413
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,222
Scribe Jung. Have you not gone home yet?

414
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:12,102
-I need to speak with you, Your Majesty.
-What?

415
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,235
All right. Come with me.

416
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,199
<i>BONCHOGANGMOK</i>

417
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,452
What is this?

418
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,622
The Diaries of the Royal Secretariat state

419
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:35,709
that the poisonous herb
that killed the late King was <i>busohwa</i>.

420
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,087
Right. I was informed of this as well.

421
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,423
And I also read the Diaries.

422
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,926
It was all fabricated.

423
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,803
When one gets poisoned with <i>busohwa</i>,

424
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,307
the postmortem signs
are supposed to show up immediately.

425
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,725
But it took

426
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,146
a day and a half for these signs
to become visible on the late King's body.

427
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,649
What are you…

428
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:10,786
<i>SONANGCHO</i>

429
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,374
It was <i>sonangcho</i>.

430
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,211
It is much more poisonous than <i>busohwa</i>.

431
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,838
And they bring out
similar postmortem signs.

432
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,217
But it is incredibly difficult
to find this herb.

433
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,764
-Then…
-If we find the distribution chain,

434
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:35,352
we will be able to find out the truth
behind the late King's death.

435
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,404
<i>SONANGCHO</i>

436
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,074
Your Majesty.

437
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,289
What is it?

438
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,126
News has come from Yeoyeon.

439
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,462
News?

440
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,150
Where is…

441
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,695
Officer Yoon?

442
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,074
He passed away.

443
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,542
Officer Yoon told me
to make sure this was delivered to you.

444
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,926
Could you escort those two
back to the palace?

445
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:59,097
I want to stay here for a bit longer.

446
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,392
Yes, Your Majesty.

447
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,980
Thank you.

448
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,028
For coming back alive.

449
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,971
I feel as if I am surrounded by fog.

450
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,142
When I run somewhere,
thinking it is my final destination,

451
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,978
I realize that the destination

452
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,023
is actually still far away.

453
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,485
And when I run with all my might,

454
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,947
it gets farther away.

455
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,868
I have been wandering around to no end.

456
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,871
And now,

457
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,834
I feel like I have forgotten

458
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,837
where I need to go.

459
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,883
Will I…

460
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,262
be able to find my way again?

461
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,517
Will the fog

462
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,353
ever go away?

463
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,696
Once the rain stops, the sun will shine.

464
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,449
Once the fog lifts,

465
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,787
the view will become clear.

466
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:52,002
If you have a destination,
you will reach it someday.

467
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,258
No matter how long it takes.

468
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,572
What brings you to the Capital?
I was not informed of your visit.

469
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,950
The news of Officer Yoon's death
has reached my ears.

470
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,328
I know that His Majesty respected him.

471
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,954
He must be grieving.

472
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,289
Yes.

473
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,958
Is that why you are here?

474
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,965
How is the relocation
of the placenta chamber going?

475
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,176
Is it going well?

476
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,512
The task was
more interesting than I expected.

477
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,265
I do not know how to thank

478
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,310
Lord Sangheon for giving me this task.

479
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,020
I am glad to hear that.

480
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,898
I was worried that life
in the countryside would be difficult.

481
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,900
Do not worry.

482
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:02,572
It seems I have a very good chance
of coming back earlier than planned.

483
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,723
What a beautiful sound.

484
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,102
It sounds like waves.

485
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,070
You asked me to come
to the seaside with you.

486
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,031
I am sorry.

487
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,369
It does not have to be the seaside.

488
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,413
I just wanted

489
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,916
to stay by your side.

490
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,505
You told me to trust you
rather than die a meaningless death.

491
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,633
But what is this
if not a meaningless death?

492
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,470
You were supposed
to take the throne and bring me back

493
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,181
after ousting
Prince Jehyeon and his people.

494
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,392
I have sent thousands of letters to you!

495
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,686
This is quite the greeting.

496
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,522
Please calm down, Uncle.

497
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:11,242
Fine. Why did you want to see me now?
What is it?

498
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,037
Do you need me now that
you got kicked out of the Capital?

499
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,208
What is it? Do you want me
to accompany you to the afterlife?

500
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,835
I do not think that will be necessary.

501
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:26,049
I asked you to come here so that
I could bring you back from the afterlife.

502
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,741
If there are two umbilical cords…

503
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,160
Does it mean they were twins?

504
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,503
If you are trying to fool me again…

505
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,464
Damn it.

506
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:11,511
Fine. So go on. Why is the fact
that they were twins important?

507
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,763
In the year His Majesty was born,

508
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,600
you must remember that many
from the delivery chamber were killed.

509
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,854
<i>So you managed to find out.</i>

510
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,689
<i>No one speaks of it as it is a secret.</i>

511
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,151
<i>What if they were all killed
to cover up a certain truth?</i>

512
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,485
<i>What do you think?</i>

513
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,320
<i>For example,</i>

514
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,991
His Majesty becoming
a different person at a certain point.

515
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,201
A different person?

516
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,412
When His Majesty was the Prince,

517
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,206
Hyun told me something.

518
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,209
He said it felt as if
the Prince had become someone else.

519
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,296
We both sensed it too, did we not?

520
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,757
I understand he wanted
to keep a distance from us,

521
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,261
but he was oddly fastidious
about not participating in activities

522
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,180
where there were only men.

523
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,821
I was right?

524
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,991
Yes, indeed! I told you!

525
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,952
What I told you was true!

526
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,662
I was right!

527
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,456
Now, I believe

528
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,876
that you may have been right

529
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,377
<i>about this.</i>

530
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,299
So I just need to check
whether or not he is a woman?

531
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,148
You have swelling around your eyes.

532
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,653
There is nothing I can do.

533
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,655
I cannot be gone for long.

534
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,364
-What is this?
-You have to get away from here.

535
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,640
Uncle, how…

536
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,331
Your Majesty.

537
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,573
Father.

538
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,069
{\an8}<i>Did you check if he was indeed a woman?</i>

539
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,320
{\an8}<i>He is a woman. I'm certain of it.</i>

540
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,115
{\an8}A woman? You must have gone mad!

541
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,367
{\an8}<i>His Majesty sees Scribe Jung in private?</i>

542
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,619
{\an8}Is it possible
His Majesty prefers men to women?

543
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,873
{\an8}<i>Is that why he is avoiding
sleeping with the Queen?</i>

544
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:36,043
{\an8}<i>You should stop seeing
Scribe Jung for the time being.</i>

545
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,380
{\an8}<i>I will not ask you for the truth.</i>

546
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,715
{\an8}Just allow me to produce an heir.

547
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,301
{\an8}<i>I do not want to lose you, Your Majesty.</i>

548
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,511
{\an8}I am getting married.
