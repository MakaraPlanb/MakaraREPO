00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:09,110
NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

2
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,154
Please stay healthy, Your Royal Highness.

3
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,616
I hope you won't be lonely.

4
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,017
{\an8}NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

5
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,067
{\an8}Lord Jung!

6
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,246
{\an8}Is it true
that you're leaving the Capital?

7
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,126
{\an8}Yes, I'm afraid it just happened that way.

8
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,420
{\an8}How can you be this indifferent?

9
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,632
{\an8}Despite my confessions of longing for you,

10
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,051
{\an8}you're leaving.

11
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,305
{\an8}Lady So-eun…

12
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,976
{\an8}Please don't leave.

13
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,025
My feelings for you
only just started to grow.

14
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,653
I've only just been made aware of them.

15
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,365
So how can you leave like this?

16
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,876
I apologize…

17
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,005
for not realizing…

18
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,759
your feelings for me.

19
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,274
It was a pleasure

20
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,610
to have…

21
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,239
met you.

22
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,443
Are you sure?

23
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,239
Yes, the farewell
would have brought anyone to tears.

24
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,409
Audacious, is it not?

25
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,078
A lady hoping to be the Crown Princess

26
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,539
has given her heart to another.

27
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,462
I hope you're not going
to let this grave piece of information

28
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,506
stay between just us.

29
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,261
What? I don't think I follow.

30
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,389
His Majesty is looking to join forces
with the Minister of Personnel

31
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,641
to regulate Lord Sangheon's authority.

32
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,479
Rumor has it that the Crown Prince
already met with Minister Shin's daughter.

33
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,191
Wait.

34
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,611
Are you saying
that she has already been chosen as

35
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,447
the future Crown Princess?

36
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,242
That all depends on you now.

37
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,833
The Minister of War's daughter is whom
Lord Sangheon wants as the Crown Princess.

38
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,795
This information would
surely grab his attention.

39
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,214
Do you not agree?

40
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,593
Gosh.

41
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,472
Are you saying

42
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:52,852
that the Minister of Personnel's daughter
harbors feelings for another man?

43
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,355
Yes, and if you give me the word,

44
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,942
I would gladly notify
the Queen Dowager this second.

45
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,571
I could even find a witness to present.

46
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,045
What is it that you want in return?

47
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,129
Pardon?

48
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,508
What I want in return?

49
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,052
If this matter is swayed in my direction,

50
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:30,681
I will make sure to repay you
in the capacity you desire.

51
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,739
This is the future Queen we're discussing.

52
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,366
A lady

53
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,245
who harbors feelings for another man?
The Crown Prince's tutor, no less?

54
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,708
I advise that it would be wise of you
to remove her name from the process

55
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,754
before this matter
causes serious problems.

56
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,635
It cannot end at just that.

57
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,017
As Your Highness implied,

58
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,355
the Minister of Personnel made a mockery
out of the royal family.

59
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,900
What is considered as
our nation's sacred event was discredited

60
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,363
so eliminating her
from the process cannot be enough.

61
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,574
Her being eliminated from the process

62
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,286
will let you choose
whomever you desire as Crown Princess,

63
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,037
so what more could you want?

64
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,666
The Minister of Personnel
put forth his daughter as a candidate

65
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:43,671
despite her transgression and therefore,
he should also answer for his crime.

66
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,348
APPEAL TO THE KING

67
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,894
It was I who ignored
my daughter's pleading

68
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,062
and entered her as a candidate

69
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,232
for the Crown Princess selection.

70
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,320
Please reprove this foolish father

71
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,574
for not realizing
where his daughter's heart lies.

72
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,913
How could this be your fault?

73
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,459
I let my greed get the best of me which
resulted in the loss of a loyal subject.

74
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,378
I am the one…

75
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,298
who should be blamed.

76
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,093
I will never be able

77
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,387
to seek forgiveness from Your Majesty,

78
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,391
His Royal Highness,
and the other officials.

79
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,496
It was I who ignored
my daughter's pleading

80
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,207
and entered her as a candidate

81
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,501
for the Crown Princess selection.

82
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,505
Please reprove this foolish father

83
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,050
for not realizing
where his daughter's heart lies.

84
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,762
Please, I beg you not to do this.

85
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,931
-Come on.
-Please don't do this.

86
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:21,018
I must hurry home. Lady So-eun awaits me!

87
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,104
Why you…

88
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,441
Screaming will not do you any good.
Nobody can help you anymore.

89
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,110
Your master has been demoted,

90
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,821
so who can possibly save you now?

91
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,489
Now, move.

92
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,241
Hurry along.

93
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,832
Who may you be
and what is with the imposing stance?

94
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,083
Step aside.

95
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:50,131
Must you indulge in such indecent behavior
within the Capital?

96
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,886
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

97
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,472
I thought you were busy
planning your wedding.

98
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,100
The period of your house arrest
must have been too short.

99
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,394
If it is what you desire,

100
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,564
I could see to it
that you never leave your house again.

101
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,568
I rested well thanks to you.

102
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,988
Sitting at home all day
almost gave me an itch that could kill.

103
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,783
However, it will not happen again

104
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,746
for I'm also dangling from the lifeline
that's around you.

105
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,125
Were you the one who informed
the Queen Dowager about

106
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,586
the Minister of Personnel's daughter?

107
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,506
It must have broken your heart

108
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,552
to have found out
about the involvement between your tutor

109
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,471
and the one you almost married.

110
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,475
Who knows? They could very well
be together at this said moment.

111
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,353
And might I remind you

112
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,648
that this girl belonged
to the family who mocked yours.

113
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,982
That being said,

114
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,362
it will be in your best interest
to just be about on your way.

115
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,823
I have unfinished business
with this girl, you see.

116
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,659
Off we go.

117
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,751
Let go of her.

118
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,878
Disobey my orders

119
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,215
and you will be taught
the weight of the law.

120
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,385
Are you threatening a royal relative

121
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,971
in the name of defending this lowlife?

122
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,265
She is one of my precious people.

123
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,311
I will not stand idly by when an attempt

124
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,981
to harm my people is being made.

125
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,652
Right, of course.

126
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,240
All right.

127
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,128
Are you all right?

128
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,505
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

129
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,466
I was headed
to the minister's residence myself,

130
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,843
so you may join me.

131
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,850
That reminds me!

132
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,185
I hope you're aware…

133
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,483
of Lord Sangheon's promise to reward me
for gaining the leverage on Minister Shin

134
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,736
which resulted in his demotion.

135
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,239
We should go.

136
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,377
I heard you saved my maid.

137
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,630
Words cannot possibly convey my gratitude.

138
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,011
I heard you will soon
be returning to your hometown.

139
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,597
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

140
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,391
I wronged you in the severest of ways

141
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,810
and should never be pardoned.

142
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,146
Hardly.

143
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,776
One's heart is not an object
that can be controlled at will.

144
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,823
That day,

145
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:08,829
I was grateful
for the honesty you displayed.

146
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,749
I say so…

147
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,252
as a coward who hid my feelings.

148
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,842
If it were not for these circumstances,

149
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,347
I even thought of how we could have been

150
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,891
good friends.

151
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,560
A friendship between

152
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,439
a man and a woman may not be possible,
but still.

153
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,653
Anyway…

154
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,908
I wish for your good health
and peaceful life.

155
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,422
My father will be home soon.

156
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,845
Please let him know
I send him my best regards…

157
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,058
and that I await the day we meet again.

158
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,299
Jan-i?

159
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,175
Jan-i!

160
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,677
Jan-i!

161
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,264
Oh, no. Jan-i…

162
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,892
Jan-i!

163
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,484
Oh, no…

164
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,404
Jan-i…

165
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,867
Jan-i…

166
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,703
No…

167
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,623
…and the one you almost married.

168
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,335
Who knows? They could very well
be together at this said moment.

169
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,010
Jan-i!

170
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,193
EPISODE 11

171
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,919
Damn it.

172
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,558
Your Royal Highness,
what brings you here of all places?

173
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,360
How dare you?

174
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,987
What is the meaning of this?

175
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,655
Why am I enraged?

176
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,740
Because a girl died.

177
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,201
An innocent girl died!

178
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,620
Why did you kill her?

179
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,288
She didn't do anything wrong! Why?

180
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,874
Let me go first…

181
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,758
Being the Crown Prince

182
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,178
doesn't give you the right
to disrespect your elder!

183
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,275
This time around,

184
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,238
I will not let your behavior slide.

185
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,281
Damn it.

186
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,875
I already told you everything.

187
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,544
It is true
that I passed the house at that hour,

188
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,629
but I did not kill anyone.

189
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,509
Who would be crazy enough
to kill a slave in broad daylight?

190
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:38,515
Why would I waste my time
and energy on a life worth nothing?

191
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,893
That's just preposterous.

192
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,521
Do you not agree?

193
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,232
Then how do you explain
the scratches on your face

194
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,361
and this jade button
that was found with the victim?

195
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,988
Oh, this?

196
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,907
That stings.

197
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,786
I already told you
that the lowlife scratched me.

198
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,413
She is as feisty as her lady.

199
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,791
How dare that wench harm a royal relative.

200
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,834
Right here.

201
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,544
Do you see this?

202
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,590
It is not I but she
who should be answering to her crime.

203
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,884
Death does not excuse anyone!

204
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,803
Talk about an unlucky day.

205
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,765
The girl was stabbed to death.

206
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,142
Have the coroner specify a murder weapon.

207
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:28,023
The killer's residence
must be thoroughly searched.

208
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,866
Hold on to these.

209
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,701
These are for the physician.

210
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,414
You will be all right now,
so do not worry.

211
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,833
Get in line, people!

212
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,087
Our physician hates
when people cut in line.

213
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,925
Is this where I can find
the acupuncturist from Hanyang?

214
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,510
Yes, you are in the right place.

215
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:01,473
From what I hear,
the physician has almost godly powers.

216
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,433
Yes, that is right. Now, get in line.

217
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,019
-But the line is too long.
-Please get in line.

218
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,813
Do not cut in line.

219
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,606
-Goodness.
-Goodness me.

220
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,983
Just how long is this line?

221
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,651
Get behind me, woman.

222
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,488
Do you remember
what I told you not to eat?

223
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,326
What was that? A fire poker?

224
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,871
No, food.
What are you not supposed to eat?

225
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
Food?

226
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,085
Yes, food. Meat and sugary food.
You must not consume those.

227
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,628
Fish?

228
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,884
No, meat. And also sugary food.

229
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,137
Right, I hear you.

230
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,141
My goodness.

231
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,562
My dear,

232
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,607
he said I should eat
a lot of meat and sugary food.

233
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,401
No, that's not…

234
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,654
Those are what you should not eat!

235
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,708
Can you wait here a second?

236
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,965
Have this brewed in warm water

237
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,884
and dab the itchy skin with it.

238
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,511
Oh, and make sure he doesn't scratch.

239
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,014
When the itch gets unbearable…

240
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,104
Count to five like so.

241
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,607
-All right.
-All right.

242
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,030
Thank you so much.

243
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,617
The pleasure is mine.

244
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,452
Can you wait over there?

245
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,037
-Sure.
-Good.

246
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,046
My lord, please.
You must get in line like the rest.

247
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,468
Hyun?

248
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,345
Ji-un.

249
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,597
I sure am glad to see you.

250
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,685
No wonder I dreamed of a snake
crawling into the yard.

251
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,020
I was foreseeing the visit
of a special someone.

252
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,606
Have a seat.

253
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,817
Here.

254
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,904
You can do it, right?
I'm putting my trust in you.

255
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,322
Next!

256
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,366
Goodness.

257
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,742
My goodness.

258
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,786
What…

259
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,206
What happened to your face?

260
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,750
Where did this happen to you?

261
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,548
Here. Take one.

262
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,562
How did you even find this place?

263
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,981
I got lost looking for it.

264
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,109
It sure was a hassle.

265
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,027
Gosh!

266
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,697
Will you stop with the mumbling
and grumbling, Lord Jaeun?

267
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,159
You sure grumble a lot
for someone who came here to lend a hand.

268
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,245
Lend a hand?
I only came by to see how you were.

269
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,873
If I had known it was this secluded,

270
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,292
I would have asked you
to meet me elsewhere.

271
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,251
Well…

272
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,545
The flowers are a beauty.

273
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,964
Even those with lingering diseases

274
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,176
leave this place
with their faces slightly flushed.

275
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,721
It must not be so bad here.

276
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,639
Of course. It's nice.

277
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,685
Clean water, fresh air, and good people.

278
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,314
If I had known about this place,
I would have come sooner.

279
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,860
I am glad to see that you are doing well.

280
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,832
The Crown Prince is well, right?

281
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,960
Is everything all right?

282
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,963
Don't worry about the palace.

283
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,471
By the way, your mother requested
that I deliver this to you.

284
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,474
My mother?

285
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,603
What weird object did she…

286
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,026
What is this?

287
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,153
A clairvoyant bodhisattva
wrote it for you.

288
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,988
She said you would know how to use it.

289
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,115
Unbelievable.

290
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,535
The so-called bodhisattva
of Mount Cheongryong.

291
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,161
She fell for his tricks again.

292
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,667
How about you take it instead?

293
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,711
You see, one must carry this
on his undergarment.

294
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,839
Go ahead. Let me help you attach it.

295
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,050
-Get that away from me.
-Come on. Don't be like this, Lord Jaeun.

296
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,137
A man engaged in state affairs
must stay healthy, don't you say?

297
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,097
Why you…

298
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,974
Get that away from me.

299
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,393
Come on. Don't be like that.

300
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,563
Allow me to attach it
to your undergarment, Lord Jaeun.

301
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,189
Get back here.

302
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,514
The flowers have bloomed beautifully.

303
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,234
I hope all went well
on your trip for the Ministry of Rites.

304
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,863
It did. Where I traveled was close to
where Royal Tutor Jung set up his clinic,

305
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,282
so I dropped by to see him.

306
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,662
I see.

307
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,670
He seemed well.

308
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,966
Staying healthy and keeping busy.

309
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,178
I am relieved to hear that.

310
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,894
How has it been for you,
Your Royal Highness?

311
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,523
What do you mean?

312
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,110
I know that you two grew quite close.

313
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,737
I thought you might be feeling lonely.

314
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,783
Not at all.

315
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,597
NOKUNGAK

316
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,466
<i>Wind chimes?</i>

317
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,635
The sounds they make

318
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,598
take me back to a moment in life I miss.

319
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,351
A time when I had no worries

320
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,395
and could spend all day doing nothing.

321
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,856
That moment in my childhood

322
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,234
is where I am taken to.

323
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,001
Don't they sound similar to this?

324
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,589
The sounds made
by the wind chimes which you enjoy.

325
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:02,847
That being said,
how about we clink our glasses once more.

326
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,350
Cheers!

327
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,091
The section chief of the Ministry of War
was found dead at the ministry office.

328
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,677
How has there not been a commotion

329
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,596
when a murder occurred
in a government office?

330
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,474
I presume it was
per Commander Yoon's orders.

331
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,105
In other words, it is His Majesty
who wishes to keep it quiet.

332
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,900
And regarding that,
one hopes to share information.

333
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,863
Un-am who took his own life recently,

334
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,574
the deceased Governor Kwon
of Hamgyong Province,

335
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,075
and now the section chief.

336
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,287
They all gave the decisive statements

337
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,873
during Preceptor Kang's interrogation
ten years ago.

338
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,002
Are you saying that someone
has been murdering them

339
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,546
to avenge the preceptor
who died ten years ago?

340
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,550
It will be in your best interest
to take precautions, my lord.

341
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,347
Look here. Step aside!

342
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,141
Make way.

343
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,149
Everybody, step aside.

344
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:37,984
Step aside.

345
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,350
What was that?

346
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,602
An assassin, my lord.

347
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,020
Take Lord Sangheon to safety!

348
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,280
Explain yourself!

349
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,869
What brings you here?

350
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,746
A suspicious man
attacked the Left State Councilor.

351
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,707
I will explain in due time.

352
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,084
Someone suspicious?

353
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,963
But no one is around.

354
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,848
I am also curious as to

355
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,184
what you are doing here
at this time of day, Commander Yoon.

356
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,107
I was patrolling outside the palace walls.

357
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,735
It surely is odd

358
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,030
for you to be on patrol
on this side of the gate.

359
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,575
Anyone suspicious
will be mine to apprehend,

360
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,118
so be on your way.

361
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,302
Kim Ga-on was able to get away.

362
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,639
I see.

363
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,891
You did well.

364
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,851
One must ask.

365
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,562
Do you still intend
to keep him in the palace?

366
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,731
It may endanger you as well.

367
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,485
Until I say otherwise,

368
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,196
keep a close eye on him.

369
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,489
I will not allow…

370
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,868
another soul to be hurt.

371
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,085
You are staring, Uncle.

372
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,172
A nephew visiting his uncle
is not all that surprising.

373
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:52,011
You are not one
to have come by without a reason.

374
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,101
Let me see.

375
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,729
His Royal Highness
must have put you up to this.

376
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,609
You were ordered to find out about
what happened to the girl named Jan-i.

377
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,863
I see you are not as dense
as you used to be.

378
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,241
That being said,

379
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,618
why did you kill the girl?

380
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,664
Since Lord Sangheon
is now looking out for you,

381
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,791
there will be no harm in telling me.

382
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,890
Do you really wish to know

383
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,059
why I did it?

384
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,529
Because I was angry.

385
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,947
Anger swept over me.

386
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,866
I could not take

387
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,869
seeing the Crown Prince
acting all righteously.

388
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,787
Still…

389
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,625
killing her was never my intention.

390
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,754
If anything, she is to blame
for harming a royal relative.

391
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,769
Gosh, that's bitter.

392
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,188
Absolutely bitter.

393
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,484
Bring me better food, damn it!

394
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,904
Anyway, eat up. Enjoy.

395
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,929
Damn it.

396
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,988
What?

397
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,449
Damn it.

398
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,210
What a relief.

399
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,179
Thank you…

400
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,724
for leading me to where it lies, Uncle.

401
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,583
That hurts.

402
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,419
Don't just stand there. Protect me.

403
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,921
It is the Crown Prince.
Sheathe your swords.

404
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,430
Damn it!

405
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,225
Now that I have evidence,

406
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,772
I doubt my grandfather can continue
to offer his protection.

407
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,657
I damaged the property
of the Minister of Personnel

408
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,119
and will accept
the punishment for my actions.

409
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,372
Anyone guilty of murder will be sentenced
to execution by beheading.

410
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,751
The deceased girl
was also one of the people.

411
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,171
Thus, your actions
should be dealt with accordingly.

412
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,215
Murder?

413
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,009
Surely you must not mean

414
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,846
that I, your uncle,
should pay for her life with mine.

415
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,604
It is common knowledge
that certain lives weigh more than others!

416
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,897
Are you saying…

417
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,691
that your life matters more

418
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,486
than the deceased girl's?

419
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,323
Well, isn't that common knowledge?

420
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,532
I am of royal blood

421
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,286
and the uncle to His Royal Highness.

422
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,123
If that is true,
then being the Crown Prince,

423
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,127
my life would be worth
much more than yours.

424
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,172
However, you carried out acts
that could harm me.

425
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,425
I don't quite follow.

426
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,969
Once at the royal hunting site

427
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,637
and once during my bath.

428
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,560
The girl had the audacity
to harm a man of royal blood.

429
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,230
She was as good as dead anyway!

430
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,609
If that can be said about her,

431
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,029
you could also be killed
right here as well.

432
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,285
No, wait.

433
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,704
Please do not tell me

434
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,916
you are not realizing
the severity of this matter

435
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,086
and are naive enough to believe
I would not kill my uncle.

436
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,922
No, wait.

437
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,468
Why are you doing this?

438
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,555
Your Royal Highness.

439
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,183
Please have mercy on me,
Your Royal Highness.

440
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,977
I was wrong.

441
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,105
If you wish to beg for your life,

442
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,317
do it in her presence, not mine.

443
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,487
Visit her grave

444
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,240
and bow for her forgiveness.

445
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,787
Do so, and I will at least
spare you your life…

446
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,499
and turn you over to the State Tribunal.

447
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,671
Wait. Hold on.

448
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,384
Did you just order me
to bow to a slave's grave?

449
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,803
Why?

450
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,431
Is it something you cannot do?

451
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,684
Of course not. I will heed your command.

452
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,311
I will do it.

453
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,502
<i>You had him kneel!</i>

454
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:28,134
You had a royal relative kneel
in front of a slave's grave.

455
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,303
How am I supposed
to understand this rash behavior?

456
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:36,267
Uncle abused his power as a royal relative

457
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,310
and took an innocent life.

458
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,729
I believed he should at least

459
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,649
atone and apologize for his actions.

460
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,819
He has been this way for years now.

461
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,320
You should have held back.

462
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,199
As the Crown Prince, it is your duty
to uphold the code of morals.

463
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,452
What brought on this lack of judgment?

464
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,329
It was not a misjudgment.

465
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,711
All I did was act dutifully.

466
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,757
I heeded Father's guidance
to serve our people

467
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,927
and Grandmother's guidance
regarding my duty

468
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,929
to uphold the dignity of our royal blood.

469
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,600
It is why

470
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,229
I do not feel
even the slightest bit ashamed.

471
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,356
-Crown Prince!
-This matter

472
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,734
will be mine to sort out.

473
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,570
You are dismissed.

474
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,116
Was this an act
to become a benevolent king?

475
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,744
You should have also kept in mind

476
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:22,164
that your actions
could provoke other royal relatives

477
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,333
and members of the nobility.

478
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,420
This nation only maintains its peace

479
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,715
because the law binding
different social classes

480
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,883
is never disrupted.

481
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,553
One who is next in line for the throne

482
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:40,266
should not disrupt that order
over the petty life of a slave.

483
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,894
A petty life, did you say?

484
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,313
What I mean is that you were wrong

485
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,525
to have gotten involved
in the murder of a lowly girl.

486
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,238
There is no such thing as a petty life.

487
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:58,325
And there is not a single person
who should die for no reason.

488
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,828
No one…

489
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,206
has the right to disregard another's life.

490
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,418
No one.

491
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,852
-The Crown Prince did what?
-You heard me.

492
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,731
Word has been traveling
all across the Capital.

493
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,191
The Crown Prince who made a mockery
out of his uncle.

494
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,613
Some are slandering him
for violating moral principles.

495
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,489
But only nobles, if you ask me.

496
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,284
People like us
could not be more satisfied.

497
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,787
Never have I ever been
this fond of a ruler before.

498
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,874
So what happened?

499
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,460
Insulting a royal relative

500
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,837
must have put His Royal Highness
in trouble.

501
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,508
You never seem intrigued
when it comes to the Capital,

502
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,428
but you prick up your ears
when the Crown Prince is mentioned.

503
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,096
Well…

504
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,415
I hope you are well,

505
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,834
Your Royal Highness.

506
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,258
Why are you outside
and not in bed sleeping?

507
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,978
Even when I am here,

508
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,190
all I do is think about you.

509
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,195
I am worried…

510
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,365
and I miss you.

511
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,786
Says the man who chose to move out here.

512
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,164
A place this secluded.

513
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,131
I wish to be by your side,

514
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,634
take you in my arms,

515
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,679
have conversations,

516
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,099
and be together with you.

517
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,011
Goodness.

518
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,931
Hello?

519
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,116
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

520
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,555
You came, Great Lord Changcheon.

521
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,187
You must have a good reason
for summoning me up here.

522
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,814
As if there must be one.

523
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,817
One only hoped
you would join me on a hunt.

524
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,112
Hunting does not intrigue me at all.

525
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:09,701
Especially a hunting trip
accompanied by royal relatives.

526
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,955
Yes, of course.

527
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,541
Prince Jehyeon is the apple
of His Majesty's eye,

528
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,877
so there is no reason
for you to go out hunting.

529
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,838
What are you trying to say?

530
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,176
Even game that's been caught in a trap

531
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:30,097
is not easy to retrieve
for the cowardly predator.

532
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,473
What?

533
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,816
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

534
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,735
These are the last words of Lord Changun.

535
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,696
Last words?

536
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:54,788
The humiliation induced by
the Crown Prince was unbearable for him.

537
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,666
How could this have happened?

538
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:02,004
I doubt I am the only one
who is devastated by his death.

539
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,173
Moral principles were violated.

540
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,969
A man of nobility knelt before a slave.

541
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,181
He was humiliated by his own nephew
which led him to take his own life.

542
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:19,229
Members of the nobility
cannot let this matter slide.

543
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,358
That reminds me.

544
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,986
I hear that your nephew

545
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,488
is the ritual manager
at the Royal Confucian Academy.

546
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,994
Confucian scholars are the ones
who have always corrected grave matters.

547
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,916
Please make sure this reaches your nephew.

548
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,795
It will serve us greatly.

549
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,012
Lord Changun, whom the Crown Prince
commanded to disrupt Confucianism order,

550
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,182
lamented over his humiliation
by taking his own life.

551
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,518
The Crown Prince is one
who should lead an exemplary life.

552
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,813
However, the entire nation is confused
and is feeling unsettled

553
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,399
over his decision
to disrupt the Confucian order.

554
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,401
The sinister way of humiliation

555
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,780
which led his uncle to death
has reached the heavens

556
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:15,243
and we are gravely worried
that its wrath will fall on the people.

557
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,538
If His Majesty wishes
to set order to the nation

558
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,957
and if he honors the Confucian law,

559
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,918
the wisest decision will be

560
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,046
to strip the Crown Prince of his title
and depose him.

561
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,839
Please punish the Crown Prince

562
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,009
for shaking the foundation
of the Confucian order.

563
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,220
-Please punish the Crown Prince.
-Please punish the Crown Prince.

564
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,429
Who was it?

565
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,390
Pardon?

566
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,518
Who was it
that rallied the Confucian scholars?

567
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,105
Well…

568
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,609
I am also flustered
by what is happening and--

569
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:53,031
Did you believe this would promote
Prince Jehyeon to Crown Prince?

570
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,744
I am lost for words
at your accusation, Your Majesty.

571
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,706
Please believe me
when I say I did not know.

572
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,624
It is common knowledge

573
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,711
that your nephew is the ritual manager
at the Royal Confucian Academy.

574
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,547
How long do you intend to deceive me?

575
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,967
My nephew may be the ritual manager

576
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,469
but who am I
to stop the Confucian scholars

577
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:18,014
from leaving their posts
to raise their concerns

578
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,518
regarding the disobedient act
against our class system?

579
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,033
What is the meaning of this?

580
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,788
You will see to it
that the scholars leave the gate.

581
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,956
Right now!

582
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,624
How dare you…

583
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,293
Deploy the soldiers, Your Majesty.

584
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,463
Those who are dishonoring
the Crown Prince on palace grounds

585
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,466
must be found guilty of treason!

586
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,926
Whether it is treason
or not is my decision to make.

587
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,722
I will see to this matter personally,
so I advise you to step away!

588
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,641
Apprehend those who led this strike
and hang their heads on a pike.

589
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,811
If necessary,
I will deploy the soldiers myself.

590
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,649
Anyone who speaks
of deposing the Crown Prince

591
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,028
shall have their mouths ripped open
and tongues cut off.

592
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,791
Explain this to me.

593
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,586
Why do you have the appeal regarding
the dethronement of the Crown Prince?

594
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,630
It speaks for itself.

595
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,758
His Royal Highness acted hastily.

596
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,968
It was a grave misjudgment on his part.

597
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,931
Is this why you met
with Great Lord Changcheon?

598
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,850
How could you do something like this?

599
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,020
Why are you orchestrating such defiance?

600
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:50,398
Until when will you
only take the Crown Prince's side?

601
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,818
It is time you face the facts.

602
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,195
Your uncle is dead.

603
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,533
And it is over for the Crown Prince.

604
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,370
Brother.

605
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,667
It was all supposed to be mine.

606
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:13,296
The palace was home to our father
who was the Crown Prince,

607
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,714
to me his eldest son,

608
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,469
you, and our mother.

609
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,137
Do not be this way.

610
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,849
Please stop this. Please.

611
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,519
Unfortunately, I cannot.

612
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:33,817
There is nothing I can do
to stop the scholars now.

613
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,165
Please dethrone the Crown Prince
and strip him of his title.

614
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,209
-Please dethrone him!
-Please dethrone him!

615
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,963
Punish the Crown Prince for shaking
the foundation of the Confucian order.

616
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:58,049
How can they be this cruel?

617
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,467
Have the Crown Prince

618
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,721
take responsibility for
the death of his own uncle.

619
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,848
-He must take responsibility.
-He must take responsibility.

620
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,648
What if you swallowed your pride

621
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,693
and asked His Majesty for forgiveness?

622
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:22,157
You don't know what
the outcome of this ordeal could be.

623
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,124
Do you two also think I went too far?

624
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,043
That's not it.

625
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,630
You were able
to hold yourself back until now.

626
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,465
But how come you couldn't this time?

627
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,800
I was going to.

628
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,595
I guess I could have.

629
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,058
But this time around, I did not want to.

630
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,813
She had her life taken from her
because she was of low birth…

631
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,234
and I had to die
because I was born a girl.

632
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,447
What makes us any different?

633
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,660
Your Royal Highness…

634
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,704
If I had turned a blind eye yet again,

635
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,206
then for another ten years…

636
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,541
No…

637
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,505
Until the end of my days,
my life would have been filled

638
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,049
with nothing more
than meaningless attempts

639
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,594
to stay alive.

640
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,224
What kind of a life would that be?

641
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,602
That thought crossed my mind.

642
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,067
Pretending not to see and hear things

643
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,611
for the sake of keeping
my place in the palace?

644
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,156
What meaning is there in that?

645
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,622
The scholars' reactions…

646
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,667
prove to me

647
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,129
that the code our people live by

648
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,216
has not changed since I was born.

649
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,886
You did well, Your Royal Highness.

650
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,019
The Crown Princess Consort

651
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,440
would not have wanted your life
to be like that.

652
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,235
If she had been alive,

653
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:23,945
she would have said

654
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,740
that you were right

655
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,076
and that you acted properly.

656
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,414
So please do not be hard on yourself.

657
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,084
Eunuch Hong and I

658
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:42,088
will always stand by you,
Your Royal Highness.

659
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,976
JASEONDANG

660
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,467
Hyun?

661
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,766
I see you have
yet to turn in for the night.

662
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,606
How can one sleep
with all the commotion outside?

663
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,779
I feel ashamed.

664
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,992
You always seem to catch me
in these embarrassing moments.

665
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,166
There is something I must confess to you.

666
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:07,799
I met you for the first time
when I was 14.

667
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:13,555
Your two eyes were deep
and as clear as the clearest of seas.

668
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,266
However, what filled them…

669
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,102
was an unexpected level of caution.

670
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,898
How could I not recognize your eyes

671
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,192
when you are like a brother to me?

672
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,822
Your face, your voice,

673
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,074
and even your gait were the same,

674
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,201
but…

675
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,538
you weren't the young prince
I grew up with.

676
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,920
All this time,

677
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,800
you knew everything?

678
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,345
I was confused at first

679
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,057
and then fear overwhelmed me.

680
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,062
And when I met you once again,

681
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,899
I wanted to protect you.

682
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,155
The child who practiced archery all night
despite the blisters on her hands.

683
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,782
The child who rose to her feet

684
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,118
even when the fall broke her bone.

685
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,164
The child who was left alone

686
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,834
in a world that would bring her
unimaginable suffering.

687
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,090
I made a promise to myself
that I would protect that child.

688
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,052
Hyun…

689
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,610
If you are dethroned,

690
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,696
the only thing that
awaits you would be death.

691
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,784
Even if you are lucky enough
not to be deposed,

692
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:01,955
how do you expect to manage
the many hardships that lie in your way?

693
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:07,794
You may have been able to fool others
into believing you are a man until now,

694
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,004
but it will not be as easy moving forward.

695
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,465
I am sure you are aware

696
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:17,512
of how this revelation
could cost you your life.

697
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,726
What is it…

698
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:32,402
that you actually want to say to me?

699
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:39,200
Do you remember how I said that
the sea awaits at the far end of the path

700
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,287
you weren't able to once take?

701
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,417
Currently docked there
is a boat with big sails.

702
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,463
You should leave on it.

703
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,758
Wherever you wish to go,

704
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,553
I will be by your side.

705
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,799
APPEAL TO THE KING

706
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,183
APPEAL TO THE KING

707
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:41,168
