1
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,587
{\an8}How could this happen?

2
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,514
Your Highness.

3
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,251
LONGING

4
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,133
May I ask
what you are doing here all alone?

5
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,848
Well…

6
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,686
I wanted to get some fresh air
after my reading,

7
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,062
so I came out for a walk.

8
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,154
Does this belong to you?

9
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,864
What?

10
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,366
That…

11
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,659
NOT

12
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,662
Yes. That's mine.

13
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,373
Only commoners play
with something like this.

14
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,083
How did you get this?

15
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,632
There you are, my lord.

16
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,433
So tell me.

17
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,562
Were you able to see her off?

18
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,941
Yes, my lord.

19
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,822
I suggest you go back to your quarters.

20
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,244
His Majesty made it clear that
you were to stay in your quarters.

21
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,081
Yes, he did.

22
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,586
Wait.

23
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,925
Yes?

24
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,552
Why are you in such a hurry?

25
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,931
You should take what's yours.

26
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,850
Right.

27
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,852
Okay.

28
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,146
NOT

29
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,114
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.

30
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,538
We must go back, Your Highness.

31
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,790
I have been looking all over for you.

32
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,251
Escort him to his quarters now.

33
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,089
He is not to leave his room today.

34
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,966
-Do you understand?
-Pardon?

35
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,303
Oh. Yes, my lord.

36
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,032
NOT

37
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,661
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,707
I was really going to come back
right after I gave him these.

39
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,794
I'll tell on you
once His Highness returns.

40
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,214
I'll tell him how you snuck out
when you were supposed to stay inside.

41
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,972
Hey, Bok-dong.

42
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,390
Bok-dong.

43
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,715
Mother, I wasn't informed
that you would be stopping by.

44
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,725
Who else knows about this?

45
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,479
Pardon? What do you mean?

46
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,981
That this child here

47
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,109
swapped clothes with my son.

48
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,987
Who else knows about this?

49
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,988
Please spare us.

50
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,867
The Prince, Dam-i, and I
are the only ones who know.

51
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,203
Please forgive me.
I was just following the Prince's order.

52
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,503
As of this moment, you are…

53
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,798
the Prince.

54
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,475
You…

55
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,061
cannot speak of this to anyone.

56
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,192
You have to take this secret to the grave.

57
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,737
Do you understand me?

58
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,832
EPISODE 2

59
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,168
My dear Prince…

60
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,363
Where are you going, Your Highness?

61
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,906
Your Highness.

62
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,576
Your Highness!

63
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,120
Your Highness.

64
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,706
Your Highness.

65
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,832
Your Highness!

66
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,588
Your Highness, what are you going to do?

67
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,298
I will go back to where I belong.

68
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,142
It's the Crown Princess.

69
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,408
It is my understanding
that you have the girl's body.

70
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,827
I am a parent who lost her daughter.

71
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,706
Nothing can stop me now.

72
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,083
-I must see her body.
-Why?

73
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,670
Do you not trust your man, Jung Seok-jo?

74
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,133
I was under the impression that

75
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,804
he wouldn't hesitate to kill even my child
if you ordered him to do so.

76
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,376
You can take her with you
if that will help you feel reassured.

77
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,505
I brought her into the world.
So naturally,

78
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,966
she must carry some of your blood as well.

79
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,677
So you can send her off

80
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,097
yourself.

81
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,557
No parent

82
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,728
wants to hurt their child.

83
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,107
Everything I am doing is
for you and our family's sake.

84
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,819
Find it in your heart to let this go.

85
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,890
{\an8}PASSAGE GRANTED

86
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,810
Go ahead.

87
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,160
-I-wol, wait up.
-Wait up.

88
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,913
What took you so long?
I thought you left without me.

89
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,166
-Excuse me.
-Goodness.

90
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,460
Are you I-wol?

91
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,586
Do you know me?

92
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,424
Of course. Don't you work with Dam-i?

93
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,218
Can you give this
to Dam-i when you go back?

94
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,224
My name is Jung Ji-un. Wait, no.
Tell her "<i>Zuo Zhuan</i>." Then, she'll know.

95
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,978
I'm sorry I can't do that.

96
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,064
I need your help.
I want to give it to her in person,

97
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,441
but I can't go inside.

98
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,609
Can you please give this letter to her?

99
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:20,114
It's not that.
Dam-i isn't at the palace anymore.

100
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,575
She's not at the palace?

101
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,076
She disappeared.

102
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,413
And no one knows where she went either.

103
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,250
What do you mean?

104
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,343
She left to attend
the banquet for the elderly,

105
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,678
but never came back.

106
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,140
No one including
the court ladies and maids

107
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,766
has seen her.

108
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>It's not like she has
a place to go outside the palace.</i>

109
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,276
Father.

110
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,530
Were you at the palace?

111
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,866
Yes.

112
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,368
I wanted to see my friend.

113
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,412
Are you talking about the court maid?

114
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,125
Father, I have a favor to ask you.

115
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,922
The next time you are at the palace,
could you ask around about my friend?

116
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,383
No one has seen her
after the banquet for the elderly.

117
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,638
You might have better luck finding her
as you are an inspector.

118
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,517
Do you think tracking down
a mere maid is my job?

119
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,936
-That's not what I meant.
-Never…

120
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,064
bring her up in front of me again.
Do you understand?

121
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,653
Did you not eat anything all day?

122
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,003
Eat.

123
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,881
Eat even if
rice tastes like sand in your mouth.

124
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,008
And drink water even if it tastes like

125
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,302
bitter medicine.

126
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,638
I don't want to.

127
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,727
I hate everything.

128
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,024
If you give up now,

129
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,109
it will mean death
for everyone around you.

130
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,861
Including you and me.

131
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,071
Everyone.

132
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,796
Are you awake?

133
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,547
Let us bring in water for your face.

134
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,424
<i>Starting now,</i>

135
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,761
<i>Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong
will be taking care of you.</i>

136
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,929
<i>So do not worry.</i>

137
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,937
<i>-Maids will bring water and help you wash</i>
-Please stop.

138
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,480
<i>in the morning.</i>

139
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,024
<i>You don't have to do a thing.</i>

140
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,985
<i>-Let the maids handle everything.</i>
-Your Highness.

141
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,410
<i>Your schedule is fairly simple.</i>

142
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,454
<i>Every morning,
you will go to the King's quarters</i>

143
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,499
<i>as well as the Queen's quarters
to offer your greetings.</i>

144
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,795
<i>And then, you will come to our quarters
to say hello to the Crown Prince and me.</i>

145
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,475
-Oh, my back.
-<i>The Prince is here.</i>

146
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,109
I was concerned when I heard
you weren't feeling well for a while.

147
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,653
Are you feeling better now?

148
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,866
Yes. I am sorry
to have caused you to worry.

149
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,368
Is it because you've been sick recently?

150
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,039
You don't sound as strong as before.

151
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,958
No, Your Majesty. I am perfectly fine.

152
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,842
This isn't good.

153
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,304
I will have one of my people to deliver
some tonics to get your energy up.

154
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,349
Make sure to drink it every day.

155
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,935
Yes, Your Majesty.

156
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,520
It's time for the morning assembly.

157
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,607
This is enough for morning greetings.
You may all leave now.

158
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,683
I keep stepping on my robe
as it is too long.

159
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,685
And this is too big for my head.

160
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,854
I will get them altered today.

161
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,072
No, not there. It's that way.

162
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,240
The other way around.

163
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:14,755
Your Highness,
I have the herbal tonics from the Queen.

164
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,520
It is hot. So please be careful.

165
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,399
Hot!

166
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,528
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

167
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,239
Oh, no.

168
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,075
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
I'll go and bring another bowl.

169
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,625
Are you all right? Gosh, it's my fault.

170
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,837
No. I'm all right.

171
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,756
Don't worry about this.

172
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,424
Bok-dong.

173
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,720
Did you ask for me?

174
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,557
Get some ointment from the royal pharmacy.

175
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,893
-Pardon?
-Hurry.

176
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,566
Your Highness.

177
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,991
Please forgive me. It was my mistake.

178
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,377
You may all leave.

179
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,513
The cut was deep.
Please call a physician for her.

180
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,597
There's no need.

181
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,853
It is not your place to worry about her
even if her finger is wounded or severed.

182
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,523
She was hurt because of me
because I dropped the bowl.

183
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,441
No.

184
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,777
It was her fault.

185
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,447
So you are never to apologize.

186
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,741
You are not to worry about other people.

187
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,367
Think only about yourself.

188
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,370
You are not to care
about what others think of you.

189
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,747
That's what it means…

190
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,876
to be the Prince.

191
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,296
There's no need to show respect to others

192
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,256
or feel bad for them.

193
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,885
The only people you will show respect to

194
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,763
are the King and the Crown Prince.

195
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,016
Do you understand that?

196
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,935
But…

197
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,063
Why must I do that?

198
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,691
That's not how I want to live.

199
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,401
It is only fair that

200
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,780
I apologize to whoever
deserves my apology when I'm at fault.

201
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,907
No matter what my title may be.

202
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,963
They must know their place.

203
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,966
Make them fear you.

204
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:09,471
So don't let them get close to you.

205
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,267
Only then will you survive.

206
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,822
Even your shoulders.

207
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,366
And your stance must be wider.

208
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,325
Who are you?

209
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,121
It's me, Hyun.

210
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,873
Hyun?

211
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,173
Are you training together?

212
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,884
No. Does this look like training to you?

213
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,721
As the Prince's good cousin,
Prince Jaeun, is here,

214
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,849
I will bring some refreshments right away.

215
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,309
No. That won't be necessary.

216
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,064
Sorry. I may have been out of line
with my prank.

217
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,526
By the way, what brings you here?

218
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,111
Isn't it obvious why I'm here?

219
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,488
Your birthday is around the corner.

220
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,575
So I came to ask you what you would like

221
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,368
for your birthday.

222
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,788
My birthday?

223
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,739
He's the brother of the King
and the son of Queen Consort An,

224
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,407
Lord Hyeonun.

225
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,951
Congratulations, Your Highness.

226
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,248
Lord Geumjeong of the Sinbin Kang clan.

227
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,500
Congratulations, Your Highness.

228
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,097
They are the sons
of the late Prince Dohyeon.

229
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,600
They are Prince Wonsan
and Prince Jaeun respectively.

230
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,101
You met him before.

231
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,230
Congratulations.

232
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,317
Thank you.

233
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,277
I hope you aren't confused today.

234
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,696
It's me, Hyun.

235
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,990
I was merely goofing around that day.

236
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,785
What were you confused about?

237
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,500
Hello.

238
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,636
Congratulations.

239
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,477
This fine weather today must be proof

240
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,105
that everything on Earth

241
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,441
is celebrating your birthday.

242
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,237
Thank you.

243
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,533
It is a true honor to witness

244
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,786
such magnificent growth in you.

245
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,170
<i>It is my understanding
that you have the girl's body.</i>

246
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,468
<i>Everything I am doing is
for you and our family's sake.</i>

247
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,262
Find it in your heart to let this go.

248
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,142
Please remember that

249
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,812
the fate of Joseon solely relies on you.

250
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,190
I will devote my life to serving you

251
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,736
just as I have been doing so far.

252
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,249
Anxiety is getting to you.

253
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,086
You received enough guests for today.
It's best we stop here now.

254
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,053
I can handle it.

255
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,432
The son of Jung Seok-jo, an inspector
at the Office of the Inspector General,

256
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,851
asks to have an audience with you.

257
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,811
Let him in.

258
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,585
My name is Jung Ji-un,
the son of Inspector Jung Seok-jo

259
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,629
at the Office of the Inspector General.

260
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,465
Thank you for granting me
a private audience with you.

261
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,858
I heard that your birthday is today.

262
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,362
This may sound impudent,

263
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:22,033
but after hearing about
how excellent you are from a girl I knew,

264
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,745
I wanted to meet you in person
and wish you a happy birthday.

265
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,585
From what she told me,
you aren't authoritative

266
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,087
or arrogant,

267
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,674
but a generous prince
with a loving heart for his subjects.

268
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,926
So ever since that day,

269
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:44,097
I have been hoping that one day,
I would be able to serve you by your side.

270
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,358
I'll soon be going to Ming for my studies.

271
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,028
And I will do my best there

272
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,907
to keep this promise to you and return
as a subject you will be proud of.

273
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,369
Please stay healthy until then.

274
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,516
Wait.

275
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,443
Is the girl you mentioned

276
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,863
a girl named Dam-i?

277
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,492
Do you know her?

278
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,670
LONGING, NOT

279
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,299
She told me to give these to you
if I ever met you.

280
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,070
LONGING, NOT

281
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:27,158
She told me they would help you
stay strong when things get hard…

282
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,620
just like…

283
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,374
they had been helpful for her.

284
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,626
By any chance,

285
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,672
do you know where she went?

286
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,509
I do not know.

287
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,306
Please let me escort you out.

288
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,520
LONGING, WAIT

289
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,491
LONGING, WAIT

290
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,109
Your Highness!

291
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,905
Your Highness!

292
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,324
Your Highness!

293
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:57,308
Aren't you the inspector
who was looking for Dam-i that day?

294
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,191
Please excuse me.

295
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,540
Dam-i hasn't come back to the palace
after the party for the elderly.

296
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,502
I was wondering if you met her that day.

297
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,425
I'm not sure where she is.
I hadn't seen her either.

298
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,221
I see.

299
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,142
Thank you for your time.

300
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,436
Wait.

301
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,480
Do you think you can help me?

302
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,482
Pardon?

303
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,735
I was actually looking
for someone to help me.

304
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,498
That girl…

305
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,985
Where are we going?

306
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,863
The court maid will be looking for me.

307
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,616
I should be going back to my post.

308
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,924
We're here.

309
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,231
Why are you doing this? Please spare me.

310
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,025
I'm sorry. I'll make it quick.

311
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,862
No!

312
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,740
No, Father. Please.

313
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,659
What are you doing here?

314
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,452
Why are you trying to kill her?

315
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,371
What did she do?

316
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,373
This has nothing to do with you. Move.

317
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,666
Father!

318
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,961
Stop it, Father. Please!

319
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,046
Move!

320
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,840
Father!

321
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,259
Father!

322
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,325
No!

323
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,864
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

324
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,325
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

325
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,869
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

326
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,037
Your Highness.

327
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,167
Where is the Prince?

328
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,045
No news yet.
We searched the Prince's quarters,

329
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,546
but to no avail.

330
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,427
We must find the child
before anyone finds out.

331
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,764
If something happens to that child too,

332
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,392
I will never forgive myself.

333
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:13,022
Please do not worry.
Everything will be all right.

334
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,191
No!

335
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,110
No, Father. Please.

336
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,154
Why are you trying to kill her?
What did she do?

337
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,573
This has nothing to do with you. Move.

338
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,033
Father!

339
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,869
Stop it, Father. Please!

340
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,329
Move!

341
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:19,964
No!

342
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,211
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

343
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,380
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

344
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,174
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

345
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,718
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

346
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,306
Eunuch Hong,
why don't you go there and check?

347
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,475
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

348
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,560
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

349
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,188
-Where are you?
-Your Highness!

350
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,106
Your Highness!

351
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,822
Where are you?

352
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,367
Your Highness!

353
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,286
Where are you, Your Highness?

354
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,043
-Where are you?
-Your Highness!

355
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,711
Your Highness! Where are you?

356
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,965
Your Highness!

357
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,593
Your Highness!

358
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,471
Your Highness!

359
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,818
What are you doing here?
Go and find the Prince now.

360
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,322
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

361
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,829
My heart breaks for the Prince.

362
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,833
She must have been so scared.

363
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,421
I wouldn't have lasted a day
if I were in her shoes.

364
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,840
The Prince's own grandfather
had him killed.

365
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,177
Being forced to live around those people

366
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,138
must have taken a toll on her.

367
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,891
But I couldn't do anything
to lessen her burden.

368
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,936
All I did was cry
in front of her out of fear.

369
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:53,742
You must be brave for the Prince.

370
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,079
The day the King finds out the truth,

371
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,541
it will be the death of everyone.

372
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,217
I'm here.

373
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,433
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

374
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,437
What on earth happened?

375
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,487
Everything is my fault.

376
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,572
Everything.

377
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,160
The Prince and I-wol died

378
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,246
because of me.

379
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,713
Please stop crying.

380
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,466
This isn't your fault.

381
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,427
Everything that's happened

382
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,056
is not your fault, Your Highness.

383
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,905
The moon tonight is bright indeed.

384
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,745
When I was pregnant with you,
I had a dream.

385
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,834
A very big moon slid under my dress.

386
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:12,089
And the moon split
into two beautiful pearls.

387
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,217
One of the pearls was your brother.

388
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,886
And the other pearl

389
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,806
was probably you.

390
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,978
I was happy…

391
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,273
when I had you and your brother.

392
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,859
I was

393
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,903
truly happy.

394
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,282
How come…

395
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,536
you are not scolding me?

396
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,083
I ran away.

397
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,670
Why are you not scolding me?

398
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,550
Because you came back.

399
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:02,097
You came back to your mother.

400
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,603
I-wol…

401
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,773
is dead.

402
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,320
I cannot

403
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,614
forgive the man

404
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,825
who killed I-wol.

405
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:27,081
And now, that boy…

406
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,711
I will not be able to forgive anyone now.

407
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,226
Then don't.

408
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,606
Be it hatred or resentment.
I do not care what it is.

409
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,234
Learn to live with it.

410
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,071
As long as it gives you the will to live,

411
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,990
it is enough.

412
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,329
I will

413
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,416
be responsible for everything.

414
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,128
I will only ask you

415
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,380
to live.

416
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,967
Live…

417
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,761
even if your heart is burdened.

418
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,390
Mother.

419
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,942
Thank you…

420
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,362
for calling me Mother after everything.

421
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,615
I am…

422
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,869
truly grateful.

423
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,254
Never forget…

424
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,924
that you are the Prince.

425
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,103
You are special.

426
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,524
Your life is the most precious.

427
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,360
You are the chosen one.

428
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,196
Mother.

429
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,241
I'm sorry.

430
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:12,663
I promised to always protect you.

431
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,833
But I won't be able to keep that promise.

432
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,797
I failed you as your mother
and made your life

433
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,841
harder than it had to be.

434
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,428
And…

435
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,391
thinking about how you are forced

436
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:35,310
to live in this endless pain…

437
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,607
I'm filled with regret.

438
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,862
But I believe in you.

439
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,490
And that…

440
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:53,453
if there's anyone
who can do this, it's you.

441
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,677
Remember what I told you?

442
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,471
You are…

443
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,100
very special.

444
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,269
Don't forget that.

445
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,523
My beautiful…

446
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,028
daughter.

447
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,989
Mother.

448
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,744
Mother.

449
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,296
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

450
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,763
Your Royal Highness.

451
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,890
Leave us.

452
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,393
I want to be alone
with the Crown Princess.

453
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:09,488
Mother. Please, Mother…

454
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,742
Mother.

455
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,963
I have one wish, Your Royal Highness.

456
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,676
Please protect

457
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,928
the Prince…

458
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,307
our child.

459
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,967
-Your Highness.
-Mother…

460
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,136
Mother…

461
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,181
Mother.

462
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,934
Mother.

463
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,769
-Your Highness!
-Mother…

464
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,808
All who are present!

465
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,562
Bow down four times!

466
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,244
{\an8}10 YEARS LATER

467
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,121
Move!

468
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,165
Get out of my way!

469
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,334
Clear the way!

470
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,297
Open the door! This is urgent.

471
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,970
Your Royal Highness, this is Bok-dong.

472
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,056
Did you get it?

473
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,391
Yes. Right here.

474
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,574
That's silk.

475
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:07,541
Yes, Your Royal Highness. I wasn't able
to find the one made with cotton.

476
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,959
Please accept it for now.

477
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,669
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

478
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,380
When a new maid was cleaning my room,

479
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,674
she threw out all the cotton covers.

480
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,991
Only do the tasks given to you.

481
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,203
Don't do anything that you aren't sure of.

482
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,205
That's the rule here

483
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,249
in my quarters.

484
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,485
SAMGAEBANG

485
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,113
Do you know how Samgaebang came about?

486
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,240
-What?
-What? How?

487
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:49,577
You see, we have
a very important man here.

488
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,455
This distinguished man passed

489
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,000
the state exam at the age of 15!

490
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,503
He is the legendary man who saved
the Vice Minister of Rites of the Ming

491
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,005
with his miraculous touch.

492
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:03,049
He saved the Vice Minister's life? How?

493
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,593
-How did he do that?
-Tell us.

494
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,803
Let me.

495
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,227
This incident took place
in the most famous inn

496
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,812
<i>in Yanjing.</i>

497
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:20,775
<i>The Vice Minister played a major role
in the Emperor's succession to the throne.</i>

498
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,861
<i>And food got stuck in his throat…</i>

499
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,821
<i>-My goodness.
-Oh, no!</i>

500
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,365
<i>…when he was having a meal.</i>

501
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,159
<i>Goodness.</i>

502
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,411
Sir, what's wrong?

503
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,455
-Are you okay?
-Sir, what's wrong?

504
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,458
-Sir!
-I think something's stuck in his throat!

505
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,713
-Oh, no! What do we do?
-Innkeeper!

506
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,590
What are you doing? Come over here!

507
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,467
Someone help!

508
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,261
Hurry! We need some help!

509
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,846
What is stuck in his throat?

510
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,016
-Are you okay?
-What are you doing? Do something!

511
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,856
Sir!

512
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,068
Who was that?

513
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,570
Get him!

514
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,801
Knock him down!

515
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,678
Who sent you?

516
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,072
He survived.

517
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,340
Wait.

518
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,516
Are you from Joseon?

519
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,813
Yes.

520
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,275
I'm also from Joseon.

521
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,569
I don't know how to thank you for this.

522
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:31,197
Don't thank me.
I just did what anyone would do.

523
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,118
The man you just saved
is the Vice Minister of Rites.

524
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,328
You saved an important man's life.

525
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,457
I'm sure the Emperor
will give you a grand reward.

526
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,584
Everyone's life is important.

527
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,879
I would have done the same thing
even if he turned out

528
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:50,300
to be a beggar on the street,
not the Vice Minister of Rites.

529
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,304
Bye.

530
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,521
"I would have done the same thing."

531
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,524
-He sounds so cool.
-How impressive.

532
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,652
All right.
Let me tell you who this man is now.

533
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,653
-Who is it?
-Who?

534
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,322
-It's…
-Who is it?

535
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,491
Physician Jung!

536
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,161
Physician Jung!

537
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,370
Where is Physician Jung?

538
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,498
Come out now!

539
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,707
What's wrong?

540
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,418
Remember? We went
to the Minister of Personnel's house.

541
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,922
His daughter's face is totally ruined.
It's a disaster.

542
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,967
Physician Jung!

543
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,303
Move!

544
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,680
-Move out of the way.
-Step back!

545
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,391
-Be quiet.
-Gosh.

546
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,860
Where is the physician?

547
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,286
What's going on out here?

548
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,330
What?

549
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,873
-Ji-un.
-Ji-un.

550
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,434
One out of a hundred faces side effects.
It's rare, but it happens.

551
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,353
And I'm the unlucky one?

552
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:30,149
Don't worry. It will go away in half a day
once you take the medicine I give you.

553
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,527
Okay. Let me see.

554
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:36,531
Where is the herb for a rash?

555
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,376
-Jil-geum.
-Yes.

556
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,797
What is it?

557
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,593
Go to the herb storage and bring me
dried blackish yellow flowers.

558
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,929
Those flowers?

559
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,726
We don't have any.

560
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,189
Of course, we do.
Check the third shelf on the right.

561
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,524
We don't.

562
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,902
We don't?

563
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,162
Give me five days.

564
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,457
Once I get the herbs,
I'll give you the medicine right away.

565
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,381
-Yeong-ji.
-Yeong-ji.

566
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,925
You have until the end of today.

567
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,178
If you fail, I can't promise

568
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,015
your shop or that girl will be safe.

569
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,976
Is that clear?

570
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,906
Damn it!

571
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,709
Bullseye!

572
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:52,518
He sure makes one arrogant Crown Prince.

573
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,396
Something must be wrong with my arrows.

574
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,983
He has his maternal grandfather to thank.
Without his grandfather,

575
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,319
he wouldn't have been the Crown Prince.

576
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,822
The Queen has the King
wrapped around her little fingers.

577
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,657
So he only adores Prince Jehyeon.

578
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,162
That explains his need to compensate.

579
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,005
Please watch your tongue, Uncle.

580
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,008
This isn't a private gathering.

581
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,594
What? So what if people hear us?

582
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,888
I wasn't making stuff up anyway.

583
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,646
You know what?
I should catch one of those deers,

584
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:40,942
so I can get on
the good side of Lord Sangheon.

585
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,238
Who knows? He might prefer

586
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,865
a man of vigor like me

587
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,493
to someone
who looks like a delicate flower.

588
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,187
That hurts!

589
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,065
Who did that?

590
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,942
What crazy bastard…

591
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,784
You said you wanted
to catch something for my grandfather.

592
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,293
The next time
you are rash with your words,

593
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,045
I will not let it slide

594
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,382
even if you are my uncle.

595
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,450
So you want to play this game?

596
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,853
What?

597
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,443
What on earth?

598
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,945
He looks like a girl.

599
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,521
What?

600
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,477
{\an8}<i>The Crown Prince has vanished?</i>

601
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:53,439
{\an8}<i>We must find the Crown Prince
before anyone else does.</i>

602
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,232
{\an8}-Jump.
-What?

603
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,359
{\an8}<i>A court maid at the royal hunting?</i>

604
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,112
{\an8}<i>She had fair skin, a delicate face,
and dark brown hair.</i>

605
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,322
{\an8}<i>An assassin?</i>

606
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:03,699
{\an8}<i>An assassin attacked the Crown Prince?</i>

607
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,744
{\an8}-Hyun?
-<i>Why did you spare the man</i>

608
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:09,205
{\an8}<i>who saw you at the royal hunting?</i>

609
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,291
{\an8}<i>I must kill him. I will.</i>

610
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:15,961
{\an8}What is your name?

611
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:20,132
{\an8}<i>-My name is Jung Ji-un.</i>
-<i>My name is Jung Ji-un.</i>

612
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:25,221
