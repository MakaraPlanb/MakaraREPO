1
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,765
{\an8}Thirteen!

2
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,434
{\an8}Fourteen!

3
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,270
{\an8}-Fifteen!
-Yeong-ji.

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,897
{\an8}Sixteen!

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,441
{\an8}-Let me face the punishment.
-Seventeen!

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,860
{\an8}Eighteen!

7
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,613
{\an8}-My lord! They don't know anything!
-Nineteen!

8
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,655
{\an8}-I gave them the orders.
-Twenty!

9
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,615
{\an8}Get him out!

10
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,327
{\an8}No! Please, my lord! No, Jil-geum!

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,121
{\an8}No, my lord! Please stop.

12
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,666
{\an8}Yeong-ji!

13
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,545
{\an8}I must go back to them.

14
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,089
{\an8}Let go of me. Please…

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,550
{\an8}No…

16
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,487
Did you send out the soldiers, Father?

17
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,823
Yes, I did.

18
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,205
They have done nothing wrong.

19
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,457
Please release them.

20
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,418
They were following my orders.

21
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,962
I'm sure they were.

22
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,422
After all,
you were the physician at Samgaebang.

23
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,133
Then…

24
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,344
you're punishing them
despite knowing everything?

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,682
-Why would you do that?
-I only want one thing

26
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,142
from you.

27
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,353
That you have a proper job at the palace.

28
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,608
Starting now,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,487
If you do, your friends will be safe.

30
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,785
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

31
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,133
I hear you come
with glorious recommendations.

32
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,176
I look forward to…

33
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,812
I will be your tutor starting from today.
I am Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

34
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,860
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,280
It's a great honor to meet you again,
Your Royal Highness.

36
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,951
I told you I wouldn't be lenient with you
if we ever met again.

37
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,077
Have you forgotten it?

38
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,079
How could I forget?

39
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,249
However, I cannot disobey a royal command.

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,543
I have been appointed by His Majesty.

41
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,129
So I have been put
in charge of your lectures.

42
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,758
Please forgive what I did that day.

43
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,304
Now, let us begin
with the <i>Classic of Poetry</i>.

44
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,820
You want me to revoke
my appointment of a new royal tutor?

45
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,740
Yes. Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un

46
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,118
comes from a noble family,
but he operated a clinic named Samgaebang.

47
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,870
With his devious acupuncture skills,

48
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,457
he tricked noblewomen and noblemen.

49
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,627
On top of that,
from what I hear, he covets wealth.

50
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,339
And at times, he sneaks into the palace
and befriends court maids.

51
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,424
His behaviors are known to be crude.

52
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,302
I cannot respect him as my tutor.

53
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,597
Please reconsider, Father.

54
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,354
The royal tutor in question was
recommended by the Left State Councilor.

55
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,690
Do you have any proof for your claim?

56
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,657
Please interrogate Chief Gu Chun-saeng

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,034
and the court maids
in charge of embroidery.

58
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,456
EPISODE 4

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,918
My duty is
to guard your quarters, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,338
I would never secretly bring in
an outsider to the palace.

61
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,550
I would never do such a thing,
Your Majesty.

62
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,014
A female physician performed acupuncture
on me as I was feeling fatigued,

63
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,808
but I have never met
a physician from Samgaebang.

64
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,853
On top of that,
I heard the physician from Samgaebang

65
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,355
is currently imprisoned
at Hanseong Magistracy.

66
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,650
How can he be locked up and be
at the royal institute at the same time?

67
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,327
You may all leave.

68
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,550
Father, they are all lying.

69
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,136
You should summon Jung Ji-un
and ask him yourself.

70
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,765
He will say that he met me at Hongwolru.

71
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,767
Hongwolru?

72
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,352
Were you at a courtesan house?

73
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,404
I only stopped by
when I went out in disguise.

74
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,531
You are the Crown Prince.

75
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,701
Not only did you go out
without my permission,

76
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,953
but you also went to a courtesan house.

77
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,123
You are truly frustrating and foolish.

78
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,921
I must attend to the state affairs.
You can leave now.

79
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,839
But…

80
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,723
I understand, Father.

81
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,694
So that wraps up my crash course
on the family tree of the royal family.

82
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,238
And now,

83
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:49,158
I will share
high-level information with you

84
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,160
as you are a new lecturer.

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,579
Have you heard

86
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,456
of the Ice Prince?

87
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,043
That's the Crown Prince's nickname.

88
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,296
He's known
to always be cold and heartless.

89
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,923
Hence, the nickname.

90
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,676
And everyone must stay
five steps away from him.

91
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,970
So he's also known as Five Step Prince.

92
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,556
But…

93
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,517
Why do you have
drawings of animals around him?

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,854
These drawings display
ranks in the royal family.

95
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,316
Ranks?

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,445
I thought you might find these useful too.

97
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,572
So I risked my safety to assemble them.

98
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,867
All right. First off, we have a tiger.

99
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,704
The tiger represents
bravery, grit, and power.

100
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,873
He's the eldest son

101
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,542
<i>of His Majesty's late brother,
Prince Dohyeon.</i>

102
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,919
-The superintendent at the Royal--
-Prince Wonsan.

103
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,881
PRINCE WONSAN

104
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,883
How did you know that?

105
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,969
As for the hawk here,

106
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,597
he's very helpful to everyone.

107
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,724
-The Second Minister of Rites--
-Prince Jaeun.

108
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,811
{\an8}PRINCE JAEUN

109
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,107
I guess you came here prepared.

110
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,487
Then who's that rabbit?

111
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,990
Well, let me tell you who this rabbit is.

112
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,576
He seems docile, but has a lot of support.

113
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,828
<i>The son of the Queen and grandson
of the Chief State Councilor.</i>

114
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,539
He's the second-in-line to the throne,
Prince Jehyeon.

115
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,749
{\an8}PRINCE JEHYEON

116
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,004
Who's that vole?

117
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,341
The fields have eyes.

118
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,967
Do you know who has ears?

119
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,180
<i>It's Prince Changun.</i>

120
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,016
He's the stepbrother of His Majesty

121
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,435
and the black sheep of the royal family.

122
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,230
Well, I don't need to go
into details for this one. Right?

123
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,655
Are you at it again?

124
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,866
You don't give up. Do you?

125
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,756
Royal Tutor Park is always
in need of more sleep.

126
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,137
Hello, Royal Scholar Yang.

127
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,597
Hello, there.

128
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,518
My goodness. The institute seems
to be full of life today.

129
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,061
Get up!

130
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:31,362
All right. A new royal tutor
has been appointed today.

131
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,781
What do you say?
That calls for celebratory drinks.

132
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,117
We already drank last night. Not again.

133
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,328
What? Sounds good. Right?

134
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,413
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,875
But I have a prior engagement today.

136
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,875
Ji-un.

137
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,089
Ji-un. What are you doing here?

138
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,844
How are you feeling?

139
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,055
Are you okay?

140
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,433
How could I be?

141
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,479
They beat me up so much
that I can't even take a dump.

142
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,402
I'm sorry.
You're going through this without me.

143
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,534
What about Yeong-ji?

144
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,870
I heard that she's at Hanseong Magistracy.

145
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,456
But I'm not sure.

146
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,337
Hang in there. I promise to get you out.

147
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,173
Ji-un.

148
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,843
Don't go out of your way for us.

149
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,555
Yeong-ji and I… I mean…

150
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,810
if my sister and I hadn't met you,

151
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,062
we would've died a long time ago.

152
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,981
No matter happens to us,

153
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,567
we won't resent you.

154
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:46,163
It will be difficult
to continue our investigation

155
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,541
on Royal Tutor Jung and Samgaebang now.

156
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,543
It looks like Jung Seok-jo

157
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,962
already bought off everyone involved.

158
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,299
I doubt that he wanted to waste
a golden opportunity

159
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,884
to make his son a lecturer.

160
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,262
Wouldn't this be a problem?

161
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,348
The lecturer has a private audience
with you almost every day.

162
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,183
He will be very close to you.

163
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,895
If, by any chance,
he finds out about you--

164
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,272
That will never happen…

165
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,611
because he'll end up resigning
before anything happens.

166
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,739
Well, may I ask
how you'll get him to resign?

167
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:26,328
Nothing can be easier
than making a lecturer resign.

168
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,259
What are all these?

169
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,761
As my knowledge is limited,

170
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,139
I'm struggling
to understand them on my own.

171
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,851
I would like you
to transcribe every single book here

172
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,603
with footnotes.

173
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,021
Pardon?

174
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,773
Every single book here?

175
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,027
Why? Is that a problem?

176
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,570
-Gosh.
-He's even strong.

177
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,702
Did you get on
His Royal Highness' bad side already?

178
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,995
What do you mean?

179
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:14,001
Goodness, Royal Tutor Jung.
You must stay strong.

180
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,545
Because…

181
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,798
this is only the beginning.

182
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:37,274
At least for now, you'll have an easy task
such as transcribing books like this.

183
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,528
But things will get worse.

184
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,713
<i>Well, this is awkward</i>

185
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,224
{\an8}It is customary
to give gifts to new tutors.

186
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,519
{\an8}But instead,
I prepared a light meal with some drinks.

187
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,438
I hope you won't mind.

188
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,569
I'm honored, Your Royal Highness.

189
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,033
Be careful. He wants to get you drunk,
so you'll make mistakes.

190
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,371
So you must not get drunk
in the Crown Prince's presence.

191
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,206
Never.

192
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,797
Why don't you drink up?

193
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,090
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

194
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,491
The bigger the glass, the better. Right?

195
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,680
Isn't this a bowl for soup?

196
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,487
Would you like a drink?

197
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,657
Court Lady Kim. Escort Eunuch Hong out.

198
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,536
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness. Get up.

199
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,098
I got it!

200
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,808
It's in here.

201
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,685
Oh, no!

202
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,065
Come on!
Why does he want me to catch loaches?

203
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,858
Well, that's because…

204
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,029
I guess you just rub him the wrong way.

205
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,614
-Whatever. Let's eat.
-What?

206
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,241
<i>How about some loach soup?</i>

207
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,960
Damn it. This stinking fishy smell.

208
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,757
I should go back right now
and just submit my letter of…

209
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,177
Envoys from Ming will arrive in two weeks.

210
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,181
If you can serve
the Crown Prince by his side until then,

211
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,517
I will release your friends.

212
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,525
Not bad.

213
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,988
I thought you would be ready
to quit right about now.

214
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,242
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

215
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,746
But I've gone through hell and high water.

216
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,874
I even had to jump off
a cliff like a bird.

217
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,002
So I'm not going anywhere.

218
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,727
What's all this?

219
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,522
These are the transcriptions you made
Royal Tutor Jung do the other day.

220
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,026
Goodness. He actually
transcribed every single one.

221
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>Here you go.</i>

222
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,507
<i>ZUO ZHUAN</i>

223
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,269
Don't just stand there. Get rid of them.

224
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,146
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

225
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,569
<i>Someone's here to see me this late?</i>

226
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,613
Well,

227
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,826
I was told to say that it's your soulmate,
and that you'd know who it is.

228
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,119
What?

229
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,665
What?

230
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,253
The visitor asked to see you here.

231
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,008
It looks like it was a prank.

232
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,722
It's been a while, my lord.

233
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,114
It's me. Your soulmate.

234
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,285
Jung Ji-un. What a surprise to see you.

235
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
A royal tutor?

236
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,500
Were you the new lecturer?

237
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,837
When did you get back from Ming?

238
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,257
Has it been about a year?

239
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,885
I arrived at the Capital
only three or four months ago.

240
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,596
How come you are not settling down?

241
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,765
No matter how busy you've been,
you should have come to see me first.

242
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,144
Can you see?

243
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,897
I have calluses on my delicate hands.

244
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,775
I get that he's the Ice Prince and all.

245
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,071
But has the Crown Prince
always been that mean?

246
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,073
I never want to see anything

247
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,992
that lives in the water.

248
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,954
It sounds like the Crown Prince
taught you a lesson or two.

249
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,459
What do you say? Should I put in
a good word with His Royal Highness?

250
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,503
Can you?

251
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,131
If you tell him that we are soulmates

252
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,927
and ask him to go easy on me,
will he do so?

253
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,679
I was expecting a firm no from you.

254
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,932
Is there something wrong?

255
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,648
Yes. I went through
a lot of difficult times.

256
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,233
And I'm still in one.

257
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,611
What is it?

258
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,113
Does this have to do with your father?

259
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,329
You said you would never serve
the royal family because of your father.

260
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,833
It's a long story.

261
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,752
Let's just drink tonight.

262
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,175
<i>How was your new lecturer?</i>

263
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,136
Do you approve of the lecturer?

264
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,475
He always looks for shortcuts and is sly.

265
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,145
He's more interested
in talking his way out of everything.

266
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,481
I don't think
I should keep him around for long.

267
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,235
I heard he's a distinguished man

268
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,237
and excels in literature
and fighting arts.

269
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,323
As he's good-natured,
he has many excellent friends.

270
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,536
I'm sure people who wanted to be
on my grandfather's good side

271
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,870
made up those lies.

272
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,165
People say
birds of a feather flock together.

273
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,751
Befriending someone like him
only proves their priority.

274
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,253
No need to see anything else.

275
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,174
That's a bit harsh.

276
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,306
Your Royal Highness,
it's time for your lecture.

277
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,640
I got it.

278
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,102
Close them.

279
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,510
Are you sure you don't want
to attend the morning lecture?

280
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,721
After getting appointed the Crown Prince,

281
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,433
you have never missed one
of your lectures.

282
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,811
How many times must I repeat
that I will not be attending the lecture?

283
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,272
Goodness.

284
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,940
May I ask why?

285
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,159
Why are you avoiding me? No.

286
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,162
Why do you want to kick me out?

287
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,667
I'm sure you know
the reason for that more than anyone.

288
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,710
Am I wrong?

289
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,797
I believe I passed
all of your assignments.

290
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,175
I am your tutor.

291
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,844
Attend my lecture,
so I can fulfill my duty

292
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,139
of helping you study
and teaching you moral principles.

293
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,475
To help me study

294
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,394
and teach me moral principles?

295
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,150
How ridiculous.

296
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,487
You may be helpful in my studies.
But as for moral principles,

297
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,074
you of all people can't possibly teach me.

298
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,708
I heard that you operated Samgaebang.

299
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,503
And we also met
at a courtesan house. Correct?

300
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,049
You are no more than an idler
who performs acupuncture there.

301
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,303
Yet, with your father's support,
you managed to become my lecturer.

302
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,890
Some may find that embarrassing.

303
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,143
But you are indeed brazen.

304
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,187
Then…

305
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,858
will you keep avoiding me?

306
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,985
I will if I can,

307
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,196
and until you realize
you have a conscience and resign.

308
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,867
I'm sorry, but what if I won't resign?

309
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,963
You know no shame.
I can understand, though.

310
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,302
Becoming a lecturer of the Crown Prince
must have been tempting.

311
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,263
Just like your father,

312
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,267
you are an opportunist.

313
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,158
Then allow me to offer a compromise.

314
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,203
We'll make a wager.

315
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,080
And if I lose this bet,

316
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,249
I will resign as you wish.

317
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,876
However,

318
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,422
if I win,
you will have to attend my lecture.

319
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,967
-A bet?
-Get the highest mark on the upcoming exam

320
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,053
{\an8}given by all lecturers including myself.

321
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,932
{\an8}His Majesty and people of the court
will attend the session,

322
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,560
{\an8}so if I fail you in the exam,
I would be in big trouble.

323
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,022
What do you think?

324
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,360
Why must I agree to that?

325
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,947
I'm not interested in making a bet.

326
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,448
What must I do

327
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,117
to get you to accept this deal?

328
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,994
Who knows?

329
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,414
But I don't think that'll ever happen.

330
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,124
Well,

331
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,421
I might change my mind
if you offered up your life.

332
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,501
What are you doing?

333
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,132
I will bet my life on it.

334
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,321
My lord! Lord Jaeun!

335
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,743
There's a problem.

336
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,704
His Royal Highness is pointing
his arrow at the new royal tutor.

337
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,289
It's quite a scene.

338
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,665
What?

339
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,024
-Your Royal Highness!
-Goodness.

340
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,571
Your Royal Highness,
your subjects are watching.

341
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,032
Please lower your bow.

342
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,828
He wishes to die. I ought to
grant him his wish. Don't you think so?

343
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,498
Oh, no.

344
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,380
What?

345
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,773
Your Royal Highness!

346
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,569
-Gosh.
-My goodness!

347
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,035
Goodness.

348
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,478
I admire your courage.

349
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,399
So I will agree to the bet.

350
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,736
Samgaebang?

351
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:46,117
They mean everything to me.

352
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,661
I will do anything to save them.

353
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,288
But still. Must you go this far?

354
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,044
So what is your plan now?

355
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,216
I don't know.

356
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,635
I must keep trying though.

357
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,979
But…

358
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,441
Lord Sangheon is his maternal grandfather.

359
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,901
Do they not get along?

360
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,824
Geez.

361
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,953
I know that His Royal Highness
isn't the friendly type.

362
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,373
But how could you be so reckless?

363
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,501
He must be in a tight spot

364
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,629
between his father, His Majesty,
and his grandfather, Lord Sangheon

365
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,715
because they don't
exactly support each other.

366
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,552
That's why he's been hard on me.

367
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,346
What are you mumbling about?

368
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,599
It's nothing. Please don't mind me.

369
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,684
Goodness.

370
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,938
His Royal Highness will like this
so go and get in his good graces.

371
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,731
And plead for forgiveness.

372
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,692
Come on. Now!

373
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,408
How could you shoot an arrow
at your tutor in broad daylight?

374
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,619
Why were you so reckless?

375
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,250
He showed no respect to me.

376
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,544
I was teaching him a lesson.

377
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,006
It's okay to show people your claws.

378
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,050
But he's not the one
you should be worried about.

379
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,927
So I ask of you

380
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,180
never to cause a scene like this again.

381
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,894
Jung Ji-un.

382
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,440
Why did you recommend him to be my tutor?

383
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,652
From what I heard,
he's had a questionable past.

384
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,283
Is it because
he is the son of Jung Seok-jo,

385
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,370
your trusted associate?

386
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,627
He's a distinguished young man
who passed the state exam

387
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,295
at the age of 15.

388
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,925
If you keep him by your side,
I'm sure he'll be helpful to you someday.

389
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:12,055
And so what if
he's the son of my trusted associate?

390
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,224
The palace can be as dirty as the mud.

391
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,311
If you don't have
your people by your side,

392
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,356
others will try to get close to you.

393
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:26,361
So please let go
of these insignificant matters.

394
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,405
It's no use to stay virtuous
when we're playing a dirty game.

395
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,450
-But--
-My people

396
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,911
are your people.

397
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,417
I advise you to keep
what I just told you in mind.

398
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,426
Yes, Grandfather.

399
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,197
Gosh.

400
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,914
Royal Tutor Jung, what brings you here?

401
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,169
Royal Scholar Yang asked me
to bring a book to His Royal Highness.

402
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,588
-Here you go.
-Okay.

403
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,968
Then I'll let you get back to work.

404
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,108
This is the topic of the upcoming exam
as well as your assignment.

405
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,819
My assignment?

406
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:01,289
You will be able to
answer my question at the exam

407
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,375
only when you can get
the seed to bud and study it.

408
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,711
However,

409
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,882
I advise you not to get your subordinates

410
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,759
to do your assignment.

411
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,469
That is because

412
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,181
only you will be able
to answer this question.

413
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,768
Do you know who I am, you punks?

414
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,940
Let me tell you who I am.

415
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,984
-Stop the palanquin.
-Yes, my lord.

416
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:22,703
Here's a thing about life.
You need to pick the right side to join.

417
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,583
Just take me for example.

418
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,212
Who are you?

419
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,801
You…

420
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,019
Isn't this a lotus seed?

421
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,062
No.

422
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,942
I'm sure it is.

423
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,653
He wouldn't have wagered
his life on such an easy question.

424
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,406
I'm sure
there's a different meaning to this.

425
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,661
-Gosh. He's so good-looking.
-He's so handsome.

426
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,163
He's so tall too.

427
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,166
-Look at his build.
-He's gorgeous.

428
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,252
-He's so handsome.
-So handsome.

429
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,547
Who is that man?

430
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,758
I'm not sure. I've never seen him around.

431
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,094
I don't think he works in your quarters.

432
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,141
Find out why he's here,
and get him out of here.

433
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,271
Your Royal Highness.

434
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,414
My name is Kim Ga-on.
I will be your bodyguard starting today.

435
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,895
Bullseye!

436
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,568
A bodyguard?

437
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,571
Did you assign a bodyguard
to the Crown Prince, Mother?

438
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,034
I thought we already discussed this.

439
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,621
Given the incident
during the royal hunting,

440
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,290
I am too worried to do nothing.

441
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,629
Fortunately, the Ministry of War was
able to recommend a trustworthy guard.

442
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,381
I hope you get on board with this.

443
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,717
I can take care of the matters
regarding the Crown Prince.

444
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,644
Then you should have done so
a long time ago.

445
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,815
How can you be so indifferent
toward the Crown Prince?

446
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,318
There's nothing I can do
about your marriage with the Queen.

447
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,738
But the Crown Prince
of Joseon is not Prince Jehyeon.

448
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,533
You must consider
the Crown Prince's reputation.

449
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,129
So what was your previous assignment?

450
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,047
I was an elite soldier in the army.

451
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,134
I see.

452
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,852
I wanted to see you in private

453
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,231
because now that
you work for the Crown Prince,

454
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,317
I thought it would be nice

455
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,611
to go over a few rules with you.

456
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,239
Here's the first rule.

457
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,283
When you are guarding the Crown Prince,

458
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:51,662
you must be at least
five steps away from him.

459
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,831
Watch me.

460
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,418
One, two, three, four, five.

461
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,299
So the distance must be as far as this.

462
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,009
Here's the second rule.

463
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,971
If there's anything
you need to report to him,

464
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:13,017
you will have to go through me
and Court Lady Kim first.

465
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,523
Do you understand?

466
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,738
-Five steps back.
-Look at him.

467
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,366
-He's so gorgeous.
-How handsome.

468
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,912
Look. I told you to be
at least five steps away.

469
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,623
You. You must step back a bit.

470
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,459
Come on. I told you to step back.

471
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,086
Five steps.

472
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,922
Look at his face. We ought
to thank the Queen Dowager.

473
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,382
I know, right?

474
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,134
He'll be guarding the Crown Prince
at night too, right?

475
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,304
-Right?
-I'll take the night shift from now on.

476
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,307
Watching him will
make me feel like I'm dreaming.

477
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,811
-He's handsome even from the back.
-Step back.

478
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,147
-You must be five steps away from him.
-He's so hot.

479
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,109
-Gosh. He's so handsome.
-So gorgeous.

480
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,321
-Goodness!
-Oh, no!

481
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,991
Five steps!

482
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,496
Didn't I tell you to follow me
from five steps behind?

483
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,001
I already have a lot on my mind
to prepare for the exam.

484
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:33,639
Did you not hear me? I told you
to stay five steps away from me.

485
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,603
Five steps.

486
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,107
I told you to stay
five steps away from me.

487
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,820
Keep going. Move back.

488
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,948
Guarding Your Royal Highness
was the royal command given to me.

489
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,786
A royal command?

490
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,958
Then does it mean you work for my father?

491
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,214
No, that's not it.
Since my grandmother gave you this post,

492
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,049
you must work for her.

493
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,263
If not, you must work
for my maternal grandfather.

494
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,848
None of the above.

495
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,978
I am only here to fulfill my duty
of guarding you, Your Royal Highness.

496
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,063
So to be exact, from this moment on,

497
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,025
I work for you, Your Royal Highness.

498
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,739
-He's so cool.
-He works for the Crown Prince!

499
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,658
My apologies.

500
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,340
Come on, five steps back.

501
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,694
<i>That is because</i>

502
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,864
<i>only you will be able
to answer this question.</i>

503
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,037
What on earth is he planning?

504
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,924
<i>ZUO ZHUAN</i>

505
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,703
YEON-SEON

506
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,667
{\an8}YEON-SEON

507
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,467
YEON-SEON

508
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,136
Lotus flowers brought me to you,

509
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,889
so I thought the name would be fitting.

510
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,599
Yeon-seon.

511
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,767
YEON-SEON

512
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,852
He wouldn't…

513
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,233
What are you doing here,
Your Royal Highness?

514
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,903
Hyun.

515
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,822
Why are you so startled?

516
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,286
Allow me to lend you a hand.

517
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,455
No. There is no need.

518
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,584
I heard that

519
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,462
you will be in charge of
receiving the envoys from Ming.

520
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,298
Is there anything I can help you with?

521
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,342
No.

522
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,261
I know that
you must have a lot on your mind.

523
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,640
I just want to accompany you
when you leave the palace.

524
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,225
Wasn't that obvious?

525
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,981
Then why don't we discuss this
after your exam?

526
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,983
The exam is important to you.

527
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,277
Yes.

528
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,615
I guess that will be better for me.

529
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:21,677
The next lecturer
is Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

530
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,470
He will present now.

531
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,817
I gave you an assignment
during my previous lecture.

532
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,236
Yes.

533
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,407
You gave me a seed, so I could plant it

534
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,492
and get it to bud.

535
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,204
Did you figure out what that seed was?

536
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,207
It was a lotus seed.

537
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,502
You are correct.

538
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,551
Then did you also figure out
the reason behind my giving you

539
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,178
the lotus seed?

540
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,265
According to the <i>Zongjing lu</i>,

541
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,394
we are unable to face our true feelings.

542
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,397
But our heart resembles
the form of a lotus flower.

543
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,649
And it says

544
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,277
blooming a lotus flower
in our heart will enlighten us.

545
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,281
Moreover, lotus flowers
can still keep their fragrance

546
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,908
without getting dirty by the mud.

547
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,911
So I should follow
this virtuous flower's path

548
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,581
and continue to cherish my people.

549
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,800
-I'm sorry, but--
-However…

550
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,807
I doubt that you gave me this assignment
to review the philosophy

551
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,310
from a Confucian classic.

552
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,190
FAIL

553
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,945
There's nothing to throw away
when it comes to lotuses.

554
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,447
Leaves, roots, fruits, pistils,

555
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,199
and even seeds.

556
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:11,036
Every part of the lotus can be used
either as food or medicinal herbs.

557
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,122
When classical scholars,
so-called noblemen,

558
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,416
find virtue in lotuses,

559
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,835
my people

560
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,421
must have found life and death.

561
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,134
Therefore,

562
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,805
I concluded that
having an open mind to seek

563
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,642
hardships in my people's lives…

564
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:39,773
instead of blindly cherishing them,
is how to become a wise king.

565
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,121
That is an excellent answer.

566
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,666
However,
it is not the answer I was looking for.

567
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,213
It is not?

568
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,508
Loving his people
isn't the only duty of the king.

569
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,635
Only those who can love themselves

570
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,762
can truly love others.

571
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:19,730
What does that have to do
with the seed you gave me?

572
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,398
Someone once said

573
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,110
that the palace
can be as dirty as the mud.

574
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,997
The palace can be as dirty as the mud.

575
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,499
If you don't have
your people by your side,

576
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,669
others will try to get close to you.

577
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,923
Lotus flowers bloom in mud,
but they can cleanse their surroundings.

578
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,844
And the leaves have the ability
to shake off murky water.

579
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,013
There's no trace of any dirt on them.

580
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,183
Just like the lotus flowers
that stay virtuous

581
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,769
despite its dirty environment,

582
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:02,189
I hope that you will become a strong king.

583
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,899
That is why I gave you the seed.

584
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,027
And some hurt innocent people

585
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,488
under the premise of a greater cause.

586
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,241
However, no matter how great the cause is,

587
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:17,162
it cannot be greater than people's lives.

588
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,667
With that said, I hope
that you will learn from the lotus flower

589
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,753
and hold onto the virtue
which will help you see

590
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,047
what matters, and make sound judgment

591
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,633
even in the mud.

592
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,553
It's no use to stay virtuous
when we're playing a dirty game.

593
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,390
I advise you to keep

594
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,268
what I just told you in mind.

595
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,693
Therefore, I must say

596
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,905
that you failed this exam.

597
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,068
Your insight is exceptional.

598
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,946
I truly like your answer.

599
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,534
It's an honor, Your Majesty.

600
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,163
Not appointing you
would've been a disservice indeed.

601
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,373
Like Lord Sangheon said,

602
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,459
you are quite extraordinary.

603
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,951
-Gosh. Okay. Pour my drink here.
-You know?

604
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,662
-All right. Pour me a drink.
-Please allow me.

605
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,999
-Sit comfortably.
-No. It's an honor.

606
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,543
What a surprise
to have a distinguished tutor here.

607
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,921
Doesn't he remind you of me ten years ago?

608
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,881
Sure.

609
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,467
-What do you think?
-Right?

610
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,890
-I don't think so.
-I think he's jealous.

611
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,435
Jealous? As if.

612
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,561
Let's drink it up.

613
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,939
-Okay.
-All right. Bottoms up.

614
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,274
-I'm a lightweight.
-Is that so?

615
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,906
I thought it was perfect.

616
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:04,329
This is all thanks to Royal Tutor Jung.

617
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,083
All right. Eat up.

618
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,877
Having a good time?

619
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,468
I have been looking for you,
Your Royal Highness.

620
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,513
So you heard my conversation with him?

621
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,808
You heard what my grandfather told me?

622
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,395
I'm sorry.

623
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,066
That was not my intention.

624
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,070
Did you find my answer offensive?

625
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,909
It was impressive.

626
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,828
No one ever dared

627
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,873
to make such a bold statement here.

628
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,712
However,

629
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,840
you must make this your last time.

630
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,971
In the palace, you must be more careful

631
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,765
than you think.

632
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,394
It's dangerous

633
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,230
and frightening.

634
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,153
I'm aware

635
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,864
of how dangerous this place is.

636
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,621
My father and your maternal grandfather,
Lord Sangheon,

637
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,958
must have contributed to that

638
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,878
along with other people.

639
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,802
Actually, I was talking about myself

640
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,514
when I gave my answer earlier.

641
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,312
Therefore,
even if my answer puts me in danger,

642
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,149
I will not fear it.

643
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,736
What I fear is

644
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,740
that I might get used
to seeing mud all the time

645
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,412
and follow in their footsteps.

646
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,917
That's the only thing I fear.

647
00:55:55,477 --> 00:56:00,190
By the way, where can I see the lotus bud?
The one from the seed I gave you.

648
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,320
Isn't it obvious where it should be?

649
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,698
The day you gave it to me,
I threw it into this pond here.

650
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,243
Does that mean you knew what it was
the moment you got it?

651
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,538
I thought this would be difficult for you.

652
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,459
The lotus fruit is often served as one
of the side dishes for the royal meal.

653
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,961
Why wouldn't I recognize that?

654
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,676
I have never seen a royal meal before.

655
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:43,399
Then the lotus seed
will bloom into a flower soon.

656
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,406
I look forward to working
for you until then, Your Royal Highness.

657
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:05,171
Royal Tutor Jung!
Royal Scholar Yang is passed out drunk!

658
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,714
Please come and help!

659
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,007
Royal Tutor Jung!

660
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,470
Okay. I'm on my way.

661
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,850
Please join us.

662
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,895
Why don't you give yourself a free night
and chase away your worries with drinks?

663
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,189
Whatever is worrying you.

664
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,278
I hope to see you back there.

665
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,612
We should get going. Time will fly today.

666
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,905
Okay, Hyun.

667
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,503
What happened to your hand,
Royal Scholar Yang?

668
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,380
You know that I had some drinks
on the day of the exam.

669
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,634
When I woke up the next day,
I found my hand injured like this.

670
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,385
And I was completely soaked too.

671
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,138
I don't remember what happened.
I must've been very drunk.

672
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,724
What happened that day?

673
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,310
I see.
You must've been pretty drunk as well.

674
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:47,065
As you can see, my hand is injured.
So can you transcribe this for me?

675
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,275
Then you can bring it to the palace.

676
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,030
Are you asking me to do your task?

677
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,615
Do my task?

678
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:59,452
This is a task from the Crown Prince.
What's important is that we get it done.

679
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,871
How could you make such accusations?

680
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,122
Forget it!

681
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,501
Do you think I want to ask you to help me?

682
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,003
I'm done here.

683
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,802
My lady, are you all right?

684
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,095
You must be more careful.

685
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,061
Are you all right?

686
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,587
Are you okay?

687
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,328
What about this?

688
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,455
Pardon?

689
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:14,253
Well, I think that one over there is
better than the one you're holding.

690
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,197
-Hey, stop pushing me.
-Stop it.

691
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,283
-Gosh. Look at this. It's so beautiful.
-This is so pretty.

692
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,412
-Oh, my. Look at this.
-Hey, take a look at this.

693
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,165
-How beautiful.
-This is so pretty.

694
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,293
-This is stunning.
-Did you see this?

695
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,631
There is a door in the back. Let's go.

696
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,674
Pardon?

697
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,347
Wait. Where are you going?

698
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,061
Step aside. Come on, let me pass through!

699
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,106
Wait. What?

700
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,579
Gosh. Oh, no.

701
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,621
Your Royal Highness.

702
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,764
Hey, don't lose them.

703
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:00,777
Hey.

704
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,672
Why…

705
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,217
Why did you do that, Hyun?

706
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,219
Isn't it fun?

707
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,471
We're playing tag
just like when we were kids.

708
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,891
Goodness.

709
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,319
What is this?

710
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,321
It is a present for you.

711
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,716
Why are you giving me this?

712
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,888
When you find a lady you love
and get engaged,

713
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,683
please give that to your betrothed.

714
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,416
Are you all right?

715
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,985
Hyun.

716
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,908
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

717
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,534
I was worried it'd splash on you.

718
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,078
Oh, no.

719
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,497
I ruined your fine robe.

720
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,791
That's all right. We all make mistakes.

721
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,084
I'm sorry.

722
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,557
I feel awful. Your robe is soaked.

723
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,774
Your hat is ruined because of me.

724
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,317
Please wait.

725
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,069
I will go and buy a new one.

726
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,196
No. That's all right.

727
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,915
Please wear mine for the time being,
Your Royal Highness.

728
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:26,667
Royal Tutor Jung.

729
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,672
A hat completes the robe.

730
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,634
What are you doing?

731
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,429
People are watching.

732
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,349
Protecting your dignity is
also my duty as your subject.

733
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,311
Please forgive me for being too forward.

734
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,025
I…

735
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,444
I can do it myself.

736
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,571
Okay.

737
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,920
You never had to tie it yourself.

738
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,381
Please stay still for a moment.

739
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,932
{\an8}Do you two know each other?

740
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:51,228
{\an8}<i>You seem happy. Did you have a good day?</i>

741
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,938
{\an8}<i>So a male friend he meets secretly?</i>

742
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,316
{\an8}<i>Could the Crown Prince like men?</i>

743
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,276
{\an8}<i>What do you mean
the Crown Prince seems like a woman?</i>

744
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,945
{\an8}<i>He resembles the court maid
I saw at the royal hunting.</i>

745
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,947
{\an8}<i>What are you doing?
I'd rather you stay away.</i>

746
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,450
{\an8}<i>Don't distance yourself too much.</i>

747
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,910
{\an8}<i>It'll only make you lonelier.</i>

748
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:09,455
{\an8}<i>Human emotions are the hardest to trust.</i>

749
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,750
{\an8}<i>Killing others to protect oneself.</i>

750
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,960
{\an8}<i>That is human nature.</i>

751
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:19,882
