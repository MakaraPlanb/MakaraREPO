1
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,447
I do not care what the position is.

2
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,910
I just need to find a way
to be at the palace.

3
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,454
Please help me.

4
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,210
What made you change your mind?

5
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,087
Why are you asking for my help?

6
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,506
I want to…

7
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,218
protect His Majesty.

8
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,057
Is it out of loyalty?

9
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,395
You do not

10
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,232
belong in the palace.

11
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,608
You should leave.

12
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,194
Why not? What do you mean

13
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,198
I do not belong in the palace?

14
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,158
That is because

15
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,955
you can tell what is right from wrong.

16
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,706
At the palace,

17
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,377
what is right is not always
the right answer.

18
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,965
Knowing that, do you think
you can survive in the palace

19
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,051
with a mere sense of loyalty?

20
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,058
I will adapt…

21
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,521
to that world.

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,866
I would like my son
to be near His Majesty.

23
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,326
But your son

24
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,289
tried to take His Majesty and flee.

25
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,503
You should be grateful
that I am not punishing him

26
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,463
for what he did.

27
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,924
But to place him by His Majesty's side?

28
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,928
You made a promise to me the first time
I took someone's life for you.

29
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,222
You promised that

30
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,310
my family and I would not
have to answer to anyone else

31
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,896
if I followed you.

32
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,023
Now, keep your promise to me.

33
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,735
As your goal has been achieved,

34
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,864
I believe it is my turn to be rewarded.

35
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,551
Two months will be enough.

36
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,556
I will not say anything
or express any of my feelings.

37
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:32,772
I will stay by your side
only until your wound has healed.

38
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,240
Please pretend that I am not here.

39
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,744
I will act accordingly as well.

40
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,675
EPISODE 14

41
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,970
{\an8}-Your Highness.
-Your Highness. Please stop.

42
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,639
{\an8}-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

43
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,058
{\an8}-Please stop running.
-Your Highness.

44
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,810
{\an8}Your Highness.

45
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,773
{\an8}I came here because I was told
His Majesty was here. Have you seen him?

46
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,861
{\an8}His Majesty went back
to his quarters after the royal lecture.

47
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,613
{\an8}Thank you for telling me.

48
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,824
{\an8}By the way,

49
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,494
{\an8}does he have a lot of state affairs
to attend to again?

50
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,371
{\an8}Pardon?

51
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,166
{\an8}Never mind.

52
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,101
Look who is here.

53
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,232
What brings you here, Your Highness?

54
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,943
-Father.
-Please. You cannot address me

55
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,863
like that.

56
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,032
Please remember royal etiquette.

57
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,037
Hello, Left State Councilor.

58
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,498
By the way, what is that in your hands?

59
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,626
This?

60
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,093
It is my love letter to His Majesty.

61
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,260
A love letter?

62
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,848
So you have been writing
love letters every day in your quarters?

63
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,767
Not every day. Only sometimes.

64
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,813
Maybe a bit more than sometimes?

65
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,860
But I am not sure
if he is reading my letters.

66
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,029
He has not responded to them.

67
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,698
I am sure he is reading them.

68
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,577
He must be reading
the letters over and over again.

69
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,372
Square your shoulders and look confident.

70
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:58,167
Do not forget
that Lord Sangheon handpicked you.

71
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,461
You must always show confidence.

72
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,756
Like this?

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,758
You look much better now.

74
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,054
Then I shall go
and see His Majesty, Father.

75
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,731
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness. Please…

76
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,900
Please be careful. I beg of you.

77
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,079
{\an8}SEUNGJEONGWON: ROYAL SECRETARIAT
THAT HANDLED THE KING'S ORDERS

78
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,520
"A section chief
at the Ministry of Personnel,

79
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,606
Kim Sa-heon,
took bribes and sold positions…"

80
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,026
Kim Sa-heon?

81
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,779
Isn't he Lord Sangheon's
second cousin once removed?

82
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,242
I shall decline this.

83
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,581
"Han Gi-jae, the Chief State Councilor,
has taken over the royal court

84
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,334
using his position
as His Majesty's grandfather…"

85
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,253
Decline.

86
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,798
{\an8}DECLINED, ACCEPTED

87
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,093
"Oust him quietly…"

88
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,058
"Follow the public opinion
by excluding him…"

89
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,685
Clear them away.

90
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
These are all the same appeals.
Clear them away.

91
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,856
Gosh. What a traitor.

92
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,738
There is a flood of appeals
requesting to impeach Lord Sangheon.

93
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,365
Yet, you turn a blind eye to them.

94
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,867
You have changed a lot,
Royal Scholar Yang.

95
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,661
No, Chief Royal Secretary.

96
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,455
After all, you were His Majesty's tutor.

97
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,419
What are you doing here again?

98
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,923
Go back to the Ministry of Taxation.
You are the section chief there now.

99
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,509
I always find you here.
What business do you have here?

100
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:15,179
If you plan to handle everything
in the Chief State Councilor's favor,

101
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,056
why do we need a Chief Royal Secretary?

102
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,558
Right, Scribe Jung?

103
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,602
It can't be helped.

104
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,105
Then…

105
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,149
I will take care of these.

106
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,904
Goodness.

107
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,617
I was wrong about him.

108
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,495
What happened to the man who made

109
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,081
the lotus analogy
to teach Lord Sangheon a lesson?

110
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,335
His father, Commander Jung,
got him the post.

111
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,005
That must be why
he rarely goes to the palace.

112
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,882
The only thing he does is
deliver these reports.

113
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,385
Writing the royal diary
by His Majesty's side

114
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,053
must go against his conscience.

115
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,726
I told you to stop jumping to conclusions.

116
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,979
You think you will be any different?
We do what we are told.

117
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,731
You know I have a point.

118
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,149
{\an8}What is he doing here as a scribe

119
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,860
{\an8}if he won't work on
the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat?

120
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,321
Right.

121
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,325
You are distracting me. Leave now.

122
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,659
Get back to work.

123
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,453
Stop idling away.

124
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,421
I heard you moved back home.

125
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,757
Did you make up with your father?

126
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,343
Yes.

127
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,305
You said you would never forgive him.
What happened?

128
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,476
I have to get going.

129
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,686
Hey…

130
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,816
What's gotten into him?

131
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,131
Your pulse was very unstable
for a while after your ascension.

132
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,968
But it has gotten much better.

133
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,136
Thank you.

134
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,305
You may go now.

135
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,463
Your Majesty,

136
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,050
the reports from Seungjeongwon are here.

137
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,136
Let him enter.

138
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,225
{\an8}You must finish in under 30 minutes.

139
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,200
{\an8}Are you leaving after the routine
examination of His Majesty's health?

140
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,995
{\an8}Yes, Commander Jung.

141
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,497
How is His Majesty?

142
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,876
Has his wound healed?

143
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,337
Pardon? His wound?

144
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,082
Your wound has healed significantly.

145
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,294
We will need to observe it
for another three to four days.

146
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,380
The royal physician said

147
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,883
my pulse has gotten very stable too.

148
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,511
I believe

149
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,181
I have gotten a lot better.

150
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,193
Please try to move your arm
to see if there is any discomfort.

151
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,949
I am fine.

152
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,256
Thank you…

153
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,806
for always treating me, Scribe Jung.

154
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,247
Your Highness. Why did you…

155
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,091
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

156
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,111
How could you open the door like that

157
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,615
without letting me
announce your entrance first?

158
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,909
I am sorry.

159
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,704
I forgot again that
I was not supposed to do that here.

160
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,707
What should I do?

161
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,468
Your Majesty,
Her Majesty the Queen is here.

162
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,512
Let her enter.

163
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,239
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

164
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,119
I am not used to royal etiquette.

165
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:37,955
I am sorry.

166
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,875
It is all right, Your Highness.

167
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,255
I will take my leave now, Your Majesty.

168
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,680
Please come and sit.

169
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,034
What brings you here?

170
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,661
Well…

171
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,636
I saw a pair of beautiful skylarks

172
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,890
perched on the tree
at my quarters last night.

173
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:25,938
So I wrote a few words
to express my affection for you.

174
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,907
Thank you.

175
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,702
I will make sure to read it.

176
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,579
Really?

177
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,167
Right. The Royal Astronomical Bureau will
pick an auspicious day and tell us soon.

178
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,337
I was wondering if you had heard.

179
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,467
I see.

180
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,100
{\an8}DAY 23 OF MONTH 12

181
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,862
Rumor has it you plan to pick a day
based on Lord Sangheon's order

182
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,739
instead of choosing
the best date for His Majesty

183
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,533
and the Queen's night together.

184
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,162
That is a misunderstanding.

185
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,165
Lord Sangheon has been
on our backs and scolding us every day

186
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,210
since he thinks it is taking too long
to schedule their night together.

187
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,129
What choice do I have?

188
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,048
We are also in a predicament.

189
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,427
Then how do you explain this?

190
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,679
How did you…

191
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,016
My goodness. How much is this?

192
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,061
So did you take the money to pay
for your meals with your colleagues?

193
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,024
-Goodness.
-Please spare me!

194
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,775
Please spare me.

195
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,736
Please spare me.

196
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,573
Oh, please. Stop this.

197
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,950
Why would we kill you?

198
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,455
His Majesty is busy with state affairs,
so he will not have time for the Queen.

199
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,749
That's what I came here to tell you.

200
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:19,384
However, if I do not pick
an auspicious day again,

201
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
there is no doubt that Lord Sangheon

202
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,514
will kill--

203
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:29,561
Actually, you might face death sooner
if we take this matter into our own hands.

204
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,066
But he just said
that there is no reason to kill me.

205
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:39,238
-I guess he has a different idea.
-He has a different idea?

206
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,822
I do have a different idea.

207
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,199
Where is the stick?

208
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,077
Wait. You know what?

209
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,956
Let me take this back…

210
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,499
Please forgive me!

211
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,625
Hey!

212
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,967
Goodness. Lord Sangheon!

213
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,137
You handle the selection
of auspicious days.

214
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,890
Tell me. Has a date been selected?

215
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,768
Well, about that…

216
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,441
As the energy
of the heavens is bad this month,

217
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,069
yin and yang will not be compatible.

218
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,989
It will be difficult to pick…

219
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,241
That does not concern me.

220
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,786
Pick a date by the end of today
and bring it to me.

221
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,913
Yes, my lord.

222
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,883
You. Come here.

223
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,392
Inspector General Cho Yeong-ho
who led the scholars to protest

224
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,020
together with Great Lord Changcheon
has been banished.

225
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,981
So a recommendation
for the successor is only appropriate.

226
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,066
Banished?

227
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,280
The banishment was
executed properly based on the royal edict

228
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,657
you had given me.

229
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,913
I see.

230
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,416
All right.

231
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,795
Your Majesty, due to this year's
prolonged rainy season,

232
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,798
{\an8}the ground around
the placenta chamber has gotten unstable.

233
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,675
{\an8}Many people have raised concerns.

234
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,263
I believe relocating it would be better.

235
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,309
I am not sure if there is anyone
who can take on such a big responsibility.

236
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,685
I recommend Prince Wonsan,

237
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,937
superintendent of
the Office of Royal Genealogy.

238
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,235
This matter will require a long-term plan.

239
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,321
A regional official should be in charge--

240
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,239
This is a royal matter.

241
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,949
Do you not agree that

242
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,827
a member of
the royal family ought to handle it?

243
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,548
I shall do my best,

244
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,675
Your Majesty.

245
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,034
Did I upset you?

246
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,748
As it was an urgent matter,

247
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,376
I failed to inform you

248
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,545
before handling the matter myself.

249
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,089
I see.

250
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,883
I appreciate it.

251
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,057
Please continue to let me handle
these burdensome matters

252
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,186
so that you can give
your full attention to producing an heir.

253
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,983
No matter how big the tree is,
the people at the palace

254
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,070
will want to chop it down
and plant a new one

255
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,823
if it does not yield any fruit.

256
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,411
Please strengthen your political realm

257
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,581
for the sake of the late King.

258
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,253
I will keep that in mind.

259
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,381
Grandfather.

260
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,011
{\an8}YOUR MAJESTY…

261
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,722
The date has been set?

262
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,015
Yes.

263
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,236
I was writing poems.

264
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,282
I heard His Majesty enjoys reading poetry.

265
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,917
Is that it? The letter with the date?

266
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,003
Yes.

267
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,344
The Royal Astronomical Bureau…

268
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,264
sent this over.

269
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,824
Today?

270
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,870
-This soon?
-Yes.

271
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,288
Oh, my.

272
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,042
Goodness. I don't know what to do!

273
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,336
Gosh, Court Lady Kim.

274
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,800
GANGNYEONGJEON

275
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,349
Are you sure
you want to proceed with this?

276
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:04,938
Why don't you say you do not feel well?
It is not too late.

277
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,940
That was the excuse for the wedding night.

278
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,317
I can handle it this time.

279
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,946
I will set an empty storeroom on fire.

280
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,864
With the commotion, we can manage--

281
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,449
No.

282
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,244
I will go to the Queen's quarters.

283
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,122
Escort me.

284
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,040
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

285
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,626
What are you going to do?

286
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,092
Is it because His Majesty and the Queen
are spending the night? It's quiet here.

287
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,553
You are right. It is indeed quiet.

288
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,440
Are you going home now?

289
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,358
Yes, Your Majesty.

290
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,194
You must be heading
to the Queen's quarters now.

291
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes. Good night.

292
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,319
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

293
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,100
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

294
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,602
I am just nervous.

295
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,772
It is all right.

296
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,441
Leave it be.

297
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,372
Have you been waiting long for tonight?

298
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,874
Pardon?

299
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,293
Right.

300
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,005
Even on our first night, I left
after helping you put down your hair.

301
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,341
So this is the first time
we are sitting down…

302
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,845
face to face like this.

303
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,598
The only desire I have is

304
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,269
to produce a son and make you happy.

305
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:59,070
Well, it is not because I have
any hidden intentions or anything.

306
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,831
I am sorry.

307
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,667
Pardon?

308
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,628
Please believe me
when I say I have no intention…

309
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,009
of disrespecting you.

310
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,261
Your Majesty.

311
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,930
I can leave this room right now.

312
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,016
But I will not do so.

313
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,976
Moreover…

314
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,272
I will not explain
why I may be doing something

315
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,984
that may humiliate you.

316
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,570
And…

317
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,157
if you resent and hate me

318
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,869
for what I am about to do…

319
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,874
I will face it without any complaint.

320
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,338
Why all of a sudden…

321
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,306
Come in.

322
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,362
Tonight…

323
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,448
we have made love as a married couple.

324
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,493
And on the days we sleep together,

325
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,955
there shall be two sets of blankets,
just like today.

326
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,460
Of course, this will remain a secret.

327
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,796
So I ask you…

328
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,633
to accept this.

329
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,971
Your Majesty.

330
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,349
Why are you doing this?

331
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,754
Can I come in?

332
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,598
You are still up.

333
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,102
I need to ask you something.

334
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,272
You must know that His Majesty was shot

335
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,983
with an arrow during the procession.

336
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:29,113
However, there was no record of
His Majesty getting treated for the wound.

337
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,410
Have you been treating the wound,
by any chance?

338
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,831
No.

339
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,626
He has a royal physician.
Why would I treat his wound?

340
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,880
Perhaps the wound was not deep enough
for him to need any treatment.

341
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,594
Is that so? That is a relief.

342
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,347
Get some rest then.

343
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,988
<i>I found a bloodstain here!</i>

344
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,837
GANGNYEONGJEON

345
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,729
May I ask

346
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:48,484
why you were honest with the Queen?

347
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,488
You could have made up an excuse.

348
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,410
Her affection for me

349
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,413
is sincere.

350
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,125
She is giving me her heart.

351
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,628
I could not just tell her lies

352
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,632
because I know that is not right.

353
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,260
Your Majesty.

354
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,726
Your Majesty, it is time to offer
your greetings to the Grand Queen Dowager.

355
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,749
Where did Kim Ga-on go?

356
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,709
He was starting to grow on me.

357
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,711
Although he seemed a bit off,

358
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,005
Ga-on was better than him.

359
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,552
CLOSED

360
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,305
I heard that the eunuch hanged himself.

361
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,600
Don't even get me started.
He poisoned the late King's herbal tonic.

362
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,643
He did?

363
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:07,063
I hear his house is haunted.
Even his wife ran away.

364
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,356
-Let's hurry.
-Goodness.

365
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,919
Did you have a good night's sleep,
Grandmother?

366
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,506
I heard that you were together last night.

367
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,424
Did it go well?

368
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,267
You are quite blunt this morning.

369
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,812
You may think I am being a nosy old woman.

370
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,565
But I just want to see

371
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,068
my great-grandson
as soon as possible before I pass.

372
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,903
I hope you can be understanding.

373
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,242
Right. I heard that you are sending

374
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,120
Prince Wonsan
to relocate the placenta chamber.

375
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,374
Thinking about

376
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:12,420
Prince Jehyeon who has been banished
after losing his parents

377
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,465
prevents me from sleeping at night.

378
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:21,929
Now that Prince Wonsan is also leaving
for a place far away from the palace…

379
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,726
I do feel burdened by his departure.

380
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,022
I am sorry, Grandmother.

381
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:36,110
Why is the Chief State Councilor adamant
about driving out my family?

382
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,946
Perhaps…

383
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,241
I have lived for too long.

384
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,763
Thank you.

385
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:05,866
Listen. We always send out
the proper amount of rice for the armies.

386
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,577
Why does Hamgil Province
always tell us they got less?

387
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,248
This definitely means someone
secretly hoarded some of it.

388
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,960
Or someone was trying to secretly use
the cargo ship for a private matter.

389
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,337
So they loaded less rice on purpose.

390
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,548
It must be the Minister of Taxation.

391
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,676
Not that many people
have access to cargo ships.

392
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,303
Exactly!

393
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,264
Come here.

394
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,643
He has a stationery chest

395
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,979
he cherishes very much in his office.

396
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,106
It is an abode of demons.

397
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,232
The moment you open it…

398
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,944
Are you trying to ruin my life?

399
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,156
If you want to backbite,
do it somewhere else. Leave me out of it.

400
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,700
Why are you talking about that here?

401
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,578
You really changed.
You must want to live a long life.

402
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,792
You two. You'd better watch your mouths.

403
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,503
The Minister of Taxation is
on Lord Sangheon's side.

404
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,299
Everyone in the royal court
is on Lord Sangheon's side.

405
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,261
Pretend you are blind
and deaf regarding state affairs.

406
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,432
Unless you have extra lives,
you better watch your tongues.

407
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:16,103
You two are young.
Don't you want to work here for long?

408
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,777
Scribe Jung.
These are for the Royal History Archive.

409
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,695
Go and take them there.

410
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,784
I will be back.

411
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,053
-Wait here.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,252
Your Majesty.

413
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,884
How are things going in Yeoyeon?

414
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:16,182
As we expected, he has been
transporting weapons using cargo ships.

415
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,102
My grandfather must have been using
the Minister of Taxation.

416
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,565
I see. I will look into
the Ministry of Taxation on my end.

417
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,194
You must be very careful.

418
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,822
If Lord Sangheon finds out,
you will be in danger, Your Majesty.

419
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,578
Do not worry. He will not see this coming

420
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,458
as he thinks of me
as nothing but his puppet.

421
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,963
My grandfather is probably
still hiding the soldiers in Yeoyeon

422
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,925
so he can seize the palace
whenever he wants.

423
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,220
So we must expose his private army.

424
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,599
With evidence of his army
and the poison he used to kill my father,

425
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,435
I will be able to bring him down.

426
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,023
Did you find Eunuch Cho's missing wife?

427
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,610
I have been inquiring about her,
so we will find her soon.

428
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,532
I'm sure she knows something
about the poisoned herbal tonic.

429
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,116
That is why she ran away.

430
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,787
-Please make sure to find her.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

431
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,396
You should wait
a moment here before you go.

432
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,985
Eunuch Hong, may I ask
what are you doing here at this hour?

433
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,990
I'm just taking a walk.
This is the perfect weather for it.

434
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,410
This part of the palace
has a nice walking trail.

435
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,997
Why don't you join me for a walk?

436
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,374
I'll show you something amazing.

437
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,126
-All right. Come here.
-Wait.

438
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,961
-We can't.
-We're on patrol.

439
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,213
Come on. Why can't you go for a walk?

440
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,674
Come with me.
I'll show you something great.

441
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,720
You are all working very hard.

442
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,430
This part of the palace…

443
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,022
You must be doing something dangerous.

444
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,858
I heard that Lord Sangheon

445
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,694
banned Officer Yoon
from entering the palace.

446
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,574
Please forget everything…

447
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,244
you heard here tonight.

448
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,539
And should I forget…

449
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,543
the look on your face too?

450
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,218
Let us go to your quarters.

451
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,929
I will…

452
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,767
check your wound one last time.

453
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:31,168
You should be in the countryside.
Why are you here at this hour?

454
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,839
What about you?

455
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,176
I did not know you still came here.

456
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,897
From what I heard, Lord Sangheon
has been stopping the reports

457
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,316
from every province.

458
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,569
And he's been dismissing
anyone against him,

459
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,822
even putting away scholars.

460
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,241
How far will he go?

461
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,828
I do not know. Why are you asking me that?

462
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,626
Do you remember
what you told me here a long time ago?

463
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,170
You said we should not live a life

464
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,340
we would regret in our old age.

465
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,009
So tell me.

466
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,514
Have you ever regretted your decision?

467
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:31,562
Your decision to stand by Lord Sangheon.

468
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,150
I never had…

469
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,611
a chance to make a decision.

470
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,574
Unlike you who did.

471
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,205
Only people like you

472
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,751
who were born into noble families
had the chance to make decisions.

473
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,171
This was the only path I was given.

474
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,965
So I merely walked my path.

475
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,511
Even if I were to go back,

476
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,763
if this is the only path that remains,

477
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,391
I would be here again.

478
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,650
I will let you go tonight as a friend.

479
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,070
But I will not turn a blind eye next time.

480
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,039
Fortunately, it will not leave a scar.

481
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:19,211
But please continue to apply ointment
until it is fully healed, Your Majesty.

482
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,215
I will.

483
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,786
Please do not get hurt.

484
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,665
Not anymore.

485
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,190
Thank you for everything.

486
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,527
Please don't mention it.

487
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:30,741
But please check the wound
every three to four days just in case.

488
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,266
-Ji-un.
-Hyun.

489
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,776
I need to speak with you.

490
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,744
It's been a while
since we had drinks together like this.

491
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,289
Right.

492
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,012
I know that you asked
your father to get you a position

493
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,847
because of His Majesty.

494
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,811
I was relieved
that you treated His Majesty's wound.

495
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,981
Because you are
the only person I can trust.

496
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:53,740
Did you know about His Majesty all along?

497
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,007
That one-sided love I once mentioned.

498
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,510
You asked me who it was

499
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,012
and why I never pursued her.

500
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,767
It's His Majesty.

501
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,773
I realized what it meant
to like someone that I shouldn't like.

502
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,403
I couldn't show my affection
and had to suppress my feelings

503
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,113
without letting anyone see them.

504
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:38,910
I couldn't approach her
even if I wanted to.

505
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,078
If I had,

506
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,540
I would have put her in danger.

507
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,170
What I had were just feelings.

508
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,506
But…

509
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,426
she could get hurt because of them.

510
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,893
That is why I have only been watching her
for all these years

511
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,020
without telling my family

512
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,397
or you, my friend.

513
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,858
I kept it all to myself.

514
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,196
-Hyun.
-That's the consequence of loving someone

515
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,323
that you shouldn't.

516
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,575
So…

517
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,996
if you have the same feelings as me,

518
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,081
I hope

519
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,126
you will end it
before it gets more painful.

520
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,934
You are the only person
I can fully trust in this world,

521
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,896
and His Majesty is the only person
I will sacrifice my life for.

522
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,273
Should anything happen to His Majesty,

523
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:53,193
I will lose my mind.

524
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,471
<i>It is the same for me, Hyun.</i>

525
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,644
<i>His Majesty has become my whole world now.</i>

526
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,998
Did the cargo ship leave
for Hamgil Province?

527
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,416
Yes.

528
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,544
I loaded everything you asked for
and shipped them as instructed.

529
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:48,475
As we expected, he has been
transporting weapons using cargo ships.

530
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,064
DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

531
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,609
What is this?

532
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,987
Well, that is…

533
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,364
DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

534
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,698
This is…

535
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,750
It's the daily log of the ship
that transports rice for the armies.

536
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,753
Why do you have this?

537
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,881
The schedule of the cargo ship
going in and out of Hamgil Province

538
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,466
is inconsistent.

539
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,344
I saw a big discrepancy
between the amount of rice

540
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,055
listed in the ledger
and the recorded document.

541
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,647
As your former royal tutor,

542
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:39,150
I thought I ought to tell you about this.

543
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,619
Then I will take my leave now,
Your Majesty.

544
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,227
Did you give it to him?

545
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,437
Goodness.

546
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,816
Can you hear it?
I thought my heart was going to explode.

547
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,694
I was always afraid of His Majesty
even when I was his tutor.

548
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,362
How could you ask me to do this?

549
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,381
Do you have extra lives or something?

550
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,216
I thought your sense of virtue was gone.

551
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,886
That's why I confided in you
about the Minister's corruption.

552
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,514
Why did you steal
the ledger so foolishly like this? Gosh.

553
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,935
You are certain
nothing will happen to me, right?

554
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,479
Do not worry.

555
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,857
His Majesty will take care of it.

556
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,859
If this was important to His Majesty,

557
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,361
why didn't you give it to him?
Why did you ask me?

558
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,574
Well, I made a promise to him.

559
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,745
Please keep this a secret to the end.

560
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,626
DAILY LOG OF CARGO SHIPS

561
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:48,947
Commander Jung.
Why have you come to see me at this hour?

562
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,907
A long time ago,

563
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,202
I heard that there was a way
to stop someone from breathing

564
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,247
for a moment through acupuncture.

565
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,085
Is that really possible?

566
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,294
Pardon?

567
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,390
I was able to discreetly
hand over the ledger to Officer Yoon.

568
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,852
Well done.

569
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:22,480
But may I ask why you seem so down?

570
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,649
Did something happen in the afternoon?

571
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,110
No.

572
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,156
I have a lot on my mind.
I just want to go for a walk in peace.

573
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,993
Should I escort you to your usual path?

574
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,622
No one was there,
so I felt peaceful there.

575
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,667
It's dangerous there when it gets dark.

576
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,508
Goodness.

577
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,018
What? Who on earth
put these lanterns here?

578
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,978
My goodness.

579
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,192
Oh, my. Who would…

580
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,615
Goodness.

581
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,159
All these lanterns…

582
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,419
Your Majesty.

583
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:31,109
Why did you light the lanterns?

584
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,447
If you trip and fall, you would get hurt.

585
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,200
You always choose

586
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,161
a path that is not safe.

587
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,124
I wanted to light your path in some way.

588
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,780
My wound…

589
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,870
has fully healed.

590
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,915
I see.

591
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,422
It has fully healed.

592
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,610
I cannot be certain, but some say
that one could stop someone's pulse

593
01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:00,281
<i>by blocking an acupuncture point
on the back of the neck.</i>

594
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,467
If you want…

595
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,265
you may stay at the palace a bit longer.

596
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,353
If it is all right with you…

597
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,691
I…

598
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,614
would like to be with you a bit longer.

599
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,007
I've been waiting

600
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,510
for you to say that.

601
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,890
Had you taken any longer…

602
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,656
Even if you did,

603
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,868
I would have waited.

604
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,497
No matter how long.

605
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,818
{\an8}<i>His Majesty is so good-looking.</i>

606
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,736
{\an8}<i>You must have been very tired.</i>

607
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,406
{\an8}Are you jealous right now?

608
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,242
{\an8}<i>You promised to never get angry.</i>

609
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:32,577
{\an8}<i>Was Dam-i her name?</i>

610
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,370
{\an8}Were you able to meet her
when you returned?

611
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,832
{\an8}<i>I am the assassin
who attacked you at the royal hunting.</i>

612
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,750
{\an8}What is it that you saw?

613
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,253
{\an8}<i>Is it absolutely necessary
to take it that far?</i>

614
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:46,173
{\an8}<i>I cannot condone even a single mistake.</i>

615
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:55,266
