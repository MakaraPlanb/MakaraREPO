1
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,475
PREVIOUSLY…

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,602
<i>Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?</i>

3
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un of the Crown Prince</i>

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,982
<i>is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?</i>

5
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,859
<i>-No.</i>
-Your Royal Highness!

6
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>Why do you have this book?</i>

7
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>That girl must have been someone
quite special to you.</i>

8
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,619
-She was my first love.
<i>-You have a big problem!</i>

9
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,872
<i>The Minister of Personnel
lodged an appeal for your resignation.</i>

10
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>For my resignation?
I'm in need of your help.</i>

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,668
You are the only person
who can help me now.

12
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,504
<i>There is nothing I can do for you.</i>

13
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,464
<i>So I advise you to stop asking.</i>

14
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,925
<i>You could have punished just me
from the beginning.</i>

15
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,844
<i>Why are you torturing my innocent friends
and putting everyone in danger?</i>

16
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,596
<i>Moreover, he deceived
me and the Crown Prince.</i>

17
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,556
<i>The degree of his crime is quite severe.</i>

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,351
<i>Who is going to get killed?</i>

19
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,563
<i>I order you as the Crown Prince.
Hand over the prisoners.</i>

20
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>If you do, no one will shed
a drop of blood here tonight.</i>

21
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,993
{\an8}Allow me…

22
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,123
{\an8}to answer that question.

23
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,824
{\an8}I was the one…

24
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,243
who moved the prisoners.

25
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,668
I was taught that prisons are where
prisoners receive punishment,

26
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,045
not where they are meant to die.

27
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,257
Despite that objective of His Majesty's,

28
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,719
their living conditions
have become horrendous

29
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,556
and have led to prisoners starving
or freezing to death.

30
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:06,769
It is why I seek forgiveness
regarding the unsanctioned transfer

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,855
of said prisoners.

32
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,821
You dare interrupt today's ruling

33
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,532
to notify me of this frivolous matter?

34
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,830
Your Majesty, I have urgent information

35
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,666
regarding the incidents at Samgaebang.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,128
This is not a matter His Royal Highness
should involve himself in.

37
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,588
I'll allow it.

38
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,965
Speak.

39
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,432
Royal Tutor Jung never disobeyed
the custom of our class system.

40
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,893
Those who actually did…

41
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,271
are them.

42
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,528
Enter.

43
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,917
One is a herb gatherer

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,003
who supplied pharmacies within the capital

45
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,216
and one is the custodian
of Literary Licentiate Choi's storage.

46
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,971
Repeat to His Majesty what you told me.

47
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,310
The accusation that
the physician of Samgaebang

48
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:34,274
only prescribed pricey medicine
is a false one.

49
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:39,279
Literary Licentiate Choi over here
bought all the medicinal herbs

50
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,698
available from villages

51
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,450
and stocked them in the storage he owns.

52
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,161
Regardless of age,
people started dying left and right

53
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,289
due to a lack of medicine.

54
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,002
After learning the truth, Physician Jung
found herbs that provide similar remedies

55
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,837
and made them affordable.

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,840
It resulted in the price drop
of the herbs in storage

57
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,675
which prompted this accusation.

58
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,637
Is this all true?

59
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,182
Of course not, Chief State Councilor!
I'm being falsely accused.

60
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,268
No, we speak the truth!

61
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,813
I have a ledger that lists
all transactions of the herbs.

62
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,273
MEDICINAL HERB INVENTORY LEDGER

63
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,907
Unlike the rumors surrounding Samgaebang,

64
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,786
you are saying it was a place
that helped the unfortunate.

65
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,372
It never indulged in foul play either.

66
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,292
Yes, but I guess

67
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:40,882
that depends on what you view
as following the rules and being dutiful.

68
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:47,013
All I want to say is that it's a place
that didn't go against the justice

69
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,308
I wish to promote in this nation.

70
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,604
<i>And Royal Tutor Jung shares
the very same values.</i>

71
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:03,446
I also believe His Royal Highness' claims
to be true, Your Majesty.

72
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,240
But you were the one

73
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,744
who first raised questions
regarding this matter!

74
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,456
Please forgive me for acting rashly

75
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:18,002
without taking a deeper look
into the underlying truth, Your Majesty.

76
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,226
I hear you.
However, that was not the only issue.

77
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,479
Jung Ji-un became a royal tutor

78
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,773
without disclosing his prior operations.

79
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,991
If I dare say so, Royal Tutor Jung
never lied about his past endeavors.

80
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,539
I accepted his teaching
while aware of his past,

81
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:00,086
and I'm sure you remember
that I informed you of this matter.

82
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,717
But you chose not to listen to me.

83
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,636
In the end,

84
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,806
you were the one who moved forward
with appointing him as my tutor.

85
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,559
So if anyone's to blame,

86
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,188
it would be Your Majesty
and the high officials of the court

87
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,068
who did not properly conduct
a background check.

88
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,704
So us being negligent is to blame?

89
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,724
Do not forget.

90
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,685
The path I choose

91
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,272
will be your path.

92
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,734
And if you deviate from that path,

93
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,361
I will not forgive you,

94
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,448
no matter how much I adore you.

95
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,046
I wish to take

96
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,049
that path with you.

97
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,184
Aren't you curious

98
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,604
as to in what way…

99
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,107
I wish to follow your lead?

100
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,124
Is the Crown Prince ready
to fight his battle?

101
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,443
EPISODE 7

102
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,018
Thank you so much.

103
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,688
Your gratitude should be extended
to His Royal Highness, not me.

104
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,577
Your Royal Highness,

105
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,497
no words can possibly convey my gratitude.

106
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,002
There is no need to thank me.

107
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,463
I just could not sit idly by

108
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,424
when I knew the truth.

109
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,262
If you head to Seorin-bang,

110
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,642
you'll be able to reunite
with your assistants.

111
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,081
I had no idea you'd take action
in solving this issue.

112
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,834
Well…

113
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,004
He's your friend, isn't he?

114
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,465
And he's also…

115
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,343
my tutor.

116
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:30,064
JEONOKSEO

117
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,619
-Ji-un.
-Ji-un!

118
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,745
Ji-un.

119
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,839
You obtained the Crown Prince's trust
in a short amount of time.

120
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,677
I'd expect no less
from someone as prodigious as you.

121
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,140
If you ever harm them again--

122
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,558
I won't force you…

123
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,894
to find a place within the royal court.

124
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,232
But don't you dare think about
being a hack of a physician again.

125
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,778
For your sake
and your mother's especially.

126
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:23,742
Just remember that it isn't easy
to cope with your one and only son

127
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,454
being chewed out.

128
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,113
My lady!

129
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,325
My lady, the night is deep.

130
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,037
-My lady, where are you headed?
-Stop this. I can't take it anymore.

131
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,872
-My lady, it's dangerous.
-Let go!

132
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,624
-My lady.
-I won't let this slide.

133
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,293
-But it's dangerous.
-What could be so dangerous?

134
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,670
-Let go of me!
-My lady!

135
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,755
Let go.

136
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,055
-Those blabbermouths--
-I knew it.

137
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,142
I was wondering whose voice was so loud.

138
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,103
Ji-un!

139
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,148
Gosh. Are you all right? Are you?

140
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,691
Of course I am.

141
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,278
My lady, your shoes don't match.

142
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,406
You can give me those
and go about your business.

143
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,999
Did the ladies in Bukchon
speak ill of me again?

144
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,960
No, that's not it.

145
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,465
They once loved to pass around
the medicine you prescribed,

146
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,676
but now they're saying ridiculous things.

147
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,512
They're obviously jealous
that you became a royal tutor,

148
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,347
so how can I let them carry on?

149
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,895
That's feisty coming from
the inspector's better half.

150
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,650
From what I hear, you used to be
the most timid maiden in the village.

151
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,237
My one and only son made me
a salty woman, that's why.

152
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,786
Until when will you find shelter
elsewhere from home?

153
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,247
It's time you moved back in.

154
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,376
Your father is gravely worried about you.

155
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,049
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,764
Goodness, I repeated the same thing again.

157
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,352
Just come by whenever you want to.
Like today.

158
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,396
Your room is still as it was.

159
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,234
Success doesn't mean
finding work at the palace.

160
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,696
Doing what you love and being happy
is the definition of a successful life.

161
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,158
So don't let others intimidate you

162
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,076
and live your life as you wish.

163
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,871
Don't let others dictate your life.
Do you hear me?

164
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,654
What…

165
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,954
Weren't you going to leave the palace

166
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,831
once you saved your assistants?

167
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,461
How could I possibly leave
when you went through so much

168
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,004
to clear my name?

169
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,092
I decided to stay where my heart lies
for a while longer.

170
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,885
Your heart?

171
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,180
I seem to have had
the wrong idea about you.

172
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,266
I let your nicknames
Five Step Prince and Ice Prince

173
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,894
cloud my judgment

174
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,439
and assumed that
you were audacious and cold-hearted.

175
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,360
However, that wasn't the case.

176
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,449
Your generosity knows no limit,
Your Royal Highness.

177
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:37,121
You could have easily been written about
in this Confucian classic.

178
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,041
<i>A cold-hearted soul</i>

179
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,086
who doesn't bat an eye
even at the sight of death?

180
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,382
No, that was only a preposterous rumor.

181
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,427
I'm living proof of it, don't you agree?

182
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,636
That being said,

183
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,808
why was His Royal Highness
given the nickname Ice Prince?

184
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,812
Because his heart
is icy cold all year round--

185
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,150
Ice is clear and sparkles under the sun.

186
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,236
It is more elegant than any other jewel.

187
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,321
And that is the origin

188
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,074
behind his nickname the Ice Prince!

189
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,088
Why does it feel like there's a chance
of him getting a promotion before me?

190
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,854
Your Royal Highness.

191
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,276
Your Royal Highness.

192
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,613
We have fine weather today.

193
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,257
Isn't it nice to enjoy
a lecture outside for a change?

194
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,302
You should watch where you're going.

195
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,514
Walking backward will surely
make you trip and fall into a pond.

196
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,810
I'm more sturdy and nimble
than people think

197
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,687
which is why I have never tripped before--

198
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,855
Goodness!

199
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,007
Your Royal Highness.

200
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,521
How cool.

201
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,528
Wait for me, Your Royal Highness!

202
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,249
{\an8}THE WATER IS COLD AND THE NIGHT IS CHILLY

203
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,257
{\an8}WITH WIND…

204
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,564
What have you been
taking your time writing?

205
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,507
<i>WELCOME RAIN ON A SPRING NIGHT</i>

206
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,344
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

207
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,767
"A good rain knows its seasons right."

208
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,855
I don't think
I properly expressed my gratitude

209
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,192
for the help I received.

210
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,405
Like the good rain
that falls when most needed,

211
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,785
I will be someone who you can count on.

212
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,208
Just like you were to me
when I needed you the most.

213
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,188
Goodness.

214
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,947
It's raining, Your Royal Highness.

215
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,992
Perfect timing, don't you think?

216
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,979
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

217
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,525
Your Royal Highness, it's Bok-dong.

218
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,822
What is this about?

219
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:09,619
Oh, Court Lady Kim ordered me
to check if you're set for the night.

220
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,747
I see.

221
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,506
-By the way, Bok-dong.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

222
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,301
It's about Royal Tutor Jung.

223
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,056
Has he been getting along
with those at the royal institute?

224
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:33,060
You have no idea. Life at the palace
must be like second nature to him now

225
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,521
considering how he brings them alcohol
and gladly trades shifts.

226
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:41,359
He is as amiable as they get
and is highly praised by the rest.

227
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,403
You can tell

228
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,907
that he's nothing like his father
from the way he acts toward you.

229
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,035
Why do you ask about him though?

230
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,955
What? No reason.

231
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,628
If you're done, dismiss yourself already.

232
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,090
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
I wish you a good night.

233
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,193
A GOOD RAIN KNOWS ITS SEASONS RIGHT

234
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,579
Since His Majesty is in poor health,

235
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,916
it might not be a bad idea
for the Crown Prince

236
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,876
to greet the envoys.

237
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,881
I'm well aware of your desire
to give more authority

238
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,509
to His Royal Highness.

239
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,887
Then I'll trust that

240
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:56,518
you will make a formal request
to His Majesty.

241
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,897
But I hope you don't think
that I will blindly act

242
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,941
according to your desires.

243
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,779
It's what I noticed with the incident
involving the royal tutor,

244
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,575
but lately,

245
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,495
I haven't been pleased about you

246
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,873
overstepping your authority.

247
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,180
Overstepping my authority?

248
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,015
I…

249
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,728
{\an8}vowed my allegiance to the former king

250
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,605
{\an8}with blood on my lips.

251
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,400
{\an8}How could you possibly say such a thing

252
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,154
when I put my life on the line
to help him take the throne?

253
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,698
I understand your fondness
for the Crown Prince,

254
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,452
but His Majesty is also
someone you must serve.

255
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,664
If you offend him in any way,
you will answer to me.

256
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,585
Your Highness, then wouldn't it
only be fair that you lead by example?

257
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,838
What?

258
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,927
More and more key officials
are being appointed in your favor.

259
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,472
You should never forget

260
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:21,061
that it is I who have been
considerate of your desire

261
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,438
to give your family power.

262
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,108
You dare threaten me?

263
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,985
Of course not, Your Highness.

264
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,571
All I want

265
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,658
is for those after
His Royal Highness' crown

266
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,410
to no longer be a threat.

267
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,332
That is all.

268
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,751
Therefore…

269
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,049
I suggest we refrain from
pointless squabbles, Your Highness.

270
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,527
A foot disorder?

271
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,865
-Has Father's foot disease returned?
-Yes.

272
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,119
His Majesty has been overwhelmed
with state affairs

273
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,079
and his prognosis isn't good.

274
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,885
Aside from Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong,

275
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,637
he's the first to protect you
from close proximity.

276
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,514
Hasn't it been uncomfortable?

277
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,768
I should learn to get used to it.

278
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,938
I cannot forever be served
by only Court Lady Kim and Eunuch Hong.

279
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,857
Right.

280
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,588
Your Majesty.

281
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,342
Leave the herbal tonic.

282
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,315
Father.

283
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,944
It is I.

284
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,322
I see. What brings you by?

285
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,035
I would like to make a request.

286
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,964
Please let me be
in charge of receiving the envoys.

287
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,845
Aren't you aware of
that being Prince Jaeun's responsibility?

288
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,181
Actually, I was hoping

289
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,602
to greet them in your place
when they arrive at the palace.

290
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:54,149
I'm aware that the same request
came from the Queen Dowager as well.

291
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,025
And who says that is what I want?

292
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,991
I will greet the envoys
according to custom.

293
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,201
You are dismissed.

294
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,207
Father,

295
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,962
do you still not have faith in me?

296
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:25,638
I am well aware that you were against
my installation as Crown Prince.

297
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,891
Was it…

298
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,603
because of my maternal grandfather?

299
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,563
Or…

300
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,775
was it…

301
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,986
because of Gyeom?

302
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,404
What is your reason…

303
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,033
for bringing that up after all this time?

304
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:50,163
I understand that
you find my grandfather to be difficult.

305
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,584
But this is what I want for myself.

306
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,173
I ask you

307
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,843
to put your faith in me this time.

308
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,929
I…

309
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,433
won't let you down.

310
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,183
He sure is adorable.

311
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,312
There is something
quite adorable about him.

312
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,819
How are preparations coming along
at the guesthouses for the envoys?

313
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,364
Have you heard from the governor who went
to Uiju to accompany the envoys?

314
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,535
You should pace yourself and take it easy.

315
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,621
I am taking His Majesty's place.

316
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,332
There can be no room for error.

317
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,589
Let your mind rest for now.
We have to be at the market soon.

318
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,466
I will first retrieve
the report sent by the governor.

319
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,440
Your Royal Highness.

320
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,446
I hear lectures have been canceled
to focus on greeting the envoys.

321
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,366
Yes, I'm afraid I won't be able
to attend for the time being.

322
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,201
I see.

323
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,207
Since you're busy, I'll keep it short.

324
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,377
Not even the legendary physician Hua Tuo
has seen these pills

325
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,088
which were made
with a drop of dragon tears--

326
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,634
Do you have nothing to do?
Why don't I ask Royal Scholar Yang to--

327
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,553
Hardly. I actually have
urgent business to address.

328
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,852
Take some when you are having
a difficult time.

329
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,231
It will give you courage
and relieve you of anxiety.

330
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,402
Then…

331
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,530
Oh, right.

332
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,097
Was it Royal Tutor Jung who just came by?

333
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,186
No one can match his anti-climactic ways.

334
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,249
They are all of good quality.

335
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,875
As if.

336
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,086
Let me take a look
since I know a thing or two.

337
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,886
I'll take this one.

338
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,937
Have them delivered to Samgaebang.

339
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,108
This one right here.

340
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,653
And this as well as this.

341
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,576
-You know what? Just send them all.
-Yes, my lady.

342
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,169
They are all to be sent to Samgaebang?

343
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,255
Like I said, I owe them that much.

344
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,636
What on earth?

345
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,982
You must be the type
to apologize with gifts rather than words.

346
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,612
Oh, well…

347
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,450
Wait, is that wrong?

348
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,288
I'm apologizing for my wrongdoing
by buying them what they need the most.

349
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,000
I only do so because I can afford it.

350
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,672
I'm just saying.

351
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,345
Anyway, why are you carrying around
that hand plow?

352
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:02,266
Oh, this? I'm looking
for some flowers to plant.

353
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,770
I can't afford to buy them
like someone I know,

354
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,814
so I must acquire them myself.

355
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,360
Wait.

356
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,783
Forgive me.

357
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,121
For putting you in a predicament, I mean.

358
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,165
I wanted to apologize in person,

359
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,544
but I couldn't muster up the courage.

360
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,508
Why are you laughing?

361
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,928
Well, because I was only joking.

362
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,306
Besides, you shouldn't apologize.

363
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,227
It's not like you told lies
just to get me into trouble.

364
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,688
Never did I think

365
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,191
you'd be a fun person to tease.

366
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,506
Let's see.

367
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,688
Why do you wish to plant flowers
within the palace grounds though?

368
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,484
Well, they're pretty. That's why.

369
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:13,272
We should hang up more square lanterns
to light up the streets more.

370
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,149
-Will do, Your Royal Highness.
-Good.

371
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,485
And the decorations?

372
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,988
They should also be prepared accordingly.

373
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,335
What's the matter?

374
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,963
Oh.

375
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,590
It's nothing.

376
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,614
Do you know them?

377
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,325
Yes, he is--

378
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,957
I mean, they are colleagues I work with.

379
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,169
I see. Do you work
at the royal institute then?

380
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,089
Well, I guess.

381
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,299
I see.

382
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,010
May I ask who we're speaking to?

383
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,846
Oh, forgive my belated introduction.

384
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,347
I am Shin So-eun.

385
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,311
There are no other empty seats,

386
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,231
-so go ahead--
-Actually, since we ran into each other,

387
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,192
why don't we sit down for a meal?

388
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,029
Four bowls of soup with rice, please.

389
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,511
Didn't you say you were busy?

390
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:13,684
Never did I imagine you having
an affectionate side, Royal Tutor Jung.

391
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,646
Affectionate?

392
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,191
How pretty.

393
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,401
The flowers, I mean.

394
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,489
Oh, these.

395
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,451
He spared me a few.

396
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,289
Anyway, how do you two know each other?

397
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,958
Well, that's…

398
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,462
It's a very long story.

399
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,963
Here's the food you ordered.

400
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,217
Goodness. We should eat first.

401
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,599
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

402
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,977
All right. Allow me to add a spoonful.

403
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,152
-Allow me.
-It's fine. I'll do it myself.

404
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,571
This is more of my specialty,
so let me do it.

405
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,198
I said it's fine!

406
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,337
Goodness. Are you all right?

407
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,139
I'll do it myself.

408
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,149
Lord Jung, your sleeves are also stained.

409
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,527
I'm… I'm fine, but…

410
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,847
GWANGHWAMUN

411
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,994
I guess it's been a while
since you set foot

412
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,663
in your homeland.

413
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,042
Homeland? What a joke.

414
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,846
NOKUNGAK

415
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,306
We did our best
to make your stay here with us

416
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,559
as comfortable as possible.

417
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,062
I do hope everything is up to par.

418
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,481
We appreciate all you have done for us.

419
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:53,445
You can speak more at ease now
for we have prepared much as well.

420
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,829
This ornamental knife
has accompanied us from Ming.

421
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,164
It's a lucky one, don't you think?

422
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,125
I'd rather rest, so please leave us.

423
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,058
I'm sure you're aware that a new emperor
ascended to the throne a year ago.

424
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,563
From what I hear,
those two played a major role.

425
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,858
This way, please.

426
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,444
They await you.

427
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,039
I'm glad you're here.

428
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,376
Why is Lord Sangheon meeting
with Royal Tutor Jung?

429
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,676
Royal Tutor Jung has
a history with the Vice Minister of Rites,

430
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,054
so he must be here to greet him.

431
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,473
Would you like to join them?

432
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,935
And say what at an uninvited event?

433
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,271
I'd only be interrupting them.

434
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,358
I heard I was urgently summoned.

435
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,902
Was it by you?

436
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,370
I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.

437
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,538
I'm the one who had you summoned.

438
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,449
Physician Jung!

439
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,080
It's been too long.

440
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,041
What brings you here?

441
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:21,051
I couldn't locate you in Ming,
so I thought the Left State Councilor

442
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,345
was pulling my leg
when he said he'd let me meet you.

443
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,639
Who knew we'd meet again like this?

444
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,977
Left State Councilor, I'm truly grateful.

445
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,481
To find out that one of my people
saved your life

446
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,317
was a great shock on my part.

447
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:41,155
I guess this is what destiny looks like.

448
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,494
As if that even qualifies
as saving one's life.

449
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,872
That's a little dramatic.

450
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,379
I'm afraid I must apologize.

451
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,674
Duty calls at
the Office of the Inspector General.

452
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,043
Physician Jung,
allow me to pour you a drink.

453
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,340
It truly has been too long.

454
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,800
I agree.

455
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,289
So the rumors about
the Left State Councilor

456
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,166
being the richest in Joseon were true.

457
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,547
Then tell me. What is it that he wants?

458
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,343
He was hoping to be given permission
to develop the land in Yeoyeon.

459
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,511
Yeoyeon?

460
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,099
Barbarians constantly invade that land.
Why would he want to develop…

461
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,810
I see.

462
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,399
He wishes to build an army under
the pretense of protecting the border.

463
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,775
How greedy of him.

464
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,696
Let him know
that he does not need to worry.

465
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,321
Thank you for the warm welcome.

466
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:31,033
However, if you had focused
more of your energy

467
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,578
on the roads leading to Joseon,

468
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,081
I wouldn't be so fatigued from the trip.

469
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,879
That means we'd be clearing a path
for the barbarians up north,

470
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,299
which is why we've been hesitant.

471
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,720
You still should have
cleared a road to Ming though.

472
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:56,350
Developing the land in Yeoyeon will make
trading with Ming less demanding.

473
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,769
That place is
a strategic point for our defense.

474
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,480
Hasty decisions cannot be made.

475
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,899
That's why I'm offering my assistance.

476
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:07,152
I will mention the issues
regarding Yeoyeon to the Emperor,

477
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,280
so all I suggest is that
you send a quick response.

478
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,349
Goodness.

479
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,644
Isn't she beautiful?

480
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,646
Especially the one in the second row.

481
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,159
Is there a girl who has caught your eye?

482
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,453
Please do not hesitate to tell me.

483
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,039
It can be ten or a hundred.
I'll make sure you receive them tonight.

484
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,670
I hear that girls sent as offerings
are quite adored.

485
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:52,174
One of them was blessed
into becoming an imperial concubine.

486
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,427
The girl to serve you tonight

487
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,971
will also be a lucky one.

488
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,725
I see.

489
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,312
So I can have my pick of girls?

490
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,938
Your request is my command.

491
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:12,486
From what I hear,
your wife's beauty is blinding.

492
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,322
Could I take her back with me?

493
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,866
Pardon?

494
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,786
Goodness. That was quite the jest.

495
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,209
A jest?

496
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,380
Then were you taunting me just now?

497
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,676
Being sent to Ming as an offering
is an honor

498
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,263
but not when it comes to your own family?

499
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:44,100
No, that is not what I meant.

500
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,196
What is the meaning of this?

501
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,535
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

502
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:06,039
It's just that this man
made promises to me that he can't keep.

503
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:12,128
I will punish him accordingly
once I gather all the facts,

504
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,047
so please let your anger subside.

505
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,717
Goodness. What is there
to investigate and find out?

506
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,052
If needed,

507
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,305
he can be executed on the spot.

508
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,766
Wait. But…

509
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,229
Please spare my life!

510
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,607
That is enough.

511
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,406
You are in the palace of Joseon.

512
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,951
His Majesty stated
that he'd get to the truth,

513
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,203
so let our system take over.

514
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,417
Leave and await your ruling.

515
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,460
Yes, Your Royal Highness!

516
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,810
This isn't your place.

517
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,731
Allow me to greet you.

518
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,656
I am Jung Ji-un,
a royal tutor at the royal institute.

519
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,868
You seem to be upset
at this festive banquet,

520
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,328
so I'd like to serve you a drink.

521
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,788
Would you accept it?

522
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,174
Please don't be like that
and accept this drink.

523
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:44,512
I'd consider it a great honor.

524
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,854
You speak out of place
knowing that you are favored

525
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,356
by the Vice Minister of Rites.

526
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,955
Get lost.

527
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:20,048
Because the drink was from you,

528
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,424
it was divine.

529
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,718
Is that so?

530
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,221
Then have some more.

531
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,100
That's about enough.

532
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,521
Do you not realize
that you're dishonoring the Emperor

533
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,022
by not showing courtesy?

534
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,236
Yes, that is enough.

535
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,955
So this is where you were,
Your Royal Highness.

536
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:47,886
Did you have to make me feel uneasy
by doing what I didn't order you to do?

537
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,390
It was an important banquet.

538
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,310
I was only worried
that things would escalate.

539
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,605
It is not your job to worry about me.

540
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,068
Pretend you didn't see anything

541
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,528
or hear anything from now on.

542
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,989
That is how you will be.

543
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,289
Wait. There's another child.
Go and get him.

544
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,624
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

545
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,252
Sit down.

546
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,753
I said sit down.

547
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,905
It is not your job to worry about me.

548
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:17,076
Is this what you serve as food?

549
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,997
Is there a problem?

550
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,624
That'd be my question to you.

551
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,961
What you served is nothing but waste.

552
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,838
What is one supposed to eat?

553
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,596
Forgive me.

554
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,891
I had the kitchen prepare what you enjoy,

555
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,935
but they must not suit your palate.

556
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,604
Prepare the food again.

557
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,564
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

558
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:57,534
Has a decision been made regarding
the man who taunted me last night?

559
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,954
His mouth should have been
ripped at the corners

560
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,164
to stop him from spewing nonsense.

561
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,085
The Office of the Inspector General
is reviewing the case.

562
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:10,505
He will be severely punished
once they come to a ruling,

563
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,674
so please let your anger subside.

564
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,802
How about you just
let me deal with him instead?

565
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:19,973
Executing the punishment myself
means less work for you.

566
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:24,352
Even a man guilty of treason
is punished by law and custom.

567
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,312
So I suggest…

568
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,357
you drop this.

569
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,697
Acting tough, are we?

570
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,827
What…

571
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,997
did you just say?

572
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:44,956
What do you mean?

573
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,384
What was that?

574
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,514
You dare treat me with disdain?

575
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,394
How dare you communicate
in code in my presence!

576
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,065
That… That is not true, my lord.

577
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,484
Communicating in code?
That is hardly true.

578
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,696
I will have the food served again.

579
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,489
Follow me.

580
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,251
How dare you follow him out.

581
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,713
Damned wench, you just
don't know your place, do you?

582
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,507
Court Lady Kim!

583
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,845
What are you doing?

584
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,726
As you can see,
I'm teaching her some manners.

585
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,604
Why? Does this require
proper procedure too?

586
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,194
Do you know what I despise the most?

587
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,864
Words or actions of disrespect
which you just showed.

588
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,408
Today, you will be taught some manners.

589
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,969
Court Lady Kim!

590
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,388
Court Lady Kim…

591
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,639
Oh, no.

592
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,516
My gosh.

593
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,484
Court Lady Kim…

594
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,529
Your Royal Highness…

595
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,489
Your Royal Highness…

596
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:53,668
- Your Royal Highness, you must not!
- Your Royal Highness, you must not!

597
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,771
You must not do this.
Your Royal Highness, no!

598
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:22,363
Oh, no. Your Royal Highness…

599
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,973
{\an8}<i>Your Royal Highness,
you did the right thing.</i>

600
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,434
{\an8}<i>If you are disgruntled,
take it up with me.</i>

601
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,102
{\an8}<i>Leave the innocent alone.</i>

602
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,064
{\an8}<i>People like you are hypocrites
who pretend to care for the people.</i>

603
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,441
{\an8}<i>And I want to destroy people like you.</i>

604
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,610
{\an8}<i>You saw someone suspicious
in the Chief Eunuch's chambers?</i>

605
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,946
{\an8}<i>I must look into the Chief Eunuch.</i>

606
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,906
{\an8}<i>Until the day you leave Joseon,</i>

607
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,408
{\an8}<i>security at this guesthouse
will be strengthened.</i>

608
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,787
{\an8}<i>If you ever go after her,
I will make you pay for it!</i>

609
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,997
{\an8}<i>Thank you for helping me.</i>

610
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,000
{\an8}<i>I would like to continue to do so
by your side.</i>

611
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,962
{\an8}<i>That is only if you will allow it,
Your Royal Highness.</i>

612
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:05,842
