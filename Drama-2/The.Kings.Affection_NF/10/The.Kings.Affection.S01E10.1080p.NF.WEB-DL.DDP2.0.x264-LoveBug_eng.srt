{\an8}LIST OF COURT MAIDS

2
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,116
{\an8}YEAR OF <i>IMJIN</i>

3
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,868
{\an8}"Year of <i>Imjin</i>."

4
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,624
{\an8}And your stance must be wider.

5
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,583
{\an8}Who are you?

6
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,378
{\an8}It's me, Hyun.

7
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,006
{\an8}Hyun?

8
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,302
{\an8}YANG SUN-JI

DAM-I

12
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,187
{\an8}DAY 21 OF MONTH 4,
LEFT THE PALACE DUE TO ILLNESS

13
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,980
She left due to an illness?

14
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,108
Does the record specify the illness?

15
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,320
This is all we have on a girl named Dam-i.

16
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,907
Usually, the illness is specified.

17
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,619
But for some reason,
there is no record of it.

18
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,164
If I may, can I ask why you wish to know?

19
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,374
Never mind.

20
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,673
DAM-I

21
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,529
The Crown Prince had
the book I gave to the girl.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,322
The Crown Prince?

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,675
No one can match his anti-climactic ways.

24
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,975
Was that the reason, Your Royal Highness?

25
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,748
I thought it was a dream.

26
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,042
However…

27
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,546
it wasn't…

28
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,090
STAY, LONGING

29
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,051
…a dream.

30
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:46,267
I will believe you
if you say the feelings were momentary.

31
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,435
But…

32
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,606
it wasn't for me.

33
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,026
It wasn't admiration from a subject.

34
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,819
I thought it was my loyalty to you.

35
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,447
But it was affection.

36
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,287
I have a deep affection for you,
Your Royal Highness.

37
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,335
Although you're a man
and the Crown Prince of this nation,

38
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,796
I…

39
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,427
love you.

40
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,246
Royal Tutor Jung.

41
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,502
We…

42
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,464
cannot be together.

43
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,302
I am the Crown Prince of this nation,

44
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,555
and you are my subject.

45
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,349
I will endure it.

46
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,145
Whatever people say… No.

47
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,315
Whatever you say,

48
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,734
I will…

49
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,237
endure it all.

50
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,958
I don't…

51
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,004
feel the same way.

52
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,425
Whatever you think you felt from me,
I ask you to please…

53
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,636
forget about that night.

54
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,722
-Your Royal Highness.
-We never…

55
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,892
had this conversation.

56
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,347
EPISODE 10

57
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,600
JASEONDANG

58
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,830
<i>Perhaps,</i>

59
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,126
<i>it might have been better
if we had never met again.</i>

60
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>If we hadn't,</i>

61
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,883
<i>we wouldn't have had
to be in such pain like this.</i>

62
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,375
YEON-SEON

63
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,632
<i>Ji-un!</i>

64
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,259
You should come on out!

65
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,760
Hurry!

66
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,138
What is it?

67
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,659
What…

68
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,832
What brings you here?

69
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,585
You're a late riser.

70
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,088
Can't you see that
the sun has fully risen in the sky?

71
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,311
What do you mean
His Royal Highness isn't at the palace?

72
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:44,232
He must know that the Queen Dowager
is expecting to see him this afternoon.

73
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,151
He does know. He is aware,

74
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,404
but something urgent came up.

75
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,241
How could you let this happen?

76
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,036
Where did His Royal Highness go?

77
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,331
I must go now
and escort him back to the palace.

78
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,502
The Crown Prince went out
in disguise to look around.

79
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,837
Naturally, he didn't have a destination.

80
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,591
His bodyguard went with him.

81
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,261
So you don't have to worry.

82
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,596
And I told the bodyguard, Kim Ga-on,

83
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,266
to stay very close to the Crown Prince.

84
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,101
He does everything I ask of him now.

85
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,665
You cannot enter
the Crown Prince's quarters today.

86
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,253
Better yet.
You should go home for the day.

87
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:51,173
You went to the market
with the Crown Prince today.

88
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,592
Do you understand?

89
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,929
If Court Lady Kim sees you,
you and I are dead meat.

90
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,139
What is this about?

91
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,935
Lord Jaeun.

92
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,396
Did the Crown Prince leave the palace?

93
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,690
Well, it's not what you think.

94
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,119
Enjoy.

95
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,502
Aren't you going to eat?

96
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,674
I will.

97
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,385
Right. Hold on.

98
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,772
It's ready now.

99
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,192
But…

100
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,944
what really brings you here?

101
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,407
I doubt you came out
for a mere bowl of soup.

102
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,787
I did.

103
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,125
I couldn't stop thinking about this soup.

104
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,213
Do you mean that?

105
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,301
The soup will get cold. We should eat now.

106
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,132
A bag of that, please.

107
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,677
Can you buy this for me?

108
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,512
Sure.

109
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,108
I see. He's grinning from ear to ear.

110
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,402
He looks just like you.

111
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,404
Is that so?

112
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,578
How is your hat today?

113
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,791
Oh. I think it's all right.

114
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,209
I'm glad to hear that.

115
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,863
The flowers have bloomed beautifully.

116
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,033
Yes, indeed.

117
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,438
All right. Does anyone want to try it?

118
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,815
Who wants to try?

119
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,652
-Come on, man.
-No way.

120
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,570
-Your Royal Highness.
-Hold on!

121
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,406
Come on, everyone.
Let's give him a round of applause!

122
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,495
-One, two, three!
-Two, three!

123
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,830
Let's give it up for him!

124
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,292
Are you all right?

125
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,255
Everyone, give him a round of applause!

126
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,807
Here I go!

127
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,355
I'm good.

128
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
Would you like to try it?

129
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,958
Pardon?

130
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,711
Gosh. That's only for women.

131
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,256
Over here!
Someone wants to try out the swing.

132
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,678
What are you doing?

133
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,014
Who says it's only for women?

134
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,475
A fun activity belongs to everyone.

135
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,022
My lord, try it. It's very fun.

136
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,940
-Come on.
-Wait. No. I…

137
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,233
Try it.

138
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
He's good.

139
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,417
Goodness. I can't believe I got
to ride a swing thanks to you.

140
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,043
What a strange experience.

141
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,715
Thanks to you,
I got to use up my energy today.

142
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,342
It really was strange.

143
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,306
Must you really have the last word
just because we're outside the palace?

144
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,519
Gosh. How could I do that?
That's a misunderstanding.

145
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,107
Look.

146
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,279
I see a big bird over the mountain.
Over there.

147
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,878
We should stay
under the roof over there for now.

148
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,796
Okay.

149
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,396
Your robe is all wet.

150
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,022
You shouldn't catch a cold.

151
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,859
I can shake off the rain myself.

152
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,309
Your Royal Highness, please tell me

153
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,687
the real reason why

154
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,690
you came to visit me today.

155
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:07,206
Sometimes, I think about how it would be
to live a normal life like them.

156
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,792
Laughing as they please

157
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,547
and crying their hearts out
whenever they want to.

158
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,637
It's impossible to be true to myself

159
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,557
when I'm in the palace.

160
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,564
I've lived my whole life competing.

161
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,777
I lived to meet expectations.

162
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,278
And I will

163
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,783
have to keep doing so in the future.

164
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,458
People may envy me
for being the Crown Prince.

165
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,296
But I envy the people out here.

166
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,008
They enjoy life to their heart's content…

167
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,596
without having to worry
about what others think of them.

168
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,894
Why don't you do the same,
Your Royal Highness?

169
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,691
You can laugh like today

170
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,610
and cry at times too…

171
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,322
at least with me.

172
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,545
Thank you for everything.

173
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,007
Thanks to you,

174
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,260
I was happy
even if it was just for one day.

175
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,721
Your Royal Highness…

176
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,082
I found a better position for you.

177
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,793
I believe taking that position

178
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,963
will be a good opportunity for you.

179
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,632
Are you…

180
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,678
ordering me to leave?

181
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,432
You can criticize me for being selfish.

182
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,477
I will…

183
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,646
soon get married

184
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,232
and have a wife.

185
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,111
This is…

186
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,365
my answer…

187
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,161
to your feelings for me.

188
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,814
It must have been a tough day.

189
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,443
Hyun.

190
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,698
There are days like this.

191
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,491
I know…

192
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,203
because today has been tough for me too.

193
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,618
I suspect you'd have more use for it.

194
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,331
You should give it to the lady
that steals your heart.

195
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,182
Did you just arrive at the palace?

196
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,476
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

197
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,235
You were caught in the rain yesterday.
Are you all right?

198
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,530
Yes. I'm all right.

199
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,170
Are you headed somewhere?

200
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,383
I must meet with my father
to talk about the royal marriage.

201
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,596
I see.

202
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,640
Let's go.

203
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,047
I would like to get married.

204
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,802
I thought we already discussed this.

205
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,808
Your Majesty, the refreshments are ready.

206
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,713
I heard you enjoy chrysanthemum tea
around this time of the year.

207
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,398
Your mother also liked chrysanthemum tea.

208
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,901
But…

209
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,989
I had never brewed tea for her.

210
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:12,083
Do you know why
I am against your marriage?

211
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,713
It must be
because you don't think I am ready

212
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,423
to take the next step.

213
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:25,722
I got married when I was your age.

214
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,478
I made a family at a young age.

215
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,772
So I didn't know

216
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,733
how precious it was or how to protect it.

217
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,236
So…

218
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,281
I failed…

219
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,577
to protect my family.

220
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,544
But…

221
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,050
I didn't want you
to make the same mistake.

222
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,430
Your grandmother is right

223
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,184
if I only consider your duty
as the Crown Prince.

224
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,186
But you are also my son,

225
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,565
so I wanted to buy you some time.

226
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,116
Do you truly want to get married now?

227
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,248
Yes.

228
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,043
I want to get married.

229
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,344
The royal marriage of the Crown Prince

230
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,681
is not the same
as the marriage of a nobleman.

231
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,308
It's an important occasion
where the fate of Joseon lies.

232
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,228
I'm sure you understand

233
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,273
what this means.

234
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,330
I examined the body three times so far,

235
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,249
but I didn't find anything unusual.

236
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,053
What about the right shoulder fracture
you mentioned before?

237
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,223
The height of the fall
was over five <i>cheok</i>.

238
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,726
So it must be from the fall
after the arrow hit him.

239
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,028
Commander Yoon, a soldier from one
of the Five Central Armies asks for you.

240
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,494
I heard we already took statements

241
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,039
from everyone involved
with the royal hunting.

242
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,876
Well, I was on extended sick leave
due to a medical condition.

243
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,545
So I must have been omitted
from the list for testimonies.

244
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,507
All right.
What is it that you want to tell me?

245
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,011
The man that was considered the suspect
did not have the capacity to kill.

246
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,723
I'm one of the people
who are happy to see him dead,

247
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,268
but someone like him couldn't have tried
to kill the Crown Prince.

248
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,187
It doesn't make sense.

249
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,949
Shoot.

250
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,998
<i>His shoulder was injured?</i>

251
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,708
Three days before we got selected,

252
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,419
he got into a fight
when we were drinking together.

253
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:47,298
He injured his right shoulder then.
So he couldn't even lift a bow.

254
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,218
<i>But he shot at the Crown Prince?</i>

255
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,178
<i>That didn't sit well with me.</i>

256
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,388
Shoot.

257
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,265
Next.

258
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,356
Get ready.

259
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,745
Shoot.

260
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,037
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

261
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,060
Commander Yoon. What brings you here?

262
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,478
Where is Kim Ga-on?

263
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,607
He headed to the King's quarters
a while ago to see His Majesty.

264
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,193
What did you say? The King's quarters?

265
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,981
I'm Kim Ga-on.

266
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,449
Ask him.

267
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,912
Your Majesty,
Commander Yoon asks for an audience.

268
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,163
Let him in.

269
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,599
What brings you here at this late hour?

270
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,726
I have something to report.

271
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,229
But I will wait outside.

272
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,523
All right. Wait a moment.

273
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,345
I heard that you are
the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

274
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,765
So how is it? Are you having any trouble?

275
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,476
No, Your Majesty.

276
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,020
I had noticed a tally on your sword

277
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,314
{\an8}you handed over to my eunuch.

278
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,234
{\an8}Was it from your betrothed?

279
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,319
{\an8}TALLY: MADE OF STONE, BAMBOO, OR JADE,
SPLIT IN HALF AND USED FOR IDENTIFICATION

280
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,446
{\an8}It's a keepsake from my late father.

281
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,908
I see.

282
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,705
Continue to do your utmost
to guard the Crown Prince.

283
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,376
There was a murder
in the Ministry of War just now.

284
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,714
How could there be a murder
in one of our six ministries?

285
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,840
Was the culprit caught?

286
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,968
The man who just left, Kim Ga-on.

287
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,429
There's something suspicious about him.

288
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,806
What do you mean?

289
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:21,484
So His Majesty finally gave his blessing
for the royal marriage?

290
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,528
This will impact the fate of our nation.

291
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,740
He knew that the Crown Prince
had to fulfill his duty soon.

292
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,368
Did he say anything else?

293
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,496
The selected lady

294
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,958
will be the future queen of Joseon.

295
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,378
As an elder of the royal family,

296
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,173
I will choose the wisest
and most benevolent lady.

297
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,217
Do not worry.

298
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,719
Of course. I expect nothing less.

299
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,515
That is why I would like
to make a suitable recommendation.

300
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,394
Someone who will be helpful

301
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,605
to Your Highness, the Crown Prince, and me

302
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,233
in our future endeavors.

303
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,530
-How pretty. Where did you get it?
-You think so?

304
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,698
-My father bought me this.
-Really?

305
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,577
-It looks like mine.
-Really? Look at this.

306
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,332
<i>You don't want to be
in the selection process?</i>

307
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,378
I'm not ready
to participate in the selection yet.

308
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,135
This isn't about
whether you are ready or not.

309
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,137
This is for our nation.

310
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,972
I heard that

311
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,308
they already have someone in mind
for such selections.

312
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,895
So no one will notice

313
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,231
if I don't participate in the process.

314
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,108
And women who participate three times

315
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,069
will have to remain chaste
for the rest of their lives.

316
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,405
I do not wish to lead such a life.

317
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:53,242
So please do not put
my name in the process.

318
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,332
If that's the law, you must follow it.

319
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,587
Don't make me a disloyal subject now.

320
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,884
-So-eun.
-Yes?

321
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,432
This is just for your eyes. Come on.

322
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,517
What's this?

323
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,815
The questions for the first round
of the selection process.

324
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:32,781
I want to be chosen,
but I shouldn't keep this from you either.

325
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,458
-I'm okay. Put this away.
-Are you sure?

326
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,089
Please follow me.

327
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,427
-Let's go.
-Okay.

328
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:26,126
I'm Jeong-hui, the eldest daughter
of Deputy Magistrate Moon Jeong-hak

329
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,545
at Hanseong Magistracy.

330
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,550
I'm So-eun, the eldest daughter
of Shin Yeong-su,

331
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,968
the Minister of Personnel.

332
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,888
I'm Ha-gyeong,

333
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:44,436
the second-eldest daughter
of No Hak-su, the Minister of War.

334
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,398
I'm Yeon-hui, the second-eldest daughter

335
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,193
of Han Gyu-seong, the director
at the Office of Royal Decrees.

336
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,657
A lord gave a test to three women.

337
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,369
The test required them to last a month
with just half a bag of rice.

338
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,706
One woman ate all the rice
and when she ran out,

339
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,249
she gave up on the test.

340
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,585
And another woman ate
the rice little by little,

341
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,420
but she gave up as she was hungry.

342
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,716
And the third woman lasted a month
without having to eat the rice

343
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,467
she was given.

344
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,262
What did the third woman do?

345
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,607
She made rice cakes
with the rice and sold them.

346
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:34,361
She then bought more rice with that money.

347
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,996
That is correct.

348
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:50,419
Then do you think what she did was fair?

349
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,422
Don't you think she cheated?

350
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,343
Well…

351
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,573
Were there any rules
that forbade her from doing so?

352
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,284
No.

353
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,995
Then she didn't cheat.

354
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,914
In order to pass the test,

355
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,292
she put her skills
in making rice cakes into good use

356
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,127
and did her best.

357
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,713
How could that be considered cheating?

358
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,471
You are So-eun,
the daughter of the Minister of Personnel?

359
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,392
Yes, Your Highness.

360
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,692
<i>Do you mean to tell me
you want my daughter to be the princess?</i>

361
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,701
When you first started working for me,

362
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,912
do you remember what you told me?

363
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:13,919
You said you would become a subject
who would keep the royal court grounded

364
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,882
without being swayed
by any biases or personal interests.

365
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,218
That is what you said.

366
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,138
I do remember, Your Majesty.

367
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,558
My goal still hasn't changed.

368
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,685
-But--
-Now is the time…

369
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,565
that I need you to show me
you meant what you said.

370
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,428
Oh, these.

371
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,307
He spared me a few.

372
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,407
My father hasn't come home from his post
at the Ministry of Personnel.

373
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,911
I'm aware.

374
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,874
I didn't come here to see your father.
I came to see you.

375
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,460
Me? Why?

376
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,215
Our bond seems stronger than I expected.

377
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,301
Had I known that we would meet again,

378
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,638
I wouldn't have lied
about my identity that day.

379
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,058
I apologize if you are surprised.

380
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,809
No, Your Royal Highness.

381
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,980
Please forgive me
if I offended you in any way.

382
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,692
Your Royal Highness.

383
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,243
Just like your father's character,

384
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:13,455
I can feel a sense of grace
and honesty from this house.

385
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,671
It's a cool day.

386
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,466
Would you like to accompany me for a walk?

387
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,321
When you were ten, what kind of husband

388
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,032
did you dream of from under this tree?

389
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,660
Pardon?

390
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,624
When I was ten and standing
under a pine tree in the backyard

391
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,376
at the palace…

392
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,841
I dreamed of someone brave
who would come to me

393
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,387
even if the path was long
and full of thorns and bumps.

394
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,848
I dreamed of someone

395
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,018
upright and strong.

396
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,815
<i>The Minister of Personnel will help you.</i>

397
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,235
Having him on your side will be

398
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,529
very helpful in your future.

399
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,036
I'm here to ask you

400
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,956
if you would be so kind
as to walk that path.

401
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,217
<i>It will most likely be,</i>

402
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,179
either Minister Shin's
or Minister No's daughter.

403
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,389
Then do you want to make a bet?

404
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,600
I will bet on Minister No's daughter.

405
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,812
Minister Shin is the symbol of integrity
and the leader of Confucian scholars.

406
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,357
Lord Sangheon will never approve of him.

407
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,860
Sure. Then I will bet
on Minister Shin's daughter.

408
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:10,364
Do you think His Majesty will not object
to accepting Minister No's daughter

409
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:14,785
when everyone knows Minister No
always sides with Lord Sangheon?

410
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,787
Don't you agree, Royal Tutor Jung?

411
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,166
Royal Tutor Jung!

412
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,836
Is it true?

413
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,548
Did the Crown Prince
truly recommend giving you a promotion?

414
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,259
Is it true?
So where are you getting transferred to?

415
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,639
Is it the Office of the Censor General?
Or the Office of the Inspector General?

416
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,724
Where is your next post?

417
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,103
That's not true.

418
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,189
Come on.
Don't keep things from me. Just tell me.

419
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,567
I'm not that petty. You know that. Right?

420
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,777
So which one is it?

421
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,987
Is it a big promotion?

422
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,867
I'm sorry,
but I'll head out a bit early today.

423
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:01,498
Don't be like that, Royal Tutor Jung.
Just tell me. Royal Tutor Jung!

424
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:07,295
Is he looking down on me
because he's getting a promotion?

425
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,172
Gosh. My blood pressure is rising.

426
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
Royal Scholar Yang!

427
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,510
Royal Scholar Yang.

428
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,438
I'm not sure

429
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,774
if I will meet the expectations.

430
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,901
This is very sudden too.

431
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,745
Do you

432
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:44,416
have feelings for someone else?

433
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,547
Please forgive me.

434
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,514
As I came all the way here,

435
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,976
I don't think I can give up that easily.

436
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,646
We'll meet again soon.

437
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,021
Why are you here at this hour?

438
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,736
I just left Minister Shin's house.

439
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,989
The woman you were with the other day

440
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,867
was Minister Shin's daughter.

441
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,582
I asked her to be my wife…

442
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:15,549
despite the fact that I knew
that she had crossed paths with you.

443
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,179
I see.

444
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,561
Did you give some thought to the offer…

445
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,106
I made the other day?

446
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:35,402
If you want,
I can recommend a better position.

447
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,153
When I see you…

448
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,533
I want to talk with you.

449
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,831
And that desire gets stronger
on days when I see you unexpectedly

450
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,333
like this.

451
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,509
Offering another position

452
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:03,096
sounds like you're asking me
to leave the palace.

453
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,936
Is that truly what you want me to do?

454
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,236
-If it's not--
-It was also…

455
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,242
hard for me to tell you such things.

456
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,539
I thought you
of all people would understand me.

457
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,627
I guess I was wrong.

458
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,382
I understand now.

459
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,427
The flowers have bloomed beautifully.

460
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,750
Your lecture isn't today.

461
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,253
I asked Royal Tutor Park
to switch our lectures just for today.

462
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:44,466
Then there won't be a lecture today.

463
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,593
You said…

464
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,055
you wanted my answer.

465
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,309
I will give you an answer afterward

466
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,437
because this will be

467
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,565
our last lecture together.

468
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,162
It means, "One can place the trees evenly,

469
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,831
but the drier parts
of the trees will burn first."

470
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,546
"One can flatten the ground,

471
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,509
but the water
will spread to the humid side."

472
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,683
"Similar trees will grow together

473
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,686
just like animals
of a similar species will band together."

474
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,907
"All things are bound to find their own."

475
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,661
"Therefore, there must be a target board

476
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,371
for arrows to land."

477
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:04,170
I will be your tutor starting from today.
I am Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un.

478
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,947
Then the lotus seed
will bloom into a flower soon.

479
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:36,703
I look forward to working
for you until then, Your Royal Highness.

480
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,499
Allow me…

481
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,752
to answer that question.

482
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,803
Like the good rain
that falls when most needed,

483
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,308
I will be someone who you can count on.

484
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,688
Just like you were to me
when I needed you the most.

485
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,448
I would like to continue
to do so by your side.

486
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,765
It means, "The trees must be dense
for there to be any to axe."

487
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:43,686
"And the shades must be dark
for the birds to fly in."

488
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,578
<i>DAEHAKJANGGU</i>

489
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,341
Now, tell me…

490
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,261
what your answer

491
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,846
to my offer is.

492
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:25,270
Could you accompany me somewhere?
It won't take long.

493
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,348
Do you remember?

494
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:07,770
This was the first place we came to
after I became your lecturer.

495
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,984
For some reason,
that day feels like so long ago.

496
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,987
<i>For once at least,</i>

497
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,823
can't you put your trust in others?

498
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:22,076
Not for anyone else, but for yourself.

499
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,538
For Your Royal Highness.

500
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,750
Don't distance yourself too much.

501
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,543
It'll only make you lonelier.

502
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,886
I swore to myself
I would never come back to the palace.

503
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,930
If I hadn't, I would have regretted it.

504
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:50,396
The truth is, I'm not the type
to stay in one place for too long.

505
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,984
So I plan to go back to the way

506
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,111
I used to live.

507
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,451
I hope you will be happy…

508
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,747
not just for a day,

509
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,208
but every day.

510
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,630
Because when I had no dreams or hopes,

511
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,217
you brought happiness to my life.

512
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,433
I don't think I can accept

513
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,019
a different position as you suggested

514
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,021
because if I stay,

515
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,316
I will keep coming to your quarters.

516
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:39,237
I might use saying hello
to the royal tutors as an excuse.

517
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:43,908
Or I might use the beautiful tree
at your quarters as an excuse too.

518
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,119
If not those,

519
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,039
I might pretend to look
for Lord Jaeun at your quarters

520
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,084
when who I really want to find is you.

521
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:17,191
NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

522
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,277
Please stay healthy, Your Royal Highness.

523
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,697
I hope you won't be lonely.

524
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,098
{\an8}NOTICE OF RESIGNATION

525
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:58,084
{\an8}<i>How has it been for you?
I thought you might be feeling lonely.</i>

526
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,168
{\an8}<i>Not at all.</i>

527
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,878
{\an8}<i>The Crown Prince is well, right?</i>

528
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,797
{\an8}-Jan-i!
<i>-Is everything all right?</i>

529
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,591
{\an8}Why did you kill her?
She didn't do anything wrong! Why?

530
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,135
{\an8}<i>You were able
to hold yourself back until now.</i>

531
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,762
{\an8}<i>But how come you couldn't this time?</i>

532
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,557
{\an8}<i>I had to hold back for the last ten years.</i>

533
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,725
{\an8}<i>The Crown Prince is responsible
for the death of his uncle.</i>
