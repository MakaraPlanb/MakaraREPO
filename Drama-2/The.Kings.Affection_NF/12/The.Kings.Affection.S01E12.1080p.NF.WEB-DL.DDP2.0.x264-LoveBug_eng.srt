1
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,698
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,369
May I ask why you are leaving
without seeing His Royal Highness?

3
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,514
Please dethrone the Crown Prince!

4
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,599
-Please dethrone him!
-Please dethrone him!

5
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,061
We beg of you to make the right decision!

6
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,772
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!
-We beg of you, Your Majesty!

7
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,400
Please punish him accordingly!

8
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,318
-Please punish him!
-Please punish him!

9
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,156
Your Majesty,
I ask that you give us an answer.

10
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,868
-We ask for your answer, Your Majesty.
-We ask for your answer, Your Majesty.

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,670
The Crown Prince…

12
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,673
shall be dethroned.

13
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,719
-What?
-Lord Sangheon.

14
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,726
-How is this…
-The Crown Prince is dethroned?

15
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,814
Please I beg of you, Your Majesty!

16
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,275
I ask that you reconsider!

17
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,986
-We ask that you reconsider!
-We ask that you reconsider!

18
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,238
I ask that you reconsider!

19
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,909
-We ask that you reconsider!
-We ask that you reconsider!

20
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,579
-We ask that you reconsider!
-We ask that you reconsider!

21
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,167
-Please, Your Royal Highness.
-Please, Your Royal Highness.

22
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,046
This cannot be, Your Royal Highness.

23
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,966
This cannot be, Your Royal Highness!

24
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:43,264
This cannot be, Your Royal Highness!

25
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,353
-Please, Your Royal Highness!
-Please, Your Royal Highness!

26
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,273
Your Royal Highness, this cannot be…

27
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,912
EPISODE 12

28
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,259
Did you decide to dethrone me

29
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,429
because of what happened with my uncle?

30
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,473
No.

31
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,982
Last night…

32
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,569
I was at your quarters.

33
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,993
I had known all along…

34
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,164
that you were a woman.

35
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,712
Since when…

36
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,236
You are very special.

37
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,783
Don't forget that.

38
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,827
My beautiful…

39
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,246
daughter.

40
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,957
Mother.

41
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,878
Mother.

42
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,941
Announce it.

43
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,611
The Crown Prince shall now enter.

44
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,993
Please protect

45
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,788
the Prince…

46
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,750
our child.

47
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,352
It does not matter now.

48
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,231
What has happened, has happened.

49
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,531
Then why have you not…

50
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,326
said anything all this time?

51
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,956
Do you resent me?

52
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,508
I pictured this day

53
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,095
for a long time

54
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,223
and wondered what would happen

55
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,143
if you were to find out.

56
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,688
I was afraid.

57
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,240
I have never resented you
as the Crown Prince.

58
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,410
However…

59
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,458
I resented you
as someone who had been born…

60
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,588
in this palace.

61
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,217
Because I was only a kid…

62
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,847
who wanted to be loved by her parents…

63
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,143
just like everyone else.

64
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,203
There is something I wish to ask.

65
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,999
If you could…

66
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,713
go back to the day I was born…

67
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,593
would you make the same decision?

68
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,764
If it were not for the late King's order,

69
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,059
could things have been different?

70
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,563
I would like to ask you that.

71
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,158
Leave the palace.

72
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,539
And live your own life.

73
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,463
I…

74
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,386
have never lived my own life.

75
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,316
If this is what you want for me…

76
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,862
I will accept it.

77
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,115
Are you really trying
to get yourself killed?

78
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,285
You show up here after a month
and demand to see His Royal Highness.

79
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,496
Don't you know
no one dares to go near him?

80
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,044
He was dethroned! If you go see him,
you could go down with him!

81
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,837
Leave me alone. I do not care.

82
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,130
You reckless fool.

83
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,428
Over there. Isn't that His Royal Highness?

84
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,315
Don't tell anyone
I let you into the palace.

85
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,858
Leave me out of this.

86
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,632
YEON-SEON

87
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,050
Yeon-seon.

88
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,744
I was wrong.

89
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,582
I will never leave you alone again,
Your Royal Highness.

90
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,170
Never.

91
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,321
What are you doing?

92
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,198
You must leave.

93
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,408
You cannot be here.

94
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,915
Your Royal Highness,
I will stay by your side…

95
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,544
no matter what you say.

96
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,675
I will…

97
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,930
protect you, Your Royal Highness.

98
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,786
It's nice to be back here.

99
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,166
The flowers, the trees,

100
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,086
and the pond.
Everything is as I left them.

101
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,799
But…

102
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,512
the air here is not
as fresh as the air in Onyang.

103
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,692
Would you like to come with me?

104
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,157
We can sit together just like this

105
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,786
and admire the flowers blooming
and withering away every year.

106
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,122
At night, we can stargaze.

107
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,919
On rainy days, we can listen to the rain

108
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,338
falling in our yard together.

109
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,187
I am afraid…

110
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,149
I cannot.

111
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,907
I had a dream.

112
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,372
A dream that I was in the distant future.

113
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,084
When I woke up from it,

114
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,337
my heart ached a bit.

115
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,007
My future has always

116
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,927
given me heartache.

117
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,056
It was painful

118
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,851
and burdensome.

119
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,396
Your Royal Highness.

120
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,284
I thought that you had changed.

121
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,496
But I'm relieved to see that you have not.

122
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,040
I am…

123
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,127
truly glad.

124
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,942
You ought to go on your path,
Royal Tutor Jung.

125
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,778
For I…

126
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,907
will now go on mine.

127
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,840
I told you.

128
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,345
No matter what you say,

129
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,851
I will stay by your side,
Your Royal Highness.

130
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,576
I…

131
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,458
want you to be happy.

132
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,127
In the same way…

133
00:20:55,712 --> 00:21:00,217
that you hoped
that I would be happy every day.

134
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,975
Please live a happy life.

135
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,185
This is…

136
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,399
the last favor

137
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,111
I ask of you, Royal Tutor Jung.

138
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,850
I am here, my lord.

139
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:44,071
So tell me.
Did you look into what I asked you to?

140
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,366
I confirmed that Great Lord Changcheon's
soldiers were at Mount Odae.

141
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,591
This ledger confirms that
the military supplies were moved there.

142
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,055
To those who do not know how
to wield a sword,

143
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:15,352
even the best sword can be dangerous.

144
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:20,273
It seems His Majesty was foolishly greedy.

145
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,778
His Royal Highness

146
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,156
is departing for Ganghwa today?

147
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,376
As soon as you hear from me,

148
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,712
you must bring
His Royal Highness back to the palace.

149
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,175
It will not take long.

150
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,220
Yes, my lord.

151
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,116
How was your life outside the palace?

152
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,495
You will have to move
into the palace soon.

153
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,831
You should get things ready one at a time.

154
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,460
I am sorry.

155
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,882
Do not apologize.

156
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,259
I just…

157
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,722
thought I should.

158
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,648
How nice it feels
to have a cup of tea with you.

159
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,693
I have been scared
for nothing all this time.

160
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,114
I pushed you away

161
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,742
because of my feelings of inferiority.

162
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,915
Do not cry.

163
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,709
You cannot be weak.

164
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,294
In the palace,

165
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,297
you must always be confident

166
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,050
and act with assurance.

167
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,682
I am sure you will do well.

168
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,978
And you must.

169
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,023
Gyeom…

170
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,860
you are my only brother.

171
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,712
GANGNYEONGJEON

172
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,789
Your Royal Highness.

173
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,959
I am afraid we should leave now.

174
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:36,052
I will leave the palace now.

175
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,513
May you…

176
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,351
stay healthy, Father.

177
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,946
Your Majesty, this is Commander Yoon.

178
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,750
I have prepared everything as you ordered.

179
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,977
Look after

180
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,064
my child.

181
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,778
I had kept the truth from you.

182
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,030
I will sacrifice my life
for your forgiveness, Your Majesty.

183
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,039
Thank you…

184
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,627
for keeping

185
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,588
my child's secret all these years.

186
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,594
You should be careful too.

187
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,824
GWANGHWAMUN

188
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,838
I shall leave now.

189
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,178
Please have a safe trip,
Your Royal Highness.

190
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,980
Make sure that His Royal Highness is safe.

191
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,700
Your Royal Highness.
May you stay in good health.

192
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,667
I have not seen the bodyguard,
Kim Ga-on, for some time now.

193
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,837
You don't think
he ran away by himself, do you?

194
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,511
Stop worrying about nonsense.
Focus on serving His Royal Highness.

195
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,931
Where did he go?

196
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,146
Let's go.

197
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,136
<i>The flowers have bloomed beautifully.</i>

198
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,233
He never listens.

199
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,484
Pardon?

200
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,740
Go and bring that to me.

201
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,034
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

202
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,630
Stop them from chasing His Royal Highness

203
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,550
until I escort him to a safe house.
Do you understand?

204
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,483
Everyone, stop.

205
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,860
We will have a rest here.

206
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,112
Let us have a rest here.

207
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,864
Here?

208
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,666
I told them to prepare a spot over there.
Please wait a bit.

209
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,510
Hold on.

210
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,971
I want you to bring some water
and a fresh set of clothes

211
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,099
for His Royal Highness.

212
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,100
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

213
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,315
-Yes, Lord Jaeun.
-Yes, Lord Jaeun.

214
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,788
We will soon arrive at a valley
where we can drink water.

215
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,206
We can rest there.

216
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,083
His Royal Highness is tired.

217
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,461
I can have someone go
and fetch some water for him.

218
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,088
We will rest here.

219
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,301
The terrain here is rough.
Many bandits are spotted here.

220
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,596
So I suggest you take my advice
and rest somewhere else.

221
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,474
I am in charge of the procession. Not you.

222
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,894
I am a member of the royal family.

223
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,480
I would never put
His Royal Highness in danger.

224
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,040
I will lead the procession.

225
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,752
The Inspector will not be able to stop me
as I am a member of the royal family.

226
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,438
It is me, Commander Yoon.
Come with me, Your Royal Highness.

227
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,607
It's His Majesty's order.

228
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,818
Protect His Royal Highness!

229
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,223
Hold on. What…

230
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,974
What is going on?

231
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,936
I think something
must have happened to His Royal Highness!

232
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,395
Oh, no!

233
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,689
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

234
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,816
-His Royal Highness is safe.
-What?

235
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,986
-What…
-What do you mean?

236
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,821
I do not have time to explain.

237
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,740
I need you to come with me now.

238
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,952
-Wait. What…
-What on earth…

239
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,704
-Hurry.
-Yes, Lord Jaeun.

240
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,249
What…

241
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,418
What are you doing here?

242
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,517
Who is the man
that took His Royal Highness?

243
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,353
I do not know.

244
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,565
All I know is that they are trying
to save His Royal Highness.

245
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,540
Get out of my way.
He must return to the palace!

246
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,127
What do you mean?

247
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:05,259
Unless you want to be framed
for abducting him, get out of here now.

248
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,517
Someone saw a group of suspicious men.

249
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,561
Search the other side.

250
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,563
-Yes, Inspector. Let's go!
-Yes, Inspector.

251
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,539
Please change your clothes first.

252
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,006
What on earth is going on?
His Majesty is behind this?

253
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,971
You told me that you are willing
to sacrifice your life for me.

254
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,765
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:58,104
Now, you will owe your life
to the Crown Prince.

256
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,358
You will

257
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,986
have to keep my child's secret to the end.

258
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,952
His Majesty wishes for you to have this.

259
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,808
<i>By the time you are reading this letter,</i>

260
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,187
<i>the palace will be in an uproar.</i>

261
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,735
<i>As I knew you would not want this,</i>

262
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,905
<i>I could not tell you in advance.</i>

263
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:36,744
<i>Even to the end, I remain a father</i>

264
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,663
<i>who denied your wishes.</i>

265
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,003
Leave the palace.

266
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,797
And live your own life.

267
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,341
I…

268
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,305
have never lived my own life.

269
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,227
<i>I thought this would be better</i>

270
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,103
<i>than losing you forever.</i>

271
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,107
<i>As long as I can keep you safe,</i>

272
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,237
<i>I will gladly put up
with any resentment you have for me.</i>

273
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,409
You want to appoint Prince Jehyeon
as the Crown Prince?

274
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,495
How much sway
does the Queen have over you?

275
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,247
Has your judgment been clouded?

276
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,918
<i>I was against appointing you
as the Crown Prince</i>

277
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,127
<i>for this very reason.</i>

278
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:11,630
<i>However, I was wrong to worry about you.</i>

279
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,633
<i>You were much stronger than I thought.</i>

280
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,653
Great Lord Changcheon
shall gain more power.

281
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,699
So when the Crown Prince becomes the King,

282
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,995
Lord Sangheon shall no longer have
any sway over him.

283
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,125
<i>That is why it was more painful</i>

284
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,753
<i>and I was tormented even more.</i>

285
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,882
<i>To me, seeing you</i>

286
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,136
<i>was the hardest thing in this world.</i>

287
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,097
<i>If you could…</i>

288
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,976
go back to the day I was born…

289
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,856
would you make the same decision?

290
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,859
<i>If it were not for the late King's order,</i>

291
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,278
<i>could things have been different?</i>

292
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,907
<i>I would like to ask you that.</i>

293
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,827
<i>I regretted the decision I made that day</i>

294
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,455
<i>for a very long time.</i>

295
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,874
<i>Therefore…</i>

296
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,462
<i>I will not repeat the same mistake.</i>

297
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,215
YI HWI

298
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,132
<i>Yi Hwi.</i>

299
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,427
<i>It was your brother's name.</i>

300
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,054
<i>But to me,</i>

301
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,348
<i>it is now your name.</i>

302
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,185
<i>You were the Crown Prince of Joseon.</i>

303
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,106
The Crown Prince shall be dethroned.

304
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,735
<i>And you were my only daughter.</i>

305
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,064
<i>I just want you to live.</i>

306
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:23,113
<i>And I hope to never hear about you.</i>

307
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,220
Have you had a good night's sleep?

308
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,393
As you had driven your son into danger,

309
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,979
you must have been
too troubled to fall asleep.

310
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:10,536
You had to pay a big price
to keep your son safe.

311
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,288
You had to abandon your daughter

312
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,041
to keep your son.

313
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,585
That is why

314
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,505
I do not like you, Lord Sangheon.

315
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:27,678
You were the one who forced me
to make that decision.

316
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:36,395
So what do you plan to do now?

317
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:41,400
Naturally, Prince Jehyeon will have
to take the Crown Prince's place.

318
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,361
How unfortunate.

319
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:49,241
I can only imagine how much you must miss
your glory days with the late King.

320
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,589
The wind is chilly.

321
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,470
May you stay healthy.

322
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,592
Go and search up on the hill.

323
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,801
Yes, Inspector.

324
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,153
We should part ways from here.

325
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,614
The soldiers know my face.

326
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,826
If I accompany you,
it will be more dangerous for you.

327
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,786
Will you be all right?

328
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,455
Do not worry.

329
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,583
Go on without me.
I will follow you soon after.

330
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,698
I knew it was you.

331
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,868
The woman you were with…

332
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,414
The Crown Prince
must have disguised himself.

333
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,458
Unfortunately for you, you are too late.

334
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,962
I am on my way back to the palace
after escorting him to a safe place.

335
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,299
Go and check all the women's faces.

336
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,802
If you find anyone suspicious,

337
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,805
bring them to me without delay.
Do you understand?

338
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,139
-Yes, Inspector.
-Yes, Inspector.

339
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,558
He has already been dethroned.

340
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:47,646
Allow him to at least keep his life.

341
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:51,399
I am doing this
to save His Royal Highness too.

342
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:08,917
Let me see your face.

343
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,765
Allow me to see your face.

344
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,190
Let me see your face clearly.

345
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,654
Let me see--

346
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,911
My lady, are you that upset?

347
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,163
You walked away so quickly.

348
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,833
I told you
I was not looking at other ladies.

349
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,422
Thank you for your service,

350
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,383
but how dare you try to look
at my wife without permission?

351
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,302
She is so stunning…

352
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,430
that her beauty will blind you.

353
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:07,100
Well, you see. I was not trying to see--

354
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,936
Right. Why do you
have to look at her face?

355
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,813
She's married. Stop bothering her.

356
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,065
-Quiet down.
-They're right.

357
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:18,361
All right. If everyone is ready,
we should get going.

358
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,989
-We, lovebirds, have a long way to go.
-Let's go!

359
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,366
-We're all busy.
-Let's go.

360
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,202
Be quiet! Let's go.

361
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,859
What happened?

362
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,822
I was following your procession
and I saw you leave with Commander Yoon.

363
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,081
I knew that you would be in disguise.

364
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,585
But it looks quite good on you.

365
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,137
But why are you all alone?

366
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,890
Well…

367
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:36,022
We are not alone here.
Let us talk after we get off.

368
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:29,242
Then His Majesty sent Commander Yoon
to save you, Your Royal Highness?

369
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:34,372
Yes. My father had already
prepared a place for me.

370
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,336
Then…

371
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,757
it means all you have to do now is leave.

372
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,891
You only lived
at the palace all your life.

373
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,310
I wonder how you will survive
in this harsh world.

374
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,562
You leave me no choice.

375
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,440
I will have to take care of you.

376
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,279
Wait. Are you looking down
on my medical practice?

377
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:11,034
You should have been there in Onyang.

378
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,828
People gave me potatoes, sweet potatoes,

379
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,207
all kinds of grains, and even meat
to pay for the treatments.

380
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,795
I can assure you I will be able to satisfy
your picky palate, Your Royal Highness.

381
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,641
Royal Tutor Jung.

382
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,726
Yes?

383
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,521
I need to make a confession.

384
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,192
A confession?

385
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,746
There is something I have not told you.

386
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,127
What is it that you must tell me?

387
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,671
You seem very anxious.

388
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,553
Well, I…

389
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,149
I am…

390
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,952
Over there! Get them!

391
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,537
-Yes, Inspector!
-Yes, Inspector!

392
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,582
Are you all right?

393
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,211
Yes, I'm all right.

394
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,381
I said he must be kept alive!

395
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,432
<i>No!</i>

396
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,319
Hurry.

397
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,983
They are not here.

398
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:30,900
Let's go.

399
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,626
Your Royal Highness. This is serious.
I should treat your wound first.

400
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,755
I am fine…

401
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,175
Your Royal Highness.

402
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,595
Your Royal Highness.

403
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,099
Please hang in there.

404
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:24,203
Stay here for a moment.
I will go get herbs to reduce your fever.

405
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,378
Please don't go.

406
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,760
You will be all right.

407
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,888
I will not take long.

408
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,134
You must stay awake, Your Royal Highness.

409
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,933
Thank you…

410
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,978
for being by my side.

411
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,732
Please do not talk.

412
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,153
Your wound will make talking more painful.

413
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,833
I said I had a confession to make.

414
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,753
Are you not curious
to find out what it is?

415
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,766
The wound must be infected.
I need to see it.

416
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,362
I…

417
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,619
I will do it myself.

418
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,698
Your Royal Highness.

419
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,202
This is…

420
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,791
my secret.

421
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:36,622
