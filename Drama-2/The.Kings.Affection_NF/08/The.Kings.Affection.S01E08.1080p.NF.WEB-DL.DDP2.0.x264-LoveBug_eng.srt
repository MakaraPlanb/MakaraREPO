1
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,485
You must not do this.
Your Royal Highness, no!

2
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,867
Oh, no. Your Royal Highness…

3
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,327
Your Royal Highness.

4
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,509
Gosh…

5
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,246
{\an8}Why did you do it?

6
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,000
{\an8}Why did you do such a thing?

7
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,047
{\an8}I put my faith in you.

8
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,676
{\an8}Yet, you disappointed me.

9
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,605
You did the right thing.

10
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,484
Your Royal Highness,

11
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,986
you did the right thing.

12
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,852
You are a brave, bold man
who can beat up the Chief Eunuch.

13
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,896
I'm sure you can handle this much.

14
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,649
That's enough.

15
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,152
Let me just treat your hand.

16
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,175
This might not be the right time
to bring this up,

17
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,097
but I know that you saw me
at the guesthouse.

18
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,810
I know I shouldn't have been there,
so I'm sorry if that disappointed you.

19
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,270
But I can promise you that

20
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,356
I didn't do anything to disgrace myself.

21
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,651
So in case you misread the situation--

22
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,403
I never did.

23
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,241
I know that

24
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,120
you are not the type of person
who would do such a thing.

25
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,874
Then…

26
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,587
why were you so distant toward me
during the banquet?

27
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,673
Well…

28
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:50,016
I didn't want you to be
in a tight spot because of me.

29
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,601
That's why.

30
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,230
I feel the same way.

31
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,942
So if you know how I feel,

32
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,196
please don't be distant toward me anymore.

33
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,663
There. It's all done.

34
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,598
EPISODE 8

35
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,586
I'm really fine, Your Royal Highness.

36
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,172
Your hand is hurt too.

37
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,050
I told you not to move.

38
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,769
How beautiful.

39
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,939
Your hair looks beautiful

40
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,401
even when it's short.

41
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,706
I have a chance to get my hair done by you
thanks to the Chief Eunuch.

42
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,543
This is truly a blessing.

43
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,845
Your Royal Highness.

44
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,354
The Chief Eunuch's subordinate is here.

45
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,024
He invited you,
the Vice Minister of Rites,

46
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,234
and Royal Tutor Jung for a drink.

47
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,570
He did?

48
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,324
Yes. Should I tell them
to station some royal guards?

49
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,997
That's all right. I can't afford
to use a cheap trick like that.

50
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,624
There can't be any more problems.

51
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,379
I will get going first.

52
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,758
Go and bring Royal Tutor Jung
to the guesthouse.

53
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,009
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

54
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,785
It seems the Vice Minister of Rites
hasn't arrived yet.

55
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,080
Men can resolve
this kind of matter over drinks.

56
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,166
There is no point
in bothering other people.

57
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,710
Please sit.

58
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,640
As a peace offering,

59
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,934
I thought I could show you
something interesting.

60
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,394
So I asked you to come.

61
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,728
What do you say?

62
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,984
Come on out.

63
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,683
From what I hear,

64
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,769
your bodyguard is
the best swordsman in Joseon.

65
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,400
Who do you think will win?

66
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,621
That doesn't interest me.

67
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,166
If this is why you asked to see me,
you can count me out.

68
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,293
I will head back now.

69
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,217
Let's go back.

70
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,028
Stop it! What do you think you're doing?

71
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,914
My guard is the best swordsman in Ming.

72
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,126
But he wasn't with me
when I was getting beaten to a pulp.

73
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,464
So I thought he deserved a chance
to show me he's worth his salary.

74
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,092
Stop this immediately!

75
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,011
Why? You were having fun
when you were beating me up.

76
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,056
But you don't want to see
your man getting beaten up?

77
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,667
I told you to stop!

78
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,172
Do you think you'll be able

79
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,342
to leave Joseon unscathed
if you leave a scratch on me?

80
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,184
Are you all right?

81
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,809
If you put a finger on the Crown Prince…

82
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,021
I will…

83
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,274
kill you.

84
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,444
With my own hands.

85
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,489
Royal Tutor Jung.

86
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,709
Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

87
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,379
Your Royal Highness!

88
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,467
Your Royal Highness. Goodness.

89
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,928
-Oh, no.
-What is going on here?

90
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,597
-Bring a physician.
-Yes, my lord!

91
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,183
Oh, no. Are you all right?

92
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,399
This is no fun.

93
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,371
How dare you pull out your sword
in front of His Royal Highness?

94
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,336
How dare you do this?

95
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,923
It wasn't my intention,
but the fight seems to have gotten heated.

96
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,219
If you are disgruntled,
take it up with me.

97
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,263
Leave the innocent alone.

98
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,182
How could I dare to do so?

99
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,060
Well, don't you keep them around,

100
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,104
so they can take your place in punishment

101
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,606
and do your dirty work for you?

102
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,943
Why are you doing this?

103
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,488
-What is it that you want?
-What do I want?

104
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,993
Right. There is one thing
I want from Joseon.

105
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,713
People like you who were born
with a silver spoon

106
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,757
are hypocrites who pretend
to care for the people.

107
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,760
And I want to destroy people like you.

108
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,395
I guess we will have to drink next time,
Your Royal Highness.

109
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,127
This way.

110
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,005
Put him down here.

111
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,512
Oh, no. What should we do?

112
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,264
Do you think he'll wake up?

113
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,767
Fortunately, he stopped bleeding.

114
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,395
But the cut is too deep.
We'll have to observe him for a while.

115
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:43,359
What on earth happened?

116
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,573
My lord. We have an urgent message
from the guesthouse.

117
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,285
The Crown Prince's bodyguard was
badly hurt by the Chief Eunuch's guard.

118
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,122
How is the Crown Prince?

119
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,208
Yes. He returned to his quarters just now.

120
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,297
Is the Chief Eunuch at the guesthouse?

121
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,299
<i>What did you say?</i>

122
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,014
How dare you talk about her here?

123
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,184
Please hear me out. I just wanted to say
there's no reason to shed blood here.

124
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,770
For that poor girl's sake.

125
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,773
You cannot do this to me!

126
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,275
What did you say?

127
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,416
I will visit you tomorrow night.

128
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,251
So wait quietly.

129
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,213
Yes, my lord.

130
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,257
Goodness.

131
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,192
What brings you here this late at night?

132
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,780
I heard that your guard
badly hurt the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

133
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,242
Not only did you cut off the hair
of a court lady from his quarters,

134
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,161
but you also hurt his guard.

135
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,330
I would like to know why.

136
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:07,669
Why are you making such a fuss
over your subordinates?

137
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,633
Right. I heard a very interesting story.

138
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,012
Someone the Emperor trusts very dearly

139
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,765
has been stealing offerings
to the Emperor.

140
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,854
I heard this person in question is also
stealing the Emperor's private assets.

141
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,984
Don't you want to know who that person is?

142
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,364
Are you trying to threaten me

143
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,491
with that groundless rumor?

144
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,869
I hear that the Emperor
has high expectations for you.

145
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,705
The higher they are,
the harder they will fall.

146
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,000
Unless you want there to be a big scandal,

147
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,672
I advise you to behave
for the remainder of your trip here.

148
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,846
How ridiculous.

149
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,060
I don't see why
you would want to do this to me.

150
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,691
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

151
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,695
I have many reasons why I must.

152
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,723
<i>"It is why traitor Kang Hwa-gil
will hereby be executed by beheading."</i>

153
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,153
Don't move. Your wound is severe.

154
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,491
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

155
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,746
I have failed my duty to protect you.

156
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,957
Do not say that.

157
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,252
I have failed to protect you too.

158
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,053
What is it that infuriated
and saddened you this much?

159
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,641
To the point that
you were suffering even in your dream.

160
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,488
You still need to recover.

161
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,325
You shouldn't move. Just rest up here.

162
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,231
Hyun.

163
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,317
Is your bodyguard all right?

164
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,197
Yes. He passed a critical moment.

165
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,202
The people at my quarters
are suffering because of me.

166
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,621
And I feel burdened by that.

167
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,625
You're not to blame here.
The Chief Eunuch is at fault.

168
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,504
He's dangerous.

169
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:42,718
So if there is a problem with him,
you should tell me right away.

170
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,309
If you're hurt, I'm hurt too.

171
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,187
So don't feel burdened.

172
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,606
You have me, Your Royal Highness.

173
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,403
Thank you, Hyun.

174
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,328
You saw someone suspicious
in the Chief Eunuch's chambers?

175
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,081
That brings me to my next point.
I need your help.

176
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>Double our tribute?</i>

177
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,134
Did the Chief Eunuch demand this too?

178
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,516
-Let me talk with him.
-There is no need.

179
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,936
I'll take care of this.

180
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,691
You are not to get involved any further.
You can leave now.

181
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,234
I can't do that.

182
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,614
I will resolve this problem
between the Chief Eunuch and me.

183
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,243
Please put your faith in me one more time.

184
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,497
Please…

185
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,168
give me a chance, Father.

186
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,388
Why does the Chief Eunuch
keep causing trouble?

187
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,849
He ought to help us
since he's from Joseon.

188
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,478
Sometimes,
your own people can be even worse.

189
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,564
<i>What do I want?</i>

190
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,905
People like you who were born
with a silver spoon

191
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,825
are hypocrites who pretend
to care for the people.

192
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,577
And I want to destroy people like you.

193
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,541
Royal Tutor Jung is close
to the Vice Minister of Rites, right?

194
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,668
Yes. That's what I've heard.

195
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,004
I must look into the Chief Eunuch.

196
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,383
Goodness.

197
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,475
<i>Tail the Chief Eunuch tonight,</i>

198
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,644
<i>and you'll be able
to find out who that man is.</i>

199
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,660
Royal Tutor Jung wasn't
at the royal institute.

200
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,413
What business does he have
at the guesthouse?

201
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,791
Goodness. Your Royal Highness, over there.

202
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,804
-You stay here.
-What?

203
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,806
Wait. Your Royal Highness.

204
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,684
Gosh. What's going to happen this time?

205
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,005
I'll go alone from this point on.
You can wait here.

206
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,215
Yes, my lord.

207
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,169
Kill him!

208
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,516
-How did you…
-Be careful.

209
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,870
Goodness.

210
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,502
If you ever use her to blackmail me again,

211
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,464
I will cut off your head.

212
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:18,553
Of course. Don't worry.
You will never see me again.

213
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,536
We've been followed.
You must get out of here now.

214
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,621
What?

215
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,814
Are you all right?

216
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,197
Stop!

217
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,536
This way!

218
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,959
Arrest everyone who has caused
a disturbance here!

219
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,335
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

220
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,591
-Catch them! Stop them!
-Get them!

221
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,027
-Royal Tutor Jung.
-Let me pass. I must go.

222
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,239
-They already got away.
-I have to find out something.

223
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,074
Why are you so reckless?

224
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,542
The cut is deep.

225
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,295
We should get this treated first.

226
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,634
I'm okay. Are you all right,
Your Royal Highness?

227
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,598
You have another cut?

228
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,476
And here too?

229
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:35,190
Where else? Are there any more wounds?

230
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,652
Your Royal Highness.

231
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,072
Why on earth did you do this?

232
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,659
You can lean on me.

233
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,622
-Pardon?
-How can you walk with those injured legs?

234
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,625
You can lean on me to walk.

235
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,714
Be careful.

236
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,354
What brings you here
in the middle of the night?

237
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,653
I wanted to visit a few places as
I haven't been in my hometown for so long.

238
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,197
-Is there anything wrong with that?
-I see.

239
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,662
Interestingly enough, we received a report
about suspicious movement around there.

240
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,790
I was concerned that
you might be the target of an assassin.

241
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:38,002
As I'm in charge of the reception,
I couldn't stop worrying about you.

242
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,257
But you have nothing to worry about.
Call off your men.

243
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,883
I can't do that.

244
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,679
I must make sure
that there won't be any more incidents.

245
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,974
So until the day you leave Joseon,

246
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:55,019
security at this guesthouse
will be strengthened.

247
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,302
I'm sure his secret ledger
must be somewhere around his quarters.

248
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,179
Watch his every movement.

249
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,556
Yes, my lord.

250
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,228
I heard that the Chief Eunuch met
with a suspicious man.

251
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,855
So I was tailing him.

252
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,357
The Chief Eunuch?

253
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,569
But still. This was reckless.

254
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,238
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

255
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,033
I wanted to be of help.

256
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,995
Do the wounds still hurt?

257
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,374
No.

258
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,629
By the way,

259
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,424
were you that worried about me?

260
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,850
I understand. If something happens to me,

261
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,479
you won't be able to find
a good replacement to take my position.

262
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,106
I get why you were concerned.

263
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,526
How can you joke right now?

264
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,280
Your Royal Highness. I'm really hurt.

265
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:34,118
Royal Tutor Jung. Are you all right?

266
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,995
Sorry.

267
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,961
Let's go.

268
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,897
Your Royal Highness.

269
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,444
Are you all right? Why are you…

270
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,154
Hyun, I can't believe you.

271
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,699
You didn't even tell me.

272
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,617
Well…

273
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,164
I…

274
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,209
So what is your plan now?

275
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,967
Let me join you.
I would like to be a part of this.

276
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,309
Why are you looking for this man?

277
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:44,313
Well, I like to collect rare objects.

278
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,317
And I hear
that his collection is very extensive.

279
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,778
I will pay you handsomely
for the introduction.

280
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,116
It's a very handsome sum of money, indeed.

281
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,620
He already left the items with me.

282
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,124
Then we'd like to buy them too.

283
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,584
I'll double the price.

284
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,673
Well, this is quite a large sum
you're talking about. How…

285
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:16,554
As you can see,
we're nothing without our good looks

286
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,724
and wealth.

287
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,151
Here.

288
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,238
He became quite a gambling addict.

289
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,159
He was arrogant because his daughter
became an imperial concubine in Ming.

290
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,995
So I definitely remember his face.

291
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,920
My goodness. This is quite a rarity.

292
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:53,466
I hear the Emperor adores your daughter.
I guess what I heard was true.

293
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,551
But you didn't believe me before.

294
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,638
Just get me a good price for that. Okay?

295
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,353
He got a large sum for the items
the Chief Eunuch gave him.

296
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,231
So he'll check this place out first.

297
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,614
<i>-Are you serious?
-Come on.</i>

298
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,658
<i>If we catch
the imperial concubine's father,</i>

299
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,245
<i>we'll be able to find out why
he threatened the Chief Eunuch.</i>

300
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,790
<i>And that will be
the Chief Eunuch's weakness.</i>

301
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,376
NINE, NINE

302
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,461
Come on.

303
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,844
My goodness. I feel awful
about taking all this money.

304
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,852
It looks like I won this round, brother.

305
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,064
Come on! You're ruining my day.

306
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,525
Hold on. Are you leaving?

307
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,236
Can't you see that I lost all of my money?

308
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,614
Come on. I thought you knew better.

309
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,034
If you leave now,
we won't be able to play anymore. Right?

310
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,452
Exactly.

311
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,080
Come on. Sit down.
I'll lend you some money.

312
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,457
I'm not a heartless person, you know?

313
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,712
Gosh. Where did you get this rare item?

314
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,842
What? This is…

315
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,345
What? Do you know what it is?

316
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,139
It's really rare.

317
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,933
That's from Ming.

318
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,852
Of course, I know.

319
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,021
I sold this.

320
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,651
Gosh. Really?

321
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,321
Goodness.
I guess we were meant to cross paths.

322
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,574
I've been looking everywhere for you!

323
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,912
The soldiers are here!

324
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,208
-The soldiers are here!
-The soldiers?

325
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,043
That way!

326
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,717
I'm so sorry, my lord! Please forgive me.

327
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,511
I was trying to make money
to buy medicine for my sister.

328
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,479
What? Who are you?

329
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,314
Well, that's none of your business.

330
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,735
I need you to come with me.

331
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,949
Don't come close.

332
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:28,287
Just drop the dagger.
You'll just end up getting hurt.

333
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,212
Hey, my arm hurts.
You're going to break my arm.

334
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,340
Goodness. This isn't even a tight hold.
Stop exaggerating.

335
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,342
How about now? Is that better?

336
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,760
Damn it.

337
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,516
-Don't follow me.
-Come on. We can talk it out.

338
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,227
Seriously. We can talk about it.

339
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,610
Come on, hurry. Go get him!

340
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,861
Go!

341
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,490
Take him with you. I'll handle them.

342
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,574
Are you sure?

343
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,202
Of course.

344
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,746
Go straight there. Don't lose him.

345
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,961
Wait. No.

346
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,717
Hey!

347
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,893
Your Royal Highness.

348
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,954
Can you handle them alone?

349
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,456
Of course, Your Royal Highness.

350
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,458
Sorry, we're late.

351
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,043
No, you are right on time.

352
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,005
Had you been a moment late,
I wouldn't have been all right.

353
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,260
-Get on the horse.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

354
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,808
I appreciate it.

355
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,281
You never listen.

356
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,201
I told you not to get hurt.

357
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,997
I'm sorry.

358
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,590
You sure make it sound painful
when the wound is minor.

359
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,762
What? That's not true.

360
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,891
You saw my wound.

361
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,601
It hurt a lot.

362
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,937
Others would have made a fuss about it.

363
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,986
Thank you…

364
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,489
for enduring the pain.

365
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,657
And…

366
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,537
for helping me.

367
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,882
I would like to continue
to do so by your side.

368
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,767
That is only if you will allow it,
Your Royal Highness.

369
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,423
Oh, my goodness.

370
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,974
Please spare me.

371
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,726
All right. Tell me.

372
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,980
What is it
that the Chief Eunuch is hiding?

373
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,110
Well…

374
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,923
What's all this?

375
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,678
Why the long face?

376
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,680
Please take a seat.

377
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,688
We could have easily resolved
the matter over drinks.

378
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,357
Perhaps, I was too rigid.

379
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,660
As a peace offering,

380
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,371
I would like to show you

381
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,833
something interesting as well.

382
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,588
You are indeed audacious

383
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,758
to have coveted the Emperor's wealth.

384
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,394
Records of your management
of the Emperor's private assets

385
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,562
are in this ledger.

386
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,690
How did you get that?

387
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,447
We will not be able to comply
with your tribute request.

388
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:23,869
And if the Emperor were to find out,
you would be in a tight spot too.

389
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,537
Wouldn't you?

390
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,462
Is this why you wanted

391
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,381
to see me?

392
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,632
Why?

393
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,263
I guess there are more secrets
that you're hiding besides this one.

394
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,107
I will keep this safe.

395
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,985
You worked hard to build
your reputation away from home.

396
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,615
So it would be a shame
to destroy it so easily like this.

397
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,884
So you told the Crown Prince everything.

398
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,053
He was going to kill me otherwise.

399
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,805
What should we do now?

400
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,349
If your relationship with her is revealed,

401
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,393
it will be the end for all of us.

402
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,942
Please help my daughter.
Take pity on her and protect her. Please?

403
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,822
You threatened me with her life before.

404
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,490
Now, you're worried?

405
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,253
Goodness.

406
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,601
I told him to leave quietly.

407
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,271
But he must have gone to see you.

408
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,148
What are you plotting?

409
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,361
You found something bigger than the book.
Why pretend you didn't?

410
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,863
I didn't pretend anything.

411
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,493
I didn't need to use
your heartbreaking love story.

412
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:31,079
I already had the ledger that proved
that you stole from the Emperor.

413
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,500
I just wasn't interested in your story.

414
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,710
Right.

415
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,757
I must say I was a bit surprised.

416
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:46,261
Not only did the father
of a concubine sell off his own daughter,

417
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:50,641
but he also bargained over her life
while threatening to expose you for money.

418
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,935
Despite that,
you were able to put up with him.

419
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,689
Is that how much you love her?

420
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,192
A concubine of the Emperor?

421
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,779
Don't you dare talk about her.

422
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,448
If you ever go after her,

423
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,700
I will make you pay for it!

424
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,577
I will use everything I have

425
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,372
to take revenge on you and Joseon!

426
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,378
Revenge?

427
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,426
I heard that your parents received

428
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,805
a mere bag of rice when they sold you off.

429
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:35,060
By the time you crossed the border,
your feet had blisters and were chapped.

430
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,604
But because you were a foreigner,

431
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,232
you were probably beaten up.

432
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,778
And you probably spent
every single night of your entire life,

433
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,031
resenting your parents for selling you off

434
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,076
and resenting Joseon
for giving away innocent people.

435
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,620
I get why you wanted to take revenge.

436
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,875
And you must have been disgusted
to see people trying to flatter you

437
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,877
after what you achieved.

438
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,672
However,

439
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,842
you shouldn't have behaved that way.

440
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:11,722
I doubt you went through all that trouble,
so you could be like one of them.

441
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,348
Get off your high horse.

442
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,766
To me,

443
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,686
you are just like them.

444
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,733
You are right.

445
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,820
I am no different from them.

446
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,530
No.

447
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:33,452
You must resent me even more
as I'm the Crown Prince of Joseon

448
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,455
that gave you away.

449
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,875
Shut your mouth.

450
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,253
I don't need your pity.

451
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,922
This isn't pity.

452
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,342
I just wanted…

453
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,637
to apologize to you

454
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,598
as the Crown Prince of Joseon.

455
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,439
A long time ago,

456
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,611
you were forced to leave
without proper clothes or food.

457
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,697
I apologize.

458
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:17,120
I will take your secret affair
to my grave as well.

459
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:24,628
You two must have gone through
a lot of pain to protect your love.

460
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,049
I think…

461
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,595
I can somewhat relate to that.

462
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,654
Feeling wronged?

463
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,449
-Don't look at me like that.
-You stole it, didn't you?

464
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,369
Answer me.
If you don't, I'll have you killed.

465
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,789
Get lost. Just go back to your homeland.

466
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,834
Bastard.

467
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,806
Are you all right?

468
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,143
It hurts a lot, right?

469
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,189
Look at all this blood.

470
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,110
You don't know…

471
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,363
when you'll be back here.

472
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,824
You should look around
a bit more before going back.

473
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,619
After all, this is your homeland.

474
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,538
Homeland, my foot.

475
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,574
I am indebted to both of you.

476
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,165
You too. You were very helpful too.

477
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,709
Come and have a drink with us tonight.

478
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,840
Sit comfortably.

479
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:19,094
All right. Everyone, if you have a drink,

480
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:22,305
let's clink our glasses.
What do you say, Your Royal Highness?

481
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,435
Cheers.

482
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,353
Cheers.

483
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,828
Since when did you become
so loyal to His Royal Highness?

484
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,663
You of all people.

485
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,707
Well,

486
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:53,378
you know that
I'm nothing without my loyalty.

487
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,714
Right, Your Royal Highness?

488
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,549
Sure.

489
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,428
Yes. I guess so.

490
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,143
Your Royal Highness, are you serious?

491
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,228
You're really hurting my feelings.

492
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,192
I get it. Calm down.
I just have something to tell him.

493
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:21,239
Come on.
I must talk to His Royal Highness.

494
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,037
Your Royal Highness.
How can you laugh now?

495
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,207
Your Royal Highness,
I cannot let this slide.

496
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,085
You are hurting my feelings right now.

497
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,214
Why don't you just sit down?

498
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:42,135
Come on, Lord Jaeun. Help me out.
Did you mean that, Your Royal Highness?

499
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,264
All right.

500
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,604
Your Royal Highness.

501
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,149
Why don't we have just one more drink?

502
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,276
Just one more.

503
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,488
Come on, move.

504
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,658
I'm asking
if he wants to have one more drink.

505
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,702
Let's have one more drink.

506
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,746
Gosh.

507
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,832
Can you escort Royal Tutor Jung?

508
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,417
I'll escort the Crown Prince.

509
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,462
Lord Jaeun. I'm not drunk.

510
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,882
Lord Jaeun. Your Royal Highness. Wait.

511
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,427
Can't we have one more drink?
Just one, please?

512
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,430
My arm hurts. Can you hold on a moment?

513
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,975
Wait. Please wait.

514
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,602
Hold on. My arm hurts.

515
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,605
Listen. Hey.

516
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,232
I'm not drunk.

517
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,568
I told you I'm not drunk. Why are you so…

518
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:44,030
Come on. Talk to me.

519
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,240
Gosh.

520
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,540
Just one drink. Please?

521
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,669
Do you want
to have one more drink with me?

522
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:03,008
I always felt that there was
a brotherly bond between us.

523
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,053
You felt it too. Right?

524
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,389
Not really.

525
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,774
Gosh. What a heartless man.

526
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,869
I have to talk to him. Gosh.

527
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,704
Come on.

528
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,019
Why can't I stop smiling?

529
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,067
I can't stop smiling?

530
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,403
Why? Why can't I stop…

531
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,543
Your Royal Highness.

532
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,179
Royal Tutor Jung.

533
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,645
What are you doing here all alone?

534
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,689
Well…

535
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,787
I was surprised.

536
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:06,626
That girl and I are
the only ones who know about this place.

537
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:13,508
I see. Are you talking
about the court maid from before?

538
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,474
I saw fireflies and followed them.

539
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,768
And I stumbled upon this place by chance.

540
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,646
The door… I found the door.

541
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,704
Did you set this place up by yourself?

542
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,915
This? Yes.

543
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,923
That's why you had
the flowers at the tavern.

544
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,803
But…

545
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,807
why do you have so much liquor here?

546
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,100
Well…

547
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,354
I couldn't sleep.

548
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,902
And everyone said no to more drinks.

549
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,781
I was just getting started, you know.

550
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,074
Is that why

551
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,495
you are using the palace
as your private tavern?

552
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,664
Only sometimes…

553
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:37,091
I am. I can't deny that.

554
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,597
That is typical of you.

555
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,399
Please don't smile like that.

556
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,153
-What?
-Pardon?

557
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:05,995
I mean… Well, I meant to say…

558
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:10,500
Right. I wanted to ask you a question.

559
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,795
Did you not expose the Chief Eunuch

560
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,422
because you really believe
the imperial concubine lives

561
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,840
for the Chief Eunuch?

562
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,599
Their lives were determined
by other people's decisions.

563
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,228
So they had to hide their love.

564
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,690
And that broke my heart.

565
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,702
You intrigue me sometimes.

566
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,123
When I first met you
at the courtesan house,

567
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,000
you were as cold as ice.

568
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,671
But deep down,
you seem to be tenderhearted.

569
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,655
You should slow down.

570
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,450
You already drank a lot earlier.

571
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,412
Well, I was thirsty.

572
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,553
{\an8}<i>Someone I know got drunk</i>

573
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,389
{\an8}<i>and kissed the cheek
of the person next to him.</i>

574
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,557
{\an8}<i>Does he like that person?</i>

575
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,226
{\an8}<i>Sometimes, you see and hear things.</i>

576
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,477
{\an8}<i>You're lovesick!</i>

577
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,020
{\an8}<i>No! That can't be.</i>

578
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,981
{\an8}<i>I deserve to die, Your Royal Highness.</i>

579
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,608
{\an8}<i>You seem to be from a noble family.
Why are you here in the palace alone?</i>

580
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,734
{\an8}<i>The selection of a princess?</i>

581
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,196
{\an8}<i>We must hold a royal marriage,
so he can produce an heir.</i>

582
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,823
{\an8}The Crown Prince is getting married?

583
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,951
{\an8}<i>Have you ever loved someone,
Your Royal Highness?</i>

584
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,036
{\an8}<i>I have a favor to ask,
Your Royal Highness.</i>

585
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,705
{\an8}Please give me a hug.

586
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:41,919
