Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,980
What happened, Your Royal Highness?

3
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,026
Well, you see,

4
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,695
there was a minor accident.

5
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,873
Goodness. What happened here?

6
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,835
I'll get someone
to clean this up right away.

7
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,587
But what are you doing here,
Royal Tutor Jung?

8
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,758
Royal Scholar Yang wanted me
to escort His Royal Highness.

9
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,596
I just told him that His Royal Highness
wouldn't be able to attend the lecture.

10
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,599
I should just attend the lecture today.

11
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,101
Go tell him I changed my mind.

12
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,395

the best of the four morals is similar

But if we look at them as a whole,
one value includes all four moral values.

No. I have a lot of work to do.

I had a private audience with you.

87
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,961
And you personally gave me
the present she left for me.

89
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,927

that happened so long ago?

91
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,142
you remembered me.

92
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,397
When we first met at the courtesan house,

93
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,817
you remembered who I was.

94
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,613
That's…

95
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,326
I only remembered you

96
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,372
because I thought you were good
at flattery even for a brazen boy.

97
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,915
Does that answer your question?

Why do you think

106
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,796
Dam-i just disappeared like that?
She didn't even say goodbye to me.

107
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,466
If she's still alive,

108
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,636
she's probably already married, right?

109
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,683
And she must have kids
who look just like her too, right?

110
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,603
What a surprise.

111
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,398
I didn't know
you could be a hopeless romantic too.

112

Didn't you tell me that you went to Ming

113
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,987
because women in Joseon
weren't good enough for you?

114
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,955
What about you? Is there someone you like?

115
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,416
Someone I like?

116
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,960
You're handsome and rich.

117
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,672
On top of that, you're a member
of the royal family with a heart of gold.

118
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,011
There is someone.

119
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,724
There is? Who is it?

120
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,185
Whose clan is she from?
Or is she a distant relative?

121
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,313
Is she pretty? Is she kind?

122
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,982
Don't tell me

123
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,818
you already set the date.

124
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,281
She's very beautiful

125
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,909
and warmhearted too.

126
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,622
How come you didn't say anything to me?

127
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,958
So when will you introduce me to her?

128
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,461
I'm a good judge of character
when it comes to ladies.

129
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,506
I'm not sure.

130
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,010
I don't even know
if I'll be able to do so.

Don't tell me

132
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,186
this is a one-sided love.

133
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,387
You had a busy couple of days.

has been settled?

142
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,886

<i>What is this regarding?</i>

151
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,667
Why did you come
all the way here this morning

152
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,627
to meet an imprisoned physician?

153
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,464
I'm embarrassed to ask you for a favor,

154
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,717
but my daughter
made a promise to the physician.

155
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,430
So I came here to ask for your help
despite my sense of shame.

156
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,016
I hope you will understand.

157
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,440
I thought you were always sure of yourself
even before Lord Sangheon and His Majesty.

158
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,235
But even you,
the Minister of Personnel, needs help

159
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,861
when it concerns your child.

160
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,377
<i>Please wait over there.
I'll bring out the physician.</i>

161
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,409
I apologized to that girl.

162
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,538
I didn't do it
just because you told me to.

163
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,458
I also know what is right and wrong.

164
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,087
I came by to tell you that.

165
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,178
Are you that surprised to see me here?

166
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,057
Or are you touched that I came to see you?

167
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,225
Who are you?

168
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,357
You…

169
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,362
Where is that physician?

170
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,449
Gosh. What are you doing here?

00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,510
LIST OF COURT MAIDS

172
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,553
What is this?

173
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:24,228
I might have been
a bit harsh the other day.

174
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,565
That court maid…

175
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,195
died.

176
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,324
It happened
not long after leaving the palace

177
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660

That explains
why you couldn't remember her.

183
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,370
That girl…

184
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,457
must have been someone
quite special to you.

185
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,796
She was my first love.

186
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,677
She helped me become a better person.

187
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,682
I wanted

188
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,518
to thank her…

189
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,106
if I ever saw her again.

190
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,237
I guess I won't be able to.

191
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,664
It wasn't my intention to
make you concerned, Your Royal Highness.

192
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,458
My apologies.

193
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,162
NOKUNGAK

194
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,264
Goodness. What are you doing?

195
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,141
I'm helping you with the laundry.

196
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,066
Do you know the story
behind these deserted quarters?

197
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,443
What story?

198
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,989
A long time ago, a court maid loved a man
who lived outside the palace.

199
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,909
And she couldn't overcome
the hopelessness of unfulfilled love.

200
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,787
So she hanged herself here.

201
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,416
Afterward, people stopped coming here.

202
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,626
And the deserted quarters
became an eyesore.

203
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,796
So the Kings tried to tear this place down
over many generations.

204
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,550
But anyone who tried to demolish
this place either got sick or died

205
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,053
as if they'd been cursed.
That's what I heard.

206
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,848
After that, they weren't
able to tear this place down.

207
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,808
So instead, they just closed it.

208
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,435
What?

209
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,481
Aren't you scared
to be alone in a place like this?

210
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,275
Why would I be scared?

211
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,986
I like that no one comes here
thanks to that story.

212
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,623
NOKUNGAK

213
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,586
-A ghost!
-You startled me!

214
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,466
Stop. Wait up!

215
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,845
Wait until I catch you!

216
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,353
Come on, wait up! I'm scared!

217
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,223
I thought you'd be busy
with the reception. What brings you here?

218
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,184
I heard that the Crown Prince ended
the lecture early today.

219
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,478
Is there something wrong?

220
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,981
Oh, he went to his spot.

221
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,028
You know, the spot he always
goes to when he has a lot on his mind.

222
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,982
This place is a true gem.

223
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,319
You won't find a place breezier than here.

224
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,446
Hyun.

225
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,824
I thought you'd be in Ganghwa
for the reception.

226
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,451
You haven't left yet?

227
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,244
I postponed it to tomorrow.

228
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,623
I have a more important matter
to take care of today.

229
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,376
An important matter? What is it?

230
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,221
You mentioned you wanted
to taste this the other day.

231
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,974
I happened to remember what you said.

232
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,770
I hope

233
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,106
you didn't delay your trip
because of this.

234
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,610
Well, let's say
it was one of many reasons.

235
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,671
You always told me you wanted to run free.

236
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,966
Why do you always stop here?

237
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,638
Because I have to go back to the palace.

238
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,766
And this is the extent…

239
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,561
of the path I know.

240
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,731
You told me

241
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,026
that you had traveled
someplace far, right?

242
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,743
What did you find far away from here?

243
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,913
If you keep going straight past the gate,

244
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,206
is it true

245
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,377
that you'll see the ocean,
which has an unknown length and depth?

246
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,298
Does that really exist?

247
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,134
Yes. It does.

248
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,847
And there is a ship with a big sail too.

249
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,934
Once you get on the ship,
you can go anywhere.

250
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,104
Even if it's very far.

251
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,657
If you ask me for directions,
I'll give them to you.

252
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,243
Always.

253
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,302
You only have an hour.

254
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,806
Unfortunately, the sun will set
in an hour.

255
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,603
So enjoy the breeze
and the view until then.

256
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,778
I have been working hard lately.

257
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,780
So I cannot stop dozing off.

258
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,214
<i>Flowers for the Crown Prince's quarters?</i>

259
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,593
I wasn't informed about this.

260
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,887
Can you tell me what they are for?

261
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,931
Well…

262
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,267
The thing is…

263
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,104
If it's too much to ask,
can't I just get some flower seeds?

264
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:58,027
Well, I'm done planting the flowers,
and I do have some left.

265
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,365
Please give me a few.

266
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,744
Can't you give me some of the flowers?

267
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,667
Why do you have them?

268
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:40,046
These? I want to plant some flowers.

269
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,131
I have a place in mind.

270
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,801
I see.

271
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,470
Thank you

272
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,100
for looking into her record.

273
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,939
Sure.

274
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,693
I heard that
you are attending lectures again.

275
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,362
I know you've been busy lately.

276
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,038
Royal Tutor Jung!

277
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,086
What are you doing?
You have a big problem!

278
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,088
What problem?

279
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,215
Well, the Minister of Personnel

280
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,343
lodged an appeal for your resignation.

281
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,473
For my resignation?

282
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,866
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un of the Crown Prince

283
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,660
is in fact Samgaebang's real physician?

284
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,581
Unfortunately, he is, Your Majesty.

285
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,083
-My goodness.
-What? He is?

286
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,673
If what you're telling me is the truth,

287
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,260
who is the imprisoned physician
at Hanseong Magistracy?

288
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,972
He used to be
a mere assistant at Samgaebang.

289
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,727
Left State Councilor,
I need you to explain this.

290
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,648
You were the one
who recommended Royal Tutor Jung.

291
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,406
Everything the Minister of Personnel
said is true.

292
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,619
Then are you telling us
that you recommended

293
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,871
a lowly physician from the street

294
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,291
to be the Crown Prince's royal tutor
despite knowing his history?

295
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,543
He may be a lowly physician
from the street.

296
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,088
But he's a royal tutor
if he has wisdom to share.

297
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:50,176
Your Majesty, didn't you compliment
his wisdom during the last exam?

298
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,388
Jung Ji-un displays great character

299
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,016
and an excellent literary talent
compared to other royal tutors.

300
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,604
This good-natured man
ran a pharmacy called Samgaebang to share

301
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,148
his medical knowledge with the people.

302
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,026
You cannot possibly hold
this act of kindness against him.

303
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,113
His history of running a pharmacy
isn't the problem.

304
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,824
Hiding this from His Majesty
and the Crown Prince

305
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,826
is a more serious crime. Don't you agree?

306
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,830
On top of that, if the Inspector General

307
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:22,542
ordered to close down Samgaebang
for corrupting public morals,

308
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,421
I'm sure there must have been
a bigger problem than meets the eye.

309
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,898
I resented the Minister of Personnel
for not siding with me before.

310
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,359
But he definitely
tipped the scales in my favor.

311
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,447
He's indeed a difficult man to figure out.

312
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,199
It's too early to celebrate.

313
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,326
Don't you know Lord Sangheon?

314
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,540
He'll probably try to make this go away
by reprimanding a lecturer.

315
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,958
That's why we must help him.

316
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,213
His Majesty expects
many great things from Prince Jehyeon.

317
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,508
Don't you think
it's time for us to step up

318
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:16,220
and weaken the influence
of Lord Sangheon and the Crown Prince?

319
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,396
Why did you let them live?

320
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,400
I'll explain everything
to the Minister of Personnel in person.

321
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,153
Do you think
you can easily hold sway over him?

322
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,492
I practically spoon-fed you,
but you couldn't even handle that

323
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,410
and made a mess.

324
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,370
I'm sorry, my lord.

325
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,208
I will do whatever it takes
to handle this matter.

326
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,834
Of course you will

327
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,505
because your precious son's life
will depend on it.

328
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,052
I must talk to the Minister of Personnel.

329
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,221
-I only need a moment of his time.
-No.

330
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,891
He said he wouldn't meet with you
until His Majesty approves of it.

331
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,059
Please leave.

332
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,022
Wait. I only need a moment of his time.

333
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,482
How dare you!

334
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,047
I want you to release them now.

335
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,134
I'll take responsibility for everything.

336
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,760
How will you take responsibility?

337
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,181
You deceived the royal family,
so even your life is in danger.

338
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,017
How will you take responsibility for it?

339
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,687
You could have punished just me
from the beginning.

340
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,274
Why are you torturing my innocent friends
and putting everyone in danger?

341
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,901
His Majesty will decide

342
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,529
on your position
in three days at the morning assembly.

343
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:01,325
Do whatever it takes
to secure your position until then.

344
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,660
If you fail,

345
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,080
those friends you cherish, the both of us,

346
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,791
and your dear mother

347
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,670
won't be able to live another day.

348
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,409
Your Royal Highness.

349
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,914
Tell me. What happened?

350
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,958
It looks like
things have gotten pretty serious.

351
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,628
Not only will His Majesty
punish Royal Tutor Jung,

352
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:58,132
but he will also punish his father
for turning a blind eye on his son.

353
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:06,474
I doubt Inspector Jung Seok-jo
was acting alone.

354
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,810
Everyone must know that he was only doing

355
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,854
what my maternal grandfather

356
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,190
told him to do.

357
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,526
Anyway, I say it all worked out.

358
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,238
You weren't exactly keen on them.

359
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,823
So driving them out of the palace--

360
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,660
It's getting late. You can go now.

361
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,911
Pardon?

362
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,289
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

363
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,925
Are you bothered by the scandal
regarding Royal Tutor Jung?

364
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,973
He's Jung Seok-jo's son.

365
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,309
His father was responsible
for murdering the Prince.

366
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:55,314
No. His father tried to kill you,
Your Royal Highness.

367
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,607
I know.

368
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,277
I do.

369
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,239
You must not forget that.

370
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,741
Never.

371
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,662
Please do not forget that.

372
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,605
It's all my fault that he's in trouble.

373
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,359
The Minister of Personnel
scared me out of my wits.

374
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,322
Do you really think it's not too late?

375
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,576
If I tell them that
I'm the real physician at Samgaebang,

376
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,495
Yeong-ji and Ji-un
will be able to live, right?

377
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,997
What nonsense is that?

378
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,460
The Inspector… No. Ji-un's father told me

379
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:01,088
that if I recant my statement,
everyone will be okay.

380
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,799
You idiot. Do you really buy that?

381
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:08,054
Hearing that he might find a nice spot
to bury you is more plausible. You dimwit.

382
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,306
What am I supposed to do?

383
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,558
Ji-un is about to die because of me.

384
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,686
Chief Gu. You have to get out of here now.

385
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,356
I'll tell Royal Tutor Jung everything.

386
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,525
So don't do anything stupid.
And say you don't know anything.

387
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,110
Stick to that. Got it?

388
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,987
Come on, hurry up!

389
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,489
You don't know anything.

390
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,965
My lady!

391
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,926
-My lady.
-Father.

392
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,721
What are you doing?

393
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,681
They are about to get hurt because of me.

394
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,394
Father.
Please let it slide just this once.

395
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,020
They aren't bad people.

396
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,064
I'm sure it wasn't their intention.

397
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,609
How can we be certain
that they aren't bad people?

398
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,780
I will only see them
as either innocent or guilty.

399
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,034
Father. Please.

400
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,620
That's enough.
I already reported it to His Majesty.

401
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,957
The decision is up to His Majesty.

402
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,085
Father!

403
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,851
His Majesty will issue a royal order
at tomorrow's morning assembly.

404
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,395
It's unfortunate, but I believe today

405
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,356
will be the last time I see you.

406
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,400
You haven't been here long,

407
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:50,573
but I will remember your lectures
as somewhat useful.

408
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,533
I cannot leave the palace yet.

409
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,453
I'm in need of your help.

410
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,248
You are the only person
who can help me now.

411
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,210
Why would I help you?

412
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,131
Did you forget that I,
of all people, wanted you gone

413
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,009
when you first came to the palace?

414
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,637
I know that.
That's why I'm asking you for your help.

415
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,516
You knew from the beginning
that I was a physician at Samgaebang.

416
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,894
But you accepted me as your lecturer.

417
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,981
It was because I lost the bet.
I did make a promise after all.

418
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,153
Could you

419
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,740
keep your promise one more time?

420
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,701
Gosh.

421
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,464
Unfortunately,
there is nothing I can do for you.

422
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,509
So I advise you to stop asking.

423
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,446
Royal Tutor Jung…

424
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,659
There you are.

425
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,538
Where have you been?
I looked everywhere for you.

426
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,415
What about Jil-geum? He's okay, right?

427
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,668
It's about your father.

428
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,838
I think he's going to pin
everything on him. What should we do?

429
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,841
I don't know what to do.
I can neither stop him nor support him.

430
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,344
Chief Gu!

431
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,430
What are you talking about?

432
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,100
That fool wants to save you and Yeong-ji.

433
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,311
You don't think he'll kill them, right?

434
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,399
After all, you cherish them
like your family. Right?

435
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,859
No… Jil-geum. No.

436
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:55,155
Hey, wait. Royal Tutor Jung!

437
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,960
Your Royal Highness,
Prince Jaeun is here to see you.

438
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,801
Hyun.

439
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,639
Was your trip to Ganghwa pleasant?

440
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,807
Yes.

441
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,477
I have something to tell you.

442
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,396
What is it?

443
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,696
Royal Tutor Jung ran Samgaebang

444
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,034
with the sole purpose
of helping poor kids from the slums.

445
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,620
Is that it?

446
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,121
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

447
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,790
He only accepted
the position at the palace

448
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,418
to save his friends from Samgaebang.

449
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,587
He never wanted the title.

450
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,468
-Why are you telling me this?
-Because--

451
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,012
I know that
Jung Ji-un is an old friend of yours.

452
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,307
I understand that you want to help him.

453
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,352
But this is pointless.

454
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,145
Whatever the reason is,

455
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:11,440
he still broke the code of morals
and deceived our family.

456
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,692
His actions will not be forgiven.

457
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,196
He may be my friend,
but he's also your royal tutor.

458
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,576
I'm tired.

459
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,538
I'm sure you are exhausted from the trip.

460
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,415
We should talk some other time.

461
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,906
<i>I cannot leave the palace yet.</i>

462
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,241
I'm in need of your help.

463
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,910
You're the only person
who can help me now.

464
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,532
What did you wish for?

465
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,914
Do you remember the slum
we passed by earlier on our way here?

466
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,833
What?

467
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,543
I wished that

468
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,880
the kids in the slum would be well fed
and grow up in good health.

469
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,381
That's what I wrote down.

470
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,592
What?

471
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,471
It's their parents' job
to take care of them.

472
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,597
Why…

473
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,141
Most of them are orphans.

474
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,227
I grew up there as an orphan too.

475
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,483
My heart breaks for them,

476
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,985
but I don't have the means to help them.

477
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,029
So if I make a wish for them,

478
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,491
perhaps, someone might help them one day.

479
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,459
Right. What did you wish for?

480
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,003
Me?

481
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,506
Well, I…

482
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,134
Hold on, Dam-i.

483
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,180
Young Master.

484
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,761
Why did you do that?

485
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,349
Well, after hearing your wish,

486
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:36,395
my wish sounded petty and selfish.

487
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,231
-Pardon?
-So I changed mine.

488
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:43,485
My wish is to become that someone
who can help those kids.

489
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,632
Should I not have mentioned it to him?

490
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,135
No.

491
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:12,556
If I did, Jil-geum would be framed
for everything and end up dead.

492
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,726
I couldn't let that happen to him.
Of course, not.

493
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,021
Right!

494
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,566
Royal Tutor Jung is on it now.
I'm sure he has come up with a plan.

495
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,944
I doubt that he's going to kill
his own son. Right.

496
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,701
No. No way.

497
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,581
What if Royal Tutor Jung gets killed too?

498
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,208
The Inspector is capable of doing so.

499
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,673
Gosh. This is driving me crazy!

500
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,759
Goodness! What do I do now?

501
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,019
Who is going to get killed?

502
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,325
Who are you?

503
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,348
Who are you?

504
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,268
Wait. Where are we going?

505
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,816
Where are you taking me?

506
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,112
Sir.

507
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:03,250
-Yeong-ji!
-Jil-geum!

508
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,627
Stop!

509
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,921
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

510
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,767
Are you…

511
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,439
-really going to kill them too?
-Step aside.

512
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,150
How much more
can you possibly disappoint me?

513
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,901
I told you to step aside.

514
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,895
Are you really going to kill me?

515
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,023
Let them go.

516
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,318
Please.

517
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,488
They will live someplace else.

518
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,115
Just tell yourself that.

519
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,993
That is the only thing you can do.

520
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,925
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

521
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,134
No!

522
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,806
-What are you doing?
-If I do this…

523
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,062
you have no reason to kill them.

524
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,415
If you lay a finger on them,

525
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,335
I will not forgive you

526
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,296
even if you are my father!

527
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,883
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

528
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,427
Lock him up until I return.

529
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,224
-Ji-un!
-Ji-un!

530
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,200
Take the girl away from here for now.

531
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,244
Jil-geum!

532
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,455
-Jil-geum!
-Yeong-ji!

533
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,790
Write down what I say.

534
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,044
You were scared, so you lied.

535
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,673
And you are the physician at Samgaebang.

536
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,593
You were scared of your punishment,

537
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,887
so you bought off
guards and escaped. Got it?

538
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,514
No…

539
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,981
Please spare me.

540
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,358
Please let me live!

541
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,944
It's my fault. Please don't kill me.

542
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,739
I heard that Ji-un saved you and that girl

543
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,033
when your lives were in danger.

544
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,660
You can pay him back

545
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,204
right now.

546
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,922
Yeong-ji.

547
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,348
Please spare me…

548
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,528
Please spare me.

549
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,702
{\an8}I AM THE PHYSICIAN OF SAMGAEBANG

550
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,287
{\an8}I ESCAPED

551
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,081
{\an8}BANG JIL-GEUM

552
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,129
Wait. As you promised,

553
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,257
please spare Ji-un and Yeong-ji.

554
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,177
Please don't kill them.

555
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,097
Please…

556
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,727
Please let them live.

557
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,547
I noticed that
some crooks secretly took the prisoners

558
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,049
from Hanseong Magistracy.

559
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,722
I order you as the Crown Prince.

560
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,267
Hand over the prisoners.

561
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,477
If you do,

562
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:19,065
no one will shed
a drop of blood here tonight.

563
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:23,194
Did Lord Sangheon approve of this?

564
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,865
Did you not hear me?

565
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,910
I ordered you
as the Crown Prince of Joseon.

566
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,747
Unless there is a royal command,

567
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,708
no one can dare to disapprove of my order.

568
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,088
Your Royal Highness.

569
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,134
Is that what you truly believe?

570
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:54,017
You must not agree with me

571
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,729
seeing how

572
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,107
you won't lower your sword.

573
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,616
If he so much as moves his hand,

574
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,494
bring me

575
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,330
his head in an instant.

576
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:22,212
What? You don't think
I can go through with this?

577
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,383
I doubt that my grandfather

578
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,179
will punish his dear grandson
for killing his dog.

579
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,657
What is going on? Tell me what happened.

580
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,369
Your Royal Highness.
You even took the royal guards with you.

581
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,372
What did you do?

582
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,625
If Lord Sangheon finds out…

583
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,191
Goodness.

584
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,764
Why did you do that?

585
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,558
Why…

586
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:03,188
were you so arrogant, Your Royal Highness?

587
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,070
They took the prisoners.

588
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,073
I understand
that you ordered them to do so,

589
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,743
but it was wrong.

590
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:21,080
So I only did what I was supposed to do.

591
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,389
You're wrong, Your Royal Highness.

592
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,269
Your moral standards

593
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,148
will not influence your actions.

594
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,526
The only thing you must do

595
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,821
is listen to me, your grandfather,

596
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,533
and not challenge me.

597
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,202
That is all.

598
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,622
Do you understand?

599
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,959
Do not forget.

600
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,921
The path I choose

601
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:13,049
will be your path.

602
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,636
And if you deviate from that path,

603
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,639
I will not forgive you,

604
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,934
no matter how much I adore you.

605
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,843
Get ready.

606
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,511
It's time for the assembly.

607
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,934
What about my friends? Where are they?

608
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,438
I need to know if they are safe first.

609
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,817
You can find out for yourself
after the morning assembly.

610
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,444
Are they alive?

611
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,113
You didn't…

612
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,284
kill them, right?

613
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:41,304
Let me sum it up.
This man here, Jung Ji-un,

614
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,222
recommended and prescribed

615
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,434
only expensive and rare medicinal herbs

616
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,853
under the pretense of treatments.
Is that true?

617
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,897
Yes, that's true.

618
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,774
There is more.

619
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,567
When I visited Samgaebang,

620
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,862
not only did he make me
wait with the people of low birth,

621
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,822
but he also humiliated me

622
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,533
by turning me away
at the gate in front of them.

623
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,329
Jung Ji-un neglected the custom
of our class system

624
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,415
and tarnished
the authority of the nobility.

625
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,627
And Inspector Jung Seok-jo
protected his son.

626
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,171
I ask you to punish them, Your Majesty.

627
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:19,050
-Please punish them, Your Majesty.
-Please punish them, Your Majesty.

628
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,806
Is everything they said true?

629
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,017
Yes.

630
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,104
It's true.

631
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,533
I will announce the punishment

632
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,578
for Royal Tutor Jung
and the prisoners from Samgaebang.

633
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,624
Royal Tutor Jung Ji-un

634
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,751
of the Royal Institute

635
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:57,422
ran a clinic called Samgaebang
as a nobleman and exploited people

636
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,425
which resulted
in tarnishing the prestige of nobility.

637
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:03,219
Moreover, he deceived
me and the Crown Prince

638
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,471
and disgraced the royal family.

639
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,974
The degree of his crime is quite severe.

640
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,726
Therefore,

641
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,062
he is no longer a lecturer
for the Crown Prince

642
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,940
and will be banished
after facing 50 whips.

643
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,568
And those who helped him

644
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,905
to run Samgaebang
will be forced to do manual labor.

645
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,327
If that is the punishment I deserve,
I will accept it.

646
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:32,832
But without the prisoners,
the punishment can't be executed.

647
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,294
My assistants from Samgaebang are missing.

648
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,504
Please tell me where they are.

649
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,798
What are you talking about?

650
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,342
I thought they were imprisoned
at Hanseong Magistracy.

651
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,805
Someone took them.

652
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,485
Allow me…

653
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,614
to answer that question.

654
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,671
{\an8}-Your Royal Highness.
<i>-Your generosity</i>

655
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,715
{\an8}<i>knows no limit, Your Royal Highness.</i>

656
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,844
{\an8}<i>Please let me be
in charge of receiving the envoys.</i>

657
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:11,097
{\an8}<i>I ask you to put
your faith in me this time.</i>

658
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,308
{\an8}<i>Thank you for the warm welcome.</i>

659
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,061
{\an8}That's enough.
You are in the palace of Joseon.

660
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,147
{\an8}<i>I brought you here to show you
something fun, Your Royal Highness.</i>

661
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,275
{\an8}What are you doing?

662
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,151
{\an8}<i>Your Royal Highness.</i>

663
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,364
{\an8}<i>I put my faith in you.
Yet, you disappointed me.</i>

664
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:33,452
