1
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,083
I'm late. Darn it.

2
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,933
Your Royal Highness.

3
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,021
Where has your mind wandered off to?

4
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,024
You couldn't hear me despite my attempts
to grab your attention.

5
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,319
I'll be late.

6
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,322
If we're done, I should go.

7
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,333
Did you enjoy your drinks last night?

8
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,419
How could you have let him accompany you
instead of me?

9
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,755
I must say I felt left out.

10
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,050
There's no need to feel that way.
I'll include you next time.

11
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,051
Thank you.

12
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,513
-Who's conducting today's morning lecture?
-I heard that it's Royal Tutor Jung.

13
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,687
Is something wrong?

14
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,068
No.

15
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,654
Five steps, remember?

16
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,743
EPISODE 9

17
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,410
Why did I do such a thing?

18
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,204
I blame the alcohol.

19
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,040
Why did I have to drink so much?

20
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,917
Why aren't you heading inside?

21
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,462
Oh, well…

22
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,132
I was enjoying the fine weather

23
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,217
and the beautiful flowers.

24
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,428
Your Royal Highness,
Royal Tutor Jung is here!

25
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,358
<i>NONEO</i>

26
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,653
{\an8}THE MASTER SAID…

27
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,252
{\an8}Last night--

28
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,171
{\an8}I deserve to die, Your Royal Highness.

29
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,883
{\an8}Alcohol got the best of me

30
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,969
{\an8}which led to
an unforgivable act on my part.

31
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,847
{\an8}I seek your forgiveness.

32
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,224
{\an8}Oh…

33
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,812
{\an8}Of course. I understand.

34
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,149
{\an8}Pardon?

35
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:02,195
{\an8}That's how it is with alcohol,
don't you agree?

36
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,365
{\an8}Everyone makes a drunken mistake
at least once in their lives.

37
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,994
{\an8}So don't be too concerned about it.

38
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,122
We can just laugh it off.

39
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,379
Of course.

40
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,218
You sure are a generous man
who understands the effects of alcohol.

41
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,887
I'm not one to make such mistakes,

42
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,098
so I don't know what came over me.

43
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,727
You seemed so stunning
under the moonlight and I…

44
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh, no… My goodness.

45
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,030
That isn't what I meant.

46
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,662
By the way,

47
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,582
I have something for you,
Royal Tutor Jung.

48
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,512
They are candies.

49
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,266
I hope it's the right amount
of sweetness for you.

50
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,644
Why would you give me this?

51
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,273
You went through a great deal
regarding the envoys.

52
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,153
I seem to only be receiving your help,
which is why I prepared a gift.

53
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,407
I hope that it suits your palate.

54
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,442
I see you're back, Royal Tutor Jung.

55
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,407
Did you receive yours?

56
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,534
Receive what?

57
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,082
What…

58
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,921
Oh, good. You received one as well.

59
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,007
This is what His Royal Highness said
as he handed it to me.

60
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,594
"You went through a great deal
regarding the envoys.

61
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:36,307
I seem to only be receiving your help
which is why I prepared a gift."

62
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,101
How benevolent is that?

63
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,522
His eyes were warm when he told me

64
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,440
that he hoped I would enjoy the candies.

65
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,569
He was also concerned
that they may be too sweet for me.

66
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,029
So considerate.

67
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,323
It's the first in 20 years.

68
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,284
It's the first time in 20 years
that my hard work was acknowledged.

69
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,370
I can finally understand

70
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,248
why you broke out into a speech
to give him high praise.

71
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,001
The sweetness is perfect.

72
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,171
Mine's bitter. Could it be bellflower?

73
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,749
I dismissed everyone at home,
so do not be concerned.

74
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,105
I'm curious as to what brings you by,
Your Majesty.

75
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,774
Great Lord Changcheon.

76
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,693
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,280
Using the Ming envoy as leverage,

78
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,949
Lord Sangheon obtained
the development rights in Yeoyeon.

79
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,995
What purpose do you think it will serve?

80
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,581
I don't quite follow.

81
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,418
Yeoyeon is constantly invaded
by barbarians.

82
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,796
Under the pretense of tightening security
at the northern border,

83
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,424
he will try and grow his army.

84
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,762
-Then…
-Build a private army of your own.

85
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,222
One that can stand against his.

86
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,850
You…

87
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,395
have my support.

88
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,732
Your Majesty!

89
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,701
Yeong-ji, eat up.

90
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,003
Why have you been so out of it?

91
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,548
Aren't you going to have any?
We'll finish them then.

92
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,762
Sure. Help yourselves.

93
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,431
Don't be like that and eat with us.

94
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,935
They are from His Royal Highness.
We feel bad eating them alone.

95
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,686
She's right. Have some.

96
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,273
Guys.

97
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,153
Forget it.

98
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,572
What on earth is this about?

99
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,909
Don't just keep it to yourself
and tell us already!

100
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,202
Well…

101
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,834
So it's like this.

102
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,461
Someone I know got drunk

103
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,382
and kissed the cheek
of the person next to him.

104
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,345
The one that was kissed
didn't seem fazed by it at all.

105
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:06,308
But the one who did the kissing
is upset by that person's reaction.

106
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,061
Because that person
nonchalantly brushed it off.

107
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:14,150
Also, it turned out he wasn't the only one

108
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,362
that the person showed kindness
and generosity toward.

109
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,992
That upset him too.

110
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,787
Why do you think that is?

111
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,038
Seriously?

112
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,499
Hold on. Who are you talking about?

113
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,836
You or someone you know?

114
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,172
Someone I know, of course.

115
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,840
Does he…

116
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,800
like that person?

117
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,761
-What?
-Isn't that what provokes jealousy?

118
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,307
You want that person
to only have eyes for you

119
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,018
and you get upset
when they aren't aware of your feelings.

120
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,812
With expectation comes disappointment.

121
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,982
No way.

122
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,611
I doubt it.

123
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,067
From what I hear,

124
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,320
His Majesty left the palace last night

125
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,031
and wasn't back even at the end of curfew.

126
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,953
Eunuch Cho, as his most trusted servant,

127
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,247
you would know why.

128
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,249
I have no clue as to what you're saying.

129
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,919
His Majesty retired to his chambers early

130
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,339
and didn't step foot outside last night.

131
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,511
Again, you choose to play dumb?

132
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,097
Why do you keep doing this to me?

133
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,351
Don't you know I'm one
of His Majesty's most loyal servants?

134
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,481
Ten years ago,

135
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,192
you came to me in tears

136
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,862
begging me to save your dying wife.

137
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,739
Have you already forgotten that?

138
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,285
I believe I already
paid back my debt in full.

139
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,121
Yes, quite handsomely might I add.

140
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,791
If you hadn't

141
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,630
hidden the letter
at the royal preceptor's house back then,

142
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,509
I wouldn't have been able
to eliminate those loyal to His Majesty.

143
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,429
If he ever finds out about it,

144
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:36,268
I'm sure he'll be most touched
by the loyalty you displayed.

145
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,857
Why not just tell me to pay with my life?

146
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,277
That I could do hundreds
and thousands of times over.

147
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,322
Your life?

148
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,285
You should hold onto that
for the sake of His Majesty.

149
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,821
Royal Tutor Jung.

150
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,741
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

151
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,785
No.

152
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,413
No, it's nothing.

153
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,083
I hardly think that's the case.
You're flushed.

154
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,293
Just tell me. How do you feel?

155
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,628
Describe your symptoms.

156
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,050
Well, you see…

157
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,137
It feels like…

158
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,515
something is squeezing my chest.

159
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,854
Multiple times a day,
my heart pounds erratically.

160
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:06,692
And I'm spacing out all day
and I can't think straight.

161
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:11,321
Wait. They sound like the symptoms
I came across in a book.

162
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,366
Is that so?
Then do tell us what he's suffering from.

163
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,953
Your face flushes involuntarily

164
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,622
and your mood goes from excited

165
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,624
to suddenly depressed.

166
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,211
Sometimes, you see and hear things,

167
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,424
while a certain someone
keeps appearing in your dreams.

168
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,594
Exactly!

169
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,138
-Yes, I knew it.
-What does he have?

170
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,681
You're lovesick!

171
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,892
Pardon?

172
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,021
Who is the young lady
that is driving you crazy?

173
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,857
What?

174
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,068
There's no young lady.

175
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,486
That's not the case.

176
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,322
Come on.
There's no need to be embarrassed.

177
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,616
-Just give us a name--
-Hold on!

178
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,912
I forgot that I needed something
from the library.

179
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,163
-I had better get going.
-Royal Tutor…

180
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,915
-Royal Tutor Jung.
-Royal Tutor Jung!

181
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,124
Royal Tutor Jung!

182
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm definitely right.

183
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,921
Who could it be?

184
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,130
Any ideas?

185
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,311
Hey.

186
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,815
You look awful. Is something wrong?

187
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,318
It's nothing.

188
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,697
Nothing's going on. Absolutely nothing.

189
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,284
As if. Unbelievable.

190
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,331
Take a look over there.

191
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,668
They're the dancers
for the upcoming banquet

192
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,629
and they've had all the men
within the palace gawking at them.

193
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,597
No!

194
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,058
That can't be.

195
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,978
That's not possible. It just isn't.

196
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,146
What do you mean?

197
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,191
What is he on about?

198
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,621
No way.

199
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,459
Find inner peace. Let's read some books.

200
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,801
Okay, let's see.

201
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,127
Why do I keep seeing…

202
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,761
What on earth?

203
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,097
Why do you keep appearing?

204
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,599
Leave.

205
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,809
Go away!

206
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,186
Go!

207
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,605
Have you lost your mind?

208
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,323
Is it really you, Your Royal Highness?

209
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,081
What brings you here?

210
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,376
I'm looking for a book, of course.

211
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,088
Oh, right.

212
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,382
I see.

213
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,009
That reminds me.

214
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,470
Did you enjoy

215
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,723
the candies I gave you?

216
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,395
Yes, of course.

217
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,897
They were delicious.

218
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,277
I'm glad.

219
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,759
I…

220
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,220
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

221
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,849
I'm not feeling well
and must excuse myself.

222
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,188
Go ahead.

223
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,189
Right.

224
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,488
What's with Royal Tutor Jung?

225
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,823
Anyway, here are your books.

226
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,536
Where could my daughter be going

227
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,830
after dolling herself up this beautifully?

228
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,583
-Do I look pretty?
-I couldn't recognize you at first.

229
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,503
I thought an angel had come to our house.

230
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,381
Unbelievable. Dad, please.

231
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,137
Now that you mention it,
I do see a resemblance.

232
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,101
My lady,

233
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,479
Lady So-eun is here.

234
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,564
Already?

235
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,698
Not so fast.

236
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,158
So-eun!

237
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,371
Goodness, are you all right?

238
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,500
Not a second goes by
without me worrying about you.

239
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,714
You got here early.

240
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,258
-Are you ready to go?
-Yes.

241
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,179
Where exactly are you going
that has her this excited?

242
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,472
I'm headed to the palace
to run an errand for my father

243
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,142
-and Ha-gyeong wanted to join me.
-The palace?

244
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,019
I'll get going, Dad.

245
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,939
Don't wander off to places

246
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,401
and follow So-eun around. Do you hear me?

247
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,365
Gosh, this is amazing.

248
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,784
I wonder what it'd be like to live here.

249
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,995
GEUNJEONGJEON

250
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,830
Can you wait for me here?

251
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,583
I'll take this to my father
and come right back out.

252
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,460
Sure. Don't worry about me and go.

253
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,221
Who are those two young ladies?

254
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,348
They don't seem familiar.

255
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,851
One is the daughter
of the Minister of Personnel

256
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,355
while the other
is the daughter of the Minister of War.

257
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,115
You seem to be from a noble family.

258
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,534
Why are you here in the palace alone?

259
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,955
Oh, I just followed the scent of flowers.

260
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,583
There is nothing to see here,

261
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,626
so head another way.

262
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,682
Your Royal Highness.

263
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,145
The Queen Dowager requests your presence.

264
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,272
-The Queen Dowager?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

265
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,075
Your Royal Highness?

266
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,160
He's the Crown Prince?

267
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,679
No way.

268
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,313
<i>The selection of a princess?</i>

269
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,541
I thought we were done speaking of this.

270
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,212
I still stand with what I said last time.

271
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,509
The Crown Prince is still unwell,
so we'll revisit the idea some other time.

272
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,471
Until when will you let others
question the weight of his crown?

273
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,101
We must hold a royal marriage,
so he can produce an heir.

274
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,813
This can't be postponed any longer.

275
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,617
Commander Yoon accompanied him
on a trip to see his father-in-law.

276
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,246
That is all I know.

277
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,332
Crown Prince, what is your take on this?

278
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,669
Is marriage what you desire?

279
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,136
The envoy reception only just ended.

280
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,473
Another big event such as a royal wedding

281
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,934
will burden our people.

282
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,688
Please be more considerate of them

283
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,442
and postpone the royal wedding
just a little bit.

284
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,325
Regarding the selection of a princess,

285
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:50,163
I hope that you will be patient
until I readdress this matter.

286
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,042
Is it because…

287
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,592
you are set on passing the crown
to Prince Jehyeon?

288
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,969
If that is not the case,

289
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:10,183
why are you in constant opposition
to His Royal Highness' marriage?

290
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,019
Lord Sangheon,
I suggest you watch your words.

291
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:17,690
You were already married
and were a father to His Royal Highness

292
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,568
when you were his age.

293
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,488
If it's the people
Your Majesty wishes to do right by,

294
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:28,493
then a royal marriage and
the birth of an heir must be a priority.

295
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,622
The people and members of the royal court

296
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:37,210
eagerly await His Royal Highness' wedding.

297
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,840
That is enough.

298
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,718
The selection of a princess

299
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,221
has always been conducted
by the ladies of the royal palace.

300
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,515
I will take matters into my own hands.

301
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:00,149
JAGYEONGJEON

302
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,209
I wish to return to my quarters.

303
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,938
Is something wrong, Your Majesty?

304
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,941
It's nothing.

305
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,103
What should we do, Your Royal Highness?

306
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,148
The Queen Dowager
is clearly adamant on the matter

307
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,527
which means it'll no longer be possible
to postpone your marriage.

308
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,030
Fret not, Your Royal Highness.

309
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,242
You've been preparing
for what you know is inevitable.

310
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,370
You know what to do.

311
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,290
You will take the hand
of your betrothed like so.

312
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,797
Then say, "My heart now belongs to you."

313
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,298
I'd rather be alone.

314
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,717
Please leave.

315
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,136
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

316
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,063
This would definitely work.

317
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,996
The Crown Prince?

318
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,956
That's what I said.

319
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,335
You should have seen the way

320
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,046
he took me by the waist
to stop me from falling.

321
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,133
Could this be what is known as destiny?

322
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,596
I have a new goal.

323
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,975
I'm going to be the Crown Princess.

324
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,476
For sure.

325
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:47,942
Jan-i, over here.

326
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,821
I'll get going then.

327
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,949
Don't be distracted on your way home

328
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,161
and please get home safely,
Crown Princess-to-be.

329
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,497
Crown Princess-to-be? Stop that.

330
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,249
I'll get going then.

331
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,050
Lady So-eun!

332
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,718
-Stop.
-Catch me!

333
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,511
-Give it back.
-It's mine!

334
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,473
That's mine!

335
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,477
My gosh!

336
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,228
Goodness. Oh, no…

337
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,396
What…

338
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,399
Forgive me, my lord. Are you all right?

339
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,568
Are you kidding me?

340
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,238
I'm truly sorry.
Please let me wipe it clean.

341
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,199
Stop that, you dirty wench.

342
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,785
How dare you lay your hands on me.

343
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,453
-My goodness!
-Oh, dear!

344
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,292
Jan-i, are you all right?

345
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,460
My lady.

346
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,171
What do you think you're doing?

347
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,256
What do I think I'm doing?

348
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,258
Really?

349
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,387
Talk about having a lousy day.

350
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,191
I'm glad.

351
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,020
Let me apologize
for the trouble my maid caused.

352
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,567
I hope my apology can appease your anger.

353
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,278
Compensation will be made
for your ruined clothes.

354
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,281
Unbelievable. Do I look like
I need monetary compensation?

355
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,991
Let's see.

356
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,120
How exactly will you pay me back?

357
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,207
With that sweet little face of yours?

358
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,335
Please stop this!

359
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,257
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to, you crazy wench?

360
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,512
And who might you be?

361
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,641
Lord Jung?

362
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,977
What…

363
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,938
Let go of my hand. Drop it.

364
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,234
We have spectators, Lord Changun.

365
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,944
Please be careful.

366
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,032
Do you have no idea
who you're speaking to?

367
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,910
Wait.

368
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,204
Oh, I see.

369
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,124
You're the Crown Prince's royal tutor,
aren't you?

370
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,418
Did being in his good graces
lead you to believe

371
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,587
that you had some sort of authority?

372
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,133
Who are you to order me to be careful?

373
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,678
You must have a death wish today.

374
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,639
Let me make it come true.

375
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,852
All right.

376
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,901
Hasn't your house arrest
only been lifted recently?

377
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,948
Causing a commotion
will only put you in a bad position.

378
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,494
What? You brazen rat.

379
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,330
I guess it's admirable.

380
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,999
I dare you to push your luck again.

381
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,960
Do it.

382
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,503
That's enough.

383
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,762
You are out of line.

384
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,807
How dare you stand
in the way of the royal family.

385
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,602
This is quite the party we're having,
don't you think?

386
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,479
Unbelievable.

387
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,233
Uncle, you should also show dignity
as a member of the royal family.

388
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,943
I'm glad you mentioned that.

389
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,696
It is why I mean to teach these lowlifes

390
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,699
the custom and order of our class system.

391
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,494
So stay out of my way today.

392
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,871
Come here.

393
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:20,256
Didn't I specifically tell you
that you have done enough?

394
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,472
Damn it!

395
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,350
What are you looking at, you bastards?

396
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,314
You may take her home.

397
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,244
My nephew, you have made
a huge mistake today.

398
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,414
Rather than teaching
those lowlifes a lesson,

399
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,250
you stood in my way when eyes were on us.

400
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,795
It was you who almost made a mistake.

401
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,133
She is the daughter
of the Minister of Personnel.

402
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,552
It won't be wise to create problems.

403
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,845
What?

404
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,431
Darn it.

405
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,893
Why are they all chummy anyway?

406
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,520
Has marriage been suggested between them?

407
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,259
It could've been dangerous for you.
Why did you intervene?

408
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,889
It being a dangerous situation
is exactly why I took action.

409
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,604
I see a different side to you
every time we meet, Lord Jung.

410
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:04,527
And I'm curious to see
what more you have to offer.

411
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,325
Expressing my gratitude
with words is not enough.

412
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,122
Jan-i is like a sister to me, you see.

413
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,795
It must have startled you,
so please get some rest.

414
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,049
Jan-i, don't feel too bad about it
and get some rest.

415
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,081
I hear you had an audience
with the Queen Dowager today.

416
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,754
Being a Crown Prince

417
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,966
can feel futile at times.

418
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,428
One must accept a loveless marriage

419
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,181
just because it's a state affair.

420
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:18,976
Maybe…

421
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,396
you could perhaps put in a word for me?

422
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,735
Petition that the wedding be postponed
for your dear younger cousin's sake.

423
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,988
I wouldn't mind taking advantage
of your influence for once.

424
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,240
Your Royal Highness…

425
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,415
I was just joking.

426
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,710
There's no need to take it so seriously.

427
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,756
It's impossible to joke around with you.

428
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,731
May I…

429
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,400
ask you something?

430
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,578
Have you ever loved someone,
Your Royal Highness?

431
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,997
Pardon?

432
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,088
Gosh. Hyun, how silly of you.

433
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:35,010
Here you are teasing a groom-to-be.

434
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,807
It's why I'm asking.

435
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,936
Have you ever harbored
romantic feelings for anyone?

436
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,815
You've never mentioned it before.

437
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,621
Of course, I had someone.

438
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,087
It was back when I was young.

439
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,009
A scuffle one day at the palace

440
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,178
led to us falling into a pond.

441
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,890
Only I knew how to swim,

442
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,602
so I saved the child.

443
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,449
"Yeon-seon"?

444
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,492
Dam-i is a pretty name,

445
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,496
but I wanted to call you
by a more meaningful name.

446
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,085
Although it was a brief encounter,

447
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,172
it still is a memory…

448
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,967
I haven't been able to forget.

449
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,970
I guess…

450
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,601
you could say it was my first love.

451
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,441
Royal Tutor Jung?

452
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:02,116
What brings you by the palace
this early in the morning?

453
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,162
I have a favor to ask,
Your Royal Highness.

454
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,834
Please…

455
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,422
give me a hug.

456
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,967
What are you saying?

457
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,348
Royal Tutor Jung, are you ill?

458
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,059
Yes, I'm unwell.

459
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,938
I'm a mess, you see.

460
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,774
So please…

461
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,986
Indulge me this once.

462
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:44,825
You're obviously not thinking clearly.
How could you ask that of him?

463
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,454
Let me embrace you instead.

464
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,126
I hope you find your strength,

465
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,462
Royal Tutor Jung.

466
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,949
Are you better now?

467
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,122
Let's head out.

468
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,441
Why on earth did you do that,
Your Royal Highness?

469
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,069
How could you have given in
to that ridiculous request?

470
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,405
The people passing by saw you two.

471
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,575
He said he's a mess
and that he's under a lot of stress.

472
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,661
Exactly! How could one
ask a favor for such reasons

473
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,788
and how could one indulge him?

474
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:59,543
Why you two acted that way is beyond me!

475
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,547
Because I like him, that's why.

476
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,632
Liking him is one thing but…

477
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,343
My goodness.

478
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,429
Pardon?

479
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,933
I'll soon be married…

480
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,188
so I should be allowed
to at least do that.

481
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,898
Right?

482
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,526
Your Royal Highness!

483
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,237
Don't you worry…

484
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,990
for I'll soon get rid of these feelings.

485
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,205
Did you hear about
the upcoming princess selection?

486
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,873
A princess selection, my goodness.

487
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:27,589
Is our Crown Prince
finally entering adulthood?

488
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,801
You'll soon be busy
once the princess selection begins.

489
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,303
-Of course.
-What did you just say?

490
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,847
A princess selection?

491
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,517
The Crown Prince is getting married?

492
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,395
Why are you surprised by this?

493
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,439
His Royal Highness is at an age
where he should get married.

494
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,692
Yes, of course.

495
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,152
This will excite maidens
across the country.

496
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,783
His Royal Highness may be aloof,
but he is quite handsome.

497
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,952
You're darn right he's handsome.
Just like me.

498
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,705
Royal Scholar Yang,
you have the face of a jester.

499
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,872
A gallant, you say?

500
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,416
A gallant…

501
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,766
Are you still feeling unwell?

502
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,978
If that's the case, the lecture--

503
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,230
I hear a wedding is imminent.

504
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,483
Oh…

505
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,362
That's right.

506
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,867
It should have happened a while ago

507
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,327
but it took longer than expected.

508
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,498
Congratulations, Your Royal Highness.

509
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,711
It's great news.

510
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,551
I appreciate it, Royal Tutor Jung.

511
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,013
Please let me know

512
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,723
if I can help in any way.

513
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,728
I doubt you'll find anyone
with more knowledge regarding women.

514
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,482
I'll consider it.

515
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,944
Once the process begins,

516
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,031
I will look forward to your help.

517
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,401
That's right.

518
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,656
It's not like anything
could have happened anyway.

519
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,784
What could come out

520
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,911
of having feelings for a man…

521
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,626
who is the Crown Prince
with a wedding underway?

522
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,548
Get a grip on yourself, Ji-un.

523
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,217
Get a grip.

524
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,640
What's with the serious look on your face?

525
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,268
You're here.

526
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,396
How are the preparations
for the wedding coming along?

527
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,002
That one-sided love you once mentioned.

528
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,920
Why did you never confess your feelings?

529
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,761
Because I thought the feelings
would never be reciprocated.

530
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,058
I was also worried that telling her
would only put a distance between us.

531
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,564
You should have told her though.

532
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,650
Who knows how people will react?

533
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,197
Maybe I should have.

534
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,827
Actually, no.

535
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,996
It's not common

536
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:32,334
for someone else
to share the same feelings.

537
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,004
So I'd rather keep them to myself.

538
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,673
I will not burden her…

539
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,092
or have any regrets.

540
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,220
That's how it'll be.

541
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,770
How corny, Lord Jaeun.

542
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,815
What? That's what you say
when I opened up to you?

543
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,484
How dare you.

544
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,485
You…

545
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:04,824
You did that on purpose
knowing I'm afraid of water.

546
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,534
Okay, fine. We'll stop this.

547
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,787
Gosh.

548
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,501
Didn't you say

549
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,879
you fell into a pond at the palace
when you were young?

550
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,757
I told you multiple times already.

551
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,635
On the day of the banquet
when I first met Dam-i.

552
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,428
She saved my life.

553
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,518
A scuffle one day at the palace

554
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,229
led to us falling into a pond.

555
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,400
Only I knew how to swim,

556
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,360
<i>so I saved the child.</i>

557
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,488
When did you say the girl disappeared?

558
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,408
Why do you suddenly ask?

559
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,246
She was an orphan taken in by monks
who came to stay at the palace.

560
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,667
-I should get going.
-What?

561
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:57,877
Hyun!

562
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,113
Where did they go?

563
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,290
Oh, right.

564
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:51,723
NOKUNGAK

565
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,553
{\an8}WAIT

566
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,265
{\an8}LONGING, WAIT

567
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:42,398
{\an8}REST, STAY

568
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,112
It wasn't…

569
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,449
a dream.

570
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,398
That was…

571
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,775
I…

572
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,071
The alcohol got the best of me and I…

573
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,783
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

574
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,076
Please forgive me.

575
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,912
It's all right.

576
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:43,001
It seems as though
I've become quite approachable to you.

577
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:46,171
Well, that's not what it is.

578
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,317
Those.

579
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,572
-Sorry?
-Could I take a look at them?

580
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,452
Oh…

581
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,401
She told me to give these to you
if I ever met you.

582
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,695
She told me

583
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,907
they would help you
stay strong when things get hard…

584
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,493
<i>just like…</i>

585
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,204
<i>they had been helpful for her.</i>

586
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,764
For a long time, I wondered…

587
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,769
of the man you came to be.

588
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,325
{\an8}LONGING, WAIT

589
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:49,062
NOT

590
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,638
{\an8}WAIT

591
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,811
I thought it was a dream.

592
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,606
I believed that my impure feelings for you

593
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,901
came to haunt me.

594
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,447
However…

595
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,536
it wasn't…

596
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,122
{\an8}STAY, LONGING

597
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,207
…a dream.

598
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,504
I will believe you

599
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,133
if you say the feelings were momentary.

600
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,596
But it wasn't for me.

601
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,599
It wasn't admiration from a subject.

602
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,768
I thought it was my loyalty to you.

603
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,604
But it was affection.

604
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,444
I have a deep affection for you,
Your Royal Highness.

605
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,533
Although you're a man
and the Crown Prince of this nation,

606
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,911
I…

607
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,542
love you.

608
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,128
{\an8}<i>What do you mean
His Royal Highness isn't at the palace?</i>

609
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,047
{\an8}<i>He must know that</i>

610
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,383
{\an8}<i>the Queen Dowager
is expecting to see him this afternoon.</i>

611
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:10,137
{\an8}<i>So His Majesty finally gave his blessing
for the royal marriage?</i>

612
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,224
{\an8}<i>You are So-eun,
the daughter of the Minister of Personnel?</i>

613
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,559
{\an8}<i>I will endure it.</i>

614
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:18,688
{\an8}<i>Whatever people say, I will endure it all.</i>

615
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:23,359
{\an8}<i>Perhaps, it might have been better
if we had never met again.</i>

616
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,153
{\an8}<i>Are you ordering me to leave?</i>

617
