00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,790
You can tell Aunt Wei Wei

196
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,350
that you're neither poor nor miserable.

197
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,180
Even the car I drive belongs to you.

198
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,590
Why would you hide your identity

199
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,950
as The Great Winter?

200
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,150
This drink is not for you.

201
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,750
It's not time yet, I'm afraid.

202
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,030
If I tell her now,

203
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,270
she would

204
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,350
remember what happened ten years ago.

205
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,870
What about Yao Yang Tech?

206
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,270
[The culprit? Super Taste]

207
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,230
Are you really going to work there?

[Yao Yang Tech]

209
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,510
Yes, of course.

210
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,100
[The culprit?]

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,740
[Cyber Tech]

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,210
Xuan He.

213
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,070
Where did he go?

214
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,670
Qin Yue.

215
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,350
President Wei has gone out.

216
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,430
Where did he go?

217
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,910
Today is my birthday.

218
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,550
He promised

219
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,470
to celebrate with me.

220
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,470
Qin Yue,

221
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,070
I don't think it's appropriate

222
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,510
to talk about personal matters

223
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,190
in the company, am I right?

224
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,310
What do you mean?

225
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,590
I've been with him

226
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,150
for two years already.

227
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,470
Forget it.

228
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,550
You're just an assistant,

229
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,750
there's no point in telling you.

230
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,470
Where exactly is he?

231
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,950
President Wei is carrying out

232
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,350
his usual work arrangements.

233
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,670
You still wouldn't tell me?

234
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,550
Fine.

235
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,070
I'll find it out myself.

236
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,190

Tongcheng University?

[Moonlit Flats]

238
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,670
Both of them were in a relationship.

239
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,470
After that, the woman left him again.

240
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,790

-Yes.

This is it.

what is your intention?

your intention.

Use the embedded program

319
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,790
I want to know

320
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,870
what is going on here.

321
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,420
Sure, Xiao Dong.

322
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,710
Take this.

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,780
What is it?

324
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,510
It can identify

325
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,990
whether you're

326
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,070
telling the truth or not.

327
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,270
You may leave now.

328
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,550
So, I just hold it in my hands?

329
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,830
I'm so exhausted.

331
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,070
to be able to solve the problem.

332
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,350
Are you going to retaliate against me?

333
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,070
You may choose to leave anytime.

334
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,830
Furthermore,

335
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,750
you're not worth retaliating.

336
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,550
Do you think I'll leave just like that?

337
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,790
Don't worry.

338
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,670
I didn't see anything

Wait, let me close the door.

Over there.

this is the farthest distance

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,660
Try it.

388
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,500
I couldn't even make it

389
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,380
pass that table.

390
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,110
I don't know why...

391
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,950
I now suspect that

392
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,390
you're stalking me.

393
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,340
No, I don't have to,

394
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,030
right?

395
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,910
Why should I follow you?

396
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,910
Right?

397
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,740
That's so strange.

398
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,950
Wait.

399
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,750
I'm really telling the truth.

400
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,710
I don't need to lie to you.

401
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,550
I also wonder

402
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,350
how I ended up here.

403
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,230
I...

404
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,670
Don't look at me like that.

405
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,630
I really didn't lie to you.

406
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,310
Do you know that

407
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,670
it's hard to grab a seat

408
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,790
in President Wei's elective course?

409
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,590
You're right.

410
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,420
He is also the most handsome

411
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,350
guest professor.

412
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,350
You're right.

413
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,750
Hello, students.

414
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,150
Hi, President Wei.

415
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,430
The way you address me

416
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,510
makes me feel like

417
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,660
we're miles apart.

418
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,750
How about this?

419
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,550
You may call me senior.

420
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,390
After all, I'm also an alumni

421
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,630
of this school.

422
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,790
Hello, senior.

423
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,110
Great.

424
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,350
It seems that

425
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,630
none of you are absent today.

426
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,830
I shall skip the roll call.

427
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,070
Let's start our lesson.

428
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,110
As all of you know...

429
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,110
Senior Wei, can I have your autograph?

430
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,670
Senior,

431
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,750
can I have your autograph too?

432
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,310
Me too.

433
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,590
Students,

434
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,110
the reason

435
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,110
we're here today

436
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,030
is to attend my lesson.

437
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,510
I hope all of you can abide

438
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,670
by classroom discipline.

439
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,150
Since we have to abide
by classroom discipline,

440
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,790
then why

441
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,350
are you having your lesson here?

442
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,430
That's a good question.

443
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,500
Please sit down.

444
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,870
I chose this place

445
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,430
because

446
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,070
the subject of our elective course is

447
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,220
The Infinite Possibilities of Media

448
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,390
endued by New Network Technology.

449
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,670
While we are here,

450
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,710
our minds can be set free

451
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,470
and break away

452
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,910
from our traditional way of thinking.

453
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,870
So

454
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,310
that's it for our outdoor lesson

455
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,740
today.

456
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,030
If you have any questions,

457
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,350
feel free to come and ask me.

458
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,270
Also,

459
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,270
your homework is

460
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,510
to think about

461
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,470
the location

462
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,910
for our next class.

463
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,310
Senior.

464
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,780
I have a question.

465
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,710
If today is

466
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,420
your girlfriend's birthday,

467
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,390
where would you bring her

468
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,910
to celebrate her birthday?

469
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,150
Senior Wei,

470
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,910
do you have a girlfriend?

471
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,420
Tell us, Senior.

472
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,300
Do you have a girlfriend?

473
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,990
Senior.

474
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,750
Do you have a girlfriend?

475
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,540
Students.

476
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,750
I should remind you that

477
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,780
we should only

478
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,550
ask questions

479
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,590
that are related to

480
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,590
the course.

481
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,750
Thank you, everyone.

482
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,430
Senior Wei.

483
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,700
I have applied for

484
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,910
an internship at your company.

485
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,590
I hope it can be approved.

486
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,270
Great.

487
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,390
I look forward to your performance.

488
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,420
If you face any difficulties,

489
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,300
just let me know.

490
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,550
Senior, I want it too.

491
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,310
Me too.

492
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:49,870
Students,

493
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,710
I have faith in all of you.

494
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,190
Let's work hard together.

495
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,340
Senior...

496
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,830
Senior Wei.

Xuan He.

498
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,590
Senior...

499
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,460
I want to apply too.

500
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,510
Please return Turing to me.

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,030

503
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,220
we just collected.

505
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,110
Got it, Xiao Dong.

506
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,670
Based on all the information gathered,

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,630

Wait...

509
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,420
What do you mean "unknown entity"?

510
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,470
I'm a person.

511
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,230
Don't mind her, please continue.

512
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,630
Noted, Xiao Dong.

513
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,270
The data shows that

[Continue analysing]

515
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,070
the distance between you

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,950
and the unknown entity

517
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,670
is shrinking.

518
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,950
The rate will increase

519
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,150
when the unknown entity

520
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,710
gets weary.

521
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,910
At the same time, it shows that

522
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,390
when the unknown entity
is in a stable condition,

523
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,310
the distance between both of you

524
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,630
will gradually revert

525
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,830
to its original distance.

526
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,110
Moreover, it's not directly affected by

527
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,150
the location or landmark.

528
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,550

If you need to change the language,

532
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,670
please reset the language settings.

533
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,430
So, what is the conclusion?

534
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,030
The unknown entity

535
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,670
is unable to leave you,

536
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,510
and not your house.

537
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,820
-Unable to leave me?
-What?

538
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,150
What did you

539
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,030
just say?

540
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,550
That the distance between us

541
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,780
is shrinking?

542
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,150
So, what will happen eventually?

543
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,030
I can't predict it.

544
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,990
Both of you may get closer indefinitely.

545
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,750
Does it mean

546
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,790
I have to stay close to him?

547
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,590
That's too ridiculous.

Of course not.

565

You won't get angry, right?

566
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,550
I won't.

00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,190
Xuan He.

581
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,390
Are you always this rational

582
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,590
and calm?

583
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,710
I know you had

584
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,710
a girlfriend in college.

585
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,470
You insisted on being with her
even though your family was against it.

586
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,830
After that, she went missing.

587
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,180
It's been ten years, and
you still couldn't forget her.

588
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,390
If your ex-girlfriend is still around,

589
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,310
perhaps you wouldn't be

590
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,750
as calm

591
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,590
and rational as you are now.

592
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,030
Do you remember

593
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,780
what I just told you?

594
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,910
Don't let others

595
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,830
discover your abnormality

596
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,140

Uniqueness.

598

Don't let others discover your uniqueness.

599
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,550
Got it.

600
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,990
Stay closely, don't give the game away.

601
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,870
I know.

602
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,430
My goodness.

603
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,670
Such a lousy company.

604
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,780
Ridiculous.

605
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,990
Let's just leave.

606
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,140
It's not a huge loss for us.

607
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,190

Here, let me show you around the company.

619
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,350
Wait,

620
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,550
why is she hiding behind you?

621
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,590
Who is she?

622
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,030
-Cousin.
-Classmate.

623
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,350
-Classmate.
-Cousin.

624
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,150
I have no time for games.

625
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,540
Tell me the truth.

626
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,910
She's my cousin... I guess.

627
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,470
What do you mean?

628
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,790
I don't care.

629
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,630
Xu Xiao Dong.

630
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,750
How dare you

631
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,470
bring your cousin along
on your first day at work?

632
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,270
Do you know

633
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,830
what the company hates the most?

634
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,910
Lack of professionalism.

635
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,230
No, wait a minute.

636
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,350
It wasn't his fault.

637
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,590
I cannot be separated from him.

638
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,790
Otherwise, I would no longer exist.

639
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,030
It might sound other-worldly,

640
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,990
but she's right.

641

Tell you what,

772
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,470
Winter has single-handedly

773
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,590
created a whole new space

774
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,790
for all gamers to

775
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,110
discover their true identities

776
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,670
within an unfamiliar world.

777
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,750
Not only that,

778
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,670
he's the reason we found
our sense of belonging.

779
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,030
Discover their true identities

780
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,710
within an unfamiliar world?

781
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,230
That's the reason why

782
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,430
Winter deserves our admiration.

783
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,540
How do I communicate with him?

784
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,590
Actually, you can just

785
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,710
drop him a private message.

786
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,590
But many people have been

787
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,430
doing so,

788
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,350
and he is extremely busy,

789
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,550
so he might never reply
to your messages.

790
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,750
Never mind, I'll try.

791
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,710
Cousin.

792
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,950
You don't have an account, right?

793
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,270
You may use my account

794
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:48,790
to send him...

795
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,710
Use my account.

796
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,420
No, use mine.

797
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,300
I've upgraded my account.

798
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,070
Cousin, it's ready to use.

799
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,070
-Cousin...
-Thank you.

800
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,510
Come on, get back to work.

801
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,220
Bye, cousin.

802
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,790
-Let's go.
-It's time to work.

803
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,110
Traitor.

804
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,110
You too.

805
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,310
Hi, Winter.

806
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,190
[Moonlit Flats]

807
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,870
I'm so exhausted.

808
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,910
I should be saying that.

809
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,430
Don't forget to ask

810
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,710
your Turing program

811
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,950
regarding the progress of

812
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,500
finding my identity.

813
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,830
I'll do it even without you telling me.

814
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,870
How troublesome.

815
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,270
Xiao Dong, open the door.

816
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,030
Xiao Dong, open the door. It's me.

817
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,190
One trouble follows another.

818
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,110
We must never let him find out

819
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,030
that you are here.
