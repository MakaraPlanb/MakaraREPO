This is not the personality I had in mind.

188
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,190
I want to be the bossy president type.

189
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,670
Bossy president?

190
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,110
Say, instead of going to work,

191
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,150
you just had to come here to get tortured.

192
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,990
That's because...

193
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,710
Because of what?

194
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,950
Listen, Jin Xiao Rui.

195
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,590
If there's even a morsel of bread in this sampling box by the end of the day,

196
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,270
don't even come in anymore, got it?

197
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,190
Okay.

198
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,350
Can I go in now?

199
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,390
No.

200
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,270
There's still this.

201
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,510
You...

202
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,070
You're not letting me in.

203
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,310
Listen, if you miss out on me now...

204
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,300
What?

205
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,750
I'll wait for you next time.

206
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,550
Jin Xiao Rui.

207
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,550
Are you planning to get yourself buried in the graveyard today?

208
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,910
Yuan Yuan, are you threatening me?

209
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,270
If you threaten me,

210
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,550
I'll continue doing this.

211
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,150
Listen.

212
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,750
I may be tolerant, but the baguette I'm holding isn't.

213
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,110
Speak another word,

214
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,110
and I'll...

215
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,750
Wait!

216
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,910
Yuan Yuan, did you just come out from the oven?

217
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,990
What?

218
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,510
You're hot.

219
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,950
Jin Xiao Rui!

220
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,300
Chu Xia!

221
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,070
Stand right there!

222
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,270
Don't hit my hair.

223
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,110
I'm working this afternoon.

224
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,510
Where did you learn such cheesy lines?

225
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,550
A little crush.

226
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,630
Stand right there.

227
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,630
Stand right there.

228
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,230
Were you wrong?

229
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,710
Are you still going to throw more cheesy lines?

230
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,390
I need to go out a while.

231
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,670
Where are you going?

232
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,790
I'm going to look for Wei Xuan He.

233
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,830
He said we used to be lovers.

234
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,100
I think he should know the recipe.

235
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,670
He's a bad...

236
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,470
Xiao Dong.

237
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,950
Chu Xia is going to look for her ex-boyfriend.

238
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,110
Watch out.

239
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,910
What are you up to?

240
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,740
Nothing.

241
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,710
Are you still going to throw more cheesy lines?

242
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,910
Miss Lei, please wait here.

[Business Talent: The Guide to Earn Big in the Entertainment Industry]

244
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,710
Have you been well?

245
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,830
I didn't know you're so successful.

246
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,750
Your company's advertisements are everywhere outside.

247
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,550
Did you come here to praise me?

248
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:03,870
Of course not.

249
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,590
Do you remember that I made a cake called Summer's Kiss?

250
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,500
Of course I do.

251
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,350
So, you're here today to ask me about Summer's Kiss?

252
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,670
Yeah.

253
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,870
I can't really remember how to make it.

254
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,870
So, I wanted to ask if I've ever told you how to make it.

255
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,190
Of course.

256
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,150
Then, tell me.

257
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,630
Do you really want to know

258
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,630
how Summer's Kiss was made?

259
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,110
Of course.

260
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,110
I want to relaunch Summer's Kiss

261
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,190
and make Summer Time a success.

262
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,550
Sure, I can tell you.

263
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,070
But, you have to do three things for me.

264
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,630
Then, if I can do them, it's a deal.

265
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,110
If I can't, then forget about it.

266
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,190
Okay.

267
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,420
The third thing is...

268
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,500
If you manage to make Summer's Kiss,

269
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,870
I'd like to have one.

270
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,390
No problem.

271
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,070
And the other two?

272
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,750
The second thing...

273
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,420
Go out for lunch with me.

[Watch out.]

279
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,870
Xiao Dong, haven't you had lunch?

280
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,750
I'm not hungry.

281
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,230
You're giving her something too?

282
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,790
Xiao Dong, excuse me.

283
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,230
What are you doing here too?

284
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,750
I'm just delivering some snacks for Chu Xia.

285
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,310
She likes comic books.

286
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,950
You think you can write one...

287
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,390
What's wrong?

288
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,830
Chu Xia...

289
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,470
She's not...

290
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,380
Coming to work today?

291
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,830
She's not an employee here.

292
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,670
Why should she come?

293
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,710
Something's off.

294
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,340
Something's bad.

295
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,070
Xiao Dong is...

296
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,790
Brother Sui is here.

297
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,350
Chu Xia must be upset.

298
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,310
Maybe she's ill.

299
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,870
Brother Sui.

300
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,470
Why don't I ask him?

301
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,110
Xiao Dong, is Chu Xia ill?

302
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,550
Did you two break up?

303
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,430
Did you make her upset?

304
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,390
If they broke up, I...

305
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,070
Do you still remember this?

306
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,270
You gave me this pen called Little Sun.

307
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,870
Do you remember anything about this restaurant?

308
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,270
I really don't remember anything.

309
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,950
Did we come here often?

310
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,430
We never came here before.

311
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,829
Then, why did you ask me out here?

312
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,030
This is a place you had always wanted to visit,

313
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,510
yet you never got to come.

314
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,710
Brother Sui, the project team's meeting is starting soon.

315
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,790
Mr. Sui, take a look.

316
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,940
Let me have a cup of coffee first, okay?

317
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,230
Sure.

318
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,430
We're running out of time, right?

319
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,190
Why didn't you remind me?

320
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,980
You made them wait for us...

321
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,070
What are you doing?

322
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,470
Brother Sui, the project team's having a meeting.

323
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,950
Did you forget to tag me along?

324
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,870
What are you gawking at? Go.

325
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,230
My dear Dong Dong.

326
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,270
Here, sit down.

327
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,710
Here, have a cup of coffee.

328
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,300
I can't decide everything by myself in the team.

329
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,390
I can't decide.

330
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,310
Whoever has the ability gets to join.

331
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,670
Since you're a capable person,

332
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,790
you will get your chance one day, right?

333
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,470
Here's some sugar.

334
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,430
Super sweet latte.

335
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,910
Enjoy.

336
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,670
Stand up!

337
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,310
You youngsters.

338
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,870
It's good to be naive, but not too naive.

339
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,470
It's always good for you to go through hardships.

340
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,230
Drink the coffee. Don't get sleepy later.

341
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,550
Turing.

342
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,390
Activate the Candy App.

343
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,110
Execute the second plan.

344
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,110
Attack the system's weakness.

345
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,110
Back then, this restaurant was a famous go-to spot among couples.

346
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,190
Many couples came here to celebrate their anniversaries.

347
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,790
Back when we're studying,

348
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,870
you had always wanted to go on a date with me here.

349
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,150
But, I was poor.

350
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,940
I didn't rely on my family.

351
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,070
I worked hard alone to start my own business.

352
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,150
You would also give me your hard-earned money from part-time jobs.

353
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,950
Back then, what we did often

354
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,870
was standing in front of this restaurant

355
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,950
and flip through the pages of their menu.

356
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,750
You'd keep telling me

357
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,350
which dish is the chef's signature dish

358
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,150
and which dessert is a must-try.

359
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,470
And so, we analyzed each dish one by one.

360
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,750
There were so many to remember.

361
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,310
That's why I brought you here

362
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,670
to make up for the regret we had back in our university days.

363
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,510
I also wanted to give myself a chance.

364
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,710
I wanted to tell you this.

365
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,350
Chu Xia.

366
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,110
If there's anything you need,

367
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,710
I can satisfy you.

368
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,750
As long as you want it,

369
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,630
I can give you.

370
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,230
Thank you for telling me about such precious moments in the past.

371
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,790
But, I really don't remember even an inkling of what you said.

372
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,510
As I look at these exquisite dishes,

373
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,060
I can't understand

374
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,310
why I would be so obsessed with this restaurant in the past.

375
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,100
Was it because I wanted to try the food here,

376
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,180
or was it because I wanted to experience the atmosphere here?

377
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,630
But, there's a voice in my heart telling me

378
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,350
that I want to be with the person I like

379
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,670
and experience the small, meaningful moments in life together.

380
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,260
I want to spend more time with him.

381
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,860
I see.

382
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,350
I didn't know about this back when we were studying.

383
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,910
But, Chu Xia.

384
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,990
I don't mind you losing your memory.

385
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,910
I just want you to come back.

386
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,110
As long as we're together,

387
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,710
for the rest of our life,

388
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,110
we can create a better future with better memories.

389
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,870
Don't you think it's nice to have a new life?

390
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,070
Why do I feel that it's not me who's affected by the past, but you?

391
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,790
I may want to find my lost memories,

392
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,990
but that doesn't mean I want to live like how I did in the past.

393
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,110
I think I should stand on the shoulders of the past

394
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,430
and go to a future that belongs to me.

395
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,310
Since time itself played a joke on us,

396
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,190
we should take this opportunity to start anew

397
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,750
instead of living in emotions and memories of the past.

398
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,820
We should have a new goal, a new direction, a new wish.

399
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,670
For instance, my wish now is to know how to make Summer's Kiss.

400
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,350
The way you're so eager to know how to make Summer's Kiss

401
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,270
is exactly like how you were in the past.

402
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,390
Eat up.

403
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,790
I'm so sorry!

404
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,710
-It's okay. -Why are you so careless?

405
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,310
I'm so sorry.

406
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,390
-It's okay. -I'm sorry.

407
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,350
What happened? Are you okay?

408
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,150
I'm fine.

409
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,510
-Apologize. -I'm so sorry.

410
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,270
I'm sorry, ma'am.

411
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,060
Mr. Wei, I'm so sorry.

412
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,070
We startled you and your girlfriend.

413
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,790
How about this? This meal is on the house.

414
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,350
No, don't.

415
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,070
First, I'm not his girlfriend.

416
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,350
Also, you don't have to offer us a free meal.

417
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,430
Are you really okay?

418
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,390
I'm really fine.

419
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,340
Okay, everything's fine.

420
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,310
Okay.

421
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,790
I'm really fine.

422
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,980
Xiao Dong.

423
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,310
Ignore that jerk, Zhou Sui.

424
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,070
He's up to his old shenanigans.

425
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,700
He keeps ragging on newbies like us.

426
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,710
Do you know why our department does the most jobs

427
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,100
yet gets the least bonus?

428
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,430
That's because Zhou Sui took all our credit.

429
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,510
We can't help it.

430
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,310
Brother Sui is the most senior around here.

431
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,950
Still, we have Chu Xia.

432
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,300
Xiao Dong, is she coming tomorrow?

433
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,600
[You have a new message]

[Credit card payment at 13:27 to Peninsula Restaurant, 8678 yuan]

436
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,990
Xiao Dong, someone stole your credit card info.

437
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,710
Want to call the police?

438
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,830
This place, Peninsula Restaurant, is a famous dating spot.

439
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,670
I seem to remember that Chu Xia has access to Xiao Dong's card.

440
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,230
I know.

441
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,710
Chu Xia is using Xiao Dong's card

442
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,860
on a date with another guy!

443
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,350
Xiao Dong, we're all men.

444
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,670
We've been through this.

445
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,190
Yeah.

446
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,190
We're all men, right?

447
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,700
We all go through this.

448
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,110
Don't worry, we're with you.

449
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,070
It's no big deal.

450
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,630
See, Liang and Da Bao has been through this.

451
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,470
Xiao Dong.

452
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,500
We, the Lone Wolves Alliance, are always behind you!

453
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,990
We're behind you!

454
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,100
Love is sweet, until she cheats.

455
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,190
Let's go.

456
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,140
You're still the same as ever.

457
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,310
You're a heroine.

458
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,630
A heroine who fights to foot the bill.

459
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,350
Since I'm asking you for a favour, of course I should foot the bill.

460
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,670
Just tell me your last condition.

461
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,510
If I complete all your requests,

462
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,900
you'll tell me how to make Summer's Kiss, right?

463
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,830
About that last request, no rush.

464
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,550
But, about the recipe for Summer's Kiss...

465
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,630
I'm not telling you.

466
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,670
Why won't you tell me?

467
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,510
That's the answer for the recipe.

468
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,070
Back then, when I casually asked you about it,

469
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,390
that's how you replied.

470
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,630
You even gave me a weird remark.

471
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,430
You said,

472
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,790
"Love is a ray of sunshine that shines on you."

473
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,030
Why would someone say something so brainless?

474
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,780
Anyway, thank you.

475
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,630
I'm off, then.

476
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,590
Are you really okay?

477
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,750
Do you need to go to the hospital?

478
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,470
It was a tiny bump. Nothing can happen.

479
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,270
It's better to be careful when it comes to your head.

480
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,710
I'll bring you to the hospital. Let's go.

481
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,430
Do I have to?

482
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,350
Doctor, how's her condition?

483
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,670
I'm her family.

484
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,670
Just tell me if there are any problems.

485
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,990
Her condition is unusual.

486
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,380
Memory loss is usually caused by brain trauma.

487
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,150
But, the results of her brain's CT scan are normal.

488
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,190
If we exclude pathological changes in the organs,

489
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,070
it's more likely that her memory loss is psychogenic.

490
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,070
Has she experienced any serious emotional trauma?

491
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,670
Probably no.

492
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,630
Then, can she still regain her memories?

493
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,750
Her condition is considered to be global amnesia.

494
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,870
There's a high likelihood that her memory loss will be permanent.

495
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,550
That means

496
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,270
it's very likely that she won't recall her past anymore?

497
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,150
It's possible.

498
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,870
I'll give you a ride back.

499
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,750
I'll just rent a bike over there.

500
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,980
You learned how to cycle?

501
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,790
Yeah.

502
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,630
No, it's okay. I'll drive you back.

503
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,590
You're injured.

504
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,510
You call that injured? My god.

505
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,190
They did nothing other than a full body checkup.

506
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,350
I'm worried about your health.

507
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,150
My health?

508
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,870
I'm perfectly healthy.

509
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,910
Of course, it'd be better if I can remember Summer's Kiss.

510
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,630
I'm off, bye.

511
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,270
Okay.

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,390

513
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,230
President Wei, it's me.

514
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,910
Are you still considering?

515
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,550
Time waits for no one.

516
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,470
Listen, this is an amazing project.

517
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,630
You'd regret if you miss out.

518
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,550
Stop hesitating.

519
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,030
President Zhao.

520
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,710
I've pondered about it.

521
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,990
Let's stop working together.

522
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,510
What?

523
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,070
The sun has risen.

524
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,750
I don't want to go back to the darkness.

525
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,190

528
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,710
Of course.

529
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,550
Other than your fanboy buying all that bread just now,

530
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,390
we didn't sell any bread today.

531
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,870
It may be a bad start,

532
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,510
but traditionally, bakeries that offer evening discounts can't discard their bread.

533
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,830
Those traditional bakeries have long gone out of business.

534
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,630
There are two kinds of glorious moments for bread.

535
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,350
First, when it's fresh out of the oven.

536
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,950
Second, it's now.

537
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,990
How did you come up with so many philosophies after a meal with Wei Xuan He?

538
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,830
What philosophies?

539
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,230
I'm trying to feel its meaning.

540
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,870
Wait.

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,150
Xu Xiao Dong is here to pick you up.

542
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,150
Why does it seem to me that he's glum?

543
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,510
Glum is an understatement.

544
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,430
He's not glum. He's angry.

545
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,310
Why is he angry?

546
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,790
I used his card.

547
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,190

549
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,590
He's here.

550
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,630
I admit that I went to an expensive restaurant and used your card.

551
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,060
But, their food was really delicious.

552
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,270
It was worth the money.

553
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,310
So, while you were dating with your ex-boyfriend there,

554
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,830
did you recall anything?

555
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,230
Sorry, excuse me.

556
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,630
Is today's bread actually getting sour?

557
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,350
How did you know?

558
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,830
No, that's not important.

559
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,910
Anyway, I think that meal was worth it.

560
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,020
After all, I found out that Wei Xuan He doesn't know how Summer's Kiss was made.

561
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,910
Nice. At least you got something.

562
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,510
We're selling at half price. Want to buy some?

563
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,750
You used up all my money in the card.

564
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,150
I'll skip the bread, then.

565
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,430
So, I wanted to ask you out.

566
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,390
Professor Chen is inviting us to his lab for a checkup.

567
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,350
Do you have time?

568
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,780
Of course I have, but...

569
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,670
Didn't you say that you're joining an important project team?

570
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,830
You have time?

571
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,910
I have now.

[Scientific Research Laboratory]

574
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,630
The data values are normal.

575
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,870
Do you feel unwell?

576
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,310
I feel okay.

577
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,110
She's spent a fortune to go wine and dine.

578
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,870
Of course she's fine.

579
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,070
Protect your wristband.

580
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,390
Don't go to unfamiliar areas.

581
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,590
Yes.

582
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,670
Don't go to unfamiliar areas.

583
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,510
Especially with a stranger.

584
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,030
You're still upset over me dining out with Wei Xuan He?

585
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,470
Me, upset?

586
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,940
Yeah.

587
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,950
Lei Chu Xia, listen.

588
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,430
Time can change someone.

589
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,430
Memories from a long time ago may not be real.

590
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,270
Right?

591
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,070
Right.

592
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,070
Professor!

593
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,110
Professor!

594
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,470
-Professor! -What is it?

595
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,710
Did you shut the windows?

596
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,430
Yes.

597
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,070
And the doors?

598
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,910
We're guarding them.

599
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,550
What about the vents...

600
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,030
Professor, don't worry.

601
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,550
There's no way your wife can enter.

602
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,430
What do you mean, my wife?

603
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,550
Me, of course.

604
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,510
Chen Mo, don't forget.

605
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,710
No door in this world can hold me back.

606
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,870
Especially the door to your heart.

607
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,830
Bye.

608
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,750
Xiao Dong, Chu Xia.

609
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,230
Why are you guys dating here?

610
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,830
It's not a date.

611
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,710
I know.

612
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,150
Still, for you to let them enter your lab,

613
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,750
you're giving me face after all.

614
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,550
How absurd. Ridiculous.

615
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,070
Is it ridiculous?

616
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,550
If it is ridiculous,

617
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,870
why did you pick me up from work?

618
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,150
Who picked you up?

619
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,510
Who'd knew that I'd bump into you at the supermarket that day?

620
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,350
A supermarket trip takes just about five minutes.

621
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,030
There are 24 hours in a day.

622
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,830
So, the probability of us meeting by chance is 3 out of 1000.

623
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,990
Do you believe in such a coincidence?

624
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,590
Just because the odds are low doesn't mean it wouldn't happen.

625
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,390
It still happened despite the low odds.

626
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,190
Are you hinting that we share a destiny?

627
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,190
The odds of a satellite hitting Earth are low too.

628
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,350
If that happens, would you call it destiny or disaster?

629
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,990
If it's a disaster,

630
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,110
then why did you buy me medicine that day?

631
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,670
Who bought you medicine?

632
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,870
You snatched my phone and bought it yourself.

633
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,630
How can I snatch a phone from a strong man like you?

634
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,630
Even if I could, how would I know your WeChat password?

635
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,390
Even if I knew the password, how would I know your payment code?

636
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,430
Face it, you bought me the medicine.

637
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,470
The way you keep going on and on is annoying!

638
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,060
I bought you the medicine so that I could clear my head!

639
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,630
I know you love it when it's clear.

640
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,550
That's why I came here without even applying makeup.

641
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,230
That's not what I mean by "clear".

642
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,990
Besides, your face looks so smooth today.

643
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,830
How are you not applying any makeup? This isn't scientific.

644
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,060
415 is a place that is based on science.

645
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,030
You're not scientific.

646
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,310
You can even tell if I'm wearing makeup or not.

647
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,830
How annoying!

648
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,670
You're a role model, Aunt Wei Wei.

649
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,060
Just you wait.

650
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,190
Chen Mo.

651
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,340
Chen Mo.

652
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,110
Wait!

653
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,430
Stand behind the yellow line.

654
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,790
Is this some kind of checkpoint?

655
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,190
Besides, where's the yellow line?

656
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,310
Miss Shen Wei Wei.

657
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,870
I'm warning you.

658
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,230
You are seriously affecting my work.

659
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,310
Chen Mo, speak the truth.

660
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,390
Are you scared of me?

661
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,910
What a joke.

662
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,430
415 is my lab. Why would I be scared of you?

663
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,510
If you're not scared of me, then why do you keep...

664
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,030
Burping?

665
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,710
My stomach is bloated from eating too many nuts this morning.

666
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,700
You're already tempted.

667
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,390
Still trying to play hard to get.

668
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,790
Don't you feel yourself burning from being so close to me?

669
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,950
Keep your distance, will you?

670
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,950
Are you tired?

671
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,070
You've gone round and round so many times in my heart.

672
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,070
Okay, I'll buy your insurance.

673
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,550
I'll buy, okay?

674
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,070
Can you leave now?

675
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,430
What in the world do you want?

676
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,110
When you're in love, you act faster than your heart.

677
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,030
[When you're in love, you act faster than your heart.]

678
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,230
[That's love, right?]

679
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,989
Do you feel anything like a hint of happiness?

680
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,989
Or the taste of a little sunshine?

681
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,350
What about the taste of falling in love?

682
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,219
I've tried all five flavours here.

683
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,510
I couldn't taste anything like happiness, sunshine

684
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,830
or falling in love.

685
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,150
I only feel like something's stuck in my throat now.

686
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,750
That's strange.

687
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,030
You're giving up?

688
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,190
The phrase "give up" doesn't exist in my life.

689
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,830
Summer's Kiss, oh Summer's Kiss.

690
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,750
What should we do with you?

691
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,910
Summer's Kiss.

692
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,030
Why don't you kiss me?

693
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,630
Seriously, a kiss?

694
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,150
Think about it. What's it called?

695
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,220
It's called Summer's...

696
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,790
Kiss.

697
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,380
This isn't a good idea.

698
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,990
I...

699
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,310
Just try it, then.

700
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,590
Nana.

701
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,990
I want to know how a summer's kiss is like too.

702
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,230
Is this it, Summer's Kiss?

703
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,550
It just looks like a fancy cake.

704
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,710
Is it really that delicious?

705
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,590
Chu Xia.

706
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,070
You did it.

707
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,750
You're awesome!

708
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,150
This tastes exactly the same as the cake ten years ago.

709
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,630
How did you recall it?

710
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,710
Yeah, didn't you lose your memory?

711
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,580
You could even remember the recipe for Summer's Kiss.

712
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,340
Then, if you use the same method,

713
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,430
do you think you can remember the other recipes you had?

714
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,110
No.

715
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,150
Xu Xiao Dong.

716
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,310
Lei Chu Xia.

717
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,270
What do you have to do with how she remembered the cake?

718
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,670
What does he have to do with how you remembered the cake?

719
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,990
You'd still babble even if I stuff your mouth.

720
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,230
They...

721
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,030
Xiao Dong.

722
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,380
Didn't I taste this at your house before?

723
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,140
My house?

724
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,230
Xiao Dong.

725
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,230
Today is your birthday.

726
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,750
Let's enjoy some cake with your mother.

727
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,910
My birthday was last month.

728
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,470
Look at me, so forgetful.

729
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,630
I'm so busy with work until I got all muddled up.

730
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,430
Then, why don't you try this...

00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,390
Is this even a celebration when my birthday's over?

732
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,910
You can have it.

733
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,550
What is it?

734
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,630
Xiao Dong, do you remember the app we worked on together?

735
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,190
No, I mean the app you tweaked.

736
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,670
It's been hacked.

737
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,590
There's a huge loophole inside now.

738
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,990
If we don't fix it right away,

739
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,300
the users we accumulated so far would all go to waste.

740
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,110
I've thought long and hard.

741
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,190
Only the developer can solve this.

742
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,630
Only you can do this.

743
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,230
Brother Sui, you're flattering me.

744
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,630
I'm just a newbie who needs more training.

745
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,270
What kind of act are you pulling here?

746
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,790
Someone was there that day.

747
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,390
Don't you know how prideful I am?

748
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,350
I can't do anything now.

749
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,030
You can't just let us drown.

750
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,550
Fine.

751
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,710
I'll let you in the core project team.

If I assume your identity, aren't you afraid that the company might look into it?

754
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,070
Just work in my office for the next few days.

755
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,910
Use my ID, use my computer,

756
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,710
use my identity to join meetings.

757
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,670
Both of us keep quiet, and no one will notice.

758
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,030
Come on, you're just as handsome as I am.

759
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,670
Can you do it?

760
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,260
Okay.

761
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,390
It's a deal, then.

762
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,710
So, I'm going to start working now.

763
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,670
Sure. Go to work.

764
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,830
It's settled, then.

765
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,830
No problem.
