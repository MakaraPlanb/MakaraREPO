I'm so tired.

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,770
I should be the one saying that.

7
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,130
Can you ask

11
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,570
I'll do it even if you didn't ask.

12
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,770
Such a hassle.

13
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,650

Stay here. Don't say a word.

34
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,210
for you to open the door?

35
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,650
Are you hiding something in there

36
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,810
that you don't want anyone to know about?

You said on the day of the Super Moon

42
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,770
Yes.

43
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,130
Not only that,

44
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,250
she can't leave you

45
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,650

46
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,730
Yes.

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,090
are you sick?

51
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,090
I'm very much conscious.

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,010
But you're acting weird.

00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,850
That smells so good.

56
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,730
Where can I find food?

57
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,810
But anyway,

58
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,610
I've met a lot of

59
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,970
pretty girls under the moonlight.

60
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,769
The ones that

61
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,250
finish their money every month.

62
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,450
By the way,

63
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,290
Xiao Dong,

64
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,690
could it be the Turing

65
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,210
that you developed has gone rogue

66
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,970
and has affected your brain waves,

67
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,050
so you believe that
illusions are the truth?

68
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,850
AIs are

69
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,170

70
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,370

71
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,010

73
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,610
give Qin Yue a call.

74
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,490
Why?

75
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,050
I think it must be because

76
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,610
you're too bored being a programmer

77
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,730
and you need your goddess

78
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,130

79
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,490
Jin Xiao Rui,

80
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,570
don't use your dirty way of thinking

81
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,170
to label the relationship of others.

82
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,930
Okay, you're right.

83
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,570

85
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,490

86
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,130
Ask her out.

87
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:03,810

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,090
Professor Chen...

197
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,210
Professor...

198
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,850
Can you please calm down?

199
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,810
Your yelling

200
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,650
reminds me of

201
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,690
a gorilla during mating season.

202
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,050
Peace and silence.

203
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,770
Professor, it's not the
problem of the machine.

204
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,450
After analysing the data,

205
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,370
this really is related to the Super Moon.

206
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,330
The Super Moon that only
appears once every decade

207
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,330
will appear tonight.

208
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,610
The moon

209
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,330
just flashed.

210
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,290
Turing,

211
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,970
compile all news

212
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,730
from around the world

213
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,890
about the Super Moon for me.

214
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,250
Run an analysis

215
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,890
and report back to me.

216
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,890
There is an increase in news

217
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,810
about the Super Moon.

218
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,490
At the same time,

219
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,170
more than one physics lab

220
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,330
detected gravitational waves

221
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,570
caused by a black hole.

222
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,290
Gravitational waves?

223
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,450
What did you say?

224
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,730
Gravitational waves?

225
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,690
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

226
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,370
Hurry.

227
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:08,970
Didn't I mention to

228
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,010
inform me first thing

229
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,730
when it comes to gravitational waves?

230
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,730
This Super Moon

231
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,290
is indeed different

232
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,410
from the others.

233
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,210
A lot of netizens are

234
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,130
debating that

235
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,090
this Super Moon

236
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,010
might have caused some

237
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,370
strange cosmic phenomenon.

238
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,650
The last time the super moon appeared

239
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,570
was ten years ago.

240
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,170
I heard at that time

241
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,170
there were a lot of

242
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,490
inexplicable incidents.

243
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,250
Could you be

244
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,650
an alien?

245
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,290
Do you want to witness

246
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,810
the power of an alien?

247
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,690
It's fine.

248
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,730
Professor,

249
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,090
when the Super Moon

250
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,370
was at its peak,

251
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,330
the gravitational wave

252
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,490
sent out some energy

253
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,370
towards Earth.

254
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,250
That's so close.

255
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,370
The data of this gravitational wave

256
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,130
is so close to the one

257
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,290
detected ten years ago.

258
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,410
Is this a coincidence or a pattern?

259
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,290
Could it be that

260
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,530
the Super Moon

261
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,210
brought a huge present

262
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,290
to us?

263
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,010
Xiao Dong,

264
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,370
unknown organism.

265
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,250
Could be a cosmic neighbour.

266
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,770
The cousin seems to
have run out of energy.

267
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,650
So her classification is

268
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,170
human.

269
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,410
Hello, Winter.

270
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,530
I don't remember my name

271
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:44,850
and I don't know

272
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,610
why I appeared here.

273
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,370
But this is

274
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,690
how it feels like

275
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,570
to be alone in a foreign place.

276
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,410
You must know how that feels,

277
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,370
right?

278
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,010
But I don't know if I can

279
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,890
find a life

280
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,290
that truly belongs to me

281
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,690
like you did.

282
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,090
Comment from a different you in the world.

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,730
I'm not sleeping.

288
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,930
I...

289
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,450
I was wondering if

290
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,490
you'd take a walk around the city

291
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,850
with me if you're free

292
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,770
tomorrow night?

293
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,530
If you lived

294
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,170
here before, then...

295
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,850
I might bump into someone I know.

296
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,730
Yes.

297
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,210
Let's go then.

298
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,850
It's late.

299
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,170
You've had your rest,

300
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,890
but I still need to sleep.

301
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,210
I didn't sleep.

302
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,570
Two options,

303
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,810
sleep on the sofa or the bed?

304
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,770
Why are you thinking of taking the sofa?

305
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,810
You're making me shy.

306
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,050
You'll sleep on the sofa
and I'll sleep on the bed.

307
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,930
No...

308
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,050
No. Good night.

309
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,530
Isn't it comfortable?

310
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:34,650
No.

311
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,410
Aren't you a gentleman?

312
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,450
Gentlemen need to rest too.

313
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,050
Good night and goodbye.

314
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,330
Perfect.

315
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,570
Xuan He.

316
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,210
Why are you here?

317
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,570
Where's Xuan He?

318
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,330
Something came up so
President Wei won't be coming.

319
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,730
This is a present as compensation.

320
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,850
It's just a bag.

321
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,530
I can afford it.

322
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,930
President Wei gave you a present
despite his busy schedule.

323
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,690
He treats you well.

324
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,250
You're the one who bought it, right?

325
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,730
He treats me well

326
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,090
compared to whom?

327
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,250
Miss Qin,

328
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,410
I think it's better if you

329
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,890
don't compare yourself with his ex.

330
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,730
Although she's been missing for a decade,

331
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,330
she is still irreplaceable

332
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,490
in President Wei's heart.

333
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,570
Instead of focusing on the past,

334
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,810
you should find a way

335
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,250
to be his most important person now.

336
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,450
What are you talking about?

337
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,370

It's finally quiet.

354
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,130
Why are you back in here?

355
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,690
How would I know?

356
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,090
You scared me to death.

357
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,130
Must be due to an increase

358
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,200
in your fatigue

359
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,690
that's causing our

360
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,610
maximum distance to shorten.

361
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,730
The living room is pretty big.

362
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,330
You might run around.

363
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,250
Come,

364
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,170
let me arrange a spot for you.

365
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,890
Trust me.

366
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,770
Let's go.

367
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,930
It's comfortable.

368
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,530
Stand here.

369
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,730
Don't move.

370
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,210
Let me test it out.

371
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,850
Test it.

372
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,770
Still alright.

373
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,850
Still alright.

374
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,570
Still alright.

375
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,170
Still alright.

376
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,770
Good night.

377
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,010
No, could you turn around?

378
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:21,650
I can't sleep

379
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,690
with you staring at me.

380
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,650
I'll keep looking at you.

381
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,810
Would you still sleep?

382
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,610
This is probably

383
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,410
within the longest distance.

384
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,250
You'll take the bed
and I'll take the couch.

385
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,650
Happy?

386
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,370
Thank you.

387
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,690
For what...

388
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,330
Just don't bother me.

389
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,010
I'll need to get a talisman from

390
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,810
my youngest aunt tomorrow.

391
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,450
Xu Xiao Dong.

392
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,890
Xu Xiao Dong.

393
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,890
There's something

394
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,130
-that I need to...
-No.

395
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,610
Xu Xiao Dong.

396
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,490
Xu Xiao Dong.

397
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,410
I said there's nothing.

398
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,810
Stop bugging me.

399
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,090
I'm...

400
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,810
hungry.

401
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,490
I think I'm hungry too.

402
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,810
Happy now?

403
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,490
No.

404
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,730
It's not authentic.

405
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,010
Not authentic?

406
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,050
Let me tell you,

407
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,850
for authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice,

408
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,690
the rice has to be stir-fried

409
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,890
with chicken oil first.

410
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,970
And the water used to boil the rice

411
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:48,930
has to be chicken soup.

412
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,250
And the meat

413
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,450
has to be kept in subzero water

414
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,090
after it's cooked

415
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:53,930
to ensure

416
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,890
that the chicken is soft

417
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,250
and the skin is crispy.

418
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,850
This is just a simplified version.

419
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,810
Very professional.

420
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,690
If you're not happy,

421
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,370
why did you eat that much?

422
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,290
Just to try it out.

423
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,610
We're at a new place.

424
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,050
I have to try it out.

425
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,330
No,

426
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,370
but you said you

427
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,130
don't remember anything, right?

428
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,370
How come you

429
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,170
remember this so clearly?

430
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,570
Are you from Hainan?

431
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,890
What I'm trying to say is...

432
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,730
a lot of people said that

433
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,370
people tend to relate the

434
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,930
memory of taste to home.

435
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,810
Think hard and see

436
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,090
if you remember something.

437
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,770
I said I've tried.

438
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,570
Maybe...

439
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,810
I don't have a family.

440
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,970
If not why didn't anyone

441
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,650
realise or look for me

442
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,690
when I've disappeared for so long?

443
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,250
Or maybe

444
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,450
it's just like you said,

445
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,450
I'm an alien.

446
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,330
So other than

447
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,330
teleportation,

448
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,210
do you have

449
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,570
any other skills?

450
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,530
Make money appear.

451
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,770
Make money appear?

452
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,370
I earn too little.

453
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,170
Can you afford to pay for this meal?

454
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,210
I'll pay.

455
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,890
Alien.

456
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,850
60...

457
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,490
And the tea.

458
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,450
Two RMB

459
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,950
[Alien-60-2]

460
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,930
plus two.

461
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:30,970
62.

462
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,410
So stingy.

463
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,010
Do you want to...

464
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,930
I don't want to eat anymore.

465
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,810
You might not be able to pay.

466
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,930
Okay. Let's go.

467
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,490
You feel sad

468
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,530
and get upset.

469
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,010
You throw tantrums when you're angry.

470
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,650
You binge eat when you're hungry.

471
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,170
No matter how I see it,

472
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,250
you're just a normal,

473
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,170
basic human being.

474
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,530
Can normal humans teleport?

475
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,410
Who am I really?

476
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,890
I want to go home so badly.

477
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,010
I'm a realist.

478
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,650
Even though there's no explanation

479
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,570
for what's going on,

480
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,530
you're really behaving

481
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,610
like a con artist.

482
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,410
What's wrong?

483
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,210
Come.

484
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,090
Why are you out?

485
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,370
Go, go back.

486
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,130
Go back, don't jump.

487
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,370
Are there cat-related memories

488
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,370
in your mind?

489
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,530
Even cats

490
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,810
have a family.

491
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,290
But I'm all alone.

492
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,890
I'll help you find your family,

493
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,890
and help you find yourself.

494
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,450
Really?

495
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,210
Why would I lie?

496
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,970
What's wrong?

497
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,130
Are you crying?

498
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,610
No one's crying.

499
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,530
You probably look good

500
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,170
when you're crying.

501
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,530
That's not what I meant.

502
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,850
I mean you can relax.

503
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,410
You are dumb,

504
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,770
you eat a lot,

505
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,490
and you always mess things up
with your help,

506
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,130
but

507
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,650
when I find your family,

508
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,690
I'll get everything back

509
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,250
with interest.

510
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,130
Hold on.

511
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,450
What are you talking about?

512
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,450
Why are you being sarcastic?

513
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,170
Nothing.

514
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,970
Whoever answers...

515
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,170
It's raining.

516
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,460
We need to get back already.

517
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,210
I'll blame you

518
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:55,930
if I catch a cold. Let's go.

519
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,890
Hurry, let's go.

520
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,770
But...

521
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:58,690
this...

522
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,570
What's wrong?

523
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,650
What are you doing?

524
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,490
Put it down.

525
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,570
Quick.

526
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,850
Hurry.

527
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,770
Okay, we need to go too.

528
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,810
We're leaving, bye!

529
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,930
You go ahead. Quick.

530
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,570
Hurry.

531
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,770
You're going to catch a cold.

532
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,530
You've really forgotten everything?

533
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,210
I've tried really hard to remember,

534
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,770
but I just can't.

535
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,170
My mind is just blank.

536
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,530
Blank mind.

537
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,090
[Missing. We're waiting
for you to come home.]

538
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,210
Then that's probably not

539
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,330
the reason you lost your memories.

540
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,990
[Missing: Lei Chu Xia]

541
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,450
Chu Xia.

542
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,410
Chu Xia.

543
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,330
Xuan He.

544
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,370
Xuan He.

545
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,610
I'm here.

546
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,290
Don't leave me.

547
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,410
Please don't leave me.

548
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,730
Okay.

549
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,810
I won't leave you.

550
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,130
Time to wake up and get my identity back.

551
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,210
It's Saturday, girl.

552
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,610
What time is it?

553
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,610
It's not easy to sleep in

554
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,810
as an adult.

555
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,810
Don't you know that?

556
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,170
Furthermore,

557
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,010
who said you could wear my clothes?

558
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,650
But..

559
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,570
But my clothes are wet

560
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,610
and I have nothing to wear.

561
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,690
I'll write it down.

562
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,410
Look at the time.

563
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,570
Everything should start in the morning.

564
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,730
You need to do everything
as early as possible.

565
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,170
Put my blanket back on.

566
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,050
No.

567
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,170
I'll do it myself.

568
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,810
No, you promised.

569
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,730
You forgot?

570
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,130
I forgot.

571
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,290
Are you getting up?

572
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,250
No.

573
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,250
No?

574
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,770
Wait here.

575
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,050
I'll ask you one last time,

576
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,890
get up?

577
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,730
I told you it's the last time.

578
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,170
Are you getting up

579

There's a traffic restriction today,
so I have to take the bike.

that she lost her memories.
