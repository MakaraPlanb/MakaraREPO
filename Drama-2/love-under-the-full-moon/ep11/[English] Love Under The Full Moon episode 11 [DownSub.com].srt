from the camcorder,

159
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,470
might have stimulated your brain cell

How is it, Cousin?

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,800
Do we look good, Cousin?

382
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,040
I think I'm the most handsome one.

383

Send it to me, I'll edit it.

384

385
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,960
I'll help you two edit it.

386

You're not done with him
last time you went to his company,

389
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,650
so there's a sequel, is that right?

390
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,870
Did you call me here

391
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
because you have something important
to tell me?

392
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,390
Yes.

393
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,100
I do have something important to tell you.

394
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,200
However,

395
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,830
I'd like to speak to you alone.

396
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,720
After all, it is a memory
that belongs to us.

397

Sit here and talk then.

proposed to you back then.

402
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
It's okay.

403
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,680
I asked you here

404

405

This is the wedding book you made

406

407
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,000
I even asked you at the time

You said

411
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,130
it was all your vision
and plans for our future.

412
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
Every stroke in it

413
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,710
is what you wanted to accomplish with me,

414
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,840
step by step.

415
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,360
We had even picked our

416
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,460

417
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,480
Look.

418
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,040
The day we got the rings,

419
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,370
you were so happy.

420
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,130
And you told me something.

421
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,720
You said

422
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,150
you couldn't wait until the wedding.

423
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,230
You wanted to tie me down earlier.

424
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,070
But I never expected that

425
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
you would vanish before

426
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800

427
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,490
Over the past ten years,

428
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
I've been suffering.

429
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,400
I really missed you.

430
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,330
Are you still willing
to put the ring on my finger?

431
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,340
We can still get married.

432
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,690
I can't do this.

433
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,600
Why?

434
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,760
My feelings for you haven't changed at all

435
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,080
over the past ten years.

436
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,120
It's fine that you
don't remember anything now.

437
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,900
We can take our time.

438
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,320
Once we get married,

439
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,350
you'll be by my side all the time.

440
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,040
You'll remember it eventually, right?

441
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,930
I believe that

442
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,260
a marriage is a mutual commitment

443
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,540
between two people.

444
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,750
Maybe, as you said,

445
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,230
we used to be able to do this,

446
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,770
but apparently not anymore.

447
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,120
Besides, I can't marry you

448
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,100
just because I want to find my memory.

449
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,420
That won't be fair for either of us.

450
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,690
I don't remember the past,

451
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,020
but I'm grateful that you remember it.

452
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,750

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,240
Hello.

561
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,240
Xiao Dong.

562
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,640
[Professor Chen, I need a favour.]

563

[The sooner the better.
Here's the thing...]

564
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,950
Okay, we'll talk again.

565
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,360
Xiao Dong, open the door.

566
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,690
Have you brought the stuff?

567

Keep it down.

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,380
This is a magnetic field stabilization suit.

571
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,180
It will help Chu Xia for a while

572
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,650
before the wrist band stops working.

573
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
This is too big.

574
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,390
How is she going to put it on?

575
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,200
Professor Chen said

576
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,120
he had limited time.

577
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,110
This is the smallest

579
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,960
Alright.

Fine.

The hero has become a prisoner of love.

588
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,820
You've changed, Xiao Dong.

589
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,000
Who knew that when you

590
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,270
fell in love with Lei Chu Xia,

591
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,280
you wouldn't care about me anymore.

592
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,560
You don't care about Jin Xiao Rui anymore.

593
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,320
This can't be made for me, right?

594
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,390
Why are you looking at me?

595
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,760
You're mocking me too, aren't you?

596
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,680
Do you want me to cut you open...

598
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,240
Xu Xiao Dong!

599

Why did you sleep here?

600
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,680
Oh right,

601
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,790
didn't you say

602
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,280
you want to see uncle and auntie?

603
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,790
So I asked Professor Chen

604
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,440
to make you
a magnetic field stabilization suit.

605
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,540
But because it was too big,

606
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,180
I put it inside this.

607
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
Check it out.

608

and it won't affect

610
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,120

611
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,160
It's nice.

612

Thank you.

613
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,320
I'm really touched.

614
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,280
You don't have to thank me.

615
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,520
I need to take a nap.

616
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,880
Wait, how do I put this on?

617
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,920
Figure it out yourself.

618

You got this for me.

619
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000

She kept looking back,

00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,130
Honey,

749
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,400
have I been treating you badly?

750
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,870
I've been a doting husband and doting father

751
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,120
for decades.

752
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,320
That's kind of true.

753
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,640
Eat up.

754
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,520
What else do you want?

755
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,960
Dumpling.

756
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,080
Chu Xia likes to eat dumplings too.

757
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,350
She always finished a large plate every time.

758
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,620
No one could stop her.

759
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,720
I didn't expect that

760
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,400
your friend likes my dumplings too.

761
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,500
You guys have no idea.

762
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,730
When Chu Xia was little,

763
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,190
she also liked sweets.

764
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,200
Really?

765
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,140
I remember when she was little,

766
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,720
when we took her travelling,

767
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,340
every place she visited,

768
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,360
she wanted to try the local desserts.

769
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,630
My daughter

770
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,990
is really talented.

771
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,310
No matter what dessert it is,

772
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,730
as long as she took a bite,

773
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,020
she would know how to make it.

774
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,630
When we got home,

775
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,290
she always made it for us.

776
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,800
I don't know when I will be able to

777
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,960
eat the desserts made by Chu Xia again.

778
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,790
Sorry for this.

779
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,560
Chu Xia is our daughter.

780
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,300
She went missing.

781
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,390
Last time, Chu Xia's mum

782
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,280
thought she saw our daughter.

783
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,630
She got so worked up,

784
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,120
her heart couldn't take it.

785
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,130
Fortunately, we met Xiao Dong.

786
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,110
He took us to the hospital in time.

787
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,950
And she got out of danger.

788
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,900
We've been looking for our daughter
for ten years.

789
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,390
People say

790
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,790
she's probably dead and we would never find her.

791
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,410
But I always think that

792
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,450
Chu Xia is just having too much fun that

793
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,090
she forgot to come home.

794
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,280
We purposely hid a key

795
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,640
at the door.

796
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,420
In case Chu Xia

797
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,010
comes back one day,

798
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,750
and can't enter the house because

799
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,710
she doesn't have a key.

800
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
I bet she would just cry at the door.

801
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,320
How we wish we could

802
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,200
go back to the old days.

803
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,040
When we both came home

804
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,480
from grocery shopping,

805
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,500
Chu Xia would

806
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,890
come running out from her room and say,

807
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,800
"I'm home."

808
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,880
Sorry.

809
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,760
I got carried away.

810
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:43,590
It's okay.

811
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,560
Uncle, auntie, don't mind this.

812
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,710
My friend is using her own way

813
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,330
to console you.

814
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,440
We know.

815
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,680
Xiao Dong.

816
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,990
I really like

817
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,320
your friend.

818
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,900
I don't know the reason,

819
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,160
but I feel like

820
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,140
I know her.

821
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,020
Child,

822
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,010
take off your head piece.

823
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,080
Let's get to know each other properly.

824
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,350
Auntie, you can get to know her
even with the mask on.

825
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,910
Your food tastes so good,

826
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,800
she will come often to see you.

827
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,560
Xiao Dong,

828
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,240
she's been wearing this for so long.

829
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,420
She could suffocate.

830
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,240
Take it off first.

831
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,200
No, uncle.

832
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,100
Don't take it off.

833
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,040
She's role-playing today.

834
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,170
If we take it off,

835
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,440
it would violate her sense of belief.

836
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,840
We'll leave it then.

837
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,680
Leave it.

838
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,000
Let's eat.

839
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,140
-Come on, sit down and eat more.
-Sit down.

840
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,000
Sit down and eat.

841
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,190
Have some more.

842
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,160
What else do you want?

843
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,120
Dumpling.

844
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,780
-Here. -When my daughter comes back,

845
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,040
maybe you two can be good friends.

846
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,030
It will happen, auntie.

847
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,430
You see, Chu Xia looked so cute

848
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,200
when she was little.

849
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,870
Yes.

850
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,030
She and her mum always bullied me

851
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,130
when she was young.

852
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,040
-I'll go. -Someone's here.

853
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,960
Hi, uncle.

854
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,920
Wei Xuan He.

855
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
What are you doing here?

856
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,480
I went to pick you up,

857
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,360
but I didn't see you.

858
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,240
So I came.

859
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,520
Auntie.

860
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,120
Xu Xiao Dong.

861
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,840
I didn't know you knew
Mr and Mrs Lei.

862
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,320
And who is this?

863
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,190
It's none of your business.

864
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,800
Wei Xuan He,

865
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,710
even if you didn't come,

866
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,160
uncle and I were going to see you a too.

867
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
You said on the phone earlier that

868
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,510
you are going to marry Chu Xia.

869
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,400
What was that?

870
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,240
You were the one who wanted
to hold a memorial service.

871
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,110
And now you said you wanted to marry her.

872
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,990
Chu Xia is still missing.

873
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,480
Who are you marrying?

874
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,340
Her.

875
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,470
You're Chu Xia?

876
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

877
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,520
Are you Chu Xia?

878
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,320
Chu Xia, you're back.

879
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,920
Why are you hiding yourself
from uncle and auntie?

880
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,470
Stop making them worried, okay?

881
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,120
Chu Xia.

882
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,400
-Chu Xia. -Chu Xia.

883
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,120
Auntie.

884
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,000
-Chu Xia! -Auntie.

885
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,640
Chu Xia!

886
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,520
Chu Xia!

887
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,240
Chu Xia!

888
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,080
Chu Xia!

889
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,760
Slow down, Chu Xia!

890
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,720
Wait for me!

891
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,880
Chu Xia, slow down!

892
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,160
Chu Xia, stop running!

893
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,120
Chu Xia!

894
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,640
Chu Xia!

895
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,560
Chu Xia!

896
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,440
Chu Xia!

897
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,920
Chu Xia!

898
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,400
-Chu Xia! -Chu Xia, stop...

899
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,600
Chu Xia, stop running.

900
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,680
Chu Xia.

901
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,960
Chu Xia, my child.

902
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,000
Chu Xia.

903
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,880
I'm not!

904
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,840
Chu Xia, how could we possibly be mistaken?

905
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,130
Wei Xuan He,

906
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,840
Chu Xia has turned you down.

907
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,340
What tricks are you trying to pull here?

908
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,730
Listen.

909
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
In this world,

910
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,510
other than Chu Xia's parents,

911
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,470
I'm the closest person to her.

912
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,290
Also,

913
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,050
you've brought her back,

914
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,630
why didn't you let her show her face?

915
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,660
What secret are you hiding?

916
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,260
It's none of your business.

917
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm warning you.

918
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,920
Stay away from Chu Xia,

919
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,900
or I won't let you off.
