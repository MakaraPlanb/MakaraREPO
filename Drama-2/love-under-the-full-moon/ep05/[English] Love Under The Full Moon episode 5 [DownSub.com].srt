00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,750
Yes, she is with me.

7
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,350
By the way, Prof. Chen,

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,579
she has a name now.

9
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,030
Her name is Lei Chu Xia.

10
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,470
Lei Chu Xia?

11
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,910
This name is quite romantic.

12
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,150
Sure, let me talk to Lei Chu Xia.

13
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,910
I have a good news.

14
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,829
Okay.

15
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,310
Prof. Chen is on the line.

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,790

24
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,590
Now, I have enough Dana

25
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,870

26
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,350

27
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,750
Does that mean...

28
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,630
Does that mean

29
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,550
I may be able to move around freely in the future?

30
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,550
I can also

31
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,510
go back to my parents?

32
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,790
Technically, it can work that way.

33
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,190
However, you will have to wait

Yes, Prof. Chen.

Why?

48
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,350
Actually I

49
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,390
have been obsessed about science since I was young.

50
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,430
Therefore, I hope

51
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,950

There are so many labs out there.

57
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,030
Why do you sponsor only us?

58
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,790
It's like this, Prof. Chen.

59
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,780
There is another reason.

60

64
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,270
I don't play game.

65
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,990
Everyone in the university knows that

66
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,110

67
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,510

69
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,190
help the Winter team out

70
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,589

73
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,630

this is

95
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,270

96

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,910
If we can conduct research on her,

100
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,110
it will be a huge improvement

101
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,230

103
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,630

109
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,510

114

120

I'm sorry.

121
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,870
I don't want to be

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,550
I can't take care of my parents.

196
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,470
However, I really didn't expect that

197
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,270
he would help me out.

198
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,190
It's so touching.

199
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,620
As your dream man,

200
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,910
I think he can be considered

201
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,590
to have passed the threshold.

202
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,030
How could you say that?

203
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,630
He is perfect!

204
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,030
I didn't expect that

205
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,750
I would meet

206
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,380
my first friend

207
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,700
on the internet.

208
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,990
He is also a super cool guy.

209
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,980
Isn't me

210
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,990
your first friend?

211
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,590
You are the first bad guy I met.

212
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,750
Of course,

213
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,110
you are nice to me now.

214
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,270
Have my parents

215
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,230
gone to the nursing home?

216
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,270
Let's check on them.

217
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,070
I mean let's go my home.

218
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,470
Let's go.

219
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,510
Why are you in a rush?

220
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,910
What does that mean?

221
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,950
It has been a long time

222
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,430
and you haven't found her?

223
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,870
Yes, Director Wei.

224
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,670
Due to the venue,

225
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,310
none of the security cameras

226
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,350
had taken any photo.

227
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,710
Furthermore,

228
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,830
Mr and Mrs Lei are not home lately.

229
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,430
No, keep looking.

230
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,670
Make sure you find her.

231
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,310
Okay, Director Wei.

232
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,030
Xuan He.

233
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,510
Don't panic.

234
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,630
Take a seat.

235
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,990
You are exhausted.

236
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,190
Perhaps you saw it wrongly.

237
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,950
She's been missing in action for ten years.

238
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,750
She wouldn't have had appeared out of no where.

239
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,110
No way I saw it wrongly.

240
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,300
She was there.

241
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,550
All right, stop thinking too much.

242
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,950
Today, I baked some biscuits.

243
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,590
Try it.

244
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,350
It's fresh from the oven.

245
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,110
[Chu Xia.]

246
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,830
No.

247
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,740
I must find her.

248
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,350
You should go back first.

249
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,590
I have something else to do.

250
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,390
Xuan He.

251
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,030
As expected, once Lei Chu Xia appears,

252
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,110
you start to neglect me.

253
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,190
Director Zhao.

254
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,670
I'm sorry, Director Wei.

255
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,710
Director Zhao insists to see you.

256
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,950
Director Wei,

257
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,100
why are you troubled?

258
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,070
Nothing.

259
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,070
Are you thinking about

260
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,470
the intelligent system

261
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,110
that will be launched soon,

262
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,260
the Family First app?

263
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,470
I heard about it.

264
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,790
For this app,

265
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,670
there are some technical issues

266
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,470
which haven't resolved.

267
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,510
That's why it took a long time to launch.

268
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,990
As one of the investors

269
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,870
of this project,

270
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,580
I'm quite worried.

271
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,750
Director, don't worry.

272
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,870
I'm the founder of Cyber Tech.

273
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,310
I care about

274
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,230
the Family First app more than anyone else.

275
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,870
Our R&D team

276
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,900
is full of talented people.

277
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,910
We will surely have a breakthrough

278
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,190
on the technical issues.

279
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm not as optimistic as you, Director Wei.

280
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,790
Speed is the soul of the internet.

281
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,150
This is the information of the companies

282
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,070
which are also working on an app similar to Family First.

283
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,470
They are a bunch of talented people

284
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,630
without support and background.

285
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
[Company information]

286
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,510
Director Wei, I have a proposal.

287
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,630
Why don't we change our mindset?

288
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,190
Since your team is unable to solve the issues,

289
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,630
why don't we

290
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,510
draw on the experience

291
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,270
of others?

292
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,350
This is plagiarism.

293
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,710
Director Wei.

294
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,350
Didn't we do the same

295
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,710
ten years ago?

296
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,510
Have you forgotten

297
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,670
Xu Wei Yi?

298
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,870
Sorry,

299
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,820
I tainted your blazer.

300
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,590
All right, I'll leave you alone.

301
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,740
Director Wei.

302
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,820
A wise man submits to fate.

303
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,020
Goodbye.

304
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,550
By the way, do you have the key?

305
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,070
If you don't have the key, how do we go inside?

306
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,590
What's wrong?

307
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,190
As expected, it's still here.

308
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,790
You remember everything now?

309
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,550
It's gut feeling.

310
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,990
Your parents are so careless.

311
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,870
How could they leave the key there?

312
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,510
Is that you when you were young?

313
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,190
You were already a glutton since young.

314
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,350
Look at you.

315
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,020
Is it funny?

316
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,950
No.

317
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,510
Think carefully

318
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,670
and see if you can recall anything.

319
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,110
Many years have passed

320
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,390
yet everything is well maintained.

321
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,350
[My father.]

322
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,030
[My father tells me that]

323
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,510
[when I was born...]

324
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,430
This must be an essay I wrote when I was in elementary school.

325
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,710
I didn't expect that my parents would keep my essay

326
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,590
written when I was in elementary school.

327
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,350
The essay is well kept

328
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,070
but I can't talk to them.

329
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,030
Where is your dad?

330
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,460
My dad?

331
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,350
My dad has passed away

332
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,980
but to me,

333
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,150
he was a hero.

334
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,350
He was a genius.

335
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,790
What is your dad's name?

336
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,070
Xu Wei Yi.

337
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,990
I don't even know my dad's name.

338
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,030
Your dad is Lei Da Ming.

339
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,430
Your mom is Wu Ping.

340
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,670
I got to know their name

341
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,390
at the hospital.

342
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,270
Lei Da Ming?

343
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,820
What is it?

344
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,790
Do you remember anything?

345
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,070
How about this?

346
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,070
You should stay in this room

347
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,300
and think about it.

348
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,150
I'll bring you

349
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,950
to another place.

350
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,430
Perhaps it's related to you.

351
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,280
[Summer Time]

352
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,590
Take a close look.

353
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,630
[Summer Time]

354
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,869
That's enough.

355
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,710
Stop talking.

356
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,069
I won't rent this place to you.

357
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,869
I have made up my mind.

358
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,630
Ms. Chen.

359
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,510
How about this?

360
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,430
Take the money.

361
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:14,990
You must

362
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,069
rent the shop to me.

363
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,270
I can't afford to lose the shop.

364
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,550
This place...

365
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,150
When was the last time it was in business?

366
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,430
Can it still be considered as a shop?

367
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,710
It's been vacant for a year.

368
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,750
I can't imagine the loss.

369
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,470
I can understand that

370
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,190
but no matter how much of losses it caused,

371
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,550
I need to hang in there.

372
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,950
I can't lose it.

373
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,110
Listen, girl.

374
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,310
Just give up on it.

375
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,140
I am serious about it.

376
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,710
I won't rent it to you anymore.

377
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,830
Don't you think you are silly?

378
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,510
Who on earth behaves like you?

379
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,270
You go to work all day and all night

380
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,550
just to make money

381
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,830
to sustain a dessert shop

382
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,990
which has not made any profit

383
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,380
in the past ten years.

384
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:44,990
Ms. Chen.

385
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,030
To me, this shop

386
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,950
is really important.

387
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,950
I set up this store

388
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,910
with my best friend.

389
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,390
I must take care of the store

390
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,470
while waiting for her to come back.

391
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,790
Why don't you increase the rent?

392
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,790
You may increase the rent.

393
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,630
No, listen.

394
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,790
Don't you get

395
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,150
what am I trying to say?

396
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,540
Even if you're willing to pay extra,

397
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,750
I can't take it anymore.

398
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,790
That's enough.

399
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,790
I have to go.

400
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,030
Pack up.

401
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,590
I'll be here to take over the place.

402
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,430
Ms Chen.

403
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,390
Ms Chen.

404
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,670
Chu Xia.

405
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,670
Is that you, Chu Xia?

406
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,990
Finally you are back.

407
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,310
It's been so many years.

408
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,510
Where have you been?

409
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,470
Do you know

410
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,390
we were so worried

411
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,390
when we couldn't find you?

412
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,430
Yuan Yuan.

413
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,790
Chu Xia.

414
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,030
Quan Quan?

415
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,350
Don't you remember me?

416
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,550
I'm Yuan Yuan.

417
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,390
Yuan Yuan.

418
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,470
I'm your best friend.

419
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,350
Can't you recognise me?

420
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,940
Do you remember this store?

421
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,280
[Summer Time]

422
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,190
Summer Time.

423
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,270
We set up

424
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,220
the store together.

425
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,510
We aspired

426
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,910
to set up the best dessert shop in the world.

427
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,550
Don't you

428
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,630
remember any of them?

429
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,430
Chu Xia.

430
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,300
What have you experienced

431
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,350
in the past ten years?

432
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,350
Who are you?

433
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,390
I'm not her boyfriend.

434
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,390
Chu Xia, come in and take a look.

435
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,670
This is our shop.

436
00:19:59,230 --> 00:19:59,990
It's spotless.

437
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,270
I come here to clean up the store every month.

438
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:01,950
Just ignore him.

439
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,030
Chu Xia.

440
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:03,990
Tell me.

441
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,350
What is going on?

442
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,310
I don't know

443
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,140
where to start

444
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,710
and I can't explain it clearly.

445
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,750
My memories

446
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,230
started from Xu Xiao Dong.

447
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,950
Not long ago,

448
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,710
I found out

449
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,670
my name is Lei Chu Xia

450
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,430
and I found my parents.

451
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,870
That's all.

452
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,070
How did you

453
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,430
meet him?

454
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,710
I picked her up.

455
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,830
Picked me up?

456
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,030
Am I a stray cat to you?

457
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,590
How could you say that?

458
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,270
You are a lot more troublesome than a stray cat.

459
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,270
It's like this.

460
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,510
Not long ago,

461
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,870
she suddenly barged into my house

462
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,590
out of the blue.

463
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,180
She looked

464
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,430
fragile and helpless.

465
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,230
She knew nothing.

466
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,070
If I left her alone,

467
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,030
she would die from starvation.

468
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,350
Hence, I brought her home.

469
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,710
However, I still have a doubt.

470
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,910
She is Lei Chu Xia.

471
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,270
Are you Yuan Yuan for real?

472
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,070
If I am not Yuan Yuan, who am I?

473
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,190
[Yuan Yuan is Lei Chu Xia's best friend.]

474
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,230
[She is one of the shareholders of Summer Time.]

475
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,750
[She is 32 years old]

476
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,870
[and she is not married.]

477
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,510
[Her weight is...]

478
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,950
No!

479
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,550
Stop, don't move.

480
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,070
Wait a minute.

481
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,630
No!

482
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,070
This is a prehistorical photo.

483
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,670
I have deleted the photo a long time ago.

484
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,630
Where did you get it?

485
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,270
That's enough!

486
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,820
She looks so cute.

487
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,790
Now, she is prettier.

488
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,910
Chu Xia.

489
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,070
You said the same thing before.

490
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,470
Do you know?

491
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,630
Both of us

492
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,390
have never separated since elementary school

493
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,390
all the way to university.

494
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,830
You were by my side when I fell in love,

495
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,030
when I fell out of love,

496
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,550
and when I had my chin surgery

497
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,070
after I fell out of love.

498
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,550
If it weren't for you,

499
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,390
I wouldn't have had

500
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,670
mustered the courage.

501
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,550
No doubt I can't remember

502
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,790
anything that you just said,

503
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,510
but today,

504
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,430
this is the first time I'm here.

505
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,150
This is also the first time I met you.

506
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,470
I have

507
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,950
a sense of familiarity for no reason.

508
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,590
I kind of think that I used to live here.

509
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,870
This is

510
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,710
the first time I met you,

511
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,430
but I have a feeling

512
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,910
we are best friends

513
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,030
for real.

514
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,630
We are best friends.

515
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,070
We are best friends for real.

516
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,830
And this is

517
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,590
Summer Time for real.

518
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,630
Furthermore,

519
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,750
you lived here before

520
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,020
for real.

521
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,550
Even though

522
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,510
we don't meet up for a long time,

523
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,110
our friendship

524
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,030
still remains the same.

525
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,790
Didn't you say that

526
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,550
you can't remember

527
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,470
most of the things?

528
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,230
It's okay, I'm here.

529
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,190
Let me find back your memories.

530
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,550
We share

531
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,230
lots of memories.

532
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,710
Come here.

533
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,310
Is it?

534
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,390
Yes. Come here.

535
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,500
Come here.

536
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,790
This is me.

537
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,750
This is you.

538
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,030
It says,

539
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,390
"Chu Xia and Yuan Yuan"

540
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,510
"are friends forever."

541
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,310
Do you know

542
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,980
why did we name the store Summer Time?

543
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:50,910
Why?

544
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,710
When we set up the store,

545
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,790
you said,

546
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,350
"it's the first day of summer."

547
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,150
"Why don't we name the store"

548
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,990
"Summer Time?"

549
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,990
That's all?

550
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,070
Can't you recall a thing?

551
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,750
Let me show you more.

552
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,500
There are more.

553
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,990
Look at this.

554
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,990
We almost spent

555
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,990
all our moneys

556
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,790
to get it.

557
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,010
[Summer Time]

558
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,550
Chu Xia.

559
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,550
Do you know what is this?

560
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,950
These utensils

561
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,950
were your favourite utensils back then.

562
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,790
What is he doing here?

563
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,230
He was the one who organised the memorial service for me.

564
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,230
He is Wei Xuan He.

565
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,390
[Lei Chu Xia?]

566
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,750
Wei Xuan He.

567
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,910
What are you doing here

568
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,470
at our dessert shop?

569
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,350
Chu Xia?

570
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,350
Watch out.

571
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,830
Why did you

572
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,550
conduct a memorial service for me?

573
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,910
Can't you recognize me?

574
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,030
You held a memorial service

575
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,950
for Chu Xia yesterday.

576
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,550
You have the cheeks to come here today.

577
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,190
You don't remember me at all?

578
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,670
I am your boyfriend.

579
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,140
You haven't met him for ten years.

580
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,510
You are at most her ex-boyfriend.

581
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,230
We met each other yesterday.

582
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,950
Before I had the chance

583
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,710
to talk to you,

584
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,500
you disappeared.

585
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,630
I guessed

586
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,670
you would come to Summer Time.

587
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,590
As expected, you are here.

588
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,230
Chu Xia,

589
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,710
I have been looking for you for ten years.

590
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,830
I have missed you so much.

591
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,710
Are you sure, Director Wei?

592
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,910
Yesterday, when I called you

593
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,310
to stop you from conducting livestream,

594
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,500
why did you turn me down?

595
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,350
It's between me and Chu Xia.

596
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,350
You are Wei Xuan He, right?

597
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,950
Since you claim that

598
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,350
you were my boyfriend ten years ago,

599
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,710
why did I disappear?

600
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,660
What happened before I disappeared?

601
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,590
Ten years ago, we were intimate.

602
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,510
However, at that point in time,

603
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,470
my company was just getting better.

604
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,230
I was too busy.

605
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,110
I didn't take care of you.

606
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,830
Since you ask about

607
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,230
the night ten years ago,

608
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,830
I planned to celebrate with you

609
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,870
after work.

610
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,230
But when I reached home,

611
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,390
I found that you had gone missing.

612
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,110
Is that true?

613
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,470
On that day,

614
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,430
you left Summer Time early.

615
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,710
I was busy at work.

616
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,190
The next day, I was informed that

617
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,070
you had gone missing.

618
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,950
I had no idea

619
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,660
what happened on that day.

620
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,710
That mean

621
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,350
none of you remember the incident.

622
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,150
Since none of you

623
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,110
know the truth,

624
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,710
let's not waste our time here.

625
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,030
Let's go home.

626
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,190
Who are you?

627
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,750
What is your relationship with Chu Xia?

628
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,780
Both of us...

629
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,670
That's none of your business.

630
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,950
Are you coming?

631
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,310
If you are not coming, I'm leaving.

632
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,790
I'm coming.

633
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,550
See you again.

634
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,990
I can help you to recollect your memories.

635
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,710
After all, ten years ago,

636
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,510
I was the one who knew you the best.

637
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,390
If you wants to know more,

638
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,790
you may contact me.

639
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,510
She doesn't want to contact you.

640
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,470
I want to do that.

642
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,870
I want...

643
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,550
No, you don't want it.

644
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,270
No.

645
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,030
What if Wei Xuan He

646
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,150
really can help me to recollect my memories?

647
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,710
Listen.

648
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,740
Not only he held a funeral for you,

649
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,550
he also conducted livestream at the funeral.

650
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,430
No way he is a kind person.

651
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,350
Furthermore, you had a long chat with him.

652
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,070
What was the outcome?

653
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,510
It was not too long of a chat.

654
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,310
That's a long chat.

655
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,470
Chu Xia, are you here to work?

656
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,430

657
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,150
You'd better go and see him now.

658
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,230

the application that you promised to work on?

665
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,670
Is something wrong with it?

666

It's well done!

has increased?

672
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,270
It's increased by ten times.

Yes, he is Director Zhao. His office is over there.

[convince Xu Xiao Dong?]

767
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,310
It's a notice about Xu Xiao Dong being recognised as a permanent staff.

768
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,950
Xu Xiao Dong is really something.

769
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,860
[Notice on Xu Xiao Dong being recognised as a permanent staff]

770
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,360
He is so cool.

771
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,590
This is the first time I saw

772
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,190
someone being recognised as a permanent staff in such a short period.

773
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,950
Chu Xia.

774
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,510
Dong is recognised as a permanent staff.

775
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,830
I bet he receives a hefty sum of reward.

776
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,710
He should buy us a meal.

777
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,110
Let me buy you guys a meal

778
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,510
but you will pay the bill.

779
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,190
You are so petty.

780
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,700
Well...

781
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,710
Wei Xuan He sent me a message

782
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,190
inviting me

783
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,030
to check out my Alma mater.

784
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,470
I think I should give it a try.

785
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,350
What do you think?

786
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,830
I don't think it's a good idea.

787
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,510
No, you should take a look.

788
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,430
Look, this is his message.

789
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,030
He also sent me a photo.

790
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,670
Look at the photo.

791
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,430
It can't be fake, can it?

792
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:20,950
It's me, right?

793
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,110
Look.

794
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,980
Tomorrow, I'm going to

795
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,790
Tongcheng University in the afternoon.

796
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,070
I mean it.

797
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,430
Then, you should go there alone.

798
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,510
If I could do that, I would have done that.

799
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,830
Aren't you curious

800
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,910
what kind of person I was in the past?

801
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,350
Can I make money

802
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,380
by understanding your past?

803
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,150
You won't lose anything anyway.

804
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,510
Just take it

805
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,630
as taking a break after a long day at work.

806
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,060
I love my job.

807
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,030
Please don't say that. You need to

808
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,190
take a break from work at times, am I right?

809
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,590
Look at this.

810
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,790
The writing

811
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,470
is almost done, right?

812
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,790
I think it's coming to an end.

813
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,030
What is going on?

814
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,750
What is going on?

815
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,390
What is going on?

816
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,790
I haven't saved my work!

817
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,150
What is going on?

818
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,870
-Save it, hurry up!
-Yes.

819
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,470
I'm going.

820
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,430
You should have said that earlier.

821
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,139
[Zhao Yao Yang]

822
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:17,630
Say it.

823
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,270
[Director Wei.]

824
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,320
Have you considered

825
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,389
[Yao Yang Tech]

826
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,510
my proposal made to you earlier?

827
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:21,590
Director Zhao.

828
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,429
Aren't you a little too impatient?

829
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,550
Director Wei.

830
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,270
When those minor companies

831
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,429
grow stronger,

832
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,710
it will be difficult to put them down.

833
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,710
[Time has changed.]

834
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,300
[The method that we used]

835
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,429
[on Xu Wei Yi]

836
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,870
[is no longer applicable.]

837
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,630
[We need to act fast.]

838
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:38,949
Director Wei, you should

839
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:39,830
understand this theory, right?

840
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,310
I need two more days

841
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,429
to figure it out.

842
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,300
All right, I shall wait for you.

843
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,870
[I thought]

844
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,310
[Xu Wei Yi's case]

845
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,550
[will disappear]

846
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,190
[along with your disappearance.]

847
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,070
[However, I didn't expect that...]

848
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,910
[Chu Xia,]

849
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,900
[why do you come back]

850
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,230
[all of a sudden ten years later?]

851
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,950
Director Wei.

852
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,270
Was that me in the photo

853
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,030
that you sent me?

854
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,510
Yes.

855
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,790
It has been so many years.

856
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,750
You haven't changed a bit.

857
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,150
Let's go.

858
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,310
He will come along.

859
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,270
Do you mind?

860
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,820
Of course Director Wei won't mind.

861
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,510
Right?

862
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,430
It's okay.

863
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,390
Come on.

864
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,270
Stand under the tree.

865
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,870
Why?

866
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,470
Just come here.

867
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,070
Watch out.

868
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,270
When we were in the university,

869
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:50,910
you always

870
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,150
waited for me under this tree.

871
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,470
Once I appeared,

872
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,150
you would run into my arms.

873
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,470
Do you still remember that?

874
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,110
There is a mosquito.

875
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,310
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

876
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,150
Not only mosquito,

877
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,270
but look, there are spiders

878
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,230
and ants.

879
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,910
This university is quite environmentally friendly.

880
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,900
However, the infestation treatment

881
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,670
is not well done.

882
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,030
If your friend is around,

883
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,980
it will affect our memories.

884
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,710
Why don't we make him stay away?

885
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,190
Are you

886
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,950
asking me to leave?

887
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,430
Sure, I'll leave now.

888
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,190
Please don't leave.

889
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,630
It won't affect anything.

890
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,630
He is

891
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,750
the first friend I met here.

892
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,790
With him around,

893
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,550
I would feel

894
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,630
more relaxed.

895
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,430
It will help me

896
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,710
recollect more memories better.

897
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,540
All right.

898
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,710
It's okay. Just ignore him.

899
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,990
Show us the way.

900
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,510
Chu Xia.

901
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,150
Do you still remember

902
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,990
the library?

903
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,590
As she said,

904
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,510
she doesn't remember a thing.

905
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,430
Of course she doesn't have any impression.

906
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,430
Am I right?

907
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,590
Back then,

908
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,510
you confessed to me here.

909
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,750
You said that you like me.

910
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,470
Then, we got together.

911
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,910
Soon, we became

912
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,190
a couple everyone envied in the university.

913
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,430
Yes.

914
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,910
After all, she doesn't remember a thing.

915
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,750
You can say whatever you want.

916
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,310
Stop fooling around.

917
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,430
Just ignore him. Continue the story.

918
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,510
Yes, continue the story.

919
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,630
Just ignore him and be yourself.

920
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,150
I like you.

921
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,940
I think the feeling is mutual.

922
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,110
What do you think?

923
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,350
What did you say?

924
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,910
That was

925
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,740
what you said

926
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,470
when you confessed to me.

927
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,630
You told me

928
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,820
not to care about someone else's opinion.

929
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,110
Don't you remember a thing?

930
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,060
Your confession was so well done.

931
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,070
I really don't remember anything.

932
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,070
It's okay.

933
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,390
Now that I have told you about it,

934
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,270
does what you said in the past

935
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,430
still count?

936
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,870
Let's go to the second floor.

937
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,550
Let's go to the second floor.

938
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,670
This way.

939
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,710
We used to come to library very frequently.

940
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,390
I loved reading finance related books.

941
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,070
You loved reading language related books.

942
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,310
For convenience,

943
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,110
we always sat at this spot.

944
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,150
Take a seat.

945
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,390
Help yourself. I want to take a stroll.

946
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,350
Dating at the library

947
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,190
is disturbing for those who are here to study.

948
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,420
That's unbelievable.

949
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,750
Not only it can guarantee

950
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,750
the exchange of magnetic field,

951
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,710
it can also limit

952
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,830
the impact caused by

953
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,950
the drastic increase of the energy.

954
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,830
If Newton were reborn

955
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,390
or Einstein were resurrected,

956
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,230
they couldn't do better.

957
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,510
Xiao Dong.

958
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,550
Let me tell you a good news.

959
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,350
The bracelet

960
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,310
is successfully invented.

961
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,350
If it works,

962
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,590
Lei Chu Xia

963
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,590
can leave you and move around.

964
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:44,950
No.

965
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,830
That's just a small achievement

966
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,870
among my many researches.

967
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,030
It's not even worth mention.

968
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,230
How about this? Come and get it tomorrow.

969
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,470
Okay, that's all.

970
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,190
Chen Mo.

971
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,510
You are such a genius.

972
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,660
That's not scientific.

973
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,310
[She came from ten years ago.]

974
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,430
[She appeared on the supermoon night?]

975
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,510
[Yes.]

976
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,590
[At that point in time, ]

977
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,150
[your smartphone had been modified.]

978
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,710
[It might have turned into]

979
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,030
[a transfer station for the magnetic field.]

980
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,390
[In other words, it became an anchor point.]

981
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,670
[Her presence]

982
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,950
[has something to do with the gravitational wave.]

983
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,470
[Lei Chu Xia]

984
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,950
[is the one and only specimen.]

985
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,470
[I won't miss the chance.]

986
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,070
[I think I'll have to do something]

987
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,910
[to the bracelet.]
