Yes.

241

This isn't from our company?

247
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,780
Why would we copy it

that you are highly skilled.

251
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,430
But why do you seem a little slow?

252
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,530

consolidate the content.

271

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,520
This smart method

273
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,170

274

There's only one way for us to win.

275
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,870
And that's stealing faster than others.

who helped come up with the

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,720
I think there's a problem
with the comment system.

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,040
There are too many comments
unrelated to the topic.

353

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,900
C.

376
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,000
IT guy, Dong something.

377
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,100
What?

378
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,530
It's C!

379
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,940
That looks like the moon.

380
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,740
It looks more like the sun!

381
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,940
Lei Chu Xia,

382
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
this is what it means by
"the hearts wants what it wants".

383
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,070
This little cookie

384
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,840
has exposed the secret in your heart.

385
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,130
What secret?

386
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,260
There's no secret.

387
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,740
Move.

388
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,860
It's tastes quite good.

389
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,250
Why are you blushing then?

390
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
You're going to blush
if you stand next to the oven too.

391
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,240
Hurry, go.

392
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,610
So it's because the oven is too hot.

393
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,760
Miss Lei,

394
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,800
each cookie costs money,

395
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
don't waste it.

396
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,750
Yes, yes, go.

397
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,240
I'm leaving.

398
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,370
Chu Xia.

399
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,240
Just pick C.

400
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,680
Stop that right now.

401
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,160
Just pick C.

402
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,800
Our teacher taught us to

403
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
just pick C
when you don't know the answer.

404
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,630
Do you want me to get Jin Xiao Rui?

405
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,090
I'm leaving.

406
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,950
Chu Xia.

407
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,630
Enough.

408
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,160
C.

409
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,690
Finally closed.

410
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,900
Yuan Yuan,

411
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,330
since I was so busy helping you

412
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,610
and didn't even have time for dinner,

413
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,730
could you go watch a movie with me?

414
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,940
I'd believe if Xu Xiao Dong didn't eat,

415
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,500
but if it's you,

416
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,860
I won't believe it.

417
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
Do you look like someone
who would sacrifice yourself?

418
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,360
I've sacrificed in vain then.

419
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,640
Let's go.

420
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,200
Go.

421
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,320
No one is going to the movies with you.

422
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,480
Let's go watch a movie.

423
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
-Hurry, quickly.
-No one is going to the movies with you.

424
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,430
Let's go.

425
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,390
Slow down.

426
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,020
I'm hungry.

427
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,200
What's this?

428
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,840
These cookies that
I casually baked this afternoon.

429
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,980
Try them.

430
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,130
Did you bake them specially for me?

431
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,090
You wish.

432
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
[C.]

433
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,520
[The unremarkable IT guy
who just spends time with her,]

434
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,520
[Dong something.]

435
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,280
Let's go.
I'll make noodles for you at home.

436
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,060
[Xiao Dong,]

437
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,520
[the noodles are ready.]

438
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,470
Dad,

439
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,070
the noodles you make still taste horrible.

440
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,710
Really?

441
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,420
But your mum loves the noodles I make.

442
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
She lied.

443
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,050
Mum said

444
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,920
the tastiest noodles

445
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,000
are the ones made with love.

446
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,790
When you're older,

447
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,350
you'll meet someone
who would make noodles for you,

448
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,220
and you will willingly finish it.

449
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,290
[Dad,]

450
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,740
[I think]

451
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,540
[I've found the person
who would make noodles for me.]

452
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,920
Let's go.

453
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,780
What's wrong?

454
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,790
Chu Xia.

455
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,640
I want to...

456
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,230
Mice poison.

457
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,160
Rat poison.

458
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,220
Fly repellent.

459
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,300
Cockroach repellent.

460
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,410
Mice poison.

461
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,000
Rat poison.

462
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,610
Fly repellent.

463
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,490
Cockroach repellent.

464
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,430
I want to...

465
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,720
[Backing up, please be alert.]

466
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,760
[Backing up, please be alert.]

467
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,070
[Backing up, please be alert.]

468
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,620
[Backing up, please be alert.]

469
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
I want to say...

470
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,360
Say it.

471
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,000
I...

472
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,220
[Remember to sort your trash.]

473
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,740
[Be mindful of the environment.]

474
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,910
[Remember to sort your trash.]

475
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,910
You're so happy.

476
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,350
What is it?

477
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,500
Let go. Let's have noodles at home.

478
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,720
-Look at the flower petals.
-Tell me.

479
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,090
Flower petals.

480
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,540
That's it?

481
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:57,050
[Summer Time]

482
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,280
Please come again.

483
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,230
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

484
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,150
Hello, welcome to Summer Time.

485
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,200
What would you like to order?

486
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,240
Take a look.

487
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,220
These are all fresh from the oven.

488
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,100
I'll look around.

489
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,280
This one.

490
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,740
Toast?

491
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,230
Okay, please hold on.

492
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,590
Toast, 15 RMB.

493
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,580
Please scan here.

494
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,440
Hold on, I'll get you a bag.

495
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
Yuan Yuan, let's go on a date.

496
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,240
Can't you see that I'm busy?

497
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,360
Yuan Yuan rejected me.

498
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,680
My heart aches.

499
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,080
Your heart grows on the right side?

500
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,280
My heart is by your side.

501
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,680
I wondered why
you kept doing silly things.

502
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,090
Turns out it's because
you don't have a heart.

503
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,930
Stop playing around.

504
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,530
Sorry for the wait.

505
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,410
Please visit us again.

506
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,660
Sir.

507
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,440
Please hold on.

508
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,000
Please try

509
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,200
our new product.

510
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,210
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

511
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,670
Dong something's cookies
are ready for tasting.

512
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,150
When will it be Rui something's turn?

513
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,720
Here, number eight.

514
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,090
Chu Xia.

515
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,420
What's wrong?

516
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,980
I'm fine. Probably because
I didn't sleep well.

517
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,980
Let's take a seat over there. Let's go.

518
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,270
-Why did she faint?
-What's wrong?

519
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,640
-Maybe she has low blood sugar.
-Chu Xia.

520
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,360
That's dangerous.

521
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,810
Chu Xia.

522
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,840
Chu Xia!

523
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,240
Help me call 120.

524
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,810
Chu Xia, wake up.

525
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,920
What's happening?

526
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,520
Xiao Rui!

527
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,870
-Chu Xia suddenly fainted.
-Help her up.

528
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,380
What happened to her?

529
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,440
Hang in there.

530
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,210
I don't know anything.

531
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,580
Don't worry,

532
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,740
I'm here.

533
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,470
Xiao Dong,

534
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,120
can you come with me?

535
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,530
Chu Xia's syncope

536
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,480
is due to loss of energy.

537
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,120
Would this be a hazard to her?

538
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,600
When she came here,
her energy was balanced.

539
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,520
But she broke them all after that.

540
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,810
There's too little data.

541
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,650
I don't know what's going to happen next.

542
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,260
But Professor Chen,

543
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:30,020
why would Chu Xia's magnetic field
suddenly become unstable?

544
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,920
Because this was in her wrist band.

545
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,440
The original wrist band was used
to control her magnetic field.

546
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,920
But after this was added,

547
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,929
it turned into an automatic emission
of energy.

548
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,270
There are less than five people

549
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,679
from my creation to

550
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,560
those who can get close to it
and make changes.

551
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,850
Professor Chen,

552
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,650
would you be able to find this person?

553
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,030
Of course.

554
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,560
If there's a sender,
there'll be a receiver.

555
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,580
I'll find this person.

556
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,220
Professor, the materials you need.

557
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,470
Leave them there.

558
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,640
I'm leaving now.

559
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,430
Hold on.

560
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,760
What's that in your coat?

561
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,500
Show me.

562
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,640
Show me!

563
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,230
You were the one who tampered
with Chu Xia's wrist band.

564
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,520
Wang Yi Xin,

565
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,670
was it really you?

566
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,570
I don't know what you're talking about.

567
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,100
Stop pretending.

568
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,720
Why would you do that?

569
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,570
Would you be able to bear the
responsibility of taking a human life?

570
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,040
Human life?

571
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,920
Does she count as human?

572
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,370
What are you talking about?

573
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,480
Say that again.

574
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,110
Say that again!

575
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,870
Xiao Dong.

576
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,600
Listen.

577
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,930
He's my student.

578
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,300
Let me handle this.

579
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,260
I'll give you an explanation.

580
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,150
Go take care of Chu Xia.

581
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,610
Wang Yi Xin.

582
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,210
You're my top student.

583
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,930
But this time,

584
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,160
you've gone too far.

585
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,030
Why?

586
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,250
Professor.

587
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,170
We can harness the energy of the universe

588
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,620
and travel from past to future.

589
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,450
That's such a wonderful thing.

590
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,440
If we can

591
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,250
find out

592
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,650
the truth about her time-travelling,

593
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,650
it'll be an outstanding step

594
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,890
in the history of science.

595
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,690
Aren't you tempted?

596
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,260
I am.

597
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,000
Of course I'm tempted.

598
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,600
Should I murder you now then?

599
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,500
All the achievement and honour

600
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,000
of researching Chu Xia

601
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,000
would be mine then.

602
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,110
Right?

603
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,580
Should I kill you?

604
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,850
How is what you're doing now

605
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,740
different from murder?

606
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,530
Firstly,

607
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,170
I didn't commit murder.

608
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,640
Secondly,

609
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,570
is there energy to be

610
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,210
taken from humans?

611
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,670
I just did what I needed to do.

612
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,400
I just didn't expect

613
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,360
taking such a small amount of energy

614
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,100
would cause her to black out.

615
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,810
You know well that Chu Xia

616
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,400
will disappear if she runs out of energy.

617
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,180
If you take her energy,

618
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,920
it's the same as committing murder.

619
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,990
Where do you draw the line?

620
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,350
The line?

621
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,380
Professor Chen,

622
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,340
you were the one who told us

623
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,760
that science is crossing the line,
one step at a time!

624
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,810
Just because we cross the line
doesn't mean there's no line!

625
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,710
I also told you

626
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,100
that science is for
bringing happiness to people.

627
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,410
Not to bring harm.

628
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,760
Wang Yi Xin,

629
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,420
I'm giving you one last chance.

630
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,940
Stop everything you're doing

631
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,370
and apologise to Xiao Dong and Chu Xia.

632
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,990
Everything that I have done

633
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,450
is for the advancement of mankind.

634
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
I didn't do wrong.

635
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,940
No,

636
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,460
you didn't do wrong.

637
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,980
I'm the one who's wrong.

638
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,190
Terribly wrong.

639
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,830
I've underestimated you.

640
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,900
You have big ambitions.

641
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,820
415

642
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,530
won't be able to contain you anymore.

643
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,720
[Wang Yi Xin]

644
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,350
Pack your things

645
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,790
and get out!

646
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,440
Stand still. Don't move.

647
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,080
Let me tell you, Jin Xiao Rui,

648
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,030
I'm asking you one last time.

649
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,890
Do you know it or not?

650
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,500
Yuan Yuan, I really don't know.

651
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,560
Don't know?

652
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,380
Say that again

653
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,840
and I'll give you clips.

654
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
More clips.

655
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,560
You decide what to do.

656
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,520
Are you going to tell?

657
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,640
Xiao Dong really didn't tell me anything.

658
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,320
I don't know anything about Chu Xia.

659
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
Do you think I'm blind?

660
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,320
I saw very clearly

661
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,330
how Chu Xia was in the afternoon.

662
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,750
Xu Xiao Dong came
and carried her off straight away.

663
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,730
I'm not going to believe
he doesn't know anything.

664
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,110
It's even harder to believe
that he knew something

665
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,600
and didn't tell you.

666
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,320
I'm no longer best friend with Xiao Dong.

667
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,880
Why would he tell me anything?

668
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,010
Are you going to tell the truth?

669
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,340
I don't know.

670
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,320
Xiao Rui.

671
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,040
What are you...

672
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,840
Xiao Dong.

673
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,600
You're finally back!

674
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,520
Chu Xia.

675
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,760
Look at my face and hands.

676
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,480
Are you all right?

677
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,940
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

678
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,630
Why did you faint?

679
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,220
Why did I faint...

680
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,130
You should tell her.

681
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
So you knew!

682
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,190
I asked you the entire afternoon
and you just wouldn't say.

683
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,960
This is too important to Chu Xia.

684
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,010
I can't tell without her permission.

685
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,360
Tell her.

686
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,210
Tell her.

687
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,270
I'm the only one who doesn't know?

688
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,450
Before I tell,

689
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,170
can I remove the clips?

690
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,440
It hurts too much.
