with my dad's invention.

7
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Then, the eight shareholders split up

8
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,880
and set up their respective company.

9
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,070
Since then, they have
cut ties with each other.

10
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,510
I looked into these companies one by one.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,630

Zhao Yao Yang,

15
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
is the last person

16
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,190
that I'm going to investigate.

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,150
You have investigated them
for so many years.

18
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,350
You tried not to alert any party.

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,950
You didn't even disclose

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,150
your identity as Winter.

21
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,990

He does look innocent in his photo.

26

Zhao Yao Yang is a cautious person.

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,990

purchasing so many items.

64

It's none of your business.

65

to pay for these kitchenware.

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,500
Why did you turn it into a kitchen?

80

I am always busy at work

81

and you can't stay away from me.

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
So, I turned this area

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
into a mini kitchen

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,760
so that you can try and see

85

Why does he behave like that?

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,710
Try it.

97
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,790
Why are you scared?

98
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,680

105

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,909
As a babysitter.

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,870
I must be the young heiress of the group.

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,670
What does that mean?

116
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,870

Is Xu Xiao Dong in love with her?

Not to that extent.

146
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
However, she always
seeks help from Xu Xiao Dong

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,510
and Xu Xiao Dong has
never turned her down.

148
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,400
But it's normal.

149
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,710
I don't think anyone
would say no to Qin Yue.

150
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,830
It's just some random stuff.

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,520

152
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,400

What is it?

Here it goes.

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,190
Everyone,

157
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,280
as we can see,

158
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,400
both parties have come
to the middle of the stage.

159
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,669
The goddess has made a move.

160
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,120
Tomorrow, I have an important live-stream.

161
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,480
I need you to monitor the background.

162
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
Will my friend

163
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
catch it?

164
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,520
Sure, no problem.

165
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,570
He got it.

166
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,950
My friend got it.

167
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,830
You agreed right away.

168
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,640
Yes.

169
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,140
No problem, it's just a small deal.

170
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,070
That's great.

171
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,740
What else do you need?

172
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,000
The current situation

173
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,440
is not helpful to my friend.

174
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,080
That's all.

175
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,790
Do you want some drinks?

176
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,960
No, I have something to do in the evening.

177
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,760
This is...

178
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,400
She is about to leave.

179
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
Will my friend

180
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,950
make her stay?

181
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,400
I'll get going.

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,630
That's great.

183
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,750
That's great?

184
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,360
I mean...

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
Isn't it great that you
have something to do?

186
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,700
At least you get to work on something.

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,760
He failed.

188
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,280
His dream girl is leaving.

189
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,430
My friend didn't manage to keep her.

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,190
No matter what,

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,640
thank you for your help, Xiao Dong.

192
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,030
What is that?

193
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,040
My friend turned the table around.

194
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
That's an ultimate move.

195
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,550
You don't have to thank me.

196
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,960
My friend

197
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,150
has been defeated by his dream girl

198
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,000
despite having the overwhelming advantage.

199
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,380
My goodness.

200
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,920
In this match,

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,040
my friend

202
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,910
is suffering a double loss.

203
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,440
It's an unbearable sight.

204
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Yes, it's a live-stream.

205
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,400
All the best to you.

206
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,440
It's a live-stream, is it?

207
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,120
All right, I'll take note
of the live-stream tomorrow.

208
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,390
You should

209
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,320
get ready for the live-stream.

210
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,880
Okay.

211
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,480
Leave the live-stream to me.

212
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:06,840
Sure.

213
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,520
Okay, bye.

214
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,360
See you.

215
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,550
Take care.

216
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,230
It's the first minute
after his dream girl left.

217
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
He has missed her.

218
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,430
It's the second minute
after his dream girl left.

219
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,030
He has missed her.

220
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,160
Jin Xiao Rui.

221
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,240
Do you believe that I
would call your mum now

222
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,000
and tell her to give
away all your garage kits

223
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,760
to your neighbour?

224
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,640
And you...

225
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,280
I refuse to listen!

226
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Everyone,

227
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
something urgent occurred.

228
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
We have to stop the
live-stream immediately.

229
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,160
Do you need a microphone?

230
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,000
Everyone,

231
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,320
please look forward to the next episode.

232
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,080
There will be another episode?

233
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,840
When will it be?

234
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,880
I think it will be aired soon.

235
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Jin Xiao Rui, stop it!

236
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
Let me knock some sense into you!

237
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
I'm leaving.

238
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,270
I'm going home.

239
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,190
Leave now!

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,550
And you!

241
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,680
I'll leave on my own.

242
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,110
I'll leave on my own.

243
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,000
I mean...

244
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,150
Clean these up before you go inside!

245
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,430
Life is hard.

246
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,110
Xiao Dong sighed.

247
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,760
[Purchased a number
of kitchenware online.]

248
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,310
[It's 871 yuan in total.]

249
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,460
[Memorial Service]

250
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,020
Xuan He.

251
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,950
The memorial service has begun.

252
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,270
Let's go inside.

253
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,510
Everything will start all over again.

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
[Winter has replied to your message.]

255
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,200
[Da Bao]

256
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,390
[Log in to my account to check it out.]

257
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,270
Da Bao said that Winter
has replied to my message.

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,280
His inbox is flooded
with private messages.

259
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
No way he would reply to you?

260
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,400
How would you know? Hurry up.

261
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,240
Don't interrupt me, I'm working.

262
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,960
Please reply to him.

263
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,600
He is busy.

264
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,790
Hurry up!

265
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,030
What a drag.

266
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,870
Hold on.

267
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,520
[One minute until the live-stream.]

268
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
[Switching from the backstage
to the live broadcast scene.]

269
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,600
[Has it started?]

270
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,090
[What a shame.]

271
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,770
[Cherish the people around you.]

272
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,550
[Rest in peace.]

273
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,120
Are you helping your dream girl?

274
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,480
As I said, she is not my dream girl.

275
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,950
She is just a friend.

276
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,640
So who is your dream girl?

277
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,230
I don't have a dream girl.

278
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,550
Do you have a dream man?

279
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,710
Of course.

280
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,950
Who is that?

281
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,440
Who else? Winter, of course!

282
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,830
Can't you tell?

283
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,770
I have created a new account for you.

284
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,800
You can keep in touch
with Winter via this account.

285
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,270
Winter.

286
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,870
He's not bad.

287
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,680
Don't say that.

288
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,910
He is really outstanding.

289
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,070
That's rare.

290
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,030
We don't usually share the same view.

291
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,310
No doubt I have not met him

292
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,630
but he has been encouraging me.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,630
[In a strange world,]

294
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,660
[you have to continue working hard.]

295
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,430
[If you ever need help,]

296
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,230
[just let me know.]

297
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,480
Furthermore, he is

298
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,870
the person I met here.

299
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,110
Hence, I always update him about life.

300
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,720
[First,]

301
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,480
[I would like to thank everyone]

302
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,610
[Three minutes of silence]

303
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,390
[who's attending the
memorial service virtually.]

304
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,430
[Memorial Service]

305
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,380
[This is a special memorial service.]

306
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,070
Your dream girl is
hosting a memorial service.

307
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,230
Yes.

308
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
That's strange.

309
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,510
This memorial service

310
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,550
is organised by a loyal
man for his ex-girlfriend.

311
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,720
Today, with a heavy heart...

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,830
That girl looks young.

313
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,800
It's a shame.

314
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,030
That's right.

315
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,000
It's quite...

316
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,040
[We would like to thank]

317
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,600
[those who are here to pay
their last respects.]

318
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,060
[Rest in peace.]

319
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,090
[She was so young]

320
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,870
Is that...

321
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,310
Is that me?

322
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,210
[Post a sad face at the comment section.]

323
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,840
Turing.

324
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,240
Based on the current situation,

325
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
compare the statistics.

326
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,280
That's me, right?

327
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,080
[The relevant information is verified.]

328
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,630
[It is 100 percent matching.]

329
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,540
[Your memorial service will begin soon.]

330
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,750
Turing, where is the memorial service?

331
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,780
[To my beloved Ms Lei Chu Xia]

[No. 48, Qinnian Street.]

Chu Xia?

334
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,240
Wait for me!

335
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,680
Turing, off the live-stream.

336
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
[Noted, Xiao Dong.]

337
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,840
Wait for me!

338
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,150
The memorial service will now begin.

339
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,220
[To my beloved Ms Lei Chu Xia]

340
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,480
What's wrong? Why is the screen off?

341
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,120
Figure it out now.

342
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
What is going on?

343
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,550
What is going on?

344
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,160
The back end has stopped.

345
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,460
Contact the person in charge now.

346
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,880
Let's go.

347
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,710
Mr Wei.

348
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,830
I'm sorry, Xuan He.

349
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,230
Something is wrong with the back end.

350
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,950
It's okay.

351
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,270
I'll contact the person in charge.

352
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,590
Okay.

353
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,380
Chu Xia.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,270
Let's put an end to all the secrets

355
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,950
when the memorial
service is officially over.

356
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,500
I've been having nightmares
in the past ten years.

357
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,190
I always found myself by
the cliff in the nightmare.

358
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,590
I didn't have a choice back then.

359
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,950
I didn't mean to harm you.

360
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,910
Please don't blame me.

361
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,510
Chu Xia.

362
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,569
Is that you?

363
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,560
Who are you? Let go of me!

364
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,069
Let go of me!

365
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,240
Let go of her!

366
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,579
-Chu Xia.
-Who are you?

367
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,540
Let go of her!

368
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,280
Are you okay?

369
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,160
Chu Xia.

370
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,040
Leave her alone!

371
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,230
Don't come near her.

372
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,230
Mr Wei.

373
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,880
Mr Zhao, I have to go.

374
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,920
Don't go yet, Mr Wei.

375
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Mr Wei.

376
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm here

377
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,140
for something important.

378
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,190
Mr Wei.

379
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,630
Lately, a few companies

380
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,830
approached me for a project
that took place ten years ago.

381
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,830
Mr Zhao.

382
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,080
Don't you forget

383
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,240
our deal.

384
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,510
No one is allowed to bring up that matter.

385
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,800
Have you lost your memories

386
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,070
due to old age?

387
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,790
I just want to share
the good deal with you.

388
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,880
Mr Wei.

389
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,840
If we succeed in this project,

390
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,830
it will be a huge deal.

391
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,590
We can enjoy our life after this.

392
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,520
So, I have to

393
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,830
talk with you about it.

394
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,160
Who is that guy?

395
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Who did he hold your hand?

396
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,470
Is he crazy?

397
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,070
My name is Lei Chu Xia.

398
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,070
I'm glad that you're okay.

399
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,390
Congratulations, you finally
found out your name.

400
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,500
Turing,

401
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,760
based on Lei Chu Xia's information,

402
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,640
make a search.

403
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,520
[Noted.]

404
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,510
[Lei Chu Xia, female,]

405
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,370
[Lei Chu Xia's biodata]

406
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,160
[graduated from Tongcheng University.]

407
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,470
[Her measurements are...]

408
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,000
Stop!

409
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,550
Why does he know everything?

410
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,430
It's the era of big data.
You can find all sorts of data.

411
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,680
Skip it.

412
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,750
Skip the measurement. Cut to the chase.

413
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
[Lei Chu Xia.]

414
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,710
[Address, No. 88, Tongcheng City.]

415
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
Go to my home.

416
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,310
Sure.

417
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,680
Did you manage to contact Xu Xiao Dong?

418
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,750
How can we mess up
at such a critical time?

419
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Show me the way to Lei Residence.

420
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,600
[Yes.]

421
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,510
Lei Chu Xia?

422
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,310
Do you recall anything?

423
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,240
No.

424
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,150
Are you going to the market?

425
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,600
Are you going to work?

426
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,680
The potatoes look fresh.

427
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,200
Look.

428
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,120
I shall get some potatoes too.

429
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,420
Is she your mother?

430
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,950
-See you later.
-See you later.

431
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,790
Mum!

432
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,070
Mum!

433
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,550
Xu Xiao Dong!

434
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,540
What's wrong?

435
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,660
[Hello, I have heart disease.
If I pass out, please contact my husband.]

436
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,670
She has an artificial pacemaker
inside her body.

437
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,800
Your presence might have affected it.

438
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,010
You need to control your emotions.

439
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,560
Here.

440
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,600
Does she live here?

441
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,710
What is going on?

442
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,750
Hello, is this 120?

443
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,160
Her pacemaker was interrupted

444
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,150
and stopped working.

445
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,080
Hence, the patient
passed out all of a sudden.

446
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,680
Fortunately, she was
sent to the hospital in time.

447
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,220
The surgery was a success.

448
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,360
At the moment, she is doing fine.

449
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,550
She will wake up soon.

450
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,440
Doctor, is she okay?

451
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,710
Yes, she is okay.

452
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,400
Thank you so much.

453
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't mention it.

454
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,920
This is our duty.

455
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,920
Okay.

456
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,160
Doctor, see you again.

457
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,680
Sure.

458
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,870
Thank you.

459
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,910
Mr Lei, good to know
that everything is okay.

460
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,350
Yes.

461
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,110
Young man,

462
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,750
thank you so much.

463
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,790
If it weren't for you,

464
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,480
my wife would be at risk.

465
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,990
Thank you.

466
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't mention it.

467
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
It's nothing.

468
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,470
It's nothing.

469
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,840
Chu Xia.

470
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,840
Mrs Lei is awake.

471
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,030
Chu Xia.

472
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,880
Darling, finally you are awake.

473
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,270
How do you feel?

474
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,640
Darling.

475
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,520
Don't move.

476
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
I saw Chu Xia.

477
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,480
Chu Xia?

478
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Were you dreaming?

479
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,590
Dreaming?

480
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,280
Chu Xia called me mum.

481
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,160
-I need to find her.
-Don't move.

482
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,830
You just had surgery.

483
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,270
I'll look for her.

484
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,000
Go now.

485
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,960
Sure, I'll go now.

486
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,470
Hurry up.

487
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,150
I'll go now.

488
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,950
I have a daughter.

489
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,790
She has been missing for ten years.

490
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,310
We have been looking for her
for the past ten years.

491
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,870
Maybe it's because she has been
longing to see her daughter so much,

492
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,350
something went wrong with her heart.

493
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,190
A few years back, a pacemaker
was installed inside her.

494
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,310
She always said,

495
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,630
"I have to keep my heart beating."

496
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,750
"I want to wait for my
daughter to come home."

497
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,750
Mr Lei.

498
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,710
Your daughter will come home for sure.

499
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,550
Now, your magnetic field is unstable.

500
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,000
You can't go to the hospital.

501
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,200
But don't worry,

502
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,430
your mum is safe now.

504
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,000
Show us the information

505
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,220
that you found.

506

[Missing person]

[She is a local.]

[on November 18, 2011.]

512
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,900
[She left home without a reason at night]

513
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,590
[and has never come home since then.]

514
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,190
[She has long black hair.]

515
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,310
[She was wearing a white sweater dress]

516
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,230
[with a down jacket.]

517
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,040
[She didn't bring anything with her.]

518
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,920
[Her family is worried. Reward will be
given to those who know her whereabouts.]

519
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,790
They have been looking
for me for the past ten years.

520
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,380
[The photo was taken in 2011.]

521
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,390
My dad has grey hair now.

522
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,360
[Her family was in a panic.]

523
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,750
[If anyone knows her whereabouts...]

524
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,990
My mum has wrinkles now.

525

[Please contact Mr and Mrs Lei.]

526
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,310
[Reward is offered.]

527
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,760
So, my presence

528
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,470
affected my mum's heart, right?

529
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,190
You didn't do that on purpose.

530
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,470
I don't remember a thing.

531
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
I don't even remember

532
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,030
my mum has a pacemaker inside of her.

533
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,870
Worse,

534
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,800
we have met each other

535
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,050
but we can't talk to each other.

536
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,760
We can meet Professor Chen

537
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,990
to see if he can figure it out.

538
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,720
That's right. We can go
and see Professor Chen.

539
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,910
Let's go.

540
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,670
[Astrophysics Center
of Tongcheng University]

541
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,240
Didn't I tell you

542
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,470
not to disturb me?

543
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Here, take a seat.

544
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,360
What I'm going to tell you

545
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
may sound ridiculous.

546
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,910
It may be beyond your imagination,

547
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,230
especially you.

548
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,270
No matter what I say,

549
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,870
please stay calm.

550
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,070
Don't panic.

551
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,600
Stay calm.

552
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,910
Okay?

553
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,750
Are you ready?

554
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,190
We shall begin now.

555
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,390
She...

556
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,910
She...

557
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,540
She came from ten years ago.

558
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,790
What did you say?

559
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,300
Peace and silence.

560
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,830
Take a deep breath.

561
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,680
You are an adult.

562
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,950
You need to control your emotions, okay?

563
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,480
All right, let's continue.

564
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,760

The magnetic energy that I detected on her

566
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,040
is very similar to

567
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,720
the magnetic wave that I detected

568
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,680
ten years ago.

569
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,310
However, for some unknown reason,

570
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,030
though you lost your memories,

571
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,150
your appearance has remained the same.

572
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,030
In other words,

573
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,680
she looks exactly the
same as ten years ago.

574
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,470
Her age remains the same.

575
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,320
You don't get it, right?

576
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,200
Let me repeat.

577
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,390
She came from ten years ago.

578
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,710
Can I go back?

579
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,310
I want to go back.

580
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm sorry.

581
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,950
I don't even know how you travelled here,

582
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,940
let alone sending you back.

583
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,230
[Ten years ago?]

584
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,390
[She is the best specimen
for time travel research.]

585
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,800
Prof Chen.

586
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,150
Will the magnetic field on Chu Xia
affect medical equipment?

587
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,080
For example, artificial pacemakers.

588
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,960
Of course.

589
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,600
Once her emotion is agitated,

590
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,280
it will affect electronic products.

591
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,520
For example, the lights were blinking.

592
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,800
It was caused by her emotional agitation.

593
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,550
However, you don't have to worry.

594
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,360
I have moved important equipment

595
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,630
to the next room.

596
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,710
Hold on, don't be reckless.

597
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,430
Be patient.

598
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,510
Is there any way

599
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,590
to control the influence?

600
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Technically,

601
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,920
as long as you stay calm,

602
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,270
it won't affect anything.

603
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,910
However, I think it's impossible.

604
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,470
She is just a human.

605
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,190
Every human has mood swings.

606
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,000
In short,

607
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
I can't move around freely

608
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,750
or meet my parents.

609
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,190
You don't have to be so pessimistic.

610
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,190
You are in luck because you ran into me.

611
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,100
I can try to find a solution

612
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,630
by inventing a device that
can control your energy.

613
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
With that device,

614
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,800
your range of activities can be expanded.

615
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,400
Then, you can leave him.

616
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,440
However,

617
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,630
there is a minor technical issue.

618
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,470
This research requires
a huge amount of money.

619
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,760
My lab is a little short on funds.

620
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,680
That means

621
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,710
it can be solved with money.

622
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,520
We accept Alipay, Wechat, cash, cheques,

623
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,870
shares, gold and futures.

624
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,630
Stop looking at him. He is stingy.

625
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,870
I will figure it out.

626
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,400
You have been jumping for half an hour.

627
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,980
Do you need a break?

628
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,520
I fell at this spot.

629
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,060
I should be able to go back
the same way, right?

630
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,540
Apparently it's against Newton's Law.

631
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,070
No way it works.

632
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,350
Why don't you jump off the building?

633
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,630
Stop! I was just kidding!

634
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,230
Are you crazy?

635
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,980
Is that a suicide attempt?

636
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,360
I need to go back.

637
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,800
I want to be with my parents.

638
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,680
No.

639
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,680
That night, you

640
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,310
fell into my arms all of a sudden.

641
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,420
Hold on.

642
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,670
Where are you going?

643
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,550
Don't move.

644
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,990
What are you doing?

645
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,230
What nonsense is this?

646
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,550
You almost killed me. Get up.

647
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,510
Why isn't it working?

648
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,300
You appeared on the night
of the Super Moon.

649
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,200
Why don't...

650
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,080
Why don't we wait

651
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,070
for the next Super Moon night?

652
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,630
[The last Super Moon for the year]

653
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,520
[was over.]

654
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,480
[According to the Saros cycle,]

655
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
[the next Super Moon]

656
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,160
[is estimated to take place in
the year 2034.]

657
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,430
Why don't we try it again in 2034?

658
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,710
Are you out of your mind?

659
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,950
I don't get it.

660
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,670
Why must the most bizarre thing

661
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,310
happen to me?

662
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,630
To me, this world

663
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,510
is like a mirage.

664
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,270
I can see it yet I can't reach it.

665
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,790
But why?

666
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,870
Are you listening?
Why did this happen to me?

667
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,160
I...

668
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,640
I am expressing my feelings.

669
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,440
Why are you ignoring me?

670
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,550
What are you doing?

671
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,470
Do you know?

672
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,710
In the virtual cyberworld,

673
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,230
it's all about binary,

674
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,230
which means everything
is formed by zeros and ones.

675
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,590
The game you play called
Battle of the Saints

676
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,520
is basically

677
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,110
a collection of zeros and ones.

678
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,880
Now, I'm using

679
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,990
many black and white boxes

680
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,280
that correspond to zeros and ones

681
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,360
to form

682
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,190
an organised pattern

683
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,790
of blacks and whites.

684
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,950
It represents a certain thing.

685
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,240
Come here.

686
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,710
Why?

687
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,030
Put it here.

688
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,870
Then?

689
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,750
Scan it.

690
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,870
Scan it?

691
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,750
It is as if you are taking a photo.

692
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,270
Scan it.

693
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,790
How did you make it?

694
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,610
[Lei Chu Xia]

695
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,590
When I was young,

696
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,710
my dad always played this game with me.

697
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,280
It's known as the

698
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,550
Two Dimensional Barcode Colouring Game.

699
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,030
I still remember that he
used to be busy all the time.

700
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,590
I always bugged him to play with me.

701
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,400
So, he got me

702
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,150
some black and white boxes.

703
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,310
If I got the code right,

704
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,870
he would spend ten minutes
to keep me company.

705
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,550
In the beginning,

706
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,060
I didn't know how to do it.

707
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,469
Slowly, I mastered the pattern.

708
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,110
However, I knew that he was busy.

709
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,510
So, I pretend that I
didn't know how to do it.

710
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,420
I spent a long time arranging
the code on purpose.

711
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,590
I bet you miss your dad a lot.

712
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,430
In the cyberworld, zero and one

713
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,400
is the most basic

714
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,790
yet the most important.

715
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,510
Therefore, in your world,

716
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,230
you are the most important.

717
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,350
As long as you are here,

718
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,840
no matter where you came from,

719
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,760
no matter who you are

720
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,630
or what your name is,

721
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,590
those are not important.

722
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,680
Just like the bar code,

723
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,310
you can find the meaning of your presence.

724
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,600
You can create

00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,350
It's time to eat.

753
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,400
You must be starving.

754
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,310
Here, try it.

755
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,030
What do you think?

756
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,470
It's a little too sweet.

757
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,380
[You have a new message]

758
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,190
Chu Xia, your mum has been discharged.

759
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,230
[Please come to the hospital
to fill the discharge papers.]

760
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,870
I wish to see her.

761
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,310
I'll see her from afar.

762
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,720
Okay, I'll bring you there.

763
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,750
Okay.

764
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,430
We are home.

765
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,990
The street lamp stopped
working for a long time.

766
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,350
Why isn't it fixed yet?

767
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,600
It's an old residential area.

768
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,310
That's normal.

769
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,440
Darling.

770
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,310
Here, let me help you.

771
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,830
I can walk on my own.
I don't need your help.

772
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,230
Why don't you hold my hand?

773
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,350
It's dark, I can't see clearly.

774
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,710
Hold my hand.

775
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,540
Here, slow down.

776
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,160
Since when

777
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,830
can street lamps be controlled by voice?

778
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,800
It's too bright. It's dazzling.

779
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,320
Hold my hand.

780
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,030
I am holding your hand, am I not?

781
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,920
[Dad, I lost my way.]

782
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,680
[Dad.]

783
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,640
[I couldn't find my way home.]

784
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,000
[Dad, I lost my way.]

785
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,070
[Chu Xia.]

786
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,760
[Here, let me hug you.]

787
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,640
[Don't cry.]

788
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,830
[I'm here.]

789
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,310
[Sit down and tell me.]

790
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,800
[What happened?]

791
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,600
[Dad.]

792
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,420
[I couldn't find my way home.]

793
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,920
[We've moved here for a month now.]

794
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,840
[Why can't you]

795
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,240
[remember the way home?]

796
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,750
[What should I do?]

797
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,420
[I have an idea.]

798
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,470
[Let's]

799
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,390
[paint the staircases]

800
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,680
[into the colours of a rainbow.]

801
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,870
[Okay?]

802
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,280
[Moving forward,]

803
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,240
[we shall call it]

804
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,030
[the rainbow staircase, okay?]

805
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,150
The rainbow staircase looks like candy.

806
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,080
It's so beautiful.

807
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,230
It's beautiful, right?

808
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,110
We shall repaint it every year.

809
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,240
In that case,

810
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,320
you will never

811
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,670
lose your way again.

812
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,310
[Xiao Dong.]

813
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,990
Is that girl with you?

814
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,580
Yes, she is with me.

815
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,120
By the way, Professor Chen,

816
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,130
she has a name now.

817
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,750
[Her name is Lei Chu Xia.]

818
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:56,990
Lei Chu Xia?

819
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,600
This name is quite romantic.

820
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,110
Sure, let me talk to Lei Chu Xia.

821
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,920
I have good news for her.

822
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,870
Okay.

823
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,510
Professor Chen is on the line.

824
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,470
Professor Chen?

825
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,110
Professor Chen.
