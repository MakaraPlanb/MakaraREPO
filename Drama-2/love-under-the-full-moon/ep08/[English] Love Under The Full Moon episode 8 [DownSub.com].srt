There's no need to visit
each of them anymore.

405
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,960
That's a lot more convenient.

406
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,630
Yes!

407
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,510
When did you make this?
Why didn't I know?

408
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,870
I didn't put a lot of effort into it.
It's just a small project.

Small project...

410

This small project

411
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,390
would take a week with four
people working on it to complete.

412
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,160
It's not like you simply throw
it in a template

413
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,030
and it's done.

414
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,670
Based on what Jin Xiao Rui said,

415
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,710
Xu Xiao Dong is
slightly better than

416
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,350

417
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,230
That's nothing.

The common programmers

419
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,790

420
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,030
We can't compare him to Winter.

421
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,070
No one can compete with my hero.

422
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,220
He has skills and he's a nice person.

423
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,400
I even heard that

424
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,550
he's really good looking.

425
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,850
No matter how good Winter is,

426
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,690
is he the one who wrote the app
for Summer Time?

427
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,320
You've never met him anyway.

428
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,470
How would you know if he's nice,

429
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,550
how his physique is,

430
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,710

432
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,340
Isn't Winter a client of yours?

433
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,060
Wouldn't you at least have seen
his picture on his profile?

434
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,990
You should be the judge.

435
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,430
Hmm...

436
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,470
I can't share any information
about Winter.

437
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,730
But I think

438
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,410
he's probably better looking
than Xu Xiao Dong.

No, there's no need for that.

444
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,430

00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,930
Isn't that Qin Yue?

561
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,570
Yes, the famous streamer, Qin Yue.

562
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,820
Go get a piece of Summer's Kiss.

563
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,640
Hurry.

564
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,540
We might bump into each other

565
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,510
and have some cake together.

566
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,270
We're going viral.

567
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,150
Go.

568
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,370
Your Summer's Kiss.

569
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,030
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

570
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,670
Please enjoy.

571
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,600
[It's finally here.]

572
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,550
I heard that

573
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,510

575
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,630
The shop's owner
disappeared for ten years,

576
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,950
and lost all her memories
when she came back.

577
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,190
She even broke up with her ex.

578
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,790
She thought that she's going to be lonely,

579
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,860
[Is the topping edible?]

580
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,000
[The way you talk sounds so good.]

581
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,470
but she didn't give up

582
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,190
[Please taste it.]

583
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,140
and remade this,

584
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,070
[It looks not bad at all.]

585
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,310
their then signature cake, Summer's Kiss.

586
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,880
In the end,

587
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:48,950
[I bet it's good, if not I'll lose 2kgs.]

588
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,990
a very talented programmer ate it

589
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,080
[I bet it tastes bad. If I lose,
I'll have to do my homework.]

590
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,400
[The comments are off.]

591
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,350
and they fell in love at first sight,

592
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,680
[I want some.]

593
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,710
and are now together.

594
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,820
[It looks not bad at all.]

595
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,550
Gosh, I envy the owner.

596
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,220
Genuinely envious.

597
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,130
That's such a romantic love story.

598
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,870
I heard that the app of this store

599
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,430
[I wonder what it tastes like.]

600
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,480
[Feel like trying it.]

602
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,800
[It's that magical?]

603
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,870
It is called Dong Xia.

604
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,060
[The cake is not eaten yet.]

605
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,390
Xia should be the store owner,

606
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,200
[Try it.]

607
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,570
[Can't wait.]

608
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,930
[The cake's design is alright.]

609
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,830
but who is Dong?

610
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:15,990
[Summer Time]

611
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,150
Must be her boyfriend.

612
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,000
[Good story.]

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,870

620
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,710
Bye!

621
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,030
[See you again!]

622
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,210

But you can't just...

627

I'm helping you.

629
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,990

747
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,570
My fare.

748
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,830
Paid.

749
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,400
Jin Xiao Rui!

750
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,159
What?

751
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,310
You took advantage of me.

752
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,150
I can pay forward!

753
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,110
I can pay forward!

754
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,350
Pay forward, you wish!

755
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,270
I want to pay forward.

756
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,290
What are you doing?

757
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,199
Bye!

758
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,389
Wait for me!

759
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,110
I'm not in the car yet.

760
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,110
Cheers!

761
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,989
Celebrating another day of sold out cakes!

762
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,880
I'm thankful.

763
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,350
Yuan Yuan and I made some deliveries,

764
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,340
Xiao Dong contributed the most useful

765
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,350
ordering app.

766
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,790
Winter

767
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,340
did an event shout out in the game.

768
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,469
Chu Xia,

769
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,780
who are you thankful for?

770
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,409
For everyone!

771
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,060
Of course, I'm most thankful for Winter.

772
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,750
I would never have thought

773
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,350
that I could become an NPC in a game.

774
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,820
So I'm now

775
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,180
living as Winter's fan.

776
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,860
If I die, I'd be Winter's...

777
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,670
die hard fan.

778
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,840
Winter takes good care
of his fans with his skills.

779
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,850
If someone becomes his girlfriend,

780
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,610
she's going to be the most pampered woman!

781
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,280
The most pampered...

782
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,000
Aren't people in reality
more helpful than virtual ones?

783
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,800
There's beauty from a distance.

784
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,230
Winter is perfect in my eyes.

785
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,700
Why don't we

786
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,880
make a plushie of him in the shop?

787
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,880
That could work.

788
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,900
Make a life-size one.

789
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,890
And when you hug the plushie,

790
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,570
it would feel like you're hugging Winter.

791
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,930
Hugging Winter.

792
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,270
I've convinced a shop

793
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,870
to make those plushies.

794
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,950
We can custom order one

795
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,480
of Winter in...

796
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,560
What do they call it? A cartoon version.

797
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,020
Look, they have a lot of them.

798
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,340
-This one...
-That's common.

799
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,760
[Cartoon Version]

800
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,510
Make the cartoon version.

801
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,290
Make it a cartoon.

802
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,610
[How does it feel to lose to yourself?]

803
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,200
[How does it feel to lose to yourself?
Round Four]

804
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,470
[Round four, Xu Xiao Dong failed.]

805
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,430
[Xu Xiao Dong]

806
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,830
Really, they have everything.

807
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,470
Get lost.

808
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,630
[Leave]

809
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,080
Look,

810
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,990
festive ones.

811
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,990
Yes!

812
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,910
We'd be so happy
if you look at it every day.

813
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,230
Okay, enough.

814
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,310
Stop dreaming, wake up.

815
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,590
Winter is not going to favour you.

816
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,790
Time to go home.

817
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,460
Let's go home.

818
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,550
Back to our own homes to see our own mums.

819
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,380
Let's go, stay safe.

820
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,150
I'll see you in the shop tomorrow.

821
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,220
Our car is that way.

822
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,340
-Let's go.
-Bye!

823
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,070
I'll send you back.

824
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,720
You don't mind if I'm charging a fare?

825
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,830
No.

826
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,630
Are you full?

827
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
Yes.

828
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,380
Why is he here?

829
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,930
Why are you here?

830
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,420
I saw that Summer's Kiss is selling well,

831
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,470
so I came to celebrate.

832
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,380
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

833
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,180
Thank you, Mr Wei.

834
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,420
It is selling well.

835
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,940
They said that

836
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,780
you were dining here

837
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,710
so I came to see you.

838
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,870
Yes, we were just done.

839
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,110
You're here at the right time.

840
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,380
Let me send you back.

841
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,590
No, it's fine.

842
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,790
Mr Wei, you might not know that

843
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,000
Chu Xia and I are staying together.

844
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,150
What do you mean?

845
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,310
Exactly what it means.

846
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,510
Staying together.

847
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,350
No, it's not what you think.

848
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,630
Even though we're staying together,

849
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,470
but...

850
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,470
It's what she said.

851
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,430
You don't have to explain to him.

852
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,030
Let's go.

853
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,660
Hold on.

854
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,360
Why are you staying together?

855
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,150
You don't have a place to stay?

856
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,140
Isn't that inconvenient?

857
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,090
Here.

858
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,460
Take this.

859
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,150
These are the keys to our marriage house.

860
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,950
I've been carrying it with me
all this while.

861
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,380
People clean it.

862
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,480
You can move in right away.

863
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,560
Take it.

864
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,150
Don't worry.

865
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,270
Before you agree to come back to me,

866
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,740
I'm not going to look for you.

867
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,260
I'm off.

868
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,990
Hey...

869
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,560
What are you thinking about?

870
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,200
What are you thinking about?

871
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,830
Lei Chu Xia,

872
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,690
Why are you zoned out?

873
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,330
I was thinking that

874
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,160
we got a house for our wedding
ten years ago.

875
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,150
So?

876
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
He said something that's quite true.

877
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,780
It's not right for me
to stay at your place.

878
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,700
So you want to move in?

879
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,980
I don't.

880
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,110
Who says I want to move in?

881
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,390
Isn't that what you meant?

882
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
I was just questioning

883
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,750
if we really got that far.

884
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,220
That was the past,
and this is the present.

885
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,100
Lei Chu Xia,

886
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,700
I told you that he doesn't seem like
a good person.

887
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,430
He doesn't look like your fiance either.

888
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,640
And if you do move in,

889
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,550
you're walking into the lion's den.

890
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,190
If something happens,

891
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,860
I'm not going to take you back
even if you come back.

892
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,680
What do you mean by that?

893
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,130
Exactly what the words mean.

894
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,830
If you move in and got bullied,

895
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,710
got hurt,

896
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,550
don't come back to me.

897
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,080
I won't have the right to take you in.

898
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,470
I don't need you to take me in.

899
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,370
You said it.

900
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,550
I said it.

901
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,270
Stop the car.

902
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,790
Stop the car? Where are you going?

903
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,620
Never you mind. Stop the car.

904
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,240
It's not easy to get a ride here.

905
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,280
I just said a few words.

906
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,330
Where's the temper for?

907
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,470
Yuan Yuan,

908
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,110
What are you doing?

909
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,110
[Chu Xia, what's wrong?]

910
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,510
[Do you need help?]

911
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,950
Yes.

912
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,590
[Yuan Yuan,]

913
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,590
[the movie is starting.]

914
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,430
[Hurry up!]

915
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,270
[Okay.]

916
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,910
[What's wrong, Chu Xia?]

917
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,430
Nothing, it's fine.

918
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,540
I just want to call and chat.

919
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Go watch the movie. We'll talk tomorrow.

920
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,170
[I can't go to Yuan Yuan's place,]

921
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,780
[but I don't feel like going back
to Xiao Dong's.]

922
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,670
[Where else can I go?]

923
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,670
Sir,

924
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,440
let's go to 88, Ren Min Street,
Summer Time.

925
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,480
Turing.

926
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,030
Find Chu Xia's current location.

927
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,800
Locating Chu Xia.

928
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,430
Signal from sub-system.

929
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,230
In Summer Time.

930
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,470
Xiao Dong, do you want
to continue playing?

931
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,910
Yes.

932
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,070
