You're finally back.

379
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,260
Don't ever leave us again.

380
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,380
I envy you.

381
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,820
Why?

382
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,620
That's something I yearn.

383
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,540
Be careful, don't burn your hands.

384
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
Aren't you envious?

385
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,920
Don't do that.

386
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,520
It's between me and my best friend.

387
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,550
Chu Xia.

388
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,550
If you don't feel well,

389
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,260
I can take you to Professor Chen
for a check-up.

390
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,220
Chu Xia.

391
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,170
What is going on?

392
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,200
Why did you

393
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,870
disappear all of a sudden at the back mountain?

394
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,410
Also, where were you the past few days?

395
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,110
We have been looking for you.

396
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,680
You missed out

397
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,670
the tenth anniversary of Summer Time.

398
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,790
Yuan Yuan, stop asking.

399
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,250
All right, I'll stop asking for now.

400
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,170
I went back to ten years ago.

401
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,420
I went to the back mountain
trying to recall my memory.

402
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,570
Then, I felt dizzy.

403
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,140
When I woke up, I was back to ten years ago.

404
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,420
Did you find out how you fell off the cliff?

405
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,430
[Everything]

406
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,940
[happened because of me.]

407
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,070
Then, how did you come back?

408
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,810
I felt dizzy again.

409
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,150
Then, I came back.

410
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,230
I want to go back for a rest.

411
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,230
Sure, let me send you home.

412
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,510
Can I go to your place?

413
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,430
Of course.

414
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,040
-But...
-Chu Xia.

415
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,990
Why don't you go back to your own place?

416
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,330
[Hurry up, persuade Xiao Dong.]

417
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,090
[Do you want me to betray my buddy?]

418
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,050
[Am I that kind of person?]

419
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,030
[Then you don't deserve to be a human.]

420
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,110
[You will be single forever.]

421
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,960
[Got it!]

422
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,800
[Leave it to me.]

423
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,520
Xiao Dong.

424
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,760
Come with me.

425
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,090
No need, you may leave first.

426
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,240
Xiao Dong, let them talk.

427
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,640
-Let's go back. Let's go.
-No need.

428
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,970
-Let's go.
-No need.

429
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,320
I said, no!

430
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,430
Chu Xia.

431
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,540
No matter what happened to you in the past,

432
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,800
you can always share it with me.

433
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,640
We can face it together.

434
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,760
They are finally gone.

435
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,480
Only two of us here.

436
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,050
Let's have

437
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,530
a talk between best friends.

438
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,600
Chu Xia, what is wrong?

439
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,790
We received the location from Turing

440
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,330
informing us that you were
at Tongcheng University.

441
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,830
When we got there,

442
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,140
we saw you and Xiao Dong hugging each other.

443
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,090
Did he confess to you?

444
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,250
He is quite the romantic.

445
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,420
He confessed to you in public.

446
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,130
He always looks a little sheepish.

447
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,050
I didn't expect him to do that.

448
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,700
Did you say yes?

449
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,920
No.

450
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,240
[Sorry.]

451
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,680
[The number you have dialled]

452
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,040
[is not available.]

453
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,630
[Please try again later.]

454
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,400
[Sending to Zhao Yao Yang]

455
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,400
[Look into Xu Xiao Dong. Do it now.]

456
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,400
Chu Xia.

457
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,460
In the past yen years,

458
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,130
I have been doing a lot of preparation

459
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,180
just in case you came back out of the blue.

460
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,320
In my life,

461
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,700
I never take any chances.

462
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,580
However,

463
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,940
the proof that I collected back then

464
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,710
still comes in handy

465
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,290
after ten years have passed.

466
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,050
I don't get it.

467
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,050
You didn't know Xu Wei Yi ten years ago.

468
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,360
[Piggy Tech sued Xu Wei Yi
for patent infringement]

469
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,050
Why were you in his office

470
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,050
on that day?

471
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,190
Open the door, Wang Yi Xin!

472
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,330
It's you again.

473
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,910
I have told you everything.

474
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,090
It's up to you to believe it or not.

475
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:40,800
I believe you.

476
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,800
I saw Lei Chu Xia

477
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,820
appearing out of nowhere.

478
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,200
What?

479
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,010
Appearing out of nowhere?

480
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,910
Yes.

481
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,060
When did that happen?

482
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,870
Where?

483
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,820
It happened this morning.

484
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,850
At Wei Xuan He's place,

485
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,150
she appeared out of nowhere.

486
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,300
In the morning?

487
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,080
The machine overloaded this morning.

488
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,030
The energy in Lei Chu Xia's body

489
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,040
is connected to the energy that I collected.

490
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,080
I have succeeded.

491
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,780
I have succeeded!

492
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,210
I have succeeded!

493
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,100
I have succeeded!

494
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,570
Wang Yi Xin, tell me!

495
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,800
What is going on?

496
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,250
Ask Wei Xuan He!

497
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,410
Stop bugging me!

498
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,290
You were the one
who stole Xu Wei Yi's patent certificate.

499
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,680
[No doubt we don't know Xu Wei Yi in person]

500
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,800
but he would rather die
than being wrongly accused.

501
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm sure he would never

502
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,870
steal someone else's patent.

503
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,920
[You sought help from a friend
who worked at Xu Wei Yi's company]

504
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,680
[to steal Xu Wei Yi's patent certificate.]

505
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,170
I can't face Xu Wei Yi.

506
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,420
I can't put you in trouble too.

507
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,130
It's a life.

508
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,920
Let go.

509
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,720
Don't let go!

510
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,850
Let go of me!

511
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,770

The sooner, the better.

515

The interval between two hypnoses

516
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,850
is too short.

517
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,540
I worry that it will cause a negative impact

518

By the way, with regards to Lei Chu Xia,

531

don't tell anyone about it.

532

Don't interfere in it too.

[Qin Yue]

579
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,880
I can feel that

580
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,620
you are not in the right condition.

581
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,620
Are you troubled?

582
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,770
It's nothing.

583
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,720
It's okay.

584
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,050
We will try it again.

585
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,000
-Stay relaxed.
-I'm sorry, Dr Tian.

586
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,650
Don't worry.

587
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,410
Did it go smoothly?

588
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,120
It's okay.

589
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,140
Don't force yourself.

590
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,250
Take your time.

591
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,660
Let me send you off.

592
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,390
Dr Tian.

593
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Can I borrow an umbrella?

594
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,790
Sure.

595
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:44,360
[Silver Secret]

596
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,170
Let's go.

597
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,690
Your hand is burning.

598
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,910
Are you having a fever?

599
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,630
Chu Xia.

600
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,520
I...

601
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,930
I...

602
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,850
Xu Xiao Dong!

603
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,210
Let me know when it is almost done.

604
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,160
Sure, thank you.

605
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,030
Don't worry.

606
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,970
I have always been in good health.

607
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,910
This is an exception.

608
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,830
Are you really okay?

609
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,380
Yes, I'm okay.

610
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,490
Do you need a check-up?

611
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,600
-It's okay.
-I will eat it only if you remove the skin.

612
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,730
You are so hard to please.

613
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,900
Perhaps I will feel better after eating fruits.

614
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,540
Let me get you some fruits.

615
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,160
Chu Xia.

616
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,290
I don't mean that.

617
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,940
Why is your hand so cold?

618
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,130
While receiving IV drip,

619
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,170
my hand naturally cools down.

620
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,750
Chu Xia.

621
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,400
For some unknown reason,

622
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,910
this time round, when I see you,

623
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,500
you are very close to me,

624
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,010
but I can't help but feel that

625
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,880
you are so far away.

626
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,250
Did you experience something bad?

627
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,120
Don't worry, just share it with me.

628
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,790
I am always here.

629
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,960
The doctor said that

630
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,460
you have to stay in the hospital today.

631
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,210
Take a good rest.

632
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,990
Hey,

633
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,720
is it a good idea

634
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,250
to leave Chu Xia alone at the hospital

635
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,790
to take care of Xu Xiao Dong?

636
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,900
What if something happens to Xu Xiao Dong?

637
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,090
Chu Xia won't be able to handle it alone.

638
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,460
Now,

639
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
we need to let them spend some time alone.

640
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,010
Don't worry.

641
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,040
Xiao Dong is taken care by Chu Xia.

642
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,210
He will recover in no time.

643
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,870
What do you think?

644
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,280
My love hack

645
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,740
is something, right?

646
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,310
What kind of

647
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,370
love hack is that?

648
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,350
It is all

649
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,550
because of your foolish idea!

650
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,040
You were the one

651
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,030
who told me to come out with some ideas.

652
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,400
Now, you put the blame on me.

653
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,850
All right.

654
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,930
Let me show you some love.

655
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,810
It's my fault.

656
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,600
I won't hit you so hard next time.

657
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
I am not angry anymore.

658
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,440
After all, you are my girlfriend.

659
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,780
I am not your girlfriend.

660
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,050
Yuan Yuan.

661
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,830
Here is a riddle.

662
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,290
Riddle?

663
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,630
Superman is a member of the Justice League.

664
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,700
Iron Man is on the Avengers.

665
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,270
Do you know what league are we in?

666
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,280
What league are we in?

667
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,600
What league is that?

668
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,520
The "Forever League".

669
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,350
What do you think?
I learned it from the internet.

670
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,160
Goodness.

671
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,360
I didn't know that

672
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,800
you came prepared with that old school pun.

673
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,910
What are you doing?

674
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,890
Will you learn something better
from the internet?

675
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,790
Don't you feel sorry after hitting me?

676
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,780
Why should I feel sorry?

677
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,080
I'm heartless.

678
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,050
Of course it won't hurt.

679
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,220
Are you sure you are not sorry?

680
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,450
Fine, I got it.

681
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,060
What do you know?

682
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,530
Are you angry?

683
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,380
No, I am not.

684
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,560
Are you really angry at me?

685
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,930
I was just kidding.

686
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,000
I am not angry.

687
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,040
Are you sure you are not angry?

688
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,250
It is my bad.

689
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,290
I was just kidding.

690
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,290
Look, I am so adorable.

691
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,890
Don't be mad at me.

692
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,990
I am sorry.

693
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,190
Kiss me

694
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,230
and I won't be angry at you anymore.

695
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,750
I want you to kiss me.

696
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,560
All right, it's a deal.

697
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,420
You will stop being angry after I kiss you.

698
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,370
Chu Xia, you are back!

699
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,900
Sorry to interrupt.
