Here.

376
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,550
Xiao Dong.

377
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,310
Do me a favour.

378
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,160
This is her usual expenses.

379
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,790
Who is this pretty lady?

380
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,360
-She's my classmate.
-Cousin.

381
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,300
She's my cousin.

382
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,270
She's his classmate.

383
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,780
Who is she?

384
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,090
Whose classmate? Whose cousin?

385
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,950
Please go on.

386
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,990
I got it.

387
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,160
Don't go yet, pretty girl.

388
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,460
She is really not bad.

389
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,750
Will you please turn around
and let me have a look?

390
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,170
That's great!

391
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,790
She is so pretty.

392
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,160
Xiao Dong, is she your girlfriend?

393
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,920
So, the relationship is not official yet.

394
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,840
Please be Xiao Dong's girlfriend, okay?

395
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,460
Let me tell you.

396
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,170
Xiao Dong may appear as cold as a fridge,

397
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,850
but he is actually an air-conditioner.

398
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,230
He can adjust his temperature accordingly.

399
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,310
Aunt Wei Wei, do you still
want your birthday present?

400
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,990
What? Are you threatening me?

401
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,060
Fine.

402
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,300
For the sake of the handbag,

403
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,540
I'll pretend that I'm threatened.

404
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Aunt Wei Wei, what are you doing here?

405
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,640
Before you came in,

406
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,020
weren't you supposed to knock on the door?

407
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,790
I have the key.

408
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,230
Let's get into the business.

409
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,780
Pass this

410
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,640
to Professor Chen Mo
of Tongcheng University.

411
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,840
Find out if he has a girlfriend.

412
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,550
Who?

413
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,330
Professor Chen Mo of Tongcheng University.

414
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,230
That's his name.

415
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,300
That man gave me a shock

416
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,850
when he pointed out the
problem in my speech.

417
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,540
Madam Shen, may I ask

418
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,610
which of the following stands
a higher chance,

419
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,220
getting accepted into Tongcheng University

420
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,990
or winning a ten-million-yuan lottery?

421
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,780
It has something to do
with the Probability theory.

422
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,680
I think you know it better than I do.

423
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,780
Of course,

424
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,410
I can answer the question

425
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,230
from the perspective
of an insurance agent.

426
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,880
Let's take Union Lotto as an example.

427
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,750
There are around a hundred million
lottery ticket buyers.

428
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,920
The prize pool is worth around
seven hundred million yuan.

429
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,890
The probability of winning the grand prize

430
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,510
would be 1 in 17,720,000.

431
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,410
The annual intake of Tongcheng University
is 3000 students.

432
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,780
Every year, ten million students
take part in the entrance examination.

433
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,850
In other words,

434
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,680
the probability of getting into
Tongcheng University is 3 in 10,000.

435
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,410
In that case,

436
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,170
the probability of getting
into Tongcheng University

437
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,990
is higher.

438
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,400
Do you think I am right, Professor Chen?

439
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,680
Impressive.

440
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,060
Looks like you've been paying attention

441
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,370
in your nine years
of compulsory education,

442
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,600
especially in mathematics class.

443
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,750
I'm thinking of your future and health.

444
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,680
Of course I have to be meticulous.

445
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,440
Did it occur to you

446
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,270
that the accidents
you mentioned just now

447
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,080
have the same probability

448
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,570
as winning the lottery?

449
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,980
It's next to nothing and
almost close to zero.

450
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,370
I am just a normal living creature.

451
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,550
I don't think I will win the lottery.

452
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,030
These people

453
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,600
are just normal living creatures.

454
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,650
I also think that

455
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,930
accidents won't happen to them.

456
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,540
Furthermore, the percentages
that you mentioned just now,

457
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,850
for example, 70 percent, 60 percent

458
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,980
and 30 percent,

459
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,570
where did you get the statistic?

460
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,060
Which organisation
came out with the statistic?

461
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,130
Is it a domestic organisation
or a foreign organisation?

462
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,300
Is it operated by the government
or a private organisation?

463
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,500
Is it certified?

464
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,510
Please show us the proof.

465
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,090
No?

466
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,030
Okay.

467
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,710
Is it safe to say that

468
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,260
these exaggerated figures

469
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,460
are merely your imagination?

470
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,410
Do you have any questions?

471
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,640
You may rebut my claim.

472
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,790
Okay.

473
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,500
Madam Shen, here's a
word of advice.

474
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,360
You excel in mathematics.

475
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,020
If you read a few more books,

476
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,570
I'm sure you will get into
Tongcheng University.

477
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,500
And the probability

478
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,980
will be so much higher compared
to the probability

479
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,310
of you having an accident.

480
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,220
Do you have any questions?

481
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,270
You may rebut my claim.

482
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,120
Okay.

483
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,840
Everyone, as mentioned earlier,

484
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,030
I am of the view that

485
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,880
there is no need to subscribe
to the insurance policy.

486
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,990
Goodbye.

487
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,170
You can buy lottery tickets every day

488
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,260
and as many times as you want.

489
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,780
However, the chance to get into
Tongcheng University

490
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,610
only comes around once a year.

491
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,370
Hence,

492
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,330
the probability of an accident

493
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,540
is not as fat as you imagine.

494
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,820
Even if the probability increases,

495
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,220
I am still of the view that

496
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,610
I can handle most of
the accidents on my own.

497
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,920
Why should I subscribe to insurance?

498
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,990
What a waste.

499
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,750
Watch out!

500
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,680
You're such a gentleman.

501
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,090
You're really something, Aunt Wei Wei.

502
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,920
How long will it take to conquer him?

503
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,260
It depends on

504
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,790
Xiao Dong's preliminary research results.

505
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,220
You should take the chance
to indirectly reveal to him that

506
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,570
I'm smart, articulate,

507
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,170
mature, wise

508
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,360
and a wife material.

509
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,080
Madam Shen Wei Wei.

510
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,550
I won't help you pursue a man.

511
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,740
He is not just any ordinary man.

512
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,570
He may become your uncle-in-law.

513
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,470
I...

514
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,440
Chen Mo...

515
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,130
[Chen Mo's resume]
[Profession: Astrophysicist]

516
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,780
He's a professor of astrophysics.

517
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,260
Perhaps he knows how to send her back.

518
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,310
I'll do it.

519
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,700
Really?

520
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,600
Yes.

521
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,840
It's a deal.

522
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,160
Is anyone there?

523
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm coming.

524
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:18,610
Who are you looking for?

525
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,360
Hello, I'm here for Professor Chen Mo.

526
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,790
He's dead.

527
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,310
It says you're Chen Mo.

528
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm at the right place.

529
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,930
Thanks for delivering the clothes.

530
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,220
Please tell Madam Shen Wei Wei that

531
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,700
even if I were to die from illness,

532
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,060
I wouldn't subscribe
to the insurance policy.

533
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,980
Tell her to let go of me.

534
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,610
Go away.

535
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,460
I'm not here to sell insurance.

536
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,020
Go away!

537
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,820
I'm here to inquire about accidents.

538
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,060
I'll spread the flu to you. Go away!

539
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm here to inquire about accidents!

540
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,130
Go inside!

541
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,680
Are you crazy, Xu Xiao Dong?

542
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,160
This is the accident.

543
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,850
It's not scientific.

544
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,310
She has a strong magnetic field.

545
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,710
What are you?

546
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,890
What did you say?

547
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,160
I am a human.

548
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,330
I'm sorry.

549
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,220
You said that

550
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,270
she appeared on the night
of the Super Moon?

551
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,550
Yes.

552
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,840
The night of the Super Moon.

553
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,090
A gravitational wave did hit Earth
a few days back

554
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,680
on the night of the Super Moon.

555
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,710
At that point in time, your
smartphone had been modified.

556
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,740
It might have turned into

557
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,170
a transfer station for the magnetic field.

558
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,790
In other words, it became an anchor point.

559
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,740
At that juncture, she accidentally

560
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,930
appeared beside you.

561
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,550
Her presence has something
to do with the gravitational wave.

562
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,920
Gravitational wave?

563
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,790
That's unbelievable.

564
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,950
It's just an accident.

565
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,880
Accident.

566
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,470
Put on your mask.

567
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,990
I'm sorry.

568
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,990
That's unbelievable.

569
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,640
A gravitational wave

570
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,310
transported a person here from space.

571
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,890
I must have done

572
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,270
a horrendous crime in the past.

573
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,120
That's why I have to go through
all this in this life.

574
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,880
I even got you into trouble
because of your phone.

575
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,090
You asked me

576
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,820
why I'm still using an outdated phone.

577
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,980
That's because

578
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,990
it's the last present from my dad.

579
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,650
I didn't know that.

580
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,880
It's okay.

581
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,270
It's long past.

582
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,600
My dad is a programming genius.

583
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,410
He devoted himself to work.

584
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,890
However, to our surprise,

585
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,610
in the end,

586
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,080
he passed away all of
a sudden during work.

587
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,310
Back then, I was rebellious.

588
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,400
It was the time where I had the
most ferocious quarrels with him.

589
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200
Why did everything

590
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,040
happen to me out of the blue?

591
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,300
Since then, I have lived
with that question

592
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,840
until now.

593
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,220
Now,

594
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,680
no matter how much I change the
phone's internals,

595
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,330
I won't change its appearance.

596
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,400
That's because

597
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,950
this is the last connection I have
with my dad.

598
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,440
Now, I believe that

everything in life

Thank you for your help.

Though Professor Chen agrees to help,

606
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,330
I think we must keep working hard too.

607

I explained more information in
this class than the previous class.

608

I have a question too.

619
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,460
So am I.

a mini mobile game before, right?

It's known as Candy App, right?

749
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,530
Yes.

750
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,910
The project was under my supervision.

are constantly on the low.

At the moment,

754
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,560
the app is at the bottom of
all the apps in our company.

755
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,140
I don't mean that.

I mean

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,960
I can save the app.

-Really?
-Yes.

759
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,820
You can do it?

760
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,410
Yes.

You are just a hardware
support technician.

Yes, I'm just a hardware

Now, you are going to work
on software development?

Yes.

765
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,660
Great.

00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,140
You have one month

767

to make the app top-ten
in user activity...

768
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,530
I only need a week.

769
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,450
I will make sure it becomes
the number one app.

770
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,050
If you fail,

771
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,180
you will have to leave the company.

772
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,780
If I succeed,

00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,430
let me join the core project team.

774
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,450
Okay.

ten years ago.

787

Ten years ago,

788
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,480
my dad invented a mobile application.

789
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,260
It was compatible

790
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,230
with every mobile phone operating
system on the market.

791
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,970
Almost every mobile phone
manufacturer in the country

792
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,160
fought with each other to
sign a contract with my dad.

proclaimed that they were
the inventor of the programme.

798
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,490
They sued my dad for plagiarism.

799
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,230
They even brought out the evidence.

800
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,230
My dad couldn't take it.

801
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,600
He had a heart attack

802
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,350
and left me.

803
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,370

with my dad's invention.

805
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,260
Then, the eight shareholders split up

806
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,820
and set up their respective companies.

807
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,960
Since then, they have
cut ties with each other.

808
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,390
