00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,680
Wei Xuan He,

5
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,480
Chu Xia has turned you down.

6
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
What tricks are you trying to pull here?

7
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,920
Chu Xia!

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Chu Xia, stop...

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,920
Chu Xia, stop running.

10
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,160
Chu Xia.

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
Chu Xia, my child.

12
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,600
Come home with me.

13
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm not!

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
Chu Xia.

15
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,680
Why won't you

16
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,510
acknowledge us?

17
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,060
Chu Xia, how could we possibly be mistaken?

18
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
You're my daughter.

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,440
You've got the wrong person.

20
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,360
Yes, that's right.

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,480
You're not Chu Xia.

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,200
We mistook you for our daughter.

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
We're old.

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,520
We couldn't see clearly.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Sorry.

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

27
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,350
Would I mistake my own daughter

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,720
for someone else?

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,480
Chu Xia.

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Honey,

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,200
our child still wouldn't acknowledge us

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
even at this point.

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,920
She must have her reasons.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Let's not push her, alright?

35
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
Let's go back first.

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,480
We'll wait for her at home.

37
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,920
When she wants to come home,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
she'll come home.

39
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,300
Right?

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,880
Xiao Dong.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,880
Uncle.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,880
You have to take care

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
of this good friend of yours.

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,240
She must also be

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,220
the most beloved child of her parents.

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,400
Uncle, auntie, don't worry.

47
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,960
No matter what happens,

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
I'll protect her.

49
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,880
Leave her to me.

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,100
Come on, let's go home.

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,840
What's wrong?

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,080
What's on your mind?

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,120
Why is this happening to me?

54
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,040
I just want to be an ordinary person,

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
who can live with their parents,

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,240
and doesn't remember those unknown fears.

57
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,400
Is that too much to ask?

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,680
Is this how I'm going to be
for the rest of my life?

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
This is not what I want at all.

60
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,840
What do you want to do then?

61
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I want to see my parents.

62
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,000
I want to tell them the truth.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,360
Including the fact that you fell off the cliff

64
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,280
and your strange encounter
over the past ten years.

65
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,990
I don't want to put them in danger,

66
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,920
but I really want to tell them I'm still alive.

67
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,980
I don't want the people I love the most

68
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,000
to drown in pain.

69
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
Are you sure?

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
I'm sure.

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,030
Now this is the Lei Chu Xia I know,

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
the one who will never surrender.

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
Alright, now.

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,880
Xiao Dong,

75
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
you're saying that
although Chu Xia has returned,

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,480
she has lost all her memories.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,030
And because of some

78
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
special reasons,

79
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,000
she can't acknowledge us?

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
But she's our daughter.

81
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,640
Auntie, uncle,

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm still helping her

83
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,520
to find her memories.

84
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,159
I want to help her solve all the mysteries

85
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
and remove the danger.

86
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,430
So that she can return

87
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
to her normal life,

88
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,120
return to your side as soon as possible.

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,390
Is there anything we can do

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,960
to help her?

91
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
Honestly,

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
Chu Xia and I

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,800
have been coming back secretly these days.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,070
But apart from some intuitions

95
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,640
from her past,

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,120
it didn't stimulate

97
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,680
more memories of her past.

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,670
I had wanted to ask Chu Xia

99
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
to move back home.

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,840
If there is anything she wants to know,

101
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,120
we can tell her slowly.

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,120
But since she can't
acknowledge us now,

103
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,400
looks like this idea

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,280
is not going to work.

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,400
What should we do?

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,800
I have an idea.

107
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,520
Maybe we can give it a try.

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
Chu Xia loves desserts.

109
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,260
She has always wanted to be

110
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,150
a dessert chef since childhood.

111
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,950
Her father and I used to

112
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,200
take her on trips.

113
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,200
We tried the desserts from different places.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,240
Here's my idea,

115
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,960
we'll visit those places again.

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,400
We'll collect all these dessert recipes

117
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
and give it to Chu Xia.

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,240
Maybe her palate can stimulate her memory.

119
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,120
Honey,

120
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,720
that's a brilliant idea.

121
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,760
Maybe when Chu Xia

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,660
tastes those desserts she used to love,

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
she would remember everything.

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,880
We've been looking for Chu Xia for ten years.

125
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,520
Ten years.

126
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,280
But we never thought of giving up.

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,680
Now that we know

128
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,080
she's healthy and safe,

129
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,550
and she have

130
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,840
reliable friends like you

131
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
by her side,

132
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
we're relieved.

133
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
She will definitely regain her memory.

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
We'll get through this.

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,159
She wants to find her memory.

136
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,880
As her parents, it's our duty

137
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,720
to help her get through this.

138
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,150
As for reuniting,

139
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,520
we can wait for a few more months.

140
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,240
When she is fully recovered,

141
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,480
our family will be reunited.

142
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,240
Why did you come in?

143
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,920
Xiao Dong,

144
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,200
please tell Chu Xia.

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,390
Our daughter has always been full of energy.

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
When she encounters any difficulty,

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,320
she always overcomes it with optimism,

148
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,680
just like when she was learning
to make desserts.

149
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,800
I believe that now, while recovering her memory,

150
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,800
she will do the same.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,360
She'll always have our support.

152
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,360
We'll wait for her to come home.

153
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,240
Tell your

154
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,240
cute teddy bear friend here,

155
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,919
next time she comes,

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,600
she can role play

157
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,370
a character without head piece.

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,680
[Mr Wei,]

159
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
[Miss Qin is drinking with some clients.]

160
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,580
[They are being rather difficult.]

161
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
[Should I help her out?]

162
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,400
She can take care of her own business.

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
♫ Gazing at you ♫

164
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
♫ Time is reflected in the heart ♫

165

167

Well done.

168
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,480
Miss Qin Yue,

169
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,600
you're not only pretty,

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,760
you can sing too.

171
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,450
You're the best influencer
for the sales of our product.

172
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,360
Mr Zhou, you flatter me.

173
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,390
We'll need to count on you for

174
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,470
the sales of our products in the future.

175
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,330
No, no.

176
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,550
Come on, cheers.

177
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,040
Let's set a deal on
our cooperation plan first.

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Mr Zhou,

179
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,920
your company's products

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,080
are already selling very well.

181
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,270
My promoting your product
is just like icing on the cake.

182
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,160
You're too kind.

183
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,960
I think

184
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,230
you should finish this glass.

185
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,150
You're the boss.

186
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,270
Mr Zhou can drink this,

187
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,590
but don't you think you should

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,280
drink a cross-armed wine with Mr Zhou?

189
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
Right, guys?

190
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,960
That's right.

191
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,520
You won't turn him down, right?

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,830
We haven't signed

193
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,120
the contract yet.

194
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,440
Miss Qin...

195
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,280
Miss Qin...

196
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Miss Qin...

197
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,080
This is quite the party.

198
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
Xuan He.

199
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,600
You came, Mr Wei.

200
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,520
Sorry that I'm late, Mr Zhou.

201
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
Are you coming to her rescue?

202
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
This is such a great party,

203
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,800
how can I miss it, right?

204
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,400
Besides, I came here to surprise you.

205
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,680
Let's have a drink.

206
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,320
You came just in time.

207
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,640
Xuan He, don't drink too much.

208
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,600
Mr Zhou likes to drink.

209
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,920
I'll have a few more drinks with him.

210
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Come.

211
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Xuan He.

212
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,480
Drink.

213
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Here.

214
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,480

Chu Xia,

267

Professor Chen has asked someone
to deliver the wrist band.

268
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,310
Great.

269
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,670
Now you don't have to go to the company
with me anymore

270
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,630
and I don't have to go with you

271
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,790
to Summer Time anymore.

272
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
It's fixed?

273
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,370
Why did someone make it seem like

274
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,650
this is such a pity?

275
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Is it that obvious?

276
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,750
This is good.

277
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,790
With this wrist band,

278
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,750
I can speed up on the investigation

279
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,120
of the truth back then.

280
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,840
This is the plan I made last night.

281
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,940
[Sui]

282
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,400
[The mainframe room is to be
relocated for maintenance.]

283
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,250
[Here's your chance to observe and learn.]

284
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
[Come now.]

285
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,320
What's the matter? Duty calls?

286
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Personnel adjustment.

287
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,200
They want me to come down there now.

288
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,640
About our plan...

289
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
It's fine, you should go.

290
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,680
You mustn't delay your work

291
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,840
because of me.

292
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,270
I have the wrist band now, don't I?

293
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,720
I can go anywhere freely now.

294
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,200
And like my parents said,

295
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,230
no matter what difficulties I face,

296
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,520
I won't give up easily.

297
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,680
So, for their sake,

298
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,650
I have to work hard.

299
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,310
Your family

300
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,580
is quite optimistic.

301
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,640
It's probably hereditary.

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,280
Just like your dad is a genius,

303
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,200
and you...

304
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,750
Although you're just an ordinary guy

305
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,090
and an IT personnel

306
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,600
who is often unemployed,

307
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,520
I think

308
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,120
you are hidden gem.

309
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,710
If you want to praise me,
just praise me directly.

310
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Don't mince your words.

311
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,400
Alright now.

312
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,320
Now that you have the bracelet, I'm...

313
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,320
Relieved?

314
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,790
Even more worried.

315
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,260
Who knows what sort of new trouble

316
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,740
you would make?

317
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,920
Life is full of challenges.

318
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,520
That's enough, go out now.

319
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,280
Don't delay your work.

320
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,000
That's enough.

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Go, go, go.

322
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm going now.

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Bye-bye.

324
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,000
Stop looking. What are you looking at?

325
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,720
Listen,

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,320
I've found some information.

327
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,960
The mainframe room is going to be
relocated earlier for maintenance.

328
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,390
This is your only chance

329
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,800
to go in,

330
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,840
you hear me?

331
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,120
Stop looking.

332
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,090
What?

333
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,440
Okay, okay.

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,960
It's okay.

335
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Thank you, Sui.

336
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,210
It's no big deal.

337
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,600
Let's go.

338
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,960
Where are you going?

339
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,520
The mainframe room.

340
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,080
You're just going to waltz in there?

341
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,080
Didn't I tell you

342
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,880
with your qualifications,

343
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,200
you can't enter
the core area of the company?

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,800
We'll do the same as before.

345
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,040
I'll use your ID.

346
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,760
That'll work.

347
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,440
My...

348
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,760
My ID tag...

349
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,480
is in the office.

350
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,920
I'll tell you the truth.

351
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,880
I am

352
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,740
not qualified too.

353
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,460
You're not qualified too?

354
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Then why did you call me here?

355
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,680
Hold on,

356
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,829
since I called you here,

357
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,720
of course I've already figured something out.

358
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,230
We might not be able to go in,

359
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,119
but someone can go in.

360
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,319
What is that?

361
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,480
Don't touch it first.

362
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,400
Xu Xiao Dong,

363
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I'll ask you again.

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,070
Are you going into the mainframe room

365
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,280
just to learn and improve?

366
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,720
Sui,

367
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,280
what are you implying?

368
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,400
I want to enter the mainframe room

369
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,400
to learn from the IT experts in there.

370
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,720
I want to use my own hands

371
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,270
to help you move up the corporate ladder.

372
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,640
Knock it off.

373
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,800
I was once like you.

374
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,960
Stop pretending.

375
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,840
I know what's on your mind.

376
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,920
You want to go in there

377

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,590
because we are really competent.

566
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,760
But take a look around,

567
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,530
these people are tech nerds.

568
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,880
I mean, they won't have the guts to...

569
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,050
steal the company's secrets.

570
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,720
Also,

571
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,760
please hand over your phones too.

572
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,160
Our phones?

573
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,390
This is out of line, isn't it?

574
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,280
That's right.

575
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,280
What rights do you have to take our phones away?

576
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
This is a violation of privacy.

577
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,000
-That's right. -Exactly.

578
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,880
Is he going to take responsibility of this?

579
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,640
They can't do this.

580
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,520
Alright, silence.

581
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,720
I'll say something.

582
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,880
Director Gao,

583
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,920
we've known each other for quite a long time.

584
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,600
I think this really is a violation of privacy.

585
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,750
And there are girls too.

586
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,080
What if their phones have...

587
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,240
Come on.

588
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,840
Everyone, put your phones into this basket.

589
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,680
Hurry up.

590
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,720
One by one, put it inside.

591
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,280
After this, disassemble your computer.

592
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,960
Disassemble it.

593
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,960
They need to check the hard drive.

594
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,120
Make it easy for them.

595
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,320
Cooperate with Director Gao.

596
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,420
Do you hear me?

597
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,800
-We got it. -We got it.

598
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,120
Seriously.

599
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,780
[Cleaning in progress]

600
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,080
I know someone's in there.

601
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,040
Come out.

602
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,840
Come out, stop pretending.

603
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,680
I'll count to three.

604
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,640
One.

605
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,640
Two.

606
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,800
Sui.

607
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
You need to pull.

608
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,190
They found out about it so soon.

609
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,680
Tell me. Did you take
something particularly important?

610
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,560
I didn't.

611
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,430
And to prevent leaks,

612
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,830
the source code in the mainframe room

613
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,000
is intelligently encrypted.

614
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,320
Once cracked,

615
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,810
it will trigger an automatic alert command.

616
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,800
In that case,

617
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,200
the smart encryption
of the source code in our mainframe room

618
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,410
is quite interesting.

619
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,800
The automatic alert function

620
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,400
is quite impressive.

621
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,920
Put that aside for now.

622
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,250
If they find out about you,

623
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,720
they will know about me too.

624
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,320
And I just got promoted.

625
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,260
You must ensure that

626
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,900
nothing happens, okay?

627
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,840
Sui, don't worry.

628
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,430
I've cracked

629
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,200
the file tracking algorithm.

630
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,800
Even if they try to trace me

631
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,070
from the source code,

632
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,600
it'll only get them to a virtual IP address.

633
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
They can't trace it back to me.

634
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,430
Also,

635
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,390
about the mainframe room,

636
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,470
I took care of everything.

637
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,480
Don't worry.

638
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,680
Good.

639
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,560
Just a false alarm, right?

640
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,320
Something is wrong.

641
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,440
What is it this time?

642
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,240
Nothing.

643
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,600
What nothing? Spit it out!

644
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,790
Nothing, really.

645
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,400
Forget the tissue paper. Tell me now!

646
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,280
The surveillance.

647
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,600
A clever IT elite

648
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
like you

649
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,230
would forget about the surveillance?

650
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,320
I didn't forget it.

651
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,350
I took care of the surveillance
in the mainframe room.

652
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
There's no problem with it.

653
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,760
I just forgot the surveillance in the lobby.

654
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,040
Xu Xiao Dong,

655
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,190
do you think we are in a soap opera?

656
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,320
Why didn't you finish your sentence
in one breath?

657
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,610
Believe me, I can die right now.

658
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,600
Sui, calm down.

659
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,480
Don't panic.

660
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,480
Calm down.

661
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,400
Breathe.

662
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,440
And,

663
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,040
why am I saying this?

664
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,600
If they did find us out,

665
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,400
they would've arrested us immediately.

666
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,590
They wouldn't have

667
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,320
gone through so much trouble to check everyone.

668
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,480
A small part

669
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,000
must have gone wrong in the process.

670
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,440
We got lucky

671
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,800
and got away.

672
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,520
Small part gone wrong.

673
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,720
We can't afford to have that.

674
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,960
The small part is usually the fatal part.

675
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,920
We could get exposed at any time.

676
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,640
What about the future?

677
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,280
What if we get exposed in the future?

678
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,520
Small part.

679
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,640
We have to find out this small part.

680
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,560
You hear me?

681
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,200
I think we'll be fine.

682
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,080
Listen to me.

683
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
The surveillance out there got us, right?

684
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,440
It's not like we were doing anything.

685
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,310
I just pulled you to the corner
and had a conversation with you.

686
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

687
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,560
You're right, Sui.

688
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,110
Nothing wrong.

689
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,510
Besides, I know that that surveillance

690
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,720
broke down a week ago.

691
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,960
That's right.

692
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,440
Xu Xiao Dong!

693
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,390
Are you messing with me?

694
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,320
Do you think it's funny?

695
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,120
How could you mess with me?

696
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,000
You made my feelings go up and down.

697
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,920
I almost lost it.

698
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,000
What's wrong with you?

699
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,560
Do you know how I felt just now?

700
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,120
I almost lost it!

701
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,680
And you still messed with me.

702
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,760
Okay.

703
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,600
Anyway, I've done you a big favour this time.

704
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,110
You will have to help me in the future.

705
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,990
Keep this in mind.

706
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Okay, don't worry.

707
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,640
I can't believe you messed with me.

708
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,120
I need to take a breath.

709
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,760
I need to use the toilet.

710
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,600
Don't worry.

711
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,160
[They're making such a big move.]

712
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,230
[Looks like the truth behind the source code]

713
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,600
[isn't simple indeed.]

714
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
[Zhao Yao Yang,]

715
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,560
[you are not getting away this time.]

716
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,160
Mr Wei,

717
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,880
we have a meeting
at the company at 2 p.m. today.

718
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,000
You'll need to attend it.

719
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,760
Wei Xuan He!

720
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,560
Wei Xuan He!

721
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,440
Who are you?

722
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,800
Stop pulling me!

723
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,880
I want to see Wei Xuan He!

724
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,840
Wait!

725
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,800
I want to see...

726
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,720
Sir...

727
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,750
Stop him!

728
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,680
Let go of me!

729
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,600
Let me in!

730
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,640
Wei Xuan He! Let me go in!

731
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,680
Get out of my way!

732
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,200
Get out of my way! Let me in!

733
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,040
Wei Xuan He,

734
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,000
I want to talk to you about Lei Chu Xia!

735
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,350
Who is that man?

736
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,880
Why is he looking for Xuan He?

737
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
I don't know.

738
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,440
Do we know each other?

739
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,000
No.

740
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,120
But I know Lei Chu Xia.

741
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,440
What is your relationship with Lei Chu Xia?

742
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,000
We have no relationship.

743
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,840
But I know her biggest secret.

744
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,240
I think I heard him say

745
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,450
Lei Chu Xia.

746
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,110
I think he said

747
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,760
he knows Lei Chu Xia's secret.

748
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,910
Find out about it.

749
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,960
Investigate this man.

750
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,910
Okay.

751
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,489
I suppose you're not just here

752
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,190
for a free breakfast.

754
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,150

762

763
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,240
See the band on Lei Chu Xia's wrist?

764
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,500
That's her stabilizer.

765
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
If you don't believe me,

766
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,920

767

You're saying that

768
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,780
the current Lei Chu Xia

769
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,170
is the Lei Chu Xia from ten years ago?

770
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,480
She's still 22 years old?

771
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,600
Yes.

772
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,550
The current level of science

773
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,880
can't corroborate it,

774
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,240
but all the facts indicate that

775
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,120
I'm right.

776
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,880
On the day of the super full moon,

777
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,030
a powerful gravitational wave

778
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,560
was formed between the earth and the moon.

779
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,400
Ten years ago,

780
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,600
some coincidental circumstances

781
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,220
might have allowed Lei Chu Xia

782
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,420
to attach herself to this gravitational wave.

783
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,080
Gravitational waves

784
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,840
can change the timeline.

785
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,000
Our ten years may be long,

786
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,240
but Lei Chu Xia's ten years

787
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,520
is fleeting.

788
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,280
Why did she lose her memory?

789
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,760
It's possible that

790
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,680
the gravitational wave has interfered

791
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,360
with her memory nerves.

792
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,670
Or some other reasons.

793
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,750
I don't know about this.

794
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,800
Tell me then,

795
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,040
how can she regain her memory?

796
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,680
Recreate all the events

797
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,840
of the moment when she attached to

798
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,590
the gravitational wave ten years ago.

799
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,400
Maybe she'll get her memory back.

800
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,040
Or maybe

801
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,040
she can travel back to ten years ago

802
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,900
or another time period.

803
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
What a great scientific moment
it would be.

804
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,600
Why are you telling me this?

805
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,650
Because I want to study Lei Chu Xia.

806

Mr Wei,

807
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,360
you've waited for her for ten years.

808
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,040
Don't you want her to regain her memory

809
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,160
so that you can start over?

810
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,040

812

So you just want to experiment on Lei Chu Xia.

813

No.

Studying Lei Chu Xia

816

is good for all of mankind.

817

We can work together, right?

821
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,190

824

00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,600
Gravitational wave.

943
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,220
Ten years ago.

944
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,600
Amnesia.

945
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,360
Chu Xia,

946
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,870
I didn't expect

947
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,360
you would have such a big secret.

948
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,670
What is she after?

949
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,960
Why is it the same as ten years ago?

950
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,240
At the most critical moment of my career,

951
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,600
you showed up again.

952
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,570
What are you trying to do?

953
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,240
Could it be that

954
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,060
you remember something about
what happened ten years ago?
