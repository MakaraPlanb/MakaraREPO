It was me.

That's impossible.

158
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,760

163
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,470
But it is true

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,310
that the person in the video

165
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,310
which Wei Xuan He showed me

166
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,270
was me.

167
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,320
I don't care what kind of proof he has.

168
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,400
We grew up

I know you.

171
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,160
You would never do

172
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,390
this kind of thing.

173
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
You have to trust yourself.

174

Jin Xiao Rui,

175
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,120
just say something!

176
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,400
How did Xiao Dong react

177
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,280
after you told him?

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,910
I didn't dare to look at him.

179
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,920
At this moment,

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,550
isn't Xu Xiao Dong

181
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,040
supposed to trust you

182
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,630
with all his heart?

183
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
Also, Jin Xiao Rui,

184
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,830
what were you trying to say?

185
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,390
Do you not trust Chu Xia?

186
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,950
Yuan Yuan,

187
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,070
this matter is very crucial

to Xiao Dong.

189
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
He definitely needs time to think it over.

190
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,190
I have no right

191
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,270
to choose who to trust on his behalf.

192
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
He must be very upset now.

193
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,280
I'll go visit him.

194
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,790
I was asking

195
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,710
if you trust her,

196
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,870
I didn't ask about Xu Xiao Dong!

197
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,790
Do you think Chu Xia is not upset

198
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,120
right now?

199
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,600
Enough, enough.

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,640
Chu Xia,

201
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,670
don't care about them.

202
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,430
I trust you

203
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,600
with all my heart.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,670
But right now,

205
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,720
I don't even trust myself.

206
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,510
So don't blame them.

207
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,550
Now all I want

208
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,590
is to make up for my sins,

209
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,590
but I feel like everything that happened

210
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,870
is irreparable.

211
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,080
I don't know what to do.

212
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll stay by your side.

213
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,860
[Moonlit Flats]

214
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,430
[Dad,]

215
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,790
[was it really Chu Xia who took your life?]

216
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,670
I lost again.

217
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,160
Is there a bug

218
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,080
in this game of yours?

219
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,070
I used the passing tips

220
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,320
that you gave me,

221
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,000
why would I still fail?

222
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,510
Since computer programs have been invented,

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,320
they have been used

224
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,670
for numerical calculations

225
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,960
and logical calculations.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,070
But do you know

227
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,840
what the future development

228
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,830
of the computer is?

229
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,550
What is it?

230
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,240
Intelligence.

231
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,070
The programs will have more

232
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,080
human-like intelligence,

233
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,790
and they'll be better

234
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,710
at studying

235
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,150
human's delicate emotions.

236
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,200
Doesn't this mean

237
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,000
that it is similar to the Turing program

238
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,900
[Turing Plan]

239
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
that we are studying?

240
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,670
Yes, you're right.

241
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,790
So,

242
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,200
when you're playing games,

243
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,080
don't just focus on the techniques

244
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,510
or tips

245
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,480
and be restricted.

246
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,480
You have to trust your heart.

247
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,590
Connect with the game

248
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,030
through your inner feelings.

249
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,400
At last,

250
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,120
you will win.

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
I hope this is how

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,800
you live your life.

253
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,630
Trust your heart

254
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,720
and overcome all the problems

255
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,000
you encounter.

256
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,600
Trust my heart?

257
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,910
Xiao Dong, have a drink with me.

258
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
[Ready, go!]

259
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,610
[K.O.]

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,320
Xu Xiao Dong, you're so cruel.

261
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,030
I thought that you're in a bad mood,

262
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,070
so I came here to have a drink

263
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,950
and play games with you.

264
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,510
Yet you beat me in every game.

265
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,910
You're a crook.

266
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,240
It's very difficult to lose to you.

267
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,430
When we first met,

268
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,360
you always lost to me.

269
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,720
Nonsense!

270
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,520
I, Jin Xiao Rui,

271
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,670
do not have such a dark past.

272
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,830
Xiao Dong.

273
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Do you really believe

274
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,120
that Chu Xia

275
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,320
is the culprit who killed Uncle Xu?

276
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,080
But Chu Xia

277
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,870
seems to be really upset.

278
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,950
Let's continue.

279
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,760
Chu Xia,

280
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,520
come.

281
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,400
Take a look.

282
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
The stuff in this box

283
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,040
is the stuff

284
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,150
from our childhood.

285
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,320
This diary.

286
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
It's my diary from when I was young.

287
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,190
Look.

288
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,360
There are so many things

289
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
about you in here.

290
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,280
We might be able

291
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,550
to recall your memory.

292
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
And this.

293
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,470
When we were in secondary school,

294
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,310
you gave me this as a birthday gift.

295
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,200
Look. It can be lit up.

296
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,470
And this.

297
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,310
This is the mobile phone we used

298
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,160
when we were young.

299
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,390
Do you remember this time?

300
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,870
It's really old.

301
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
I've been charging it.

302
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,360
It still contains the messages

303
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,550
that we sent.

304
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,200
Best friends forever.

305
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,790
Let me help you recall what happened.

306
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,870
When you were in lower secondary school,

307
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,400
you got an award.

308
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,550
That award

309
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,280
was a Helping Others Award.

310
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,520
After we got into university,

311
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,030
you became the president of the student union.

312
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,360
When we were in the university,

313
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,280
you were actively

314
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,760
helping those clubs

315
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,040
to participate in activities

316
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,000
and hold evening galas.

317
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,000
Everyone

318
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,440
really adored you.

319
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,390
Besides,

320
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,510
you have to trust yourself.

321
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,630
You

322
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,710
have always been

323
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,190
a kind-hearted girl.

324
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,359
You don't even have the heart

325
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,510
to hurt an animal.

326
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,440
Why would you hurt anyone?

327
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,680
You wouldn't do this in the past,

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,109
you won't do it now as well.

329
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,670
But you've always been my best friend.

330
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,599
It's normal

331
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
for you to side with me.

332
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,470
But these

333
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,000
are all facts.

334
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,760
One more thing.

335
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
Look at these photos.

336
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,960
You were adorable back then.

337
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,750
Not bad.

338
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,510
But why did you

339
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,000
cut these photos in halves?

340
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,240
These are not important.

341
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,640
The most important thing now

342
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,440
is to find new evidence

343
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,830
to clear your name.

344

This lipstick is pretty.

349
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,710
Please double-check them.

350
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,320
Okay.

351
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,160
Our vendor prepared this necklace

352
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,990
specially for you.

353
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,160
It's the latest product.

354
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,920

Miss Qin, let me hold your hair.

This necklace is stunning!

358
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,640
Exactly.

359
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,790
It's so beautiful.

360
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,160
It's really elegant.

361
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,600
It looks as if

362
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,600
it were made just for you.

363
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,320
Is it nice?

364
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,990
Miss Tian Tian.

365
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,270
It's really bright.

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,750
Mr Wei has called a halt to Miss Yue's livestream.

367

What did you just say?

368
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,310
Come on, follow me.

369
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,590
Why are you all leaving?

370
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,600
What is going on?

371
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
The livestream is starting in no time.

372
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,960
Miss Qin Yue,

373
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,310
there's some issue with the livestream.

374
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,440
Miss Qin Yue!

375
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,590
Miss Qin Yue!

376
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,170
Okay.

377
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,060
[Beauty Sale]

378
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,990
Miss Qin Yue!

379
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,870
What are you doing?

380
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,080
-Looks good.
-Miss Qin Yue.

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,550
Our livestream has been cancelled.

382
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,880
Are you kidding me?

383
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,440
The vendor wants me to livestream.

384
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,800
Who else can promote the products

385
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,750
better than I do?

386
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200

[Let's see what she's up to.]

767
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,720
That's right.

768
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,470
I'm the owner of Summer Time.

769
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,020
[Isn't she the alien from two days ago? ]

770
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,760
Regarding the internet rumours

771
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,640
that...

772
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,510
The internet rumours that I'm an alien,

773
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,950
and that I have superpowers,

774
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,020
[Explain it like I'm five.]

775
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,000
are true.

776
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,800
Da Huang, come over here.

777
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,060
[Any special offers?]

778
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,400
Like this bread,

779
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,760
I actually generated electricity by myself

780
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,140
[Where are you located?]

781
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,320
and baked it.

782
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,320
Come. Smell it. Does it smell good?

783
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,720
It's good!

784
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,980
[I knew you were trying to promote your stuff.]

785
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,840
It's good!

786
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,430
And now.

787
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,400
Okay, you can leave now.

788

[Do you have superpowers?]

793
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,980
[Cheap effect.]

794
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,940
[I bet she didn't even have to pay for it.]

795
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,820
[I'm leaving.]

796

What else, Xu Xiao Dong?

798
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,020
[Why are you still watching? Guys, just leave.]

799
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,160

800

[The alien is promoting.]

801
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,140
[This is absurd.]

802
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,500
[You could've used better acting skills.]

803
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,980
[I feel humiliated.]

804
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,160
Anything else?

805
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,220
[Viewers decreasing.]

806
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,920
-Mr Xu!
-Nothing...

807
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,180
[Viewers decreasing.]

808
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,460
[That's it?]

809
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,950
Don't go! Don't go, don't go!

810
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,000
There's more!

811
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,540
[Aren't you embarrassed?]

812
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,400
One more. It's...

813
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,510
What is it?

814
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,630
I can vanish into thin air.

815
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,710
Three, two, one.

816
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,620
[This is so cheap.]

817
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,630
Am I gone now?

818
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,300
[Could you be any more absurd? ]

819
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,360
Get the cake.

820
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,200
Hurry, hurry.

821
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,780
[People are playing dirty now.]

822
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,800
Come, come.

823
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,430
Don't ever miss this.

824
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,700
[What could it be if it's not cake?]

825
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,920
Presented by our alien boss,

826
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,340
[Bomb?]

827
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,360
our new alien cake!

828
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,940
[Alien: I don't know her.]

829
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,590
It is definitely

830
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,150
the lowest price on the internet today.

831
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,720
She baked this by generating the electricity herself.

832
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,230
You must never miss this.

833
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,280
You will not lose anything

834
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,280

[This place seems familiar.]

841
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,830
Yes!

[I'm leaving.]

855

Is this an alien cake?

856
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,630
Yes!

Don't leave! Don't leave!

862
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,510
Viewers, don't leave.

863
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:53,380
[Can I travel in space after eating that cake?]

864
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,110
Don't leave.

865
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,630
We are very sincere.

866

00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,430
What are you...

956
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:36,990
Let's go!

957
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,550
Are you...

958
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,590
What are you...

959
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,630
Stand there!

960
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,510
Catch the thieves!

961
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,390
Catch the thieves!

962
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,510
Catch the thieves!

963
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,220
[Intruder Alert]

964
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,190
[The intruders are unidentified.]

965
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
[They've escaped.]

966
00:41:52,460 --> 00:42:00,940
[Yao Yang Tech]

967
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm working overtime.

968
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Yes.

969
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,960
It will take about a month.

970
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,000
We'll definitely complete it by then.

971
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,880
Don't worry, Mr Wang.

972
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,150
Okay, goodbye.

[Xu Xiao Dong]

974
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,990
Hello.

975
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,670
Xu Xiao Dong?

976
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,230
Did you come to my office?

977
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,910
What?

978
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,710
You want to talk to me?

979
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,800
Sorry, I don't have time for that.

980
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,030
One more thing,

981
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,800
you've been fired.

982
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,480
Stop disturbing me.

983
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,280
He's insane.
