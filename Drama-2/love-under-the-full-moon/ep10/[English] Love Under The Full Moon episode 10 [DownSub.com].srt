[Episode 10]

4
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,579
Then we helped her

5
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,900
find Summer Time.

6
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,270
You know the rest.

7
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,540
So that's it.

8
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,870
I'm glad you're back.

9
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,460
I'm glad I waited until you got back.

10
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Based on

11
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,320
what was said,

12
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,530
you're currently just

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,640
twenty-two years old.

14
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,120
But I'm already...

15
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,610
Thirty-two.

16
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
It's alright.

17
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,740
That's not important.

18
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,710
What's important is that you're back.

19
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,400
It's fine.

20
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,460
I'll protect you.

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
You've always been

22
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,030
taking care of me like a sister

23
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,960
in the past.

24
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,660
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

25
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,960
I won't complain that you're young.

26
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,700
Since you fainted,

27
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,060
you're probably not feeling well.

28
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
So tonight you should stay at my place.

29
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,910
I'll take care of you.

30
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,680
Why are you looking at him
just to come stay at my place?

31
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,200
Well, you see...

32
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,520
Didn't I lose my wrist band?

33
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,710
I can't stay too far away from him.

34
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,990
No matter how far I go,

35
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,720
I'll still be back at his side.

36
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,820
Then would you mind

37
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,340
sleeping on the sofa at my place?

38
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,620
I...

39
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,420
I don't mind.

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,270
Get lost.

41
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,970
That's decided then.

42
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,640
I want to go too.

43
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,980
What does this have to do with you?

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,890
What does this have to do with you?

45
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,040
How's this?

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,550
Doesn't this

47
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,790
look quite cool?

48
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,400
Yuan Yuan,
why are you staying at a warehouse?

49
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,250
The rent is low here.

50
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,210
The money that I save

51
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,909
has to go to sustaining Summer Time.

52
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,830
Come in and take a look.

53
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
Why don't you move in with me?

54
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,500
I won't charge rent.

55
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,950
No one wants to stay with you.

56
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,590
My place is a little small.

57
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,840
Yuan Yuan,
your home is decorated quite nicely.

58
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,400
Life is tough

59
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,360
so I have to treat myself nicer.

60
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,470
It doesn't look very decent.

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,840
You're the indecent one.

62
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,460
Jin Xiao Rui,

63
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,520
you are making yourself at home, huh?

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,080
Chu Xia,

65
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,090
the bedroom is this way.

66
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,500
We can sleep together

67
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,560
tonight.

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,960
You're mine.

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,310
Xu Xiao Dong,

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,040
you'll sleep on the sofa, okay?

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,670
Okay.

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Is this distance alright?

73
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,530
No problem.

74
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,850
What about me?

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,000
Look,

76
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,500
there's a lot of space on the floor.

77
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,780
Pick a spot.

78
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,420
How is it?

79
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,520
My room.

80
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,390
Your room is really tasteful.

81
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,120
Right?

82
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,320
There was actually nothing here

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,620
when I first moved in.

84
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,640
These were all

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,320
slowly added to the decoration.

86
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,980
Look.

87
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,260
There's a small balcony.

88
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,230
When I came,

89
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,870
everything was empty.

90
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,520
I thought since I'm staying here,

91
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,110
I should treat myself better.

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,440
So I decorated it.

93
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,540
Now it looks not bad, right?

94
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,500
When we earn some big money,

95
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,440
we'll stay in a bigger home,

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,010
and have more flavour in life.

97
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,710
Let's work hard together.

98
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,360
What's wrong?

99
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,260
Why are you not getting ready
to sleep yet?

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,350
Were you scared about

101
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
what happened just now?

102
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm fine,

103
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,550
but the customers got scared.

104
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,990
Don't worry about them.

105
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,350
People love to be

106
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,700
nosy.

107
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,430
The bigger the issue the better.

108
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,090
But,

109
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,550
luckily Xu Xiao Dong showed up in time.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,909
You didn't see

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,730
how anxious he was

112
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,780
when he picked you up.

113
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,490
Thanks to him.

114
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,690
Thanks to him.

115
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,820
Based on my strong sixth sense,

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,120
my instinct says that

117
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,640
Xu Xiao Dong definitely
has feelings for you.

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,610
What about you?

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,030
What about me?

120
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,010
Playing dumb?

121
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,450
I'm asking if you like him.

122
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,870
I better think about

123
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,190
how to stay alive here.

124
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,290
You're such a killjoy.

125
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,250
I think Xu Xiao Dong

126
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,650
is definitely the first choice.

127
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,980
I'll be the first to vote for him.

128
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,750
Vote with both my hands and feet.

129
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,420
Alright, time to sleep.

130
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,300
You can make anything work.

131
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,180
Xiao Dong is just on
the other side of the door.

132
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,920
Go to sleep.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Stop talking.

134
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,560
No, it's because the two of you...

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,350
Don't talk when you're eating
or sleeping, okay?

136
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,350
Okay, I'll sleep.

137
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,930
You should sleep early too.

138
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,300
Sleeping soon.

139
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,130
I feel so happy

140
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,160
breathing the air of Yuan Yuan's home.

141
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,580
Xiao Dong,

142
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,810
tell me.

143
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,530
Yuan Yuan was able to finish

144
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,970
all my sentences about love.

145
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,640
Don't you think that
we're extra compatible?

146
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,790
Even though she's a lot older than I am,

147
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,450
I feel that she doesn't mind that at all.

148
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,760
What do you think?

149
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,540
Your best friend is talking to you.

150
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,570
Can you give some response, please?

151
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,250
The girls might just be

152
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,920
having pillow talk in the room.

153
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
We should communicate so that

154
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,570
we have each others' backs.

155
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,299
Okay.

156
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,400
Do you think I should be
more straight forward

157
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,280
and take a lot more initiative?

158
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm afraid you might not

159
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,320
be able to even sleep on the sofa.

160
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,350
Okay. Let's stop talking about me.

161
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,800
Let's talk about you.

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,440
I saw you

163
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,730
coming back with her.

164
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,910
That feeling between you two...

165
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,080
I will definitely not believe it

166
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,990
if you say you don't have feelings
for each other.

167
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,570
You're a man.

168
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,290
You should just confess your feelings.

169
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,940
It's not the best time
to confess my feelings.

170
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,160
Chu Xia just experienced
a serious physical condition.

171
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,200
If I confess now, I...

172
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,230
Didn't they say online that

173
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,340
spending time is
the most romantic confession?

174
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,650
I think I'll just spend time with her.

175
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,620
You're right.

176
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,050
I'm going to

177
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,920
spend more time with Yuan Yuan
in the future too.

178
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,100
Okay. Go spend time with Yuan Yuan.

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,400
Go to sleep.

180
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,320
Okay, I know.

181
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,540
You couldn't sleep either?

182
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,620
Do you want to have a drink together?

183
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,950
Don't you think that
the moon is quite full today?

184
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,490
I remember the day when you appeared,

185
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,650
the moon

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,470
was a round, full moon too.

187
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,420
You were probably scared out of your life.

188
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,370
What if I told you

189
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,540
I remembered something today?

190
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,920

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,280
Three, two, one.

380
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,910
How is it, Dr Tian Yu?

381
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,150
The scene that Chu Xia saw

382
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,300
wasn't an illusion.

383
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,770
Are the scenes in her memory

384
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,410
all true?

385
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,910
The scenes shown during hypnosis

386
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,160
basically match what Chu Xia described.

387
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,880
This means it's not an illusion.

388
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,020
Look,

389
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,110
running,

390
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,200
falling,

391
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,370
being chased.

392
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,480
It hints at a lack of security.

393
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,690
It's bizarre.

394
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,330
She is especially resistant and nervous

395
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,490
with this one memory.

396
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,020
That caused her to see

397
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,270
sporadic scenes.

398
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,910
This further points to

399
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,710
a big probability that

400
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,600
this is a true memory.

401
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,250
Based on what you said,

402
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,520
the man that let go and caused her

403
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,000
to fall down the cliff in her memory

404
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,410
really exists too?

405
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,840
It's highly possible.

406
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,670
Of course,

407
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,240
we can't rule out that this is something

408
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,560
that stem from her extreme fear.

409
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,410
We need more memories

410
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,310
to come to a
relatively accurate conclusion.

411
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,120
Got it. Thank you, Dr Tian.

412
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,190
It's windy.

413
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,130
Don't overthink.

414
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,680
It's possible that the person

415
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,430
who hurt you is already dead.

416
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,480
It's also possible that

417
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,480
just like Dr Tian Yu said,

418
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,410
he's just a visualisation of your fear.

419
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,480
This person might not exist in reality.

420
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,860
If someone really

421
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,430
pushed me off a cliff ten years ago,

422
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,960
something terrible must have happened.

423
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,070
I have to investigate.

424
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,370
Okay.

425
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,910
Mum.

426
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,390
Chu Xia.

427
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,180
Chu Xia.

428
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,040
Chu Xia.

429
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,560
It's been a few days.

430
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,940
Why don't I go back to the room with you?

431
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,340
It's more comfortable to sleep on a bed.

432
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,870
You're not sleeping well here.

433
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,100
I'm fine.

434
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,660
I don't dare to sleep now anyway.

435
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,940
You can go back to work.

436
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,630
I...

437
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,480
I'll just lie down here for a bit.

438
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,390
Madam, can I have a sugar pancake?

439
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,490
Okay.

440
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,670
Where did she go?

441
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,080
Lei Chu Xia.

442
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,830
What are you doing?

443
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,000
Are you having another nightmare?

444
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,520
I just went to get breakfast.

445
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
The wrist band is
still with Professor Chen.

446
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,750
We can't stay too far apart.

447
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,760
You need to control the distance.

448
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,150
Since you're awake,

449
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,340
let's go together.

450
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,100
I want to sleep a little bit more.

451
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,950
Stop sleeping.

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,800
You've said so much,

453
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,910
it's time to get up.

454
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,270
Get up.

455
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,230
Hey,

456
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,590
I saw with my own eyes

457
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,390
that there was only one
sugar pancake left.

458
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,760
It's a shame if we don't get it.

459
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,230
The last one?

460
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,530
I'll go with you then.

461
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,560
The best way

462
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,560
to control your distance,

463
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,110
a leash.

464
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,590
This is what you meant by the last one?

465
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,340
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Sure thing.

466
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,150
Is this sugar pancake really that good?

467
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,150
You don't get it.

468
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,190
Sometimes you just have to

469
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,210
get what you're craving for.

470
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,780
If you don't, you won't be happy.

471
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,840
Xiao Dong!

472
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,240
We have to go.

473
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,190
Oh no.

474
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,730
-Xiao Dong.
-Good morning, aunty.

475
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,580
Why do you have a leash on?

476
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,350
This is usually for dogs and kids,

477
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,890
I've never seen it on boyfriends before.

478
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,990
This is something new.

479
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,690
Yes.

480
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,820
Women shouldn't be too possessive.

481
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,860
If you really want to tie him down,

482
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,320
it shouldn't be done with a rope.

483
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,630
Exactly.

484
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,750
Let me tell you,

485
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,580
if a woman wants to tie a man down,

486
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,040
you need to tie him at his heart.

487
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,870
Yes.

488
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,320
Aunty, young people like us
prefer it like this.

489
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,320
Bye!

490
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,780
Kids nowadays.

491
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,020
Why are they all like that?

492
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,390
There's always something new.

493
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,630
It's true.

494
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,610
[Chu Xia's dream]

495
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,910
[is a projection of
her wanting to get her memories back.]

496
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,260
Because she's pushing
to know more about the past,

497
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
she kept dreaming about it.

498
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
As for what the dream represents,

499
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,800
we would need
more information to decipher it.

500
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,830
We can actually try

501
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,620
getting her to get in touch with people,
places and events

502
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,040
[that she's more familiar with.]

503
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,080
[This might help her a lot more.]

504
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,390
[Since Dr Tian Yu said that,]

505
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,630
[why don't we go to my home?]

506
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,110
Catch.

507
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,120
Chu Xia,

508
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,760
take a look.

509
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,950
Hurry.

510
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,280
♫ Broken ♫

511
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
♫ Zoning out all night ♫

512
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,750
♫ The time machine is broken ♫

513
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
This was when I was young?

514
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,690
I think so.

515
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,490
[Run.]

516
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,000
What happened?

517
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,720
Was that it?

518
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,950
Did it end or is it broken?

519
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,900
Is it out of battery?

520
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,600
This might be broken.

521
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,760
Let's find a place to fix it.

522
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,770
We definitely need to fix it.

523
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,900
This unit isn't an old model.

524
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,910
It's an antique.

525
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,600
It's done once it's broken.

526
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
But the video inside
is pretty precious.

527
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,210
Could you help us
take better look?

528
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,950
If it stopped playing half way,

529
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,320
there's one possibility.

530
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,560
The battery slot is broken.

531
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,230
It turns on at first,

532
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,350
but stops after awhile.

533
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,420
That means

534
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
if I can find a new slot
and replace it,

535
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,520
it'll work again, right?

536
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,540
But this type of slot

537
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,110
has been obsolete for a long time.

538
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,300
It's not easy to find at all.

539
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,620
I can try and give it a go.

540
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,570
-Thanks a lot.
-Great.

541
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,370
Let's go and find one.

542
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,350
Okay.

00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,870
[Which one is Darwin's girlfriend?]

566
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,620
[Summer Time]

567
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,660
[Courier]

568
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,840
-Here.
-Thank you.

569
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,210
-Please visit us again.
-Okay.

570
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,220
Summer Time,

571
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,160
I have a delivery for you.

572
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,060
Coming.

573
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,280
What is it?

574
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,790
I don't think I ordered anything.

575
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,700
It is addressed to the owners.

576
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,000
Thanks.

577
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,780
There's still more there.

578
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,130
There's more?

579
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,500
The whole truck.

580
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,380
That many?

581
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,610
Jin Xiao Rui,

582
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,860
come and help.

583
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,950
Help me place them on the second table.

584
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,560
-Okay, no problem.
-Thanks.

585
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,350
So many parcels?

586
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,700
Don't stand around.
Help me move them.

587
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,670
Okay.

588
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,800
I don't know who...

589
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,910
Battle of the Saints...

590
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,520
Why is there a bracket,

591
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,880
"Battle of the Saints,"

592
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,700
behind all the senders' names?

593
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,520
What is Xiao Dong trying to do?

594
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,590
Who's trying to do what?

595
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,820
You know who's behind this?

596
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
No.

597
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,390
I'm moving the parcels.

598
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,910
Weird.

599
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,390
Is this it?

600
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,230
Players of Battle of the Saints

601
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,230
sent a lot of

602
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,870
parts and user manuals to us?

603
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,010
Didn't you say that you're

604
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,390
looking for parts of the DV?

605
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,390
So Winter

606
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,910
helped you in the game.

607
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,520
So now Summer Time

608
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,540
has been flooded by

609
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,320
aide parcels sent by the fans.

610
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,940
What fairy tale is this?

611
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,500
I didn't tell Winter that

612
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,910
I'm trying to fix a DV.

613
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,950
Did Jin Xiao Rui

614
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,450
tell Winter?

615
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,840
Jin Xiao Rui

616
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,840
-counts as Winter's online friend too.
-Is this it?

617
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,150
And he helped Winter

618
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,520
help out Summer Time before.

619
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,470
Here's the problem.

620
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,140
I didn't tell Jin Xiao Rui either.

621
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,280
Xiao Dong,

622
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,430
my back feels like it's burning.

623
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,860
Every time you need help,

624
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,240
Winter will appear in time.

625
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,280
This means...

626
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,000
-he's around us.
-He's around us.

627
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,760
But there's only the two of them

628
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,340
around us.

629
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,490
They're Winter!

630
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,860
How's that possible?

631
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,900
Stop staring.

632
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,410
Keep looking.

633
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,270
Okay.

634
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,080
Winter knows me very well.

635
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,730
Xiao Dong knows me best, after you.

636
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
He's Winter?

637
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,560
I heard that

638
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,750
Winter is the

639
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,520
mature and reliable type.

640
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,380
Is this it?

641
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,360
That's it.

642
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,680
So the both of them...

643
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,460
-Yes.
-You found it.

644
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,780
-Found it.
-You found it.

645
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,710
Xiao Dong!

646
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,910
Found it.

647
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,150
♫ Broken ♫

648
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,940
♫ Zoning out all night ♫

649
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,100
♫ The time machine is broken ♫

650
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,030
♫ it's running so fast ♫

651
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,210
Oh my gosh.

652
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,910
Have you been so naive
since you were a kid?

653
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,590
[Mum!]

654
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,080
[Are you happy?]

655
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,910
[Yes.]

656
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,480
[Our Chu Xia loves sausages.]

657
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,380
But you were really very cute

658
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,150
when you were young.

659
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,040
[Run!]

660
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,520
[Run.]

661
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,520
Are there no more videos?

662
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,630
That's all the videos
that are in the DV.

663
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,610
Chu Xia,

664
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,760
did you remember anything?

665
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,540
I just feel that I'm pretty adorable

666
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,040
when I was a kid.

667
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,330
If it's not for Winter,

668
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,440
I wouldn't get to watch all these.

669
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,940
But how did he know?

670
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,030
I forgot to tell you.

671
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,840
The owner of the electronic store
sent a message to me.

672
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,440
He said he plays Battle of the Saints too.

673
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,630
He bumped into Winter in the game.

674
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,080
After Winter found out about this,

675
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,030
he tried to ask around.

676
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,940
Are you leaving comments for Winter?

677
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:33,790
Yes.

678
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,940
Chu Xia,

679
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,120
don't you feel that the way you're

680
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,600
communicating with Winter,

681
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,460
[Thanks Winter.
I found the part for the DV.]

682
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
[I'll thank you in person
if I get the chance.]

683
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,320
it feels like...

684
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,070
He wants to be in
a virtual relationship with you.

685
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,679
Do you want to die?

686
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,070
He's never even seen me.

687
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,780
That's why it's called
a virtual relationship.

688
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,400
When you meet it's called
bringing it to the real world.

689
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,510
Think about it.

690
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,460
A friend whom

691
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,710
you have never met

692
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,630
keeps giving you a helping hand.

693
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,950
He also fulfils all your requests

694
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,770
using the public for personal gain.

695
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,130
There's only one truth to this,

696
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,310
and that is that he likes you.

697
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,590
That's impossible. Stop guessing.

698
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,630
Okay, I'll stop guessing.

699
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,390
We don't need to care

700
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,510
what Winter thinks.

701
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,540
Let me ask you then.

702
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,120
Do you have feelings for Winter?

703
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,680
He might just be casually helping out.

704
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,950
It's like doing
the daily missions in the game.

705
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,550
Winter is a gaming genius.

706
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,950
And your favourite game

707
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,360
was designed by him.

708
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,680
Wouldn't you fall for
someone with so much talent?

709
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,710
Xiao Rui,

710
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,350
have you heard that
crazy gamer boys

711
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,670
only shower once a month

712
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,850
and have shiny, greasy hair?

713
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,830
No way.

714
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,470
Winter is a hot guy,

715
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,990
and definitely a very hot one.

716
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,250
If he's so mysterious,

717
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,250
it's possible that he's just

718
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,380
an emotionless pig that only lives online.

719
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,810
Who said you could
talk about my friend like that?

720
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,440
What about me?

721
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,550
You...

722
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,470
are my friend too.

723
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,270
Then let me ask you this.

724
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,180
If I fell into the sea with Winter,

725
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,490
who would you save?

726
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,020
I can't swim.

727
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,990
I'm saving neither.

728
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,240
Lend me your phone.

729
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,240
What do you want to do?

730
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,260
[Thanks, Winter.]

731
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,060
[I found the part for the DV.]

732
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,550
[I'll thank you in person]

733
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,950
[if I get the chance.]

734
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,980
Chu Xia doesn't sound like

735
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,280
she has feelings for Winter
other than being thankful.

736
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,070
As for meeting in person,

737
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,630
she's not going to get a chance.

738
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,130
What are you sneakily watching?

739
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,870
Watch... watching?

740
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,420
Don't move.

741
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,200
What were you watching?

742
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,650
Jin Xiao Rui.

743
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,720
A good relationship

744
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,400
would allow us to see each others' phones,

745
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,300
and we might not need
to see each other's phone.

746
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,410
But I think

747
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,010
I'll pick the former.

748
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,140
What do you think?

749
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,200
What would you choose?

750
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,460
There's nothing that I can't show you.

751
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,950
See, there's nothing there.

752
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,190
Good.

753
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,850
Why don't you see it later?

754
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,810
Not now.

755
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,350
You would have deleted
what needs to be deleted.

756
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,990
You think I'm dumb?

757
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
Yuan Yuan, this...

758
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,070
What's your password?

759
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,240
I... I've forgotten.

760
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Really...

761
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,660
[Lei Chu Xia: Thanks, Winter.
I've found the part for the DV.]

762
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,940
[I'll thank you in person
if I get the chance.]

763
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,120
Winter asked me
to settle things here.

764
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,230
I can't expose Winter's information,

765
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,280
but I think he's probably

766
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,670
better looking than Xu Xiao Dong.

767
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,170
[Jin Xiao Rui...]

768
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,750
Could he be Winter?

769
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,520
You're Winter?

770
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,930
I'm not.

771
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,910
-You have feelings for Chu Xia!
-I don't!

772
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,350
You have feelings for Chu Xia!

773
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,150
Go away.

774
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,420
You did so much for Chu Xia?

775
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,560
Did so much!

776
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,170
Trust me. I really don't
have feelings for Chu Xia.

777
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,370
How do you explain Winter?

778
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,290
How do you explain it?

779
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,440
Jin Xiao Rui, you liar!

780
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,320
Jin Xiao Rui, you're such a liar!

781
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,490
I won't believe you anymore.

782
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,120
-Yuan Yuan...
-You're a liar!

783
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,870
A liar you are!

784
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,420
I told you to wait a little longer.

785
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,380
Now we're exposed.

786
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,400
We can't let Chu Xia

787
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,350
know my identity yet.

788
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,920
There's more danger
if more people know about it.

789
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,460
What should I do with Yuan Yuan then?

790
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,300
She's going to ignore me!

791
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,470
I must come clean.

792
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,020
If you're my best friend,

793
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,990
you need to help me.

794
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,670
If you're my best friend then you
should tell her that you're Winter!

795
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,700
Xiao Dong,

796
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,210
please help me.

797
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,520
Yuan Yuan is going to ignore me.

798
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,480
What should I do?

799
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,130
Okay.

800
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,070
No, no, no.

801
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,760
No.

802
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,070
I...

803
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,980
Jin Xiao Rui!

804
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,840
No!

805
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,430
It's dangerous! Slow down.

806
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,760
So you are the real Winter.

807
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,780
Correct.

808
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,330
Winter is my actual identity.

809
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,740
But due to some unique reasons,

810
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,310
I had to cover my identity

811
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,890
with the identity of a game programmer.

812
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,040
But don't worry.

813
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,040
I won't hurt Chu Xia.

814
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,590
Then why did you tell me?

815
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,150
If I don't tell you,

816
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,490
I'm going to lose
Jin Xiao Rui as my brother.

817
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,420
He doesn't want you to misunderstand.

818
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,450
Yuan Yuan,

819
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,590
I hope that for now,

820
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,000
you won't tell Chu Xia yet.

821
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,880
I'll tell her personally

822
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,090
when the time is right.

823
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,820
I don't have to tell her now,

824
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,460
but when is it the right time?

825
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,450
When my place in Chu Xia's heart
overtakes

826
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,720
Winter's place.

827
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,190
I really don't understand
what you men

828
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,690
think about all day.

829
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,180
Okay,

830
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,540
I've come clean.

831
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,720
I hope you can help me keep this secret.

832
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
Thank you.

833
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,940
Good luck.

834
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,300
[Summer Time]

835
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,520
So Yuan Yuan,

836
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,770
please don't ignore me.

837
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,120
Let go.

838
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,120
No.

839
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,200
Are you going to let go?

840
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,390
Sit over there.

841
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,670
So based on what

842
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,130
Xu Xiao Dong said,

843
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,840
that car wasn't yours?

844
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,880
Well...

845
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,070
He doesn't drive it.

846
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,800
I just drive it for fun.

847
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,670
What about the watch?

848
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,790
Xiao Dong gave it to me.

849
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,530
I'm just a

850
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,820
common finance worker.

851
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,690
Why would you
keep pretending like

852
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,100
you come from money?

853
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,070
You can't hit me

854
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,490
if I tell the truth.

855
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,430
Tell me.

856
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,400
It was love at first sight

857
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,640
since the first time I saw you.

858
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,200
But you look

859
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,560
a lot more mature than I am.

860
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,340
I worried that you'd think I'm too young,

861
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,410
so I thought that

862
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,630
if I have money,

863
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,210
you probably wouldn't turn me down.

864
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,820
Really?

865
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,520
Yes.

866
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,880
I keep hearing people say

867
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,080
mature women

868
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,130
have seen a lot in life
and are very realistic.

869
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,240
So I thought a relationship
without stable financial grounds

870
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,340
will not last.

871
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,460
I'm acting all the time because

872
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,990
I want to sustain our love.

873
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,360
So in Jin Xiao Rui's Heart,

874
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,490
I've always been

875
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,150
a woman who just loves money?

876
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,370
Let me tell you,

877
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,370
I don't need that.

878
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,340
What era is this?

879
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,630
You think this is the past?

880
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,370
Women must rely on men?

881
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,050
Jin Xiao Rui,

882
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,520
I'm breaking up with you.

883
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,280
Hold on,

884
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,160
when were we officially together?

885
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,610
Why didn't you inform me?

886
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,360
That's not important.

887
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,320
We've broken up now.

888
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,780
Why am I just being informed

889
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,320
about a relationship and our breakup?

890
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,360
Wait for me.

891
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,500
[Summer Time]

892
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,910
What's going on with you and Jin Xiao Rui?

893
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,280
That Jin Xiao Rui...

894
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,320
He thinks I'm a woman

895
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,200
who is after fame and fortune.

896
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,150
Am I?

897
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:40,900
No.

898
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,320
And he

899
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,760
pretended to be tall, rich and handsome

900
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,030
in front of me.

901
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,360
Does he fit?

902
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,730
Which part of him is tall,

903
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,000
rich and handsome?

904
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,000
Xiao Dong, if you don't help me
get Yuan Yuan back,

905
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,210
I'll just stick to you
for the rest of my life.
