00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,850
We used to come to library very frequently.

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,320
I loved reading finance related books.

6
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000

Help yourself. I want to take a stroll.

Dating at the library

12
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,260
is disturbing for those who are here to study.

13

not only I didn't recollect anything,

41
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,860
I also didn't feel

Common sense wise,

45
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,620
when two persons who loved each other met each other,

46
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
they would surely feel

47
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,860
some kind of spiritual touch.

48
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,260
The emotional touch that you mentioned

yet at the same time,

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,100
I could feel that he was happy.

55
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,020
Was he happy?

56
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,740
Of course he was happy.

He doesn't have to take over you, the troublemaker.

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,060
Chu Xia,

93
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,300
you went to the university with Wei Xuan He.

94
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,700
Did you find back any memories?

95
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,980
He was quite interested in my memories

96
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,420
but I somehow didn't find a sense of familiarity in him.

97
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,659
You said that I was quite close with him, right?

98
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,140
You were indeed quite close with him.

99
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,300
After you went missing,

100
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
he looked for you like crazy.

101
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,220
Though he claimed that he couldn't live without you,

102
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,980
I think that he was just paying lip services.

103
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,260
It has been ten years.

104
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,220
It's such a long time

105
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,580
but I had never seen him

106
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,020
took care of your parents.

107
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,940
I had also never seen him

108
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,540
took care of Summer Time.

109
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,300
What does that mean?

110
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,580
What does that mean?

111
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,940
It shows that Wei Xuan He

112
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,140
is a selfish person.

113
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,020
He loves only himself.

114
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,100
He loves only himself.

115
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,260
Look, what Yuan Yuan said

116
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,900
does make sense.

117
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,580
Can you do it?

118
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,180
It's done.

119
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,220
He interrupted our conversation.

120
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,220
What I am trying to say is

121
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,820
now that you are back,

122
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,780
it means Summer Time

125
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,380
Yes.

126
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,260
It used to be popular?

127
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,179
It was so popular back then.

128
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,059
It's all because of your signature dessert,

129
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,419
Summer's Kiss.

130
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,060
Now I remember.

131
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,540
One day before you went missing,

132
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,140
you made a Summer's Kiss.

133
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,540
You put it there.

134
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,380
Then, you left the store.

135
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,300
You told me

136
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,860
it's reserved by an important customer.

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,060
He would come and pick it up.

138
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,460
Then, you left the store.

139
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,500
But I waited for him for the whole day.

140
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,100
No one came to pick it up.

141
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,620
Was my disappearance had something to do with that customer?

142
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,980
That could be.

143
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,300
Our priority

144
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,980
is to reopen the store.

145
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,780
Then, you should think carefully

146
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,860
how to make Summer's Kiss.

147
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,460
Perhaps

148
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,700
the answer that we are looking for lies in it.

149
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,380
That's right.

150
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,620
However, we need fund to reopen the store.

151
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,660
I have

152
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,060
five thousand yuan.

153
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,940
That's my saving

154
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,100

155

The rest...

156
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,740
I don't have money.

157
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,740
The rest...

158
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,300
I don't plan to invest at the moment.

159
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,140
I have it.

160
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,660
I have money.

161

This is the first time we meet each other.

162
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,180
You don't have to give me such a huge present.

163

Why are you wearing glasses?

166
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,220
Is it because you think that the night is not dark enough?

167
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,020

168
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,180

169
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,700

180

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,300
I, Jin Xiao Rui,

192
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,140
a renowned personal financial manager in the industry,

193
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,300
is entrusted by Winter

194
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,140
to handle this matter.

195
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,420
I believe that

196
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,260
you will receive the fund soon.

197
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,120
[You have received 500,000 yuan]

198
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,260
That's too much.

199
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,500
Look.

200
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,180
Look at this.

201
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,220
But we can't accept the money.

202
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,340
You know him, right?

203
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,260
Return the money to him.

204
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
You can't do so.

205
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,820
I don't really know Winter.

206
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,420
I am only in charge of

207
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,900
the business of his company.

208
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,740
Furthermore, once Winter has made up his mind,

209
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,260
without his authority,

210
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,060
I can't undo it.

211
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,660
Winter has a message for you.

212
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,340
He said, "Bravery is more valuable than money."

213
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,700
He hopes that you will accept his encouragement that isn't worth a penny.

214
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,980
He thinks that the encouragement isn't worth a penny?

215
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,580
He is indeed so cool!

216
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,700
He's awesome.

217
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,900
No way.

218
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,060
Forget it, I'll leave him a comment.

219
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,780

You are so observant.

272
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,620
Yes, it looks like a pedometer

273
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,860
but it can

274
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,700
perfectly control

When she is wearing the bracelet,

278
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,340
it is not eye-catching.

280
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,060

Good.

[Finally he has get ridden of me, the troublemaker.]

378
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,420
[I bet he is happy now.]

379
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,340
[Finally I got rid of her]

380
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,900
[but why am I feeling empty inside?]

381
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,380
Chu Xia.

382
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,460
Wei Xuan He?

383
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,300
Do you have time?

384
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,460
Let me take you to a place

385
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,340
to bring back your memories.

386
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,460
♫ Waiting for wind, rain and snow ♫

387
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,230
♫ Waiting for the full moon ♫

388
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,850
♫ Those who missed out on each other will meet again ♫

389
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,900
♫ You are in my heart ♫

390
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,810
♫ It feels like you are as far as the galaxy ♫

391
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,910
♫ I have missed you ♫

392
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,500
♫ The longer I have not seen you ♫

393
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,530
♫ The more I long to see you ♫

394
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:13,090
[Lei Chu Xia]

395
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,820
[Wei Xuan He is taking me]

396
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,100
[to a place to find back my memories.]

397
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,300
[I'm going.]

398
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,320
♫ Those who missed out on each other will meet again ♫

399
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,220
It's a beach.

400
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:38,980
Yes.

401
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,620
Director Wei.

402
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,780
You said that we are here to find my memories?

403
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,740
Yes.

404
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,740
But I didn't expect that

405
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,540
the pier has been deserted.

406
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,540
We have a deal, right?

407
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,500
Call me Xuan He.

408
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,140
What should we do?

409
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,940
How do we go in?

410
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,380
Come on.

411
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,820
What are you doing?

412
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,100
Have you forgotten?

413
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,140
I learned this from you.

414
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,820
When we were late to school

415
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,420
and were stuck at the entrance,

416
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,020
you taught me to climb over the wall.

417
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,020
Now, it's my turn to be your teacher.

418
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,140
Give me your hand.

419
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,260
I'm good.

420
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,700
Are you coming down?

421
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,740
It's okay.

422
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,180
Let's go.

423
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,780
Did we come here often?

424
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,460
Yes.

425
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,060
It's almost time. Listen closely.

426
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,100
What is it?

427
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,900
Listen to it.

428
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,300
It's ship whistle.

429
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,340
The ship whistle goes well with the waves.

430
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,700
It gives me a sense of calmness.

431
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,980
Were we here to listen to the ship whistle in the past?

432
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,060
Yes.

433
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,420
You brought me here.

434
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,900
Look.

435
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,460
[Xuan He.]

436
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
[I'll do anything]

437
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,420
[for you.]

438
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,420
It's us ten years ago?

439
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,140
Yes.

440
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,300
This is the video you recorded

441
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,700
on our Fourth Anniversary.

442
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,510
♫ I have come to this city before ♫

443
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,240
♫ Everyone on the street looks like me ♫

444
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,020
♫ Waiting for sunrise and sunset ♫

445
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,970
♫ Missing the childhood ♫

446
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,310
♫ Staring at the sky ♫

447
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,410
♫ I move forward ♫

448
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,300
♫ For a long time ♫

449
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,900
♫ Now only I stop walking ♫

450
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,460
♫ There are so much of feelings ♫

451
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,850
♫ Accidentally discover something ♫

452
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,510
♫ Move forward ♫

453
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,490
♫ For a long time ♫

454
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,130
♫ I can't wait to wake up ♫

455
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,990
♫ The sun shines ♫

456
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,700
Listen!

457
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,540
What is it?

458
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,620
Listen carefully!

459
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,020
♫ Tell him I will come back ♫

460
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,300
♫ Nothing can stop me ♫

461
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,200
♫ Stars are blinking ♫

462
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,160
♫ Tell him you will come back ♫

463
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,230
♫ Nothing can stop me ♫

464
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,860
Lei Chu Xia's love for Wei Xuan He lasts forever.

465
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,140
Lei Chu Xia will be with Wei Xuan He forever.

466
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,500
Xuan He,

467
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,980
I'll do anything

468
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
for you.

469
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,300
So will I.

470
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,140
You look so pretty.

471
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,380
Show it to me.

472
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,420
No way.

473
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,140
Ever since we got together,

474
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,940
every year, you recorded a video

475
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,860
but you wouldn't show it to me.

476
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,180
This is the video I recorded.

477
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,220
In the past ten years,

478
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,180
I came here once in a while.

479
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,580
I would spend time here alone.

480
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,420
When I missed you,

481
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,300
I would watch the video.

482
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,260
It felt as if you were by my side.

483
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,060
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,060
Everything that you said

485
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,340
is not part of my memories.

486
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,100
I don't remember you.

487
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,660
I don't remember Yuan Yuan.

488
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,300
I don't remember my parents.

489
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,620
I don't remember anything.

490
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,980
I even suspect

491
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,780
if the me in your mind

492
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,980
is the real me.

493
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,540
Chu Xia.

494
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,220
Just like what you said before,

495
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,260
love and pain are inseparable.

496
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,380
As long as we can grow together,

497
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,340
I love you

498
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,020
and I'm willing to bear the pain with you.

499
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,300
What you have forgotten,

500
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,980
I'm willing to remember it for you.

501
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,220
No matter how many times it happens,

502
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,980
bear it in mind,

503
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,500
Lei Chu Xia's love for Wei Xuan He lasts forever.

504
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,900
The same goes to Wei Xuan He.

505
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,740
Just give me a chance.

506
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,380
We can go back to the past

507
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,620
as if

508
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,980
nothing has happened.

509
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,370
[Yuan Yuan]

510
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,740
Wei Xuan He loves only himself.

511
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,620
Let's go back.

512
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,340
You are on the wrong way.

513
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,660
I know that. You don't have to remind me.

514
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,300
Why do I feel that someone

515
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,700
is troubled?

516
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,900
I'm fine.

517
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,300
Is it?

518
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,260
Finally you got rid of Lei Chu Xia, the troublemaker.

519
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,660
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

520
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,300
Yes, I'm happy.

521
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,740
Of course I'm happy.

522
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,660
That's right.

523
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,100
I'm happy when you're happy.

524
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,060
Yuan Yuan told me that

525
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,420
tonight

526
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,020
she is going to throw Chu Xia

527
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,620
a welcome home party.

528
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,700
I wonder if someone keens to join the party.

529
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,300
Of course, why not?

530
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,980
No.

531
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,540
When did you become Yuan Yuan's friend on WeChat?

532
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,100
This is love.

533
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,820
It's more like harassment.

534
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,900
What do you know?

535
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,540
Let's wait for a minute.

536
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,140
Chu Xia said that she will be here soon.

537
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,140
Chu Xia went out with someone?

538
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,780
She seems happier when she's not by your side.

539
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
You are so articulate.

540
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,620
I need to tend to the lamps.

541
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,340
Help her with the candles.

542
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,740
Yuan Yuan.

543
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,140
It's getting late. Why don't we start early?

544
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,820
What is worth celebrating between us?

545
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,180
What is worth celebrating?

546
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,060
It's to celebrate the first 24 hours we met each other.

547
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,020
Let me see.

548
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,580
If something is wrong with your eyes,

549
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,740
you should consult a doctor before it's too late.

550
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,060
Where did you learn this mushy pose?

551
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,460
It's not mushy!

552
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,060
Nowadays, all the idols are doing this.

553
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,940
This is the ultimate move.

554
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,660
Wink.

555
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,780
All the idols are doing this?

556
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,460
Do you know

557
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,300
what is the difference between illustration and actual product?

558
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,580
What is the difference?

559
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,940
Come here, let me tell you.

560
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,340
The difference lies in your appearance.

561
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,700
I'm quite good looking.

562
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,780
