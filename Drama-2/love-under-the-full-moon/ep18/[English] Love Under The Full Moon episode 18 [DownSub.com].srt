a lot after that,

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,600

strength that adults show

108

128
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,910
would pass away so soon?

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
Why did Xiao Dong and I

130
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,720
have to go through this misfortune?

131
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,720

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,750

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
But

only love

and convey each other's yearning.

140

weird phone call.

205
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,550

206
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,790

208

is running away from home.

210
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,120

212

I've been looking for you for half a day.

218
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Why are you still thinking of running away from home?

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Is it because your dad didn't come back

220
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,430
and you're afraid that he

221
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,750

you'll look up at the moon.

Do you know why?

233
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,550
Because the moon never changes.

389

the biggest misfortune?

393
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,240
I, Wei Xuan He,

394
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,790
son of Wei Guo Peng,

395
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,310
born to an affluent family with all eyes on me

396
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,510
but have no success.

397
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,750
With Xu Wei Yi's patent,

398
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,160
I can get my first pot of gold,

399
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,590
I can carry on with my entrepreneurship,

400
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
and I can bravely face

401
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,950
the criticism that people

402
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,830
throw at me.

403
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,510
If I have to stop now,

404
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,080
I can only beg for mercy

405
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,960
from my father.

406
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,990
I'll be turning into

407
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,640

408
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000

409
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,720
a degenerate who only disappoints my father

410
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,160
and shames the family?

411
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,510
But why

412
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,880
are you stealing from others?

413
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,400
Xu Wei Yi isn't just anyone,

414
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,400
he's a genius.

415
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,190
But this genius

416
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,160
just had to develop things

417
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,160
that are in the same direction as me.

418
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,070
He's the one

419
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,880
who's pushing me over the edge.

420
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,880
A genius can develop

421
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,440
the first revolutionary system,

422
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
and he'll be able to make the second,

423
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,070
third, fourth, fifth...

424
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,880
With his brains,

425
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,390
countless patents will be his

426
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,160
in the future.

427

432

Why am I doing this?

433
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,270
I'm doing this

This success

436

440

442

Was I wrong?

444
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,720
Chu Xia,

445
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm begging you.

446

448

451
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,440
you really shouldn't do this.

452
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,270

give Xu Wei Yi's source code

475

to them?

476
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,440

477

478
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,200
Proceed.

488
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,400
could you answer me?

So...

494
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,920
So everything Lei Chu Xia said

495
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,350
was true?

498
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,350

to fall off the cliff a decade ago?

500
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,560
I've never thought of

501

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,720
I've always thought

505
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,680
that we're the same type of people.

506
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400

Tell us.

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,830
I can let you use the machine,

595

It's AI.
