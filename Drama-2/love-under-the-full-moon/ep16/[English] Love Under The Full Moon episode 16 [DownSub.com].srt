00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,030
which makes it mine too.

193
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,270
I want to take care of it myself.

194
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,070
Okay.

195
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,270
This is the place they're coming to.

196
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,510
Jin Xiao Rui doesn't dare

197
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,790
to lie to me now.

198
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,470
Are you really not going

199
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,630
to tell Xu Xiao Dong?

200
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,790
He didn't want me to come,

201
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,310
it must be because he didn't want me

202
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,360
to put myself in danger.

203
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,710
But this is a matter

204
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,840
of my innocence.

205
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,510
I have to take care of it myself.

206
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,880
Come on, let's go and take a look.

207
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,480
Hour maids are not allowed in.

208
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,480
Have you ever seen any hour maids

209
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,670
dressed like this?

210
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
You're not hour maids.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,030
All the more reason you can't go in.

212
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,150
If something happens,

213
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,070
who will take responsibility?

214
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,390
Open your eyes and look at us.

215
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,390
Do we look like bad guys?

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,790
Why are they allowed

217
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,550
to drive in?

218
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,160
Look at

219
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,320
the brand of car they drive.

220
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,310
So what if they have a car?

221
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
So what if they are rich?

222
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,550
Just because he's rich,

223
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,430
does it mean he's not a scammer

224
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,390
or a bad guy?

225
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,240
I didn't mean to tell her.

226
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,670
Yuan Yuan grabbed my phone.

227
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,120
Just go.

228
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,750
You're unbelievable.

229
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Excuse me,

230
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,430
they are

231
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,480
our hour maids.

232
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,590
Okay, okay.

233
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm sorry, girls.

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,920
Please.

235
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,320
What are you waiting for, hour maids?

236
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,320
Ouch, ouch.

237
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,640
[No. 189, 5A]

238
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,360
No. 189, 5A.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,950
This is Zhao Yao Yang's

240
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,830
foreclosed villa.

241
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,440
I just walked around.

242
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,360
The environment around

243
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
is really nice.

244
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,000
Looks like Zhao Yao Yang

245
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
definitely makes a lot of money.

246
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,160
I've set up

247
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
a motion capture system.

248
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,320
Whenever there is movement in his house,

249
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,390
it will alert us.

250
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,600
That's brilliant, Xiao Dong.

251
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,590
We won't have to bother

252
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,550
with surveillance.

253
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,600
Are you upset?

254
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,670
No.

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,910
I just suddenly

256
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,720
thought about my dad.

257
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,920
He used to

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
like to sit under an old tree too.

259
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,630
He told me that

260
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,360
when he shared all his happiness

261
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,390
with the tree,

262
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,550
he would gain strength;

263
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
when he shared all his unhappiness

264
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,480
with the tree,

265
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,750
all his worries would be gone.

266
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,790
This is who he is.

267
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,480
He likes to

268
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,200
keep everything to himself.

269
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,750
Every time I hear you talk about your dad,

270
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,960
I can feel that

271
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,880
he is a good father.

272
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
You know,

273
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,360
I have

274
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,080
a game console that I grew up playing with.

275
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,120
My dad

276
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,240
carved some words on it for me.

277
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,760
What are those words?

278
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
To Xiao Dong,

279
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,920
my son.

280
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
But at that time,

281
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,200
I was rebellious and immature.

282
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,870
I always caused him trouble.

283
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,000
So I made up my mind

284
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,080
to find out the truth

285
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,670
and clear his name.

286
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,550
I think

287
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,470
as long as you don't lose

288
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,840
the courage to face everything,

289
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,070
any difficulty

290
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,150
can be defeated.

291
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,070
Why does it

292
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,000
sound so familiar?

293
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,240
The

294
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
old fairy lady

295
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240
said the same thing before.

296
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,190
She said something similar

297
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,550
to encourage me.

298
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,960
You mean the person you told me about last time?

299
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,200
Are you still in touch with her?

300
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,280
No.

301
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,720
Ten years have passed.

302
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,750
I've lost touch with her a long time ago.

303
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,000
Besides, I didn't see clearly

304
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,960
what she looked like.

305
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,550
I think even if we stand together now,

306
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,360
face to face,

307
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,630
we still won't recognize each other.

308
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,790
There are quite a lot of stars tonight.

309
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,000
I guess we'll have fine weather tomorrow.

310
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,480
Oh right, have you heard?

311
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,960
A comet named Neo

312
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,600
will pass by

313
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,520
Earth soon.

314
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,760
Experts say that

315
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,360
if we miss it this time,

316
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,590
it'll only come again

317
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,720
6,000 years from now.

318
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,510
That sounds romantic.

319
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,390
There must be something special on Earth

320
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,390
that it cares about,

321
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,550
that is why it has to come back

322
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,910
to Earth again after 6,000 years.

323
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,720
It's just a cosmic phenomenon.

324
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,480
There are also many comets

325
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,150
that pass through the solar system

326
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,550
once and never return.

327
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,000
Simply passing by and going into

328
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
the depths of the universe.

329
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,200
This is just

330
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,080
the trajectory of the comet.

331
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,670
You know nothing.

332
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,520
This is

333
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,270
the trajectory of love.

334
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,400
No way.

335
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,070
Could that be the comet

336
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,600
you were just talking about?

337
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,710
It could be.

338
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,590
Make a wish, make a wish.

339
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,040
I don't care.

340
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,920
Make a wish first, make a wish first.

341
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,830
Hurry.

342
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,710
Sorry.

343
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,000
Did I interrupt you?

344
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,670
Sorry for interrupting.

345
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,750
No, no.

346
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,790
You didn't interrupt anything.

347
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,400
You have a flashlight.

348
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,480
I need to use the bathroom.

349
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,750
You carry on.

350
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,190
Let's go.

351
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,670
Are you seriously using me as a third wheel?

352
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,640
What...

353
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,240
Oh, Xu Xiao Dong,

354
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,000
serve you right.

355
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,550
Now you know how it feels to get interrupted.

356
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,320
You even lit a small lamp.

357
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,510
That's quite romantic.

358
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,520
It's to keep away mosquitoes.

359
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,640
Keep away mosquitoes?

360
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,590
Wait up.

361
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,070
Chu Xia,

362
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,630
there are a lot of mosquitoes inside, look.

363
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:53,760
Check if there's any mosquito spray

364
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,640
in the bag.

365
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,520
What should I do?

366
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,240
Mosquito spray.

367
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,200
Let me see if they have brought it.

368
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,080
What is this?

369
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,680
I didn't find any mosquito spray,

370
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,160
but I found two bottles of pepper spray.

371
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,790
Jin Xiao Rui!

372
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,480
Jin Xiao Rui.

373
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,520
What's wrong?

374
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,349
Why did you bring

375
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,480
pepper spray?

376
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,349
What's wrong with pepper spray?

377
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,349
Boys need to

378
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,640
protect themselves too.

379
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,790
Are you going to eat me?

380
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,800
Jin Xiao Rui, you're so gross.

381
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,110
How can you be so shameless?

382
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,910
What are you doing?

383
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,000
There are a lot of mosquitoes inside.

384
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm sacrificing myself to feed the mosquitoes.

385
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,840
So that mosquitoes

386
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,750
won't bite Yuan Yuan.

387
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,720
Is there any scientific basis for this?

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
It'll work if you believe in it.

389
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,830
It'll work if I believe in it?

390
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,480
Is there any scientific basis for this?

391
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,720
It'll work if you believe in it.

392
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,550
Xiao Dong,

393
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,200
tell me,

394
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,550
does this count as we are offering blood?

395
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,030
What are you talking about?

396
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,070
We are offering love.

397
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,520
What's wrong with your hand?

398
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,520
Nothing.

399
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,200
How are you feeling?

400
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
Did you sleep well last night?

401
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,550
It was alright.

402
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,030
Zhao Yao Yang showed up.

403
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,270
Let's go.

404
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,150
Mr Zhao.

405
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,430
Are you

406
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,510
the assistant of Mr Wei?

407
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,590
What are you doing here?

408
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Mr Wei would like to

409
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,350
talk to you alone.

410
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,030
Please come with me.

411
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,110
I've said everything I needed to.

412
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,190
You guys should go.

413
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,640
I'm sorry for this then.

414
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,110
What's going on?

415
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,350
Seize him!

416
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,800
Let's go.

417
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,470
Come on.

418
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,350
Stop!

419
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,590
Stop!

420
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Stop!

421
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,800
Let's go.

422
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,280
Let's go.

423
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,030
Stop!

424
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,070
-Stop!
-Stop there!

425
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,040
Stop!

426
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,680
I didn't expect

427
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,000
you'd be the one who saved me.

428
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,360
Thank you.

429
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,310
Save your thanks.

430
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,270
I need to ask you about something.

431
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,400
Did I steal the

432
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,750
patent certificate for you back then?

433
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,150
You?

434
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,590
Plus the memorial service,

435
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,070
this is only the second time I met you.

436
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,550
How could it be you?

437
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,640
Who was it then?

438
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,880
Are you still not going

439
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,760
to tell the truth?

440
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,240
Fine.

441
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,470
For the sake that

442
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,440
you saved me today,

443
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,480
I'll tell you.

444
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,270
It was

445
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,680
a woman named Gu Xiao Qi.

446
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,880
Gu Xiao Qi?

447
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,310
Do you know her?

448
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,000
She was my dad's secretary.

449
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,920
His right-hand-woman in the company.

450
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,920
Why would a right-hand woman do that?

451
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,910
About this,

452
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,640
you will have to

453
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,750
ask Wei Xuan He.

454
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,680
He will tell you everything.

455
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,790
Wei Xuan He?

456
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,480
Let me see.

457
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,830
So much blood.

458
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,230
We're going to the hospital.

459
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,110
Come on.

460
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:15,800
Doctor,

461
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,240
isn't his wound a little deep?

462
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,590
It's fine, it's just a minor injury.

463
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,590
It's nothing serious.

464
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
What do you mean by nothing serious?

465
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,960
Your wound

466
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,440
requires at least twelve stitches.

467
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,200
And you need a tetanus shot.

468
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,640
You're being dramatic.

469
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,880
It's not necessary.

470
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,600
Don't worry, I'm fine.

471
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,480
What do you mean "not necessary?”

472
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,920
Come, get ready for suturing.

473
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,440
Sorry, Mr Wei.

474
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,270
We lost Zhao Yao Yang.

475
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,030
And we saw

476
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,110
Lei Chu Xia and Xu Xiao Dong.

477
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,510
We can't find out

478
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,440
their whereabouts now.

479
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,510
A bunch of losers.

480
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Scram!

481
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,160
Did you not hear what I said?

482
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,480
I said scram.

483
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,720
You're here.

484
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,710
Have a seat.

485
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,590
Who is Gu Xiao Qi?

486
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,160
You met Zhao Yao Yang, didn't you?

487
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Nothing he said was true.

488
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,480
But Gu Xiao Qi is real, isn't it?

489
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,960
You're still lying to me at this point.

490
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,590
You were the one who colluded with other people

491
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,360
and stole the patent certificate.

492
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,270
Yet you're pinning it on me now.

493
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,230
Was there anything

494
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,110
you said that was true?

495
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,440
You still don't trust me.

496
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,640
Why do you always

497
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,590
take sides against me?

498
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,270
You are still doing that even now.

499
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,550
Is it hard to tell the truth?

500
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,440
What is the truth?

501
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
What is the evidence?

502
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,790
Do you have any evidence?

503
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,830
If you don't,

504
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,680
then there is no truth.

505
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,000
[Cyber Tech]

506
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,550
Yuan Yuan.

507
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,160
Chu Xia, where are you?

508
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,750
Why didn't you answer your phone?

509
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,070
I came here to see Wei Xuan He.

510
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,790
All the leads are gone.

511
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:30,990
Did Wei Xuan He

512
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,200
tell you anything?

513
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:32,840
I only know there was a girl

514
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,000
named Gu Xiao Qi.

515
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,110
Gu Xiao Qi?

516
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,000
What?

517
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,390
Do you know her?

518
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,160
Not only do I know her,

519
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you know her too.

520
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,720
[I know Gu Xiao Qi too?]

521
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,720
[Who is she?]

522
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
[Where will]

523
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,960
[fate lead me to this time?]

524
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,070
This is the machine that

525
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,070
can make Lei Chu Xia disappear?

526
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,960
At least I managed

527
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,440
to bring Lei Chu Xia

528
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,350
back to this dimension last time.

529
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,960
If I want her to disappear again,

530
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,070
can you do that?

531
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,920
The machine has some problems now.

532
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,590
I need some time.

533
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,880
Also,

534
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,440
the bracelet Professor Chen gave her

535
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,270
has stabilized

536
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,830
her magnetic field in this dimension.

537
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,400
I can no longer control

538
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,070
the energy in her from a distance.

539
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,200
I can give you time.

540
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,200
You just need to fix this.

541
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,760
I'll take care of

542
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,350
the rest.

543
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,680
It's a deal.

544
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,910
Mr Wei,

545
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,160
I think there's something you should know.

546
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,590
Without

547
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,110
Professor Chen's bracelet,

548
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,680
I can't ensure that Lei Chu Xia

549
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,000
will return to her original dimension,

550
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,720
and there is a possibility that

551
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,640
she will dissipate into the universe.

552
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,920
You don't need to worry about that.

553
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,920
We'll leave it to the universe.

554
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,040
[Chu Xia,]

555
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,200
[you leave me no choice.]

556
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,880
Haven't I already seen all of these?

557
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,960
No, I'm asking you to look at these.

558
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,350
Do you remember

559
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,400
the last time you

560
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,790
saw these pictures, you asked me

561
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,270
why was a part of this photo cut off?

562
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,150
Yes.

563
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,750
Because the person who was cut out

564
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
is Gu Xiao Qi.

565
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,640
The three of us were good friends

566
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,480
for four years in college.

567
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,240
And in those four years,

568
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,510
you and her were close.

569
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,590
After graduation,

570
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,160
you two

571
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,590
shared a place for a while.

572
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,000
Why haven't you mentioned this before?

What did she owe you?

764
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,390
Ask her.

I owe you, I owe you.

766

It's not for you.

What do you think?

770
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,920
Don't you think it's too corny?

771
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,190
You've confessed in a western way,

772
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,320
you've tried that,

773
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,990
but did he get it?

774
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,000
He didn't get it at all.

775
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,710
If he doesn't get it,

776
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,360
after

777
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,360
you use such a direct way,

778
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,000
then he's just an idiot.

779
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,240

Why did you have to mess it up?

783
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,230

Stop, stop, stop.

Are you going to say it or not?

789
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,200
I really didn't know

790
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,190
you were trying to confess.

791
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,240
We've exhausted

all methods now.

Tell me what more we can do.

794
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,070
You could ask me.

795
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,240

Listen, Chu Xia,

800
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,190
if you want him to accept your love confession,

801
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
you need to cater to his liking.

802
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,760
Cater to his liking?

803
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,830

What's wrong?

818
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,240
Nothing.

You've been acting weird today.

You didn't do something wrong,

821

did you?

822
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,990
No.

00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,190
What could I possibly do wrong?

You've given it to me.

I won't take it back, I won't take it back.

if Jin Xiao Rui wants to go?
