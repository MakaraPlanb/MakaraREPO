let go of the past

About ten years ago and Xu Wei Yi,

259
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,200
there are some things I have to tell you.

260
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,960
Certain things

261
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,750
are not what they seem.

262
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,480
Chu Xia,

263
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,270
since you disappeared ten years ago,

264
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,830
apart from the fact that your whereabouts were unknown,

265
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,030
do you know what

266
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,910
worried me most?

267
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,480
What?

268
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,750
At the cliff you fell off,

269
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,270
I couldn't find the patent certificate,

270
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,550
but I watched you

271
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,960
fall down with it.

272
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,680
After that, I couldn't even find

273
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,310
a piece of paper down there.

274
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,590
But recently,

275
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,720
I've figured something out again.

276
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,720
I know where the patent certificate is.

277
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,550
Where is it?

278
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
You're too anxious.

279
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,350
I know you're looking for the patent certificate,

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,070
but like me,

281
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,550
you've gotten nowhere.

282
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,270
But has it ever occurred to you that

283
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
the reason why you can't find it is

284
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,750
because the patent certificate

285
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
doesn't exist

286
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,920
in this dimension?

287
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,520

290
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,680
It's a trap, as I expected.

291
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,590
Give me the bracelet!

292
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,390

380
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Mr Xu is away on a business trip.

381
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,480
He's not in the office right now.

382
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,670
I have something very important to tell him,

383
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,720
I need to talk to him now.

384
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,270
Can you get a hold of him for me?

385
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,310
Oh,

386
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,070
Mr Xu is in a business meeting,

387
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,320
it's inappropriate to

388
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,550
interrupt his meeting.

389
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,800
Please,

390
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,350
this is really important.

391
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,720
How about you make a call for me?

392
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,190
Alright.

393
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,310
I'll call him for you.

394
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,720
Thank you.

395
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,270
Nice doing business with you.

396
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,670
Hello.

397
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,640
Hi, Ms Gu.

398
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,110
I'm the front desk receptionist.

399
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,710
A lady said

400
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,590
she has some really important matters

401
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,640
to tell Mr Xu.

402
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,440
She needs to talk to him now.

403
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,390
Mr Xu,

404
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,720
your call.

405
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,800
Mr Xu is waiting for you

406
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,920
at the other end of the phone.

407
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,350
Thank you.

408
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
Hello, Hi.

409
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,670
Hi.

410
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,230
Is this Mr Xu,

411
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,110
Xu Wei Yi?

412
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,480
Yes, Xu Wei Yi speaking.

413
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,030
Mr Xu,

414
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,200
I finally found you.

415
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,510
Calm down, talk slowly.

416
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,720
Mr Xu, hi.

417
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,480
I'm Lei Chu Xia.

418
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,670
I hope

419
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
you can trust me

420
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,160
in everything I tell you next.

421
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,680
Okay, Ms Lei Chu Xia.

422
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,830
I promise you that I'll try.

423
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,920
Lei Chu Xia?

424
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,440
What's the matter, Gu Xiao Qi?

425
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,440
You know her?

426
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,550
Chu Xia is my best friend from college.

427
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,030
I came on this business trip in a hurry,

428
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,310
I didn't have time to tell her.

429
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,880
Plus, my phone is out of battery.

430
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,990
I didn't expect

431
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,320
she would call you.

432
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,510
Excuse me, Mr Xu,

433
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,430
may I take this call

434
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,080
outside?

435
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,960
Go on.

436
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,270
Don't, Mr Xu. No.

437
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,720
Lei Chu Xia,

438
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,680
what are you trying to do?

439
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,240
You must be Gu Xiao Qi, right?

440
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,880
Why did you do such

441
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,720
an immoral thing with Wei Xuan He?

442
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,120
If you confess

443
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,710
to Mr Xu now,

444
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,000
it's still not too late.

445
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,990
Chu Xia,

446
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,030
you've been saying

447
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,160
things that don't make sense lately.

448
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,030
I don't understand at all.

449
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,520
Besides,

450
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,470
you're defaming me.

451
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,350
Do you have any proof?

452
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,550
The reason I'm helping Wei Xuan He,

453
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,640
don't you already

454
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,350
know the answer in your heart?

455
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,040
Hello?

456
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,910
Hello?

457
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Ma'am, please have some water.

458
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,870
Thank you.

459
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,030
Gu Xiao Qi will do

460
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,640
something that harms Mr Xu.

461
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,640
You have to help me.

462
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,800
Gu Xiao Qi is Mr Xu's

463
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
most trusted person.

464
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,080
She's the most competent board secretary

465
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,510
of our company.

466
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,240
There's no way she will harm Mr Xu.

467
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,310
You have to trust me.

468
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm talking about

469
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
the future that will happen

470
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,830
soon.

471
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
You can see the future?

472
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,480
Ma'am, are you alright?

473
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,240
Do you need me to call a doctor for you?

474
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,590
I'm fine, I'm fine.

475
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,920
I knew no one would trust me.

476
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,390
How about this?

477
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,190
Give me

478
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,270
Mr Xu's private number.

479
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,510
I'm not at liberty to tell

480
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,590
an outsider Mr Xu's private number.

481
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,560
I'm not an outsider.

482
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,440
I

483
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,590
may be, possibly, could be

484
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,960
his future daughter-in-law.

485
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,400
What?

486
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,350
Who's my wife?

487
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
[Wei Yi Tech]

488
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,440
Love is sweet, sweet and sad.

489
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,310
A bachelor doesn't need love.

490
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,160
Xiao Dong, what are you doing here?

491
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,720
Don't you have school today?

492
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm out of game coins.

493
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,950
I want to get a new avatar.

494
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,160
Hurry up and go get me some money.

495
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,190
Your dad still has something

496
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,070
he wants to give you.

497
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,750
Non-mainstream.

498
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,400
[Wei Yi Tech]

499
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,830
Look up to the sky at 45 degrees,

500
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,110
so that your tears don't fall.

501
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,510
You're the one who wanted to be my wife?

502
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,110
I don't deserve you.

503
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,400
Don't get infatuated with me.

504
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,150
I'm just a legend.

505
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,400
Do you know me?

506
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,480
Woman,

507
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,550
let me see your face.

508
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,920
Let me see if there is the possibility of transformation.

509
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,160
Don't be shy.

510
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,080
Go away, go away.

511
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Maybe you have potential.

512
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,400
Non-mainstream, non-mainstream.

513
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,720
Let me see, let me see.

514
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,920
The old lady hit me!

515
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,240
The old lady hit me!

516
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,120
The old lady hit me!

517
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,160
Who are you calling "old lady?" I'm a fairy.

518
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,470
My head hurts.

519
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,550
My heart hurts, I'm going to die.

520
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,190
Call 120.

521
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:51,670
She looked

522
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,880
just like the older girl

523
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,310
I met before.

524
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,950
And she called herself

525
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,030
the old fairy lady.

526
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,230
That

527
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,230
old fairy lady

528
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,110
said the same thing before.

529
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,230
She said something like this

530
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,270
to encourage me.

531
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,640
The old fairy lady turns out to be me.

532
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,640
Help!

533
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,920
Someone hit me!

534
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,670
An old lady hit me!

535
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,640
Cut it out.

536
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,320
I'm telling you,

537
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,030
if you hadn't stopped me,

538
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,910
I would've...

539
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,920
Mr Xu fixed the handheld.

540
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,920
He asked me to pass it to you.

541
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,840
He said

542
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,030
he would go home immediately after the meeting

543
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,920
to finish the level with you.

544
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,080
As for your pocket money,

545
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,750
Mr Xu said

546
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,710
think of it as the payment

547
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,590
for fixing the handheld.

548
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,270
So that means no money for me.

549
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,590
Stop lying, I don't believe him.

550
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,590
How many times has he said that?

551
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,920
Has he ever kept his promise?

552
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,190
Work comes first.

553
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,310
That's what he said.

554
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,310
He doesn't care about me at all.

555
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,790
Stop pretending to be a good father.

556
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,080
He said he cared about me?

557
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,310
To hell with that.

558
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,310
He actually does care about you.

559
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,550
What does that have to do with you?

560
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,000
You're everywhere.

561
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,840
What is her position?

562
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,670
Fire her.

563
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,470
This lady doesn't

564
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,320
work for us.

565
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,190
Ignore him, ignore him.

566
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,070
Leave it to me.

567
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,430
I have

568
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,070
a playboy that I grew up playing.

569
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,270
My dad

570
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,160
carved some words on it for me.

571
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,200
What are those words?

572
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,510
To Xiao Dong, my son.

573
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,360
[To Xiao Dong, my son]

574
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,800
What are you doing?

575
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,070
See it yourself.

576
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,240
[To Xiao Dong, my son]

577
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,400
But at that time,

578
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,310
I was rebellious and immature.

579
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,550
I always caused him trouble.

580
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,200
Hang on,

581
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,550
how did you know?

582
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,430
Let me see...

583
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,120
Xiao Dong,

584
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,750
your teacher just called and

585
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,240
said you skipped class again today.

586
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,710
Nobles don't attend classes.

587
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,640
That's normal, isn't it?

588
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Non-mainstream.

589
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,320
Is that an ear stud?

590
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,880
Let go.

591
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,670
Is that an ear stud?

592
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,550
Ouch! Ouch!

593
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,630
Let go!

594
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,590
Give me my wig back!

595
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,350
Stop her!

596
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,160
Give me my wig back!

597
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,550
I'm going to teach you a lesson for your father.

598
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,350
You break my wings, I will destroy your paradise.

599
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,680
We're here, this is the place.

600
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,870
Ouch.

601
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,600
Ouch.

602
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,640
Let go.

603
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Ouch.

604
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,160
Go in.

605
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,990
It really hurts.

606
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,870
Open the door.

607
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,630
I don't have the key.

608
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,070
Open the door.

609
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,590
I don't have the key.

610
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Xiao Dong.

611
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,870
Aunt.

612
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,270
You know my aunt?

613
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,200
-No.
-Xiao Dong,

614
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,790
this is the girl

615
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,440
who took you home, right?

616
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,830
I heard it from the front desk.

617
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,440
It was you who took Xiao Dong home.

618
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,440
Thank you.

619
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,880
Why do you keep blocking your face

620
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,830
with your scarf?

621
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,270
Is it because you can't be seen?

622
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,270
Her face got acne.

623
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,550
Don't talk nonsense, kid.

624
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,590
When your dad comes home, remember to tell me.

625
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,469
I have something important

626
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,350
I need to tell him.

627
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,360
Do you have a pen and paper?

628
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,389
Yes.

629
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,800
Call this number.

630
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Ask your dad to be careful of Piggy Tech.

631
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,320
See you next time.

632
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
There will be no next time.

633
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
It's not up to you,

634
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,190
it's up to the universe.

635
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,679
Thank you.

636
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,710
Thank you.

637
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,600
Aunt,

638
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,949
not every adult is

639
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,920
as smart as my dad,

640
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,800
right?

641
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,360
You brat.

642
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,440
And you,

643
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,400
your teacher called again.

644
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,710
Did you skip class?

645
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,429
I couldn't reach Brother-in-law on his phone.

646
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,440
You had me worried sick.

647
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,030
Are you not going to

648
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:57,590
listen to me?

649
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,110
No matter what I say?

650
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,510
Anyway...

651
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,070
It's fine that you don't listen to me,

652
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,630
my sister is watching you from heaven.

653
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,480
Adults are so nagging.

654
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,830
Xiao Dong.

655
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,870
This kid.

656
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,720
[Looks like]

657
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,070
[the idea of telling Uncle Xu]

658
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,840
[in advance]

659
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,720
[is hard to pull off.]

660
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,760
[What can]

661
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,070
[I do next?]

662
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,510
[Who else can I get to help me?]

663
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,840
Summer Time.

664
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,120
Chu Xia,

665
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,590
didn't you say you were resting at home?

666
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,590
Why are you here?

667
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,920
Yuan Yuan?

668
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,920
What's going on with your face?

669
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,630
Can you tell I've lost weight?

670
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,990
I lost another

671
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,800
0.1 kg this morning.

672
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,960
[I remember it now.]

673
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,550
[Yuan Yuan had a chubby face back then.]

674
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,400
Hang on,

675
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,320
where did you find

676
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:14,950
such an ancient photo?

677
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,830
Alright now.

678
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,470
You seem thinner, thinner.

679
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,480
It's quite obvious.

680
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,030
Do you think

681
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,550
I should lose more weight?

682
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,510
Maybe I should get a V-Line surgery.

683
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,670
Are you insane?

684
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,920
Listen to me,

685
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,630
your ex-boyfriends

686
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,430
were blind.

687
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,280
Don't mind them.

688
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,630
You should feel lucky

689
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,470
because you get to

690
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,440
meet a better man, don't you think so?

691
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,760
Because

692
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,480
you're my best friend,

693
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,230
that's why you said that to console me.

694
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,000
Don't say that.

695
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,230
In the matter of loving you,

696
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,760
anything I say is the truth.

697
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,550
Anyway,

698
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,190
I already read your fortune.

699
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,000
You will have a good boyfriend

700
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,150
who is obedient and

701
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,200
will do whatever you say

702
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,080
in the future.

703
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,720
Master,

704
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,000
tell me more.

705
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,320
When will I meet him?

706
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,280
Ten years later.

707
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,030
Ten years later?

708
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,280
I...

709
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,240
I'll be 32 years old

710
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,110
in ten years.

711
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,030
Don't tell me it's a May-December romance.

712
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
What's wrong with May-December romance?

713
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,840
Check, please.

714
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,240
Go, go.

715
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,590
What's the fun

716
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,510
in dating a younger man?

717
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,320
Well, you have to give it a try, right?

718
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,550
18 yuan.

719
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,710
Pack it up.

720
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
I took 20 yuan,

721
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,280
give you 2 yuan for change.

722
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,990
Thank you.

723
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,280
Please come again.

724
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,240
Yuan Yuan,

725
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,920
have I told you

726
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,510
anything lately?

727
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,960
What do you mean?

728
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,280
Like about Wei Xuan He.

729
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,920
You mean your wedding?

730
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,630
You talk about it every day.

731
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,030
Besides the wedding.

732
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Such as,

733
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,360
is there anything about me

734
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,630
that seems off?

735
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,760
You seem off to me

736
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,030
right now.

737
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,510
I'm serious.

738
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,150
Let's get serious then.

739
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,280
When exactly are you going

740
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,880
to move all your stuff over?

741
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,510
What stuff?

742
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,920
Your stuff at

743
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,150
Gu Xiao Qi's place.

744
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,070
Why would I put my stuff at her place?

745
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,280
Lei Chu Xia,

746
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,150
Have you lost your memory?

747
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,880
Since graduation,

748
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,030
you've been sharing a place

749
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,360
with Gu Xiao Qi.

750
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,670
That's why you packed your stuff

751
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,190
because you are moving out.

752
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,200
Don't you remember?

753
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,670
You even got the keys out.

754
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,230
Aren't these the keys?

755
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,080
Right?

756
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,510
I remember now.

757
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,150
Thank you, thank you.

758
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,160
I have to go now.

759
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,550
Where are you going?

760
