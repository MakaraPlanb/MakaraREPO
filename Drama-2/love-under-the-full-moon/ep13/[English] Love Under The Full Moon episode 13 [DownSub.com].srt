[Will I fall off the cliff again
because of him?]

381
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,870
If you ask me,

382
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,510
there is no need for you
to get married in a rush.

383
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,800
Summer Time

384
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,290
has only been set up for a few months.

385
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,180
Chu Xia

386
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,920
should focus on

387
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,030
her career first.

388
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,160
Getting married will not affect her career.

389
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,870
Am I right?

390
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,070
Chu Xia and Xuan He

391
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,040
have been in a relationship

392
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,840
since they were in university.

393
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,360
It has been five years.

394
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,970
Starting a happy family

395
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,300
has always been Chu Xia's dream.

396
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,270
Am I right, Chu Xia?

397
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,360
Getting married?

398
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,510
I am not in a hurry.

399
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,270
I wish to keep you two company
for a longer time.

400
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,660
So, who was the one that wanted to get married

401
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,500
as soon as possible?

402
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,720
You are so in love with him.

403
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,480
Why did you

404
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,640
change your mind?

405
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,960
Did you two fight?

406
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,420
It's normal

407
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,690
to have argument.

408
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,750
I'm on your side.

409
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,830
Not long ago,

410
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,480
for the nonsensical wedding photography session,

411
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,630
you went on a strict diet.

412
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,510
You didn't even eat properly.

413
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,550
Here.

414
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,070
Have some meat.

415
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,880
You need some nutrient.

416
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,550
Are you working together to piss me off?

417
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,280
Is it?

418
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,260
Go get the door.

419
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,880
I am going.

420
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,990
Mr Lei.

421
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,310
Mr Lei.

422
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,270
Xuan He is here.

423
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,860
Xuan He, here you are.

424
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,030
Hurry up, take a seat.

425
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,630
Chu Xia.

426
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,090
Let me bring a pair of chopsticks for you.

427
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,920
We need to talk.

428
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,310
Chu Xia,

429
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,750
why don't you serve Xuan He?

430
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,640
Xuan He, take a seat.

431
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,400
It's okay.

432
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
I need to talk to Chu Xia.

433
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,460
Xuan He.

434
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,840
Here, take a seat. Take a seat.

435
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,110
Sure.

436
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,650
Xuan He.

437
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,510
Chu Xia said that

438
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,910
you joined Piggy Tech recently.

439
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,490
[Piggy Tech?]

440
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,000
[I think Xiao Dong mentioned it before.]

441
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,400
[That company stole the patent registered by]

442
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,950
[Xiao Dong's dad, Xu Wei Yi.]

443
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,170
It seems that

444
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,000
you are really capable.

445
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,400
That means Xuan He has

446
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,000
what they need the most,

447
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,480
which is his talent.

448
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,820
Chu Xia.

449
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,680
Why did you
tell your parents everything?

450
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Your parents

451
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,790
shouldn't be worrying about my work.

452
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,790
Well, I sought help from my friend

453
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,070
to hold the shares on behalf of me

454
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,150
in Piggy Tech.

455
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,150
It's no big deal as it's just a small share.

456
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,480
That means you are a sleeping shareholder.

457
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,400
It's quite risky.

458
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,650
[Sleeping shareholder?]

459
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,880
[Wei Xuan He,]

460
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,940
[what kind of deal did you enter
with Piggy Tech?]

461
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,830
It seems that

462
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,630
you really trust that friend.

463
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,030
It's just a deal of profit.

464
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
It doesn't involve trust or what not.

465
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,030
I'm doing all these

466
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,550
for our future.

467
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,510
I aspire to provide Chu Xia a better life.

468
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,390
Mr and Mrs Lei.

469
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,200
I really

470
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,720
need to talk to Chu Xia.

471
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,110
Go ahead.

472
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,390
Before getting married,

473
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,200
you surely have many things

474
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,340
to discuss with each other.

475
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,200
Go on.

476
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,800
Chu Xia.

477
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,730
Go.

478
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,600
Let's go.

479
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,530
Go ahead.

480
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,330
Stop sulking.

481
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,700
Where did you keep the document?

482
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,770
What document?

483
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,850
Chu Xia.

484
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,180
Don't do silly things in the name of love.

485
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,200
Not only will you ruin me,

486
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,360
you will ruin our future too.

487
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,170
Please.

488
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,790
If that document

489
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,300
is really important to you,

490
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,340
why didn't you keep it properly?

491
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,410
What do you mean?

492
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,360
Are you not going to give it to me?

493
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,440
I will look for it.

494
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,970
So, the memory was true.

495
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,370
Hello.

496
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,950
What did you say?

497
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,530
Chu Xia.

498
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,370
No matter what you decide,

499
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,550
think about our relationship.

500
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,090
I am doing this

501
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,620
for both of us.

502
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,520
What document is he looking for?

503
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,110
If my memory serves me right,

504
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,890
then everything

505
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,890
will repeat itself
in accordance with the destined trajectory.

506
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,640
[Your parents said that]

507
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,790
[on that night,]

508
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,510
[about 7.30 p.m.,

509
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,910
you left home all of a sudden

510
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,940
and disappeared.

511
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,200
We didn't hear from you again.

512
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,880
[About 7.30 p.m.?]

513
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,300
[Why did I leave home all of a sudden?]

514
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,610
Did you fight with him?

515
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,790
I could tell that

516
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,270
Xuan He was not in a good mood

517
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,350
when he left.

518
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,870
Is it a misunderstanding?

519
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,750
You just have to explain to him.

520
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,830
It's still not too late to catch up with him.

521
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,760
No way.

522
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,070
Why should my daughter

523
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
chase after him?

524
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,440
No matter who is at fault,

525
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,880
Wei Xuan He

526
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,870
has to be the one who apologises first.

527
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,170
Senior Lei is right.

528
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,070
No matter what,

529
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,190
I won't leave home today.

530
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,030
Look at you!

531
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,960
You are adding oil to the fire!

532
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,690
To get along with your partner,

533
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,880
you need to be wise. Got it?

534
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,480
Go get the dishes done. Go.

535
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,910
[No matter what happens,]

536
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
[I won't leave the house.]

537
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,880
[I must not disappear for another ten years.]

538
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,300
[It will break my parent's heart
for a second time.]

539
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,130
[July 23, 2021]

540
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,370
I want all the news coverage

541
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,450
on Xu Wei Yi's death.

542
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,560
I want it now.

543
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,270
[Chu Xia.]

544
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,110
[Believe it or not,]

545
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,510
[even until the last moment,]

546
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,160
[I had never thought of hurting you.]

547
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,830
[No matter where are you now
in the universe,]

548
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,800
[just don't reappear before me.]

549
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,740
[Let's respect]

550
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,550
[the will of the universe.]

551
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,540
[Let's put an end to it.]

552
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,000
Chu Xia!

553
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,440
Chu Xia!

554
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,750
[Unable to detect Chu Xia's signal.]

555
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,070
[Unable to connect to Turing.]

556
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,270
[Unable to locate Lei Chu Xia.]

557
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,710
Mr Wei.

558
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,780
This is the document that you asked for.

559
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,570
Mr Wei.

560
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
Someone is waiting for you.

561
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,590
Ms Qin came to the office today

562
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,590
looking for you.

563
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,620
However, I didn't tell her your schedule.

564
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,350
When did that happen?

565
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,480
Quite some time ago.

566
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,920
Okay.

567
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,780
Next time,

568
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,920
send me a message.

569
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,350
Sure, Mr Wei.

570
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,520
What's wrong?

571
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,420
Nothing.

572
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,530
You just seem a little different from before.

573
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,400
You may leave now.

574
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,100
Xuan He.

575
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
You are back.

576
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,220
I cooked for you.

577
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,470
Let's go inside.

578
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,510
I won't necessarily come back here.

579
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,630
You might not get hold of me

580
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,070
if you wait here.

581
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,470
It's okay.

582
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,750
I'm experienced in this.

583
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,400
If you still don't come back

584
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,310
in an hour,

585
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
I will wait for you in the office.

586
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,740
If I can't find you in the office,

587
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,050
I will go to the other places

588
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,170
where you usually frequent.

589
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,310
No matter what,

590
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,370
I will surely find you somewhere.

591
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,200
Listen.

592
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,170
Waiting for you is my hidden talent.

593
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,690
Is your effort

594
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,030
worth it?

595
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,430
You mean the dishes?

596
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,260
I can finish it.

597
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,440
I am incredible.

598
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,240
You know what I am trying to say.

599
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,980
Actually...

600
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,880
Xuan He.

601
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,780
Stop talking.

602
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,270
I like you.

603
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,020
That's why

604
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,880
when I know that you have feelings
for someone else,

605
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,850
I am unable to keep my emotion at bay.

606
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,620
However, it doesn't affect my love for you.

607
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,410
I will continue loving you.

608
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,070
I will keep loving you

609
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,230
until your feelings for others are gone.

610
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,440
I think by that time,

611
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,510
I would've mastered
the art of controlling my bad temper.

612
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,160
Hence, for the time being,

613
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,620
please show me the way, Mr Wei.

614
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,860
I will work hard

615
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,900
to get rid of my bad temper.

616
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,660
However,

617
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,030
you have to work hard too.

618
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,480
Please work harder

619
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,550
to get rid of the feelings for someone else.

620
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,870
Okay?

621
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,830
Let's go home.

622
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,790
There is a bench not far away.

623
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,840
Let's take a break.

624
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,530
Here.

625
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:14,860
Slowly.

626
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,830
Show me your leg.

627
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,760
It's scrapped.

628
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,030
Can you walk?

629
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,870
It's okay.

630
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,679
I knew it. Something bad always happen

631
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,690
when Chu Xia goes out with Wei Xuan He.

632
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,230
Ten years ago...

633
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,719
Ten years ago,

634
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,290
Chu Xia had a fight with him.

635
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,460
Then, all of a sudden,

636
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,840
she disappeared for ten years.

637
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,969
The same thing happened again.

638
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,440
She said that

639
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,670
she was going for psychological counselling.

640
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,030
Then, she disappeared all of a sudden again.

641
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,630
If I can't find Chu Xia,

642
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,320
I won't spare him.

643
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,460
We have searched everywhere for her around here.

644
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,840
But we couldn't find her anywhere.

645
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,350
We can't reach her by phone too.

646
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,070
Chu Xia is always associated
with paranormal phenomenons.

647
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,440
Is it possible that

648
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
she has left this world

649
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,360
and travelled to another time and space?

650
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,560
No way.

651
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,480
No way!

652
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,150
What if

653
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,800
her magnetic field became unstable temporarily?

654
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,720
What if she was transported to another city?

655
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,980
What if she lost her memories

656
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,320
and forgot us?

657
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,710
She might have

658
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,980
brushed past us last night

659
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,840
but she couldn't recognize us.

660
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,230
We must

661
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,340
find Chu Xia now.

662
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,880
We must not

663
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,040
leave her alone.

664
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,160
We must look for her.

665
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,030
Slow down.

666
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,840
Let me help you.

667
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,060
Xiao Dong.

668
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,090
Xiao Dong!

669
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,550
-Xiao Dong!

Have you found Chu Xia?

673
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,840
Have you found her?

674
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:57,980
No.

675
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,550
Have you found her?

676
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,660
Yuan Yuan.

677
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,130
Xiao Rui.

678
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,480
Take Yuan Yuan back for a rest.

679
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,710
I will look around for her.

680
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,790
No, I don't want to go back.

681
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,000
I want to look for her too.

682
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,830
No way.

683
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,230
I will feel more guilty

684
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,710
if you come along.

685
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,000
We should go back together.

686
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,320
Don't be stubborn.

687
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,190
Xiao Dong,

688
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,070
if you are worn out,

689
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,320

690
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,980

691
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,910

692
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,230
you would look after Summer Time?

693
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,640

695
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,510

758
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,790
show it to your mum.

759
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,440
If your mum knows that
you cleared yet another level,

760
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,230
I'm sure she will be very happy.

761
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,130
Dad, if you want to cheer mum up,

762
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,210
why don't you

763
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,490
show it to mum by yourself?

764
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,240
That's because

765
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,970
I know that

766
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,390
your mum enjoys watching you play the game.

767
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,850
If she knows that

768
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,080
you have become so good at playing the game,

769
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,710
she will surely feel more happy

770
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,880
than watching me play.

771
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,900
Is it?

772
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,780
So, this is

773
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,600
how you cheer mum up.

774
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,710
No wonder you taught me how to play the game.

775
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,710
You knew how to play the game
in the first place.

776
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,450
I didn't know how to play at first.

777
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,790
However,

778
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,010
the moment I saw your mum,

779
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,150
I knew that

780
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,410
it was

781
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,680
a magical power that would only appear

782
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,990
when you meet someone you like

783
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,110
and it would make you invincible!

784
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,920
When you grow up,

785
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,460
you will experience it.

786
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,550
So, this is

787
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,850
how you feel when you possess magical power.

788
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,660
Yes.

789
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,890
This is the feeling of possessing magical power.

790
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,760
Dad.

791
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,290
I think

792
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,710
I'm experiencing the feeling

793
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,990
of possessing magical power.

794
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,810
Turing.

795
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,410
Take the studio,

796
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,660
Summer Time,

797
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,340
Lei residence

798
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,810
and Tongcheng University

799
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,370
Back Mountain as reference,

800
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,340
re-plan the route for me.

801
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,590
Besides that,

802
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,410
maintain the request

803
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,360
to establish a connection

804
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,740
with Chu Xia's location data.

805
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,670
[Okay, Xiao Dong.]
