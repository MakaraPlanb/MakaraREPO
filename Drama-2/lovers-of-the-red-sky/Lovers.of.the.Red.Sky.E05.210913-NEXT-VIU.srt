(This drama is fictional and people or stories are not tied to reality.)

2
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:20,561
Is this the line?

3
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:24,601
- You may go inside. - Thanks.

4
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:28,346
I'm Hong Cheon Gi of Baekyu Painters Society.

5
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:30,472
Hong Cheon Gi of Baekyu Painters Society.

6
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:32,241
Look who this is.

7
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,212
It's Painter Hong.

8
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:36,315
Darn it.

9
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:39,322
We need to square everything first.

10
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:45,696
How can you assault a lady in the middle of the day?

11
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,196
Where are your senses?

12
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:50,061
- What's he doing? - That's impossible.

13
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:53,432
Be quiet, all of you! What do you know anyway?

14
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:57,171
Hey, you.

15
00:00:57,337 --> 00:00:58,701
Are you really a painter?

16
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:01,402
Show me your contest ID slip.

17
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:02,712
Yes, sure.

18
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:12,522
I think I left it.

19
00:01:13,126 --> 00:01:14,886
But I'm with Baekyu Painters Society.

20
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:16,726
I really am a painter. Please let me in.

21
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:20,065
Goodness, how can a woman be a painter?

22
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:22,095
You'll even make dogs laugh.

23
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:24,866
You can't go inside unless you have a contest ID slip.

24
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,806
Next person. Finish up quickly.

25
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:28,306
- Wait, but... - Hurry.

26
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:31,536
Let's go quietly while we're nice. Don't put up a fight.

27
00:01:31,537 --> 00:01:33,806
No, wait. Hey!

28
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,441
What do you think you're doing?

29
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:40,742
Let her go immediately.

30
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:43,381
The litter?

31
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:45,522
Scholar.

32
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,622
I see that you two are together.

33
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:51,965
Watch your mouth! He's...

34
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,092
Man soo.

35
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,135
Yes.

36
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:56,631
She's coming with me.

37
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:59,101
Says who? Come here.

38
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:12,011
You!

39
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,821
Darn it, you!

40
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,582
Are you all right?

41
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,011
Yes.

42
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,152
Scholar Ha, you're here.

43
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:57,655
- How dare you make a scene here? - Quiet!

44
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,996
This is Prince Yangmyeong's Maejukheon.

45
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:02,266
Get out of here! Go!

46
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,061
- Cheon Gi, I'll get you! - Get out of here!

47
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,571
Please come inside.

48
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,875
This woman is also participating in the contest.

49
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,571
I'm going in with her.

50
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,911
Yes, I understand.

51
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:20,712
See? I told you so.

52
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,056
Now, please hurry.

53
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:26,586
Take out your ID slip in advance.

54
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:27,725
- All right. - Line up, please.

55
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:31,221
(Episode 5: Maejukheon Painting Contest, Part One)

56
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:43,932
This is so amazing.

57
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:47,171
It's crowded like the central marketplace.

58
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:52,481
Anyway, what brings you to the painting contest?

59
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:55,041
I was invited by Prince Yangmyeong.

60
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:57,781
Oh, you were invited.

61
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:05,666
Well, he may have invited you here,

62
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,166
but where is his courtesy?

63
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,132
No one is here to escort you.

64
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:15,002
Never mind, I'll be your escort.

65
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,075
Then please help me out.

66
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:19,502
Sure. Trust me and follow me.

67
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:21,342
This way.

68
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:26,512
Right ahead of you. Be careful.

69
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:36,522
Anyway, Sir Scholar. How are you so good at using your body?

70
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:39,661
It was as if you could see.

71
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:42,262
No, even those who can see couldn't do what you did.

72
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:45,502
Are you a military officer?

73
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,762
I've been training since when I was young.

74
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,402
Let's just say I had a great teacher.

75
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,541
Anyway, you were the best.

76
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:01,111
How could I ever repay you?

77
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:04,152
Don't mention it. It was something I ought to do.

78
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:10,556
But still. Those men are the minions of Wolseongdang.

79
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:14,361
I don't want you to get in trouble because of me.

80
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:17,291
People say it's best to avoid fights.

81
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,801
I'll avoid them as much as I can, so don't worry.

82
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:24,272
But you have to be very, very careful.

83
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:32,712
It looks like this is where the guests are to sit.

84
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:35,142
And on the other side,

85
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,981
I'll be drawing out in this yard.

86
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:42,621
Is that so? I look forward to it.

87
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:46,291
I've never been to such a huge place before.

88
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:51,491
I've dreamt of this moment for quite a long time.

89
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:54,902
I'm sure you could win first place.

90
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:58,231
Sorry? Goodness, no way.

91
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:03,111
However, I'll do my best.

92
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:07,815
Then do paint in dashing spirit and see great results.

93
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,382
(Dashing spirit: Staying strong as one advances forward)

94
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:12,012
Come this way, please.

95
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:15,721
Thank you.

96
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:19,092
You have to keep your eyes on me.

97
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:22,765
I apologize.

98
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,161
It's all right. I'm used to it now.

99
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,801
Then please excuse me.

100
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,505
Where did she go? Where is she?

101
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:32,645
- She's over there. Come on. - Where? Oh.

102
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,202
Cheon Gi. Hey.

103
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,546
- Hey. - My gosh!

104
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,981
Why do you walk so quickly?

105
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:42,286
Goodness, you fool. When did you come? We were worried.

106
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:45,185
Hey! You two came into Maejukheon by yourselves.

107
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:47,125
What? You were worried? Please.

108
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,825
I met Jung Seon Rye on the way and almost died.

109
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,952
- What? - What?

110
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,291
You met that guy?

111
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,895
How did he get released so quickly?

112
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:56,996
No idea.

113
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:59,036
So? And?

114
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:02,572
What do you mean? I ran away as best I could.

115
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:05,772
Anyway, we should stay vigilant when we walk around at night.

116
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:09,275
Man, then everything we did, we did in vain?

117
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:10,945
My gosh, I can't believe it.

118
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:12,712
He looks familiar.

119
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,652
Hey, forget them.

120
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,716
Let's grab our seats.

121
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:19,955
Okay. We can talk about this later.

122
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,726
Let's grab our seats.

123
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:23,226
You haven't found seats for us?

124
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:26,192
- We went looking for you! - We had no time to get seats.

125
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:33,062
(Master painter, Monk Manyoo)

126

(Touch of a deity, Kang Hee Yeon)

127

(Magical touch, Sim Dae Yu, also known as Sim with a bamboo hat)

128
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:47,842
There are some seats left.

129
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,181
It's a great spot.

130
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:54,125
Now, look.

131
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:57,791
I'll make sure I win first place here at Maejukheon.

132
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:00,226
You'll get into Gohwawon if you make it to the third screening.

133
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:03,236
Don't be such a show-off. Stay modest, and paint carefully.

134
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:06,131
Hey, that's not good enough.

135
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:15,871
Are you ready?

136
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,212
I'm all ready.

137
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,481
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

138
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:43,702
Goodness, look who this is.

139
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:46,005
It's Scholar Ha of Seomungwan.

140
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,175
(Seomungwan: An office in charge of astronomy, weather, and calendar)

141
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:51,471
Your looks always remind me of an entrancing painting.

142
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,912
Have you been well?

143
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:55,616
(Prince Joohyang, Lee Hoo, the second son of King Seongjo)

144
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:58,412
I thought he's the type who wouldn't care for paintings.

145
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:02,621
His Majesty especially adored him, so I wondered what he's like.

146
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,922
He's very dignified and even beautiful.

147
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:09,932
He really doesn't seem human.

148
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:12,162
Is that so?

149
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,241
Prince Joohyang is here.

150
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,241
Forgive my belated greetings, Your Highness.

151
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:29,151
I thought you'd be busy carrying out duties at Seomungwan,

152
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,952
so I never thought we meet in a place like this.

153
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,755
I looked at my fortune today through hexagrams,

154
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,851
and an unexpected 24th hexagram came out.

155
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,226
It must've meant I'll have the honor...

156
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,866
of sitting by your side as I watch over the contest.

157
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:44,891
- The 24th hexagram? - Are you saying it was destined?

158
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:46,861
Yes.

159
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,731
It's nice to have a man who's as upright as you say that.

160
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:53,371
My ears are delighted.

161
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:56,141
Do enjoy the contest.

162
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:58,312
Yes, Your Highness.

163
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,322
You're one mischievous man.

164
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:13,721
If I had...

165
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,891
just died at the cliff back then.

166
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:18,962
Step back!

167
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,562

(Investigator Kim Gong Rae, Prince Joohyang's bodyguard)

170

All honored guests and painters,

171
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:38,651
Maejukheon Painting Contest is about to begin.

172
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,221
Please take your seats.

173
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,552
Hey.

174
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,216
Draw stones to look as light as feather.

175
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:04,912
Draw trees as if they're characters.

176
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,616
When you draw bamboos,

177
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:10,452
you should be well-versed in penmanship.

178
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,922
If any of you are aware of this,

179
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,856
you must know calligraphy and painting are the same.

180
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:16,956
(The theory of calligraphy and painting as a single entity)

181

I hoped to find a talented painter as such,

182
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,932
and opened up the doors of Maejukheon in four years.

183
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,371
It's nice to meet you all.

184
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:38,312
I'm Yangmyeong, the lord of Maejukheon.

185
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:53,922
Now, let me introduce the judges who'll judge the paintings with me.

186
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:56,162
First off,

187
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,206
Han Geon, an expert of Gohwawon.

188
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,601
(Gohwawon: An office in charge of paintings)

189
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,206
(Han Geon, Expert of Gohwawon)

190
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:06,271
And his long-time colleague, a historic painting society,

191
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:09,101
Choi Won Ho, the master of Baekyu Painters Society,

192
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:14,216
(Number 52)

193
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,915
Yoo Si Saeng, the master of Jungyu Painters Society.

194
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,111
(Yoo Si Saeng, the master of Jungyu Painters Society)

195
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:20,782
A dear friend of mine and my brother's,

196
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,755
and the finest writer of Dan Dynasty, Seo Ki Jung.

197
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:24,891
(Seo Ki Jung, the erudite of Bomungwan)

198
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:30,295
Lastly, a man of profound knowledge in literature and martial arts,

199
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:32,832
who always sets an example as my older brother.

200
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:34,802
Please welcome Prince Joohyang.

201
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:52,851
This Maejukheon Painting Contest will be held over two days.

202
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,082
The contest will have three screenings.

203
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:57,851
You'll draw two paintings for two screenings today,

204
00:12:58,056 --> 00:12:59,496
and tomorrow will be the third screening.

205
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:00,625
(Three different screenings for the contest)

206
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:01,761
First,

207
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:04,631
an honored guest of my choice will announce the theme...

208
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,401
for each screening.

209
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,702
Second,

210
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:13,141
the evaluation will be held without publicizing your ranks or statuses.

211
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,001
That's it!

212
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,741
We got this. We can do it.

213
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:23,555
Third, after the evaluation,

214
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:27,322
the judges will decide if you pass or not with the red and blue sticks.

215
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,351
Red stick means you pass.

216
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,952
Blue stick means you don't.

217
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:34,025
If the majority hold up red sticks, you pass.

218
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,692
If not, you do not.

219
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,162
However,

220
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:40,401
even if everyone does not let your painting pass,

221
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:43,131
senior judges may use their free pass stick...

222
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,505
and let you pass the screening once.

223
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,606
(Senior Judges: 5 judges who old superior authorities)

224
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:47,775
(Free Pass Stick: Given only to senior judges as a free pass)

225
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:48,942
Now,

226
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:53,011
I look forward to seeing paintings that'll become legendary.

227
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,111
I wlil also...

228
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:57,412
take part in the evaluation as a judge.

229
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:08,726
Painters, feel free to use papers as much as you need,

230
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,361
provided by Maejukheon.

231
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,462
If you stay seated, you will receive...

232
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:15,231
your first piece.

233
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:18,135
- Thank you. - Also, if you do not finish...

234
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:22,072
the painting within the time limit, you will be eliminated.

235
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:26,086
The time limit changes for each round.

236
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,542
- The stamp is so pretty. - And the theme will change too.

237
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,255
This is wonderful.

238
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:33,452
This is premium paper, so it even smells different.

239
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,782
You two sound like hillbillies.

240
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,521
You might end up kissing the paper.

241
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:50,601
- Hey, Young Wook. - Yes?

242
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:53,741
Who's that creepy monk?

243
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:59,511
Master painter of Jeolla Province, Monk Manyoo?

244
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:01,981
Once he drew Vimalakirti on the wall of the temple,

245
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:04,751
the painting shined the entire temple brightly.

246
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:07,055
People swarmed in to look at that painting,

247
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,025
and the temple brought in over a million Jeon.

248
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:12,092
He shocked the world with his masterpiece painting,

249
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:13,361
so he's called the master painter.

250
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:19,962
Hey, then who's that man in a bamboo hat?

251
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:24,371
That painter seems to be...

252
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,172
Sim with a bamboo hat.

253
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,946
The magical touch of Gyeongsang Province.

254
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:32,042
Magical touch?

255
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:33,842
Magical touch.

256
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:38,582
He must be capable of doing magic tricks as he paints.

257
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:43,696
Oh, so he could paint boldly as if a horse rides through fogs.

258
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:46,165
He can even ride on that horse and compose his painting,

259
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,462
the magical touch.

260
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,962
Goodness, you slow kids.

261
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:54,401
Calm down. I have to keep calm.

262
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,601
What I mean is this.

263
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,706
He always wears that bamboo hat,

264
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,871
so no one knows what he looks like or how old he is.

265
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,415
A goblin called Hwacha that loves paintings came every night...

266
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,182
to have paint-offs against him.

267
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:09,682
Then he came to an enlightenment for his magical touches.

268
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,481
That's why he's called the magical touch.

269
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:15,481
Do you get it now?

270
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,596
All great painters in the Dan Dynasty...

271
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,192
have gathered here.

272
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,905
Actually, there is someone else...

273
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:30,172
who receives the most attention in this painting contest.

274
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:31,802
Who is it?

275
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:33,171
Oh, me?

276
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:35,302
I know who that is too.

277
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:39,171
The biggest potential winner of this Maejukheon Painting Contest.

278
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:41,641
Touch of a deity, Kang Hee Yeon.

279
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:45,886
The best scholarly painter who grew up as a gifted child.

280
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:48,386
He uses composed lines for his ink-and-wash painting,

281
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,525
yet he brings out ardent blank spaces.

282
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,822
His paintings are all lively and realistic.

283
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:55,565
These judges are all scholars,

284
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:56,795
so he has the highest chance...

285
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,032
compared to painters like us, who do this for a living.

286
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:00,762
Are you telling me...

287
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:05,005
to accept the reality that I won't be the winner...

288
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:06,701
of this painting contest?

289
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,906
I mean, these men are here to paint with us.

290
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,911
How can we dream of competing with them?

291
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,216
But still, let's dream big...

292
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,582
here at Maejukheon today, Frown.

293
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:20,082
- And Nuisance? - Goodness.

294
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,322
So are you going to try to win?

295
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:25,396
She has always been too hopeful since when she was young.

296
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,722
- That's what I'm saying. - Just grind the ink stick.

297
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:36,906
Let me announce the first painting type and theme.

298
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,876
(Painting type: Landscape, animals, portrait, et cetera)

299
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:41,275
(Painting theme: The overall theme of the painting)

300
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,045
The first screening's painting type is plumtree and bamboo.

301
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,476
(Plumtree and bamboo)

302
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:45,641
The theme will be...

303
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:54,451
decided by the expert of Gohwawon, Han Geon.

304
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,232
What?

305
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:06,361
Hey, doesn't this mean Jung has the upper hand?

306
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,762
Yes, isn't he his teacher?

307
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,631
"When I recite poetry alone under the moonlight,"

308
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:39,532
"the smell of the plum blossom begins to seep into my clothes."

309
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:42,361
"I'm afraid butterflies will fly as a group..."

310
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,236
"thinking that spring has already come."

311
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,706
("When I recite poetry alone under the moonlight,")

312
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,201
("the smell of the plum blossom begins to seep into my clothes.")

313
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,386
Now, you get 1 sijin.

314
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,515
(One sijin: About 2 hours)

315
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:56,711
Two hours?

316
00:18:58,056 --> 00:18:59,181
That's too tight.

317
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:00,656
I don't have enough ink yet.

318
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:01,782
Start grinding the stick first.

319
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:03,421
What do you think?

320
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,656
I tried changing the theme to match the eye level...

321
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:07,121
with the copycat painter.

322
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,292
You're an outstanding strategist, Your Highness.

323
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,325
His penmanship is incredible.

324
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:36,752
His writing is as great as the masters.

325
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,292
It's a wonder.

326
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:40,661
It is.

327
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,832
How can he write like that?

328
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,002
- Goodness. - That's amazing.

329
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:53,441
His penmanship is solid yet dignified.

330
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:56,376
Prince Yangmyeong's writings are always a masterpiece.

331
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:59,312
Even envoys from other countries covet after his writings.

332
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,545
We could consider his calligraphy as a national treasure.

333
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,411
Are you concerned about him?

334
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:08,351
Why would I be?

335
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:13,361
I'm just proud to have such a talented younger brother.

336
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,722
It's just calligraphy.

337
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:20,002
Keep your focus solely on the intentions of Prince Yangmyeong.

338
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,032
Hey, Jung.

339
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:04,716
Hey. Could you interpret the theme one more time?

340
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:06,815
"Moonlight, poetry, alone, plum blossom, seep, clothes."

341
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:09,345
"Afraid, butterflies, fly, spring, already come."

342
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,451
What?

343
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:12,812
What the heck is he saying?

344
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:18,691
Young Wook, you try to read that.

345
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:20,461
Okay, trust me.

346
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:21,762
Make it accurate.

347
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,161
"Under the moon..."

348
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:30,802
The poetry is what now?

349
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:35,005
Hey, forget it. I heard that part too.

350
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:36,242
Hey.

351
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:39,312
I'll tell you just this once, so make sure you listen well.

352
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,916
They're reciting poetry alone under the moonlight,

353
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:48,151
but the smell of the plum blossom is so strong, it got on their clothes.

354
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:52,151
Then butterflies fly in as a group thinking it's already spring.

355
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:54,262
That's what it means.

356
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:58,631
All right, I get it.

357
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:04,572
So...

358
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:06,641
the moonlight.

359
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:09,401
Plum blossoms.

360
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:13,512
Butterflies.

361
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:57,651
What is it?

362
00:23:58,387 --> 00:23:59,982
That's an uncanny painting.

363
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:04,292
I'm not even finished yet.

364
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:06,861
This won't be good enough.

365
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:35,522
He has bold touches.

366
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:36,782
Already?

367
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,921
Two hours have passed already.

368
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:47,325
When you touch the paper with a brush, you create a stroke.

369
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:48,996
(A stroke brings out the actual shape)

370
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:51,065
Then you're left with empty spaces.

371
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,865
(Empty spaces depict the energy of the created shape)

372
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:58,931
Will you let the stroke win and bring out the shape?

373
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:03,911
Or will you let it loose and let the shape show?

374
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,022
Father.

375
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:22,621
No one can add 10 thousand touches with just a single stroke.

376
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,861
Once I gave up my greed,

377
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:28,101
I could see flowers and the Moon.

378
00:26:56,227 --> 00:27:00,035
Since this is the first screening, I still see many ignoble paintings.

379
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:03,166
If they call themselves a painter, what's with that first stroke?

380
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,131
We should focus on the dignity of the painting.

381
00:27:05,177 --> 00:27:07,441
Let's find out what the painters' focuses were.

382
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:10,211
The first painting type was plumtree and bamboo.

383
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:14,242
They'll be evaluated on their take on nature and their attitude.

384
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:23,252
Swish.

385
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,552
Swoosh.

386
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:32,161
Once you close your eyes,

387
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,631
you hear sounds.

388
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:45,342
Even if she is that girl,

389
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:49,681
our relationship was already once disconnected.

390
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:57,292
I won't let my petty feelings ruin my great plan.

391
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:07,101
That's the time for your first painting.

392
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:12,302
Make sure you write your name.

393
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:28,303
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] SBS E05 'Lovers of the Red Sky'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

394
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:42,802
Come on, get up. Let's go.

395
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:47,206
Did you all write your names?

396
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:48,302
Yes.

397
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:54,381
Prepare for the evaluation.

398
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,746
I see a magnanimous and brave layout,

399
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,046
but it doesn't portray the theme's intimacy.

400
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,259
- It's against the theme. - Six blue sticks!

401
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,256
There are 26 blue sticks...

402
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,100
and eight red sticks.

403
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:21,926
Fail!

404
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,340
This person used ink too dark...

405
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:30,036
to paint the moon.

406
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,171
Fail.

407
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,266
(Light and shade)

408
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,645
The plum tree must be bold and strong.

409
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:40,716
There's nothing more to see.

410
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,716
- Hey. - It's yours?

411
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,956
It's not always good to fill the paper.

412
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:52,630
The energy of the plum tree isn't enough to relieve...

413
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:53,999
the sorrow of a man reciting a poem.

414
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,095
(Deep sorrow)

415
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:57,170
Fail!

416
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,266
That was yours?

417
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,140
Oh, dear. You did well anyway.

418
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:02,895
- Good luck. - Thanks.

419
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,665
Oh, dear.

420
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:09,080
The plumtree looks empty...

421
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:11,380
as it lacks strokes here and there.

422
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:14,350
- It's a fail. - Fail!

423
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:17,885
The brush strokes are rough and the ink shows no light or shade.

424
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,160
- Fail. - Fail!

425
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:22,120
- Fail. - Fail.

426
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,256
Fail.

427
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,055
- Hey. - Hey.

428
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,696
It's Young Wook's.

429
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,999
My gosh.

430
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,395
Plum flowers bloom beautifully all over the branches.

431
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:37,769
It's a good piece that portrays the plum...

432
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,835
that blooms throughout hardships.

433
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:48,080
There are 31 red sticks and three blue sticks.

434
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:49,819
Number 25, pass.

435
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,046
Pass!

436
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,645
Hey.

437
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:56,786
Well done.

438
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:00,325
(Number 22)

439
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,565
Branches stretching out elegantly under the moonlight.

440
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,936
I can almost smell a cool fragrance coming from the flowers.

441
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:09,696
- Pass. - Yes.

442
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,506
- Hey. - You made it.

443
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,706
You did it.

444
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,580
From the rough growth of the tree,

445
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:18,605
I sense the chastity of one's spirit.

446
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,046
Pass.

447
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:26,190
Number 32 did very well.

448
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:27,286
It's yours.

449
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,759
This painting has a different character and pose.

450
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
(Character and pose)

451
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:34,526
It's a refreshing composition and style.

452
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,526
Pass.

453
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,299
The Yeon merchants would clamor to purchase...

454
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,196
a painting like this.

455
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,165
There's nothing more to say.

456
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,239
The flowers and moonlight are drawn almost poetically.

457
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,635
I like it very much.

458
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,446
Pass.

459
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:54,880
The energy of the painting takes flight in the breeze,

460
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:58,145
scatters in the flowers and stops at the moon.

461
00:31:58,451 --> 00:31:59,885
It's truly amazing.

462
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,555
A great piece.

463
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:22,335
But what is this?

464
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,489
It's a good use of blank space,

465
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,355
and the strokes and contrast are truly exceptional.

466
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:40,600
Your glance is led to reach the round moon,

467
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:42,729
and on the plum flowers, a gift of heaven...

468
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,095
is sprinkled which almost gives me the chills.

469
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,635
However,

470
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:53,410
although the plum grows in the cold,

471
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:55,575
it never sells its fragrance.

472
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,676
I'd like the painter of this work to think of what I said.

473
00:33:00,451 --> 00:33:01,546
Fail.

474
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,789
Six blue sticks!

475
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,645
Four blue sticks!

476
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,660
There are 33 red sticks and one blue stick.

477
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:12,855
This work is a fail.

478
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,426
(Fail)

479
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,805
Wait, Your Highness!

480
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,085
I wish to ask you something.

481
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,506
Come forward.

482
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,745
You crazy...

483
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,986
- My gosh. - Let's sit down.

484
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,355
Oh, dear.

485
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:16,515
What a mess.

486
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,866
I'm Hong Cheon Gi from Baekyu Painters Society.

487
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,439
You just said that...

488
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,975
my work is good, but you can't give it a pass.

489
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,276
I would like to know...

490
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,216
why that is.

491
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,855
All other painters accepted their results.

492
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,895
Why did you come forward to doubt the judges' opinion?

493
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,596
I apologize sincerely...

494
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:06,605
for disrupting the event and posing a sudden question.

495
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:09,480
But I'm not objecting to the opinions...

496
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,205
of learned experts.

497
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,649
As you said, I have already failed.

498
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,776
So what?

499
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,716
My hope...

500
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,855
and the reputation of my society are already damaged.

501
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:27,955
If I were to go home not knowing the reason...

502
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,966
why I failed, I might despair and decide never to paint again.

503
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,196
So I dare ask.

504
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,636
What ability...

505
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:40,205
do you think I lack?

506
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:48,080
Your painting has a structure that is unique...

507
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:49,576
and unlike any other.

508
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,145
That alone is enough to seduce and bewilder.

509
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,819
You have great skills.

510
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,859
(To infatuate someone)

511
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,426
However, the plumtree you drew...

512
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,895
have flowers facing upward,

513
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,756
so they look like apricot flowers.

514
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,495
The butterflies all took flight, despite it being nighttime.

515
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,439
Doesn't that show the shallowness of the painter...

516
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,236
who only tries to win the interest of a buyer?

517
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,739
That goes against fidelity and loyalty the plum represents,

518
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,546
and is the same as selling the tree's fragrance.

519
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,546
You can ask me ten times,

520
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,216
but I would still fail your painting.

521
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,290
So it was the butterfly that was the problem.

522
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,685
What do you mean?

523
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,625
Can't you tell?

524
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,460
The prince is being nitpicky.

525
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:35,625
There's something about it.

526
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:38,265
There's something about that butterfly painting.

527
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,939
It was the butterfly.

528
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,065
What? What about the butterfly?

529
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,910
It looks just fine.

530
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:47,910
It has wings and feelers.

531
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:49,076
It has...

532
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:52,879
A butterfly?

533
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,475
- Gosh. - You're so gutsy.

534
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,350
This is my mark.

535
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:02,556
(A painter's mark left behind instead of a seal.)

536
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,926
That painter is the woman I saw at the dye house.

537
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,535
The two of them...

538
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:17,806
must definitely know each other.

539
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,065
She knows Yul?

540
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,245
Your Highness.

541
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,649
If you say a detailed painting that is almost lifelike...

542
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,446
is flawed by its excessive detail...

543
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:37,855
That is what I...

544
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,265
What do you think?

545
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,299
The strokes have pent-up energy,

546
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,239
and the branches are so stiff they might snap.

547
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,366
This could mean the painter was too absorbed in her emotions...

548
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,306
she failed to grasp the concept.

549
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:57,480
I also think the plum flowers...

550
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:59,049
are too simple,

551
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,346
and they look outdated and ignorant.

552
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:03,446
Your further comments...

553
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,515
only proved even more...

554
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,955
why this painting is a fail.

555
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:12,556
Your Highness.

556
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,895
Are you failing my painting...

557
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,326
because the flowers face upward so they look like apricot flowers?

558
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,370
You said you'd let the painters draw freely,

559
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:23,100
so how could you say that?

560
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:25,265
Are you talking back at me?

561
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,636
I apologize.

562
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,046
Whatever you say,

563
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,419
to me, this painting...

564
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,489
looks like you tried to show off using a unique layout,

565
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,145
but then failed to grasp the basic concept.

566
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:47,299
He figured out she's the forger.

567
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,855
In my painting,

568
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,866
the butterfly took flight under the moon too.

569
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,100
So why...

570
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:58,265
Now, now. Everything in the world stems from issues of the heart.

571
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,109
Do not blame others.

572
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,279
Those who are meant to pass will pass,

573
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,276
and those meant to fail will fail.

574
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,415
I see.

575
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:15,656
I finally get what it means to host

576
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,315
a contest in Maejukheon.

577
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:18,859
Then it's done.

578
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,285
You said that...

579
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,859
we compete as equals, regardless of our rank or status.

580
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,665
That this contest is only about skill.

581
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,265
However...

582
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,339
that's all just for show.

583
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,105
Everything's about your taste and thoughts.

584
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,236
I get that now.

585
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:41,375
What a brazen thing.

586
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:45,486
We cannot let people like her paint at all.

587
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,986
What an insolent girl she is.

588
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:01,366
I was impudent.

589
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,765
I will leave now.

590
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,596
Wait!

591
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,046
Your Highness. I think...

592
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:55,290
the reason none of the flowers face downward...

593
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,890
is because the painter thought of...

594
00:40:57,891 --> 00:40:59,930
Du Hyang's poem of the drooping plum...

595
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:02,826
that grows downward by the water.

596
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,169
Also, the upward flowers that you say...

597
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,065
make you think of apricot flowers...

598
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,736
is because the painter was true to what she saw...

599
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,435
and she painted exactly what she felt.

600
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:20,815
Why are you doing this?

601
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,015
Your Highness.

602
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,556
She's a blessed painter.

603
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,910
My gosh.

604
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:57,105
What?

605
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,546
Does her painting have some kind of power?

606
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:05,346
This is so very strange.

607
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:19,169
Do you mean that Hong Eun O's daughter could compete?

608
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,835
I stopped her from applying, but I'm warning you just in case.

609
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,310
Eun O had a daughter?

610
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:28,605
Promise me that...

611
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:31,475
you will fail her.

612
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,245
The blood of a blessed painter.

613
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,716
She must be Hong Eun O's daughter.

614
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:43,015
I will...

615
00:43:44,461 --> 00:43:46,326
use my free pass stick.

616
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:18,785
You got a free pass stick.

617
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,056
There is no need for a reason.

618
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:22,225
Pass.

619
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,265
A free pass?

620
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,605
Some petty list of painters?

621
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:39,279
It could decide the fate of my colleagues,

622
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,676
the honor of Baekyu Society,

623
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,585
and bring hope to my life.

624
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,685
Pass!

625
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,125
You're out of your mind.

626
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,796
Next!

627
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,035
Hey.

628
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:09,710
Troublemaker. I thought you'd get into real trouble.

629
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:11,379
What were you thinking?

630
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,205
I don't know myself.

631
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,846
It's too early to celebrate. I have bad news.

632
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:17,616
What is it?

633
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,756
I think Prince Yangmyeong bought the fake Sochundo from Wolseongdang.

634
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,355
What?

635
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:27,730
Didn't you think it weird that he kept mentioning the butterfly?

636
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:29,700
That can't be.

637
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:32,866
If it weren't for that, why else would he fail you?

638
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,500
Come on. Even so...

639
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:37,966
What'll you do now?

640
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,705
No one knows who Jung Seon Rye sold it to.

641
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,879
Hey. Let's say Prince Yangmyeong did buy my fake painting.

642
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,819
Why would he have kept quiet until now?

643
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,319
My back aches.

644
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,950
If you're not careful, you might lose your hand...

645
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,620
and your career too.

646
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:57,015
Darn you.

647
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,460
Mr. Choi.

648
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:00,930
Fancy seeing you here.

649
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:03,100
Hello, Mr. Song, Mr. Jang.

650
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:05,469
I have to go to the toilet. Bye.

651
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,100
- Get back on time. - You're all here.

652
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:08,339
Of course we are.

653
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,870
It's the first contest in years.

654
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:11,236
We wouldn't miss it.

655
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:14,335
I should try even hard now that I saw you here.

656
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,540
Goodbye.

657
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,279
Don't try too hard.

658
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,046
See you around.

659
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,145
Let's go.

660
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:29,219
Isn't she the rude painter who talked back at the prince?

661
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,859
Yes, it's her.

662
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,685
She came in with Seomungwan's Scholar Ha.

663
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:38,665
Seomungwan's Scholar Ha? Are they talking about him?

664
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:44,065
He's relying on his friendship with the prince to back his lover.

665
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,810
She even got a free pass.

666
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:49,739
Rumors that he was cursed to become a freak...

667
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,410
with red eyes must be true.

668
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:54,776
Don't you think he cast a spell to make the butterflies come over?

669
00:46:55,351 --> 00:46:59,185
If it wasn't that, he put honey on the paper.

670
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,386
I'm impressed.

671
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,256
Darn it.

672
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,156
My gosh.

673
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,216
What?

674
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,719
Do you know about Seomungwan's Scholar Ha?

675
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,116
Yes. The guardian spirit of the King's palace.

676
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:38,826
That's it?

677
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,495
He's also called the freak with red eyes.

678
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,895
Why?

679
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,330
Because his eyes are red?

680
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,466
Yes.

681
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,136
No one has said that to me before.

682
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:57,306
People see my eyes and call me a freak.

683
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:06,585
Is a Seomungwan scholar a high rank?

684
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,455
It is.

685
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,455
Why? Are you interested?

686
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,265
Hey. Are you interested in everything you ask about?

687
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,395
I just heard his eyes are red and asked you about it.

688
00:48:23,371 --> 00:48:26,205
What's that about a curse or something?

689
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:30,906
You're acting really weird today.

690
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:33,205
You're even asking about a guy.

691
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:35,846
Do you know something?

692
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,986
Come on, tell me.

693
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,185
Well,

694
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,960
he was offered as a sacrifice at the rainmaking ritual...

695
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,756
and they say that's why his eyes turned red.

696
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:45,125
What?

697
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,489
The rainmaking ritual?

698
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,256
Yes. It was almost 20 years ago.

699
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:54,366
Hey.

700
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:58,006
What is it? Do you feel sick?

701
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,035
No. Don't mind me.

702
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,346
If it was 20 years ago...

703
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,645
No way.

704
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,616
The second round will start soon.

705
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,890
Can the painter who is called...

706
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:20,256
stand and give a speech on how they will compete?

707
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,330
Monk Manyoo.

708
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:23,955
A painting is...

709
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:27,830
a depiction of creations borrowing the power of paper and ink.

710
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,335
Through it,

711
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:33,366
you must be able to meditate and teach the people.

712
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:37,040
Save us, merciful Buddha.

713
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,310
Choi Jung.

714
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:41,250
You don't put anything inside a painting.

715
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:43,145
It's a battle of brushstrokes.

716
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,046
I don't know how to lose that battle.

717
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:47,546
I will win.

718
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,455
There is no winning or losing about painting.

719
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,826
You paint, then you walk.

720
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,125
Then you have fun, and that's it.

721
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:01,435
Most of the people here paint for a living.

722
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:05,590
They grew up fighting others like thugs fight in the marketplace.

723
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:07,690
I will not back down easily.

724
00:50:07,865 --> 00:50:11,304
You people talk too much about boring stuff.

725
00:50:11,305 --> 00:50:12,460
Fighting thugs?

726
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:15,574
I'd like to win that fight.

727
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:18,000
I'd like to make my family proud.

728
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:20,869
Hong Cheon Gi.

729
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:28,150
This contest,

730
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:32,050
to some high-up noble young man is just a game,

731
00:50:32,385 --> 00:50:34,253
and to some painters...

732
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:36,750
is a fight for money or glory.

733
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:38,389
But to me,

734
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:41,190
it's a lifelong wish.

735
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:43,730
My whole life is at stake.

736
00:50:44,194 --> 00:50:47,199
I will win.

737
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:57,844
With that,

738
00:50:57,845 --> 00:51:00,514
I congratulate all 20 people...

739
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,514
who made it to the second round.

740
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:05,579
Are you all ready to begin?

741
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:11,349
Very well. I look forward to your submissions.

742
00:51:13,225 --> 00:51:17,389
I will explain the new rules to the second round.

743
00:51:17,564 --> 00:51:20,559
In this round, you'll paint using paper,

744
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:23,500
brushes, and ink provided by Maejukheon.

745
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:25,943
You'll each get one sheet...

746
00:51:25,944 --> 00:51:27,773
of oiled bamboo pulp paper.

747
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:30,940
If you make a mistake, you will not get another sheet.

748
00:51:31,274 --> 00:51:32,909
Instead, you'll be failed on the spot.

749
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:35,849
One wrong stroke and you're done.

750
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:37,550
Oiled bamboo pulp paper?

751
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:40,820
Isn't it expensive paper used for portraits at Gohwawon?

752
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:44,023
Do we have to draw someone's portrait?

753
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:46,764
What? Then Nuisance has an advantage.

754
00:51:46,765 --> 00:51:49,134
You troublemakers.

755
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:51,090
Would they make us draw a portrait?

756
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:55,030
If the paper's oiled,

757
00:51:55,274 --> 00:51:57,530
it depends on how we use the ink.

758
00:51:58,644 --> 00:52:00,943
The brush has no core,

759
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:03,909
and you only get one thick brush with a long stem.

760
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:06,980
Those who cannot use this brush...

761
00:52:07,084 --> 00:52:09,713
or those who used special tailored brushes...

762
00:52:09,714 --> 00:52:11,820
Just one brush? That's unbelievable.

763
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,954
What are we supposed to do?

764
00:52:13,955 --> 00:52:15,393
Just one long-stemmed brush?

765
00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:17,623
I really want to cry now.

766
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:19,423
A long-stemmed brush with no core.

767
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:22,230
It'll be hard for most to even draw a straight line.

768
00:52:22,834 --> 00:52:24,733
If we use the wrong amount of water,

769
00:52:24,734 --> 00:52:26,503
we can't make any delicate touches.

770
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:28,170
The delicate touches,

771
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:30,634
you can make by using just some of the brush hairs.

772
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:31,643
(To split the hairs)

773
00:52:31,644 --> 00:52:32,940
We know that much.

774
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:34,204
Split the hairs?

775
00:52:34,205 --> 00:52:36,614
If we compete using the same paper, brush, and ink,

776
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:38,679
the difference in skill will be apparent.

777
00:52:39,245 --> 00:52:41,884
Experienced people will realize...

778
00:52:41,885 --> 00:52:43,679
how to use the brush in no time.

779
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:46,550
It will come down to skill and energy.

780
00:52:46,785 --> 00:52:48,320
The painting type...

781
00:52:49,024 --> 00:52:50,224
is landscape.

782
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:53,719
(Paintings of scenery such as rivers or mountains.)

783
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:55,159
And the theme...

784
00:52:57,535 --> 00:53:00,199
I ask Seomungwan's Scholar Ha to provide that.

785
00:53:03,405 --> 00:53:05,769
Your Highness, I do not dare.

786
00:53:06,245 --> 00:53:09,510
Scholar Ha is my close friend...

787
00:53:09,674 --> 00:53:12,079
and an astronomer acknowledged by the King.

788
00:53:12,245 --> 00:53:13,684
His poems...

789
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:16,750
are also just as astronomical.

790
00:53:17,015 --> 00:53:18,650
Step forward.

791
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:34,929
One more step.

792
00:53:35,604 --> 00:53:36,929
Do your best.

793
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:44,043
Spring is everywhere on the mountain,

794
00:53:44,044 --> 00:53:45,784
(Spring is everywhere on the mountain)

795
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:47,643
and I play among the peach blossoms.

796
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:50,483
(I play among the peach blossoms)

797
00:53:50,484 --> 00:53:53,224
I suddenly wish for a peach,

798
00:53:53,225 --> 00:53:57,824
(I suddenly wish for a peach)

799
00:53:57,825 --> 00:54:00,824
so I look for it morning and night.

800
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:07,130
(I look for it morning and night)

801
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:11,503
In this round, if your painting moves us,

802
00:54:11,504 --> 00:54:13,070
you'll get extra points.

803
00:54:13,845 --> 00:54:17,710
Also, paintings that show courage and energy...

804
00:54:17,915 --> 00:54:19,909
will gain extra points.

805
00:54:22,984 --> 00:54:24,179
Are you...

806
00:54:24,854 --> 00:54:26,719
really Ha Ram?

807
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,849
The time you get

808
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:31,420
is two hours.

809
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:55,849
Everyone's painting so smoothly as if they knew the theme.

810
00:54:57,015 --> 00:54:58,650
This is really bad.

811
00:55:01,124 --> 00:55:03,090
Let's paint horizontally.

812
00:55:13,265 --> 00:55:16,500
Hey. I don't know what's going on, but focus.

813
00:55:18,575 --> 00:55:21,570
(Number 39)

814
00:55:25,044 --> 00:55:27,880
Yes. I'll ask after the contest.

815
00:55:45,905 --> 00:55:48,329
You drew the fake Sochundo?

816
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:51,840
I still cannot believe it.

817
00:56:02,055 --> 00:56:03,480
Is it really you?

818
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:05,449
Is it you?

819
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:08,590
There's a lot I want to ask,

820
00:56:09,194 --> 00:56:10,489
but I'll save it.

821
00:56:23,435 --> 00:56:26,469
The peach orchard, 19 years ago.

822
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:32,809
Do you still remember that place?

823
00:56:33,285 --> 00:56:34,440
I'd like to know.

824
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:37,210
Even if I once adored you,

825
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:40,949
I am already a dead man.

826
00:56:41,924 --> 00:56:43,719
You listened to me,

827
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:47,559
and you held my hand with such warmth.

828
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:50,559
I cannot forget it.

829
00:56:51,194 --> 00:56:54,099
Did you look forward to it?

830
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:56,800
To the tomorrow I promised?

831
00:56:58,135 --> 00:56:59,400
I want to hear...

832
00:57:00,245 --> 00:57:03,269
the reason you couldn't return.

833
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,957
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

834
00:57:46,032 --> 00:57:48,060
Why do you tell me to forget so easily?

835
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:50,196
I did not come back to see you...

836
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:52,670
because I had forgotten about you.

837
00:57:52,671 --> 00:57:55,141
For how long will you keep quiet?

838
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:58,440
Is it that wrong for a painter to enter a painting contest?

839
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,281
Do your paintings even contain...

840
00:58:00,282 --> 00:58:01,511
your energy and soul?

841
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:04,611
People are not moved by a painter's skill.

842
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:05,721
You're giving up like this?

843
00:58:05,722 --> 00:58:08,250
What do you know about me for you to say that?

844
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,917
It wasn't your fault.

845
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:11,817
Don't blame yourself.

846
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:13,817
Don't blame yourself.

847
00:58:15,231 --> 00:58:16,386
Ha Ram.

848
00:58:17,132 --> 00:58:18,426
It's you, isn't it?
