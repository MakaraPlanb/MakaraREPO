2
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,614
Is this the line?

3
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,654
- You may go inside. - Thanks.

4
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,399
I'm Hong Cheon Gi of Baekyu Painters Society.

5
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,525
Hong Cheon Gi of Baekyu Painters Society.

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,294
Look who this is.

7
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,265
It's Painter Hong.

8
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,368
Darn it.

9
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,375
We need to square everything first.

10
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,749
How can you assault a lady in the middle of the day?

11
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,249
Where are your senses?

12
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,114
- What's he doing? - That's impossible.

13
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:27,485
Be quiet, all of you! What do you know anyway?

14
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,224
Hey, you.

15
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,754
Are you really a painter?

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,455
Show me your contest ID slip.

17
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,765
Yes, sure.

18
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,575
I think I left it.

19
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,939
But I'm with Baekyu Painters Society.

20
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,779
I really am a painter. Please let me in.

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,118
Goodness, how can a woman be a painter?

22
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,148
You'll even make dogs laugh.

23
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,919
You can't go inside unless you have a contest ID slip.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,859
Next person. Finish up quickly.

25
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,359
- Wait, but... - Hurry.

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,589
Let's go quietly while we're nice. Don't put up a fight.

27
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,859
No, wait. Hey!

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,494
What do you think you're doing?

29
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,795
Let her go immediately.

30
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,434
The litter?

31
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:19,575
Scholar.

32
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:23,675
I see that you two are together.

33
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,018
Watch your mouth! He's...

34
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:27,145
Man soo.

35
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,188
Yes.

36
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,684
She's coming with me.

37
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,154
Says who? Come here.

38
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,064
You!

39
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,874
Darn it, you!

40
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,635
Are you all right?

41
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,064
Yes.

42
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,205
Scholar Ha, you're here.

43
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,708
- How dare you make a scene here? - Quiet!

44
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,049
This is Prince Yangmyeong's Maejukheon.

45
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,319
Get out of here! Go!

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,114
- Cheon Gi, I'll get you! - Get out of here!

47
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,624
Please come inside.

48
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,928
This woman is also participating in the contest.

49
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,624
I'm going in with her.

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,964
Yes, I understand.

51
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,765
See? I told you so.

52
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,109
Now, please hurry.

53
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,639
Take out your ID slip in advance.

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,778
- All right. - Line up, please.

55
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:05,274
(Episode 5: Maejukheon Painting Contest, Part One)

56
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,985
This is so amazing.

57
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,224
It's crowded like the central marketplace.

58
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,534
Anyway, what brings you to the painting contest?

59
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,094
I was invited by Prince Yangmyeong.

60
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,834
Oh, you were invited.

61
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,719
Well, he may have invited you here,

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,219
but where is his courtesy?

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,185
No one is here to escort you.

64
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:49,055
Never mind, I'll be your escort.

65
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,128
Then please help me out.

66
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:53,555
Sure. Trust me and follow me.

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,395
This way.

68
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,565
Right ahead of you. Be careful.

69
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,575
Anyway, Sir Scholar. How are you so good at using your body?

70
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,714
It was as if you could see.

71
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,315
No, even those who can see couldn't do what you did.

72
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,555
Are you a military officer?

73
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,815
I've been training since when I was young.

74
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:26,455
Let's just say I had a great teacher.

75
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,594
Anyway, you were the best.

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,164
How could I ever repay you?

77
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,205
Don't mention it. It was something I ought to do.

78
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,609
But still. Those men are the minions of Wolseongdang.

79
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,414
I don't want you to get in trouble because of me.

80
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,344
People say it's best to avoid fights.

81
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,854
I'll avoid them as much as I can, so don't worry.

82
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,325
But you have to be very, very careful.

83
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,765
It looks like this is where the guests are to sit.

84
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,195
And on the other side,

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,034
I'll be drawing out in this yard.

86
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,674
Is that so? I look forward to it.

87
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,344
I've never been to such a huge place before.

88
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,544
I've dreamt of this moment for quite a long time.

89
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,955
I'm sure you could win first place.

90
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,284
Sorry? Goodness, no way.

91
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,164
However, I'll do my best.

92
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,868
Then do paint in dashing spirit and see great results.

93
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,435
(Dashing spirit: Staying strong as one advances forward)

94
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,065
Come this way, please.

95
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,774
Thank you.

96
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,145
You have to keep your eyes on me.

97
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,818
I apologize.

98
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,214
It's all right. I'm used to it now.

99
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,854
Then please excuse me.

100
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,558
Where did she go? Where is she?

101
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,698
- She's over there. Come on. - Where? Oh.

102
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,255
Cheon Gi. Hey.

103
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,599
- Hey. - My gosh!

104
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,034
Why do you walk so quickly?

105
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,339
Goodness, you fool. When did you come? We were worried.

106
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,238
Hey! You two came into Maejukheon by yourselves.

107
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,178
What? You were worried? Please.

108
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,878
I met Jung Seon Rye on the way and almost died.

109
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,005
- What? - What?

110
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,344
You met that guy?

111
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,948
How did he get released so quickly?

112
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,049
No idea.

113
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,089
So? And?

114
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,625
What do you mean? I ran away as best I could.

115
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,825
Anyway, we should stay vigilant when we walk around at night.

116
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,328
Man, then everything we did, we did in vain?

117
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,998
My gosh, I can't believe it.

118
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,765
He looks familiar.

119
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,705
Hey, forget them.

120
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,769
Let's grab our seats.

121
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,008
Okay. We can talk about this later.

122
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,779
Let's grab our seats.

123
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,279
You haven't found seats for us?

124
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,245
- We went looking for you! - We had no time to get seats.

125
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,115
(Master painter, Monk Manyoo)

126

(Touch of a deity, Kang Hee Yeon)

127

(Magical touch, Sim Dae Yu, also known as Sim with a bamboo hat)

128
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:21,895
There are some seats left.

129
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,234
It's a great spot.

130
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,178
Now, look.

131
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:31,844
I'll make sure I win first place here at Maejukheon.

132
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,279
You'll get into Gohwawon if you make it to the third screening.

133
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,289
Don't be such a show-off. Stay modest, and paint carefully.

134
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,184
Hey, that's not good enough.

135
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,924
Are you ready?

136
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:51,265
I'm all ready.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,534
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

138
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,755
Goodness, look who this is.

139
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,058
It's Scholar Ha of Seomungwan.

140
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,228
(Seomungwan: An office in charge of astronomy, weather, and calendar)

141
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:25,524
Your looks always remind me of an entrancing painting.

142
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:27,965
Have you been well?

143
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,669
(Prince Joohyang, Lee Hoo, the second son of King Seongjo)

144
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,465
I thought he's the type who wouldn't care for paintings.

145
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:36,674
His Majesty especially adored him, so I wondered what he's like.

146
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,975
He's very dignified and even beautiful.

147
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,985
He really doesn't seem human.

148
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,215
Is that so?

149
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,294
Prince Joohyang is here.

150
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,294
Forgive my belated greetings, Your Highness.

151
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,204
I thought you'd be busy carrying out duties at Seomungwan,

152
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,005
so I never thought we meet in a place like this.

153
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:07,808
I looked at my fortune today through hexagrams,

154
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:09,904
and an unexpected 24th hexagram came out.

155
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,279
It must've meant I'll have the honor...

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,919
of sitting by your side as I watch over the contest.

157
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,944
- The 24th hexagram? - Are you saying it was destined?

158
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:20,914
Yes.

159
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,784
It's nice to have a man who's as upright as you say that.

160
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,424
My ears are delighted.

161
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,194
Do enjoy the contest.

162
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,365
Yes, Your Highness.

163
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,375
You're one mischievous man.

164
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:47,774
If I had...

165
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,944
just died at the cliff back then.

166
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,015
Step back!

167
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,615

(Investigator Kim Gong Rae, Prince Joohyang's bodyguard)

170

All honored guests and painters,

171
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,704
Maejukheon Painting Contest is about to begin.

172
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:16,274
Please take your seats.

173
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,605
Hey.

174
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,269
Draw stones to look as light as feather.

175
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,965
Draw trees as if they're characters.

176
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,669
When you draw bamboos,

177
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,505
you should be well-versed in penmanship.

178
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,975
If any of you are aware of this,

179
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,909
you must know calligraphy and painting are the same.

180
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,009
(The theory of calligraphy and painting as a single entity)

181

I hoped to find a talented painter as such,

182
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,985
and opened up the doors of Maejukheon in four years.

183
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,424
It's nice to meet you all.

184
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,365
I'm Yangmyeong, the lord of Maejukheon.

185
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,975
Now, let me introduce the judges who'll judge the paintings with me.

186
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:30,215
First off,

187
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:33,259
Han Geon, an expert of Gohwawon.

188
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,654
(Gohwawon: An office in charge of paintings)

189
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,259
(Han Geon, Expert of Gohwawon)

190
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,324
And his long-time colleague, a historic painting society,

191
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,154
Choi Won Ho, the master of Baekyu Painters Society,

192
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:48,269
(Number 52)

193
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,968
Yoo Si Saeng, the master of Jungyu Painters Society.

194
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,164
(Yoo Si Saeng, the master of Jungyu Painters Society)

195
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,835
A dear friend of mine and my brother's,

196
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,808
and the finest writer of Dan Dynasty, Seo Ki Jung.

197
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:58,944
(Seo Ki Jung, the erudite of Bomungwan)

198
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:04,348
Lastly, a man of profound knowledge in literature and martial arts,

199
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,885
who always sets an example as my older brother.

200
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,855
Please welcome Prince Joohyang.

201
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:26,904
This Maejukheon Painting Contest will be held over two days.

202
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,135
The contest will have three screenings.

203
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,904
You'll draw two paintings for two screenings today,

204
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,549
and tomorrow will be the third screening.

205
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,678
(Three different screenings for the contest)

206
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,814
First,

207
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,684
an honored guest of my choice will announce the theme...

208
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,454
for each screening.

209
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,755
Second,

210
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:47,194
the evaluation will be held without publicizing your ranks or statuses.

211
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,054
That's it!

212
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,794
We got this. We can do it.

213
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,608
Third, after the evaluation,

214
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:01,375
the judges will decide if you pass or not with the red and blue sticks.

215
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,404
Red stick means you pass.

216
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:05,005
Blue stick means you don't.

217
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,078
If the majority hold up red sticks, you pass.

218
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,745
If not, you do not.

219
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,215
However,

220
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,454
even if everyone does not let your painting pass,

221
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,184
senior judges may use their free pass stick...

222
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,558
and let you pass the screening once.

223
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,659
(Senior Judges: 5 judges who old superior authorities)

224
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,828
(Free Pass Stick: Given only to senior judges as a free pass)

225
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:22,995
Now,

226
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:27,064
I look forward to seeing paintings that'll become legendary.

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,164
I wlil also...

228
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,465
take part in the evaluation as a judge.

229
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,779
Painters, feel free to use papers as much as you need,

230
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,414
provided by Maejukheon.

231
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:47,515
If you stay seated, you will receive...

232
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,284
your first piece.

233
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,188
- Thank you. - Also, if you do not finish...

234
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:56,125
the painting within the time limit, you will be eliminated.

235
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,139
The time limit changes for each round.

236
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,595
- The stamp is so pretty. - And the theme will change too.

237
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,308
This is wonderful.

238
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,505
This is premium paper, so it even smells different.

239
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,835
You two sound like hillbillies.

240
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:12,574
You might end up kissing the paper.

241
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,654
- Hey, Young Wook. - Yes?

242
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:27,794
Who's that creepy monk?

243
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,564
Master painter of Jeolla Province, Monk Manyoo?

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,034
Once he drew Vimalakirti on the wall of the temple,

245
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,804
the painting shined the entire temple brightly.

246
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,108
People swarmed in to look at that painting,

247
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,078
and the temple brought in over a million Jeon.

248
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,145
He shocked the world with his masterpiece painting,

249
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,414
so he's called the master painter.

250
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,015
Hey, then who's that man in a bamboo hat?

251
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:58,424
That painter seems to be...

252
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,225
Sim with a bamboo hat.

253
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,999
The magical touch of Gyeongsang Province.

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,095
Magical touch?

255
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,895
Magical touch.

256
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,635
He must be capable of doing magic tricks as he paints.

257
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:17,749
Oh, so he could paint boldly as if a horse rides through fogs.

258
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,218
He can even ride on that horse and compose his painting,

259
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:21,515
the magical touch.

260
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,015
Goodness, you slow kids.

261
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,454
Calm down. I have to keep calm.

262
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,654
What I mean is this.

263
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:32,759
He always wears that bamboo hat,

264
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,924
so no one knows what he looks like or how old he is.

265
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,468
A goblin called Hwacha that loves paintings came every night...

266
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:40,235
to have paint-offs against him.

267
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,735
Then he came to an enlightenment for his magical touches.

268
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,534
That's why he's called the magical touch.

269
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,534
Do you get it now?

270
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:56,649
All great painters in the Dan Dynasty...

271
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,245
have gathered here.

272
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,958
Actually, there is someone else...

273
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,225
who receives the most attention in this painting contest.

274
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,855
Who is it?

275
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,224
Oh, me?

276
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,355
I know who that is too.

277
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,224
The biggest potential winner of this Maejukheon Painting Contest.

278
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,694
Touch of a deity, Kang Hee Yeon.

279
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,939
The best scholarly painter who grew up as a gifted child.

280
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,439
He uses composed lines for his ink-and-wash painting,

281
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,578
yet he brings out ardent blank spaces.

282
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,875
His paintings are all lively and realistic.

283
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,618
These judges are all scholars,

284
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,848
so he has the highest chance...

285
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,085
compared to painters like us, who do this for a living.

286
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,815
Are you telling me...

287
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,058
to accept the reality that I won't be the winner...

288
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,754
of this painting contest?

289
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,959
I mean, these men are here to paint with us.

290
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,964
How can we dream of competing with them?

291
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,269
But still, let's dream big...

292
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,635
here at Maejukheon today, Frown.

293
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,135
- And Nuisance? - Goodness.

294
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,375
So are you going to try to win?

295
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,449
She has always been too hopeful since when she was young.

296
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,775
- That's what I'm saying. - Just grind the ink stick.

297
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,959
Let me announce the first painting type and theme.

298
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,929
(Painting type: Landscape, animals, portrait, et cetera)

299
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,328
(Painting theme: The overall theme of the painting)

300
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,098
The first screening's painting type is plumtree and bamboo.

301
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,529
(Plumtree and bamboo)

302
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,694
The theme will be...

303
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:28,504
decided by the expert of Gohwawon, Han Geon.

304
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,285
What?

305
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,414
Hey, doesn't this mean Jung has the upper hand?

306
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,815
Yes, isn't he his teacher?

307
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,684
"When I recite poetry alone under the moonlight,"

308
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,585
"the smell of the plum blossom begins to seep into my clothes."

309
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,414
"I'm afraid butterflies will fly as a group..."

310
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,289
"thinking that spring has already come."

311
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,759
("When I recite poetry alone under the moonlight,")

312
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,254
("the smell of the plum blossom begins to seep into my clothes.")

313
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:28,439
Now, you get 1 sijin.

314
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,568
(One sijin: About 2 hours)

315
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,764
Two hours?

316
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,234
That's too tight.

317
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,709
I don't have enough ink yet.

318
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,835
Start grinding the stick first.

319
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,474
What do you think?

320
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,709
I tried changing the theme to match the eye level...

321
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,174
with the copycat painter.

322
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,345
You're an outstanding strategist, Your Highness.

323
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,378
His penmanship is incredible.

324
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,805
His writing is as great as the masters.

325
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,345
It's a wonder.

326
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:14,714
It is.

327
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,885
How can he write like that?

328
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,055
- Goodness. - That's amazing.

329
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,494
His penmanship is solid yet dignified.

330
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,429
Prince Yangmyeong's writings are always a masterpiece.

331
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,365
Even envoys from other countries covet after his writings.

332
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,598
We could consider his calligraphy as a national treasure.

333
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,464
Are you concerned about him?

334
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,404
Why would I be?

335
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,414
I'm just proud to have such a talented younger brother.

336
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,775
It's just calligraphy.

337
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,055
Keep your focus solely on the intentions of Prince Yangmyeong.

338
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,085
Hey, Jung.

339
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,769
Hey. Could you interpret the theme one more time?

340
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,868
"Moonlight, poetry, alone, plum blossom, seep, clothes."

341
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,398
"Afraid, butterflies, fly, spring, already come."

342
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,504
What?

343
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,865
What the heck is he saying?

344
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,744
Young Wook, you try to read that.

345
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,514
Okay, trust me.

346
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,815
Make it accurate.

347
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,214
"Under the moon..."

348
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:04,855
The poetry is what now?

349
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,058
Hey, forget it. I heard that part too.

350
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,295
Hey.

351
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:13,365
I'll tell you just this once, so make sure you listen well.

352
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,969
They're reciting poetry alone under the moonlight,

353
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,204
but the smell of the plum blossom is so strong, it got on their clothes.

354
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,204
Then butterflies fly in as a group thinking it's already spring.

355
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,315
That's what it means.

356
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,684
All right, I get it.

357
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,625
So...

358
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,694
the moonlight.

359
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,454
Plum blossoms.

360
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,565
Butterflies.

361
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,704
What is it?

362
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,035
That's an uncanny painting.

363
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,345
I'm not even finished yet.

364
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:40,914
This won't be good enough.

365
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,575
He has bold touches.

366
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,835
Already?

367
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,974
Two hours have passed already.

368
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:21,378
When you touch the paper with a brush, you create a stroke.

369
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,049
(A stroke brings out the actual shape)

370
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,118
Then you're left with empty spaces.

371
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,918
(Empty spaces depict the energy of the created shape)

372
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,984
Will you let the stroke win and bring out the shape?

373
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,964
Or will you let it loose and let the shape show?

374
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,075
Father.

375
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,674
No one can add 10 thousand touches with just a single stroke.

376
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,914
Once I gave up my greed,

377
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,154
I could see flowers and the Moon.

378
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,088
Since this is the first screening, I still see many ignoble paintings.

379
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:37,219
If they call themselves a painter, what's with that first stroke?

380
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,184
We should focus on the dignity of the painting.

381
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,494
Let's find out what the painters' focuses were.

382
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,264
The first painting type was plumtree and bamboo.

383
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,295
They'll be evaluated on their take on nature and their attitude.

384
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,305
Swish.

385
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,605
Swoosh.

386
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,214
Once you close your eyes,

387
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,684
you hear sounds.

388
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,395
Even if she is that girl,

389
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:23,734
our relationship was already once disconnected.

390
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:31,345
I won't let my petty feelings ruin my great plan.

391
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,154
That's the time for your first painting.

392
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,355
Make sure you write your name.

393
00:28:57,356 --> 00:29:02,356
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] SBS E05 'Lovers of the Red Sky'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

394
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,855
Come on, get up. Let's go.

395
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,259
Did you all write your names?

396
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,355
Yes.

397
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,434
Prepare for the evaluation.

398
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:44,799
I see a magnanimous and brave layout,

399
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:47,099
but it doesn't portray the theme's intimacy.

400
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:50,312
- It's against the theme. - Six blue sticks!

401
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:52,309
There are 26 blue sticks...

402
00:29:52,313 --> 00:29:54,153
and eight red sticks.

403
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:55,979
Fail!

404
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:02,393
This person used ink too dark...

405
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:04,089
to paint the moon.

406
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,224
Fail.

407
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:06,319
(Light and shade)

408
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:12,698
The plum tree must be bold and strong.

409
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:14,769
There's nothing more to see.

410
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:19,769
- Hey. - It's yours?

411
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:23,009
It's not always good to fill the paper.

412
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:26,683
The energy of the plum tree isn't enough to relieve...

413
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:28,052
the sorrow of a man reciting a poem.

414
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:29,148
(Deep sorrow)

415
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:31,223
Fail!

416
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:32,319
That was yours?

417
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,193
Oh, dear. You did well anyway.

418
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:36,948
- Good luck. - Thanks.

419
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:39,718
Oh, dear.

420
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:43,133
The plumtree looks empty...

421
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,433
as it lacks strokes here and there.

422
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:48,403
- It's a fail. - Fail!

423
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:51,938
The brush strokes are rough and the ink shows no light or shade.

424
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:54,213
- Fail. - Fail!

425
00:30:54,214 --> 00:30:56,173
- Fail. - Fail.

426
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:57,309
Fail.

427
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,108
- Hey. - Hey.

428
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:02,749
It's Young Wook's.

429
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:05,052
My gosh.

430
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:08,448
Plum flowers bloom beautifully all over the branches.

431
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:11,822
It's a good piece that portrays the plum...

432
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:14,888
that blooms throughout hardships.

433
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:22,133
There are 31 red sticks and three blue sticks.

434
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:23,872
Number 25, pass.

435
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:25,099
Pass!

436
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:26,698
Hey.

437
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:30,839
Well done.

438
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:34,378
(Number 22)

439
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:38,618
Branches stretching out elegantly under the moonlight.

440
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:41,989
I can almost smell a cool fragrance coming from the flowers.

441
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:43,749
- Pass. - Yes.

442
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:46,559
- Hey. - You made it.

443
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:47,759
You did it.

444
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:50,633
From the rough growth of the tree,

445
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:52,658
I sense the chastity of one's spirit.

446
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:54,099
Pass.

447
00:31:58,244 --> 00:32:00,243
Number 32 did very well.

448
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:01,339
It's yours.

449
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:04,812
This painting has a different character and pose.

450
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:05,813
(Character and pose)

451
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,579
It's a refreshing composition and style.

452
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:10,579
Pass.

453
00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:13,352
The Yeon merchants would clamor to purchase...

454
00:32:13,353 --> 00:32:15,249
a painting like this.

455
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:17,218
There's nothing more to say.

456
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:21,292
The flowers and moonlight are drawn almost poetically.

457
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:22,688
I like it very much.

458
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,499
Pass.

459
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:28,933
The energy of the painting takes flight in the breeze,

460
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:32,198
scatters in the flowers and stops at the moon.

461
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:33,938
It's truly amazing.

462
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:35,608
A great piece.

463
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:56,388
But what is this?

464
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,542
It's a good use of blank space,

465
00:33:06,543 --> 00:33:10,408
and the strokes and contrast are truly exceptional.

466
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:14,653
Your glance is led to reach the round moon,

467
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:16,782
and on the plum flowers, a gift of heaven...

468
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:20,148
is sprinkled which almost gives me the chills.

469
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:22,688
However,

470
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:27,463
although the plum grows in the cold,

471
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,628
it never sells its fragrance.

472
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:33,729
I'd like the painter of this work to think of what I said.

473
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:35,599
Fail.

474
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:38,842
Six blue sticks!

475
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:40,698
Four blue sticks!

476
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:44,713
There are 33 red sticks and one blue stick.

477
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:46,908
This work is a fail.

478
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,479
(Fail)

479
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:57,858
Wait, Your Highness!

480
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:17,138
I wish to ask you something.

481
00:34:36,393 --> 00:34:37,559
Come forward.

482
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:41,798
You crazy...

483
00:34:43,773 --> 00:34:46,039
- My gosh. - Let's sit down.

484
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:48,408
Oh, dear.

485
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:50,568
What a mess.

486
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:04,919
I'm Hong Cheon Gi from Baekyu Painters Society.

487
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:07,492
You just said that...

488
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:11,028
my work is good, but you can't give it a pass.

489
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:14,329
I would like to know...

490
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:16,269
why that is.

491
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:28,908
All other painters accepted their results.

492
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:32,948
Why did you come forward to doubt the judges' opinion?

493
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:36,649
I apologize sincerely...

494
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:40,658
for disrupting the event and posing a sudden question.

495
00:35:41,094 --> 00:35:43,533
But I'm not objecting to the opinions...

496
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:45,258
of learned experts.

497
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,702
As you said, I have already failed.

498
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:49,829
So what?

499
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:55,769
My hope...

500
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,908
and the reputation of my society are already damaged.

501
00:35:59,484 --> 00:36:02,008
If I were to go home not knowing the reason...

502
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:06,019
why I failed, I might despair and decide never to paint again.

503
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:08,249
So I dare ask.

504
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:10,689
What ability...

505
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:14,258
do you think I lack?

506
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:22,133
Your painting has a structure that is unique...

507
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:23,629
and unlike any other.

508
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:27,198
That alone is enough to seduce and bewilder.

509
00:36:27,473 --> 00:36:28,872
You have great skills.

510
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:29,912
(To infatuate someone)

511
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:32,479
However, the plumtree you drew...

512
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:34,948
have flowers facing upward,

513
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:36,809
so they look like apricot flowers.

514
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:40,548
The butterflies all took flight, despite it being nighttime.

515
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:43,492
Doesn't that show the shallowness of the painter...

516
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:46,289
who only tries to win the interest of a buyer?

517
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:48,792
That goes against fidelity and loyalty the plum represents,

518
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:51,599
and is the same as selling the tree's fragrance.

519
00:36:52,163 --> 00:36:53,599
You can ask me ten times,

520
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:56,269
but I would still fail your painting.

521
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:02,343
So it was the butterfly that was the problem.

522
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:03,738
What do you mean?

523
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:05,678
Can't you tell?

524
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:08,513
The prince is being nitpicky.

525
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:09,678
There's something about it.

526
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:12,318
There's something about that butterfly painting.

527
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:15,992
It was the butterfly.

528
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:18,118
What? What about the butterfly?

529
00:37:18,493 --> 00:37:19,963
It looks just fine.

530
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:21,963
It has wings and feelers.

531
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:23,129
It has...

532
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:26,932
A butterfly?

533
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:29,528
- Gosh. - You're so gutsy.

534
00:37:31,743 --> 00:37:33,403
This is my mark.

535
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:36,609
(A painter's mark left behind instead of a seal.)

536
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:45,979
That painter is the woman I saw at the dye house.

537
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,588
The two of them...

538
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:51,859
must definitely know each other.

539
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:54,118
She knows Yul?

540
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:01,298
Your Highness.

541
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:05,702
If you say a detailed painting that is almost lifelike...

542
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:07,499
is flawed by its excessive detail...

543
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:11,908
That is what I...

544
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:18,318
What do you think?

545
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:20,352
The strokes have pent-up energy,

546
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:22,292
and the branches are so stiff they might snap.

547
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:25,419
This could mean the painter was too absorbed in her emotions...

548
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:27,359
she failed to grasp the concept.

549
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:31,533
I also think the plum flowers...

550
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:33,102
are too simple,

551
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,399
and they look outdated and ignorant.

552
00:38:35,504 --> 00:38:37,499
Your further comments...

553
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:40,568
only proved even more...

554
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:43,008
why this painting is a fail.

555
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:46,609
Your Highness.

556
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,948
Are you failing my painting...

557
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:52,379
because the flowers face upward so they look like apricot flowers?

558
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:55,423
You said you'd let the painters draw freely,

559
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:57,153
so how could you say that?

560
00:38:57,154 --> 00:38:59,318
Are you talking back at me?

561
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:04,689
I apologize.

562
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,099
Whatever you say,

563
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:08,472
to me, this painting...

564
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,542
looks like you tried to show off using a unique layout,

565
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:14,198
but then failed to grasp the basic concept.

566
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:21,352
He figured out she's the forger.

567
00:39:21,353 --> 00:39:22,908
In my painting,

568
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:25,919
the butterfly took flight under the moon too.

569
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:27,153
So why...

570
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:32,318
Now, now. Everything in the world stems from issues of the heart.

571
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:34,162
Do not blame others.

572
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,332
Those who are meant to pass will pass,

573
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,329
and those meant to fail will fail.

574
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,468
I see.

575
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:49,709
I finally get what it means to host

576
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:51,368
a contest in Maejukheon.

577
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:52,912
Then it's done.

578
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:54,338
You said that...

579
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,912
we compete as equals, regardless of our rank or status.

580
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:00,718
That this contest is only about skill.

581
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:02,318
However...

582
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:05,392
that's all just for show.

583
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:09,158
Everything's about your taste and thoughts.

584
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:11,289
I get that now.

585
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:15,428
What a brazen thing.

586
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:19,539
We cannot let people like her paint at all.

587
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:22,039
What an insolent girl she is.

588
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:35,419
I was impudent.

589
00:40:36,154 --> 00:40:37,818
I will leave now.

590
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:06,649
Wait!

591
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,099
Your Highness. I think...

592
00:41:26,344 --> 00:41:29,343
the reason none of the flowers face downward...

593
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,943
is because the painter thought of...

594
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:33,983
Du Hyang's poem of the drooping plum...

595
00:41:33,984 --> 00:41:36,879
that grows downward by the water.

596
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:40,222
Also, the upward flowers that you say...

597
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:42,118
make you think of apricot flowers...

598
00:41:44,154 --> 00:41:46,789
is because the painter was true to what she saw...

599
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:50,488
and she painted exactly what she felt.

600
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:54,868
Why are you doing this?

601
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,068
Your Highness.

602
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,609
She's a blessed painter.

603
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:29,963
My gosh.

604
00:43:29,964 --> 00:43:31,158
What?

605
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:36,599
Does her painting have some kind of power?

606
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,399
This is so very strange.

607
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:53,222
Do you mean that Hong Eun O's daughter could compete?

608
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:56,888
I stopped her from applying, but I'm warning you just in case.

609
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:01,363
Eun O had a daughter?

610
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:02,658
Promise me that...

611
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:05,528
you will fail her.

612
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,298
The blood of a blessed painter.

613
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:15,769
She must be Hong Eun O's daughter.

614
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,068
I will...

615
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,379
use my free pass stick.

616
00:44:51,214 --> 00:44:52,838
You got a free pass stick.

617
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:55,109
There is no need for a reason.

618
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:56,278
Pass.

619
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:05,318
A free pass?

620
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,658
Some petty list of painters?

621
00:45:10,734 --> 00:45:13,332
It could decide the fate of my colleagues,

622
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,729
the honor of Baekyu Society,

623
00:45:15,473 --> 00:45:18,638
and bring hope to my life.

624
00:45:20,873 --> 00:45:22,738
Pass!

625
00:45:28,243 --> 00:45:31,178
You're out of your mind.

626
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:37,849
Next!

627
00:45:37,893 --> 00:45:39,088
Hey.

628
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:43,763
Troublemaker. I thought you'd get into real trouble.

629
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:45,432
What were you thinking?

630
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:47,258
I don't know myself.

631
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:49,899
It's too early to celebrate. I have bad news.

632
00:45:50,504 --> 00:45:51,669
What is it?

633
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:55,809
I think Prince Yangmyeong bought the fake Sochundo from Wolseongdang.

634
00:45:56,273 --> 00:45:57,408
What?

635
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:01,783
Didn't you think it weird that he kept mentioning the butterfly?

636
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:03,753
That can't be.

637
00:46:03,754 --> 00:46:06,919
If it weren't for that, why else would he fail you?

638
00:46:08,554 --> 00:46:10,553
Come on. Even so...

639
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:12,019
What'll you do now?

640
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:15,758
No one knows who Jung Seon Rye sold it to.

641
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:20,932
Hey. Let's say Prince Yangmyeong did buy my fake painting.

642
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:23,872
Why would he have kept quiet until now?

643
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:25,372
My back aches.

644
00:46:25,373 --> 00:46:28,003
If you're not careful, you might lose your hand...

645
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:29,673
and your career too.

646
00:46:29,674 --> 00:46:31,068
Darn you.

647
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:33,513
Mr. Choi.

648
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:34,983
Fancy seeing you here.

649
00:46:34,984 --> 00:46:37,153
Hello, Mr. Song, Mr. Jang.

650
00:46:37,154 --> 00:46:39,522
I have to go to the toilet. Bye.

651
00:46:39,523 --> 00:46:41,153
- Get back on time. - You're all here.

652
00:46:41,154 --> 00:46:42,392
Of course we are.

653
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:43,923
It's the first contest in years.

654
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:45,289
We wouldn't miss it.

655
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:48,388
I should try even hard now that I saw you here.

656
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:49,593
Goodbye.

657
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:51,332
Don't try too hard.

658
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,099
See you around.

659
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,198
Let's go.

660
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:03,272
Isn't she the rude painter who talked back at the prince?

661
00:47:03,273 --> 00:47:04,912
Yes, it's her.

662
00:47:04,913 --> 00:47:07,738
She came in with Seomungwan's Scholar Ha.

663
00:47:08,654 --> 00:47:12,718
Seomungwan's Scholar Ha? Are they talking about him?

664
00:47:13,654 --> 00:47:18,118
He's relying on his friendship with the prince to back his lover.

665
00:47:18,393 --> 00:47:20,863
She even got a free pass.

666
00:47:20,864 --> 00:47:23,792
Rumors that he was cursed to become a freak...

667
00:47:23,793 --> 00:47:25,463
with red eyes must be true.

668
00:47:25,464 --> 00:47:28,829
Don't you think he cast a spell to make the butterflies come over?

669
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:33,238
If it wasn't that, he put honey on the paper.

670
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:35,439
I'm impressed.

671
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:42,309
Darn it.

672
00:47:43,453 --> 00:47:45,209
My gosh.

673
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,269
What?

674
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:07,772
Do you know about Seomungwan's Scholar Ha?

675
00:48:07,773 --> 00:48:10,169
Yes. The guardian spirit of the King's palace.

676
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:12,879
That's it?

677
00:48:13,944 --> 00:48:16,548
He's also called the freak with red eyes.

678
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:18,948
Why?

679
00:48:19,953 --> 00:48:21,383
Because his eyes are red?

680
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:22,519
Yes.

681
00:48:25,023 --> 00:48:27,189
No one has said that to me before.

682
00:48:27,694 --> 00:48:31,359
People see my eyes and call me a freak.

683
00:48:36,904 --> 00:48:40,638
Is a Seomungwan scholar a high rank?

684
00:48:42,313 --> 00:48:43,508
It is.

685
00:48:44,973 --> 00:48:47,508
Why? Are you interested?

686
00:48:48,313 --> 00:48:52,318
Hey. Are you interested in everything you ask about?

687
00:48:52,523 --> 00:48:56,448
I just heard his eyes are red and asked you about it.

688
00:48:57,424 --> 00:49:00,258
What's that about a curse or something?

689
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:04,959
You're acting really weird today.

690
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:07,258
You're even asking about a guy.

691
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,899
Do you know something?

692
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,039
Come on, tell me.

693
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:13,238
Well,

694
00:49:13,773 --> 00:49:16,013
he was offered as a sacrifice at the rainmaking ritual...

695
00:49:16,014 --> 00:49:17,809
and they say that's why his eyes turned red.

696
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:19,178
What?

697
00:49:20,183 --> 00:49:21,542
The rainmaking ritual?

698
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:24,309
Yes. It was almost 20 years ago.

699
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:28,419
Hey.

700
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:32,059
What is it? Do you feel sick?

701
00:49:32,623 --> 00:49:35,088
No. Don't mind me.

702
00:49:38,603 --> 00:49:40,399
If it was 20 years ago...

703
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:42,698
No way.

704
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:48,669
The second round will start soon.

705
00:49:48,913 --> 00:49:50,943
Can the painter who is called...

706
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:54,309
stand and give a speech on how they will compete?

707
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:56,383
Monk Manyoo.

708
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:58,008
A painting is...

709
00:49:58,284 --> 00:50:01,883
a depiction of creations borrowing the power of paper and ink.

710
00:50:01,884 --> 00:50:03,388
Through it,

711
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:07,419
you must be able to meditate and teach the people.

712
00:50:08,223 --> 00:50:11,093
Save us, merciful Buddha.

713
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:12,363
Choi Jung.

714
00:50:12,364 --> 00:50:15,303
You don't put anything inside a painting.

715
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,198
It's a battle of brushstrokes.

716
00:50:17,703 --> 00:50:20,099
I don't know how to lose that battle.

717
00:50:20,304 --> 00:50:21,599
I will win.

718
00:50:22,043 --> 00:50:25,508
There is no winning or losing about painting.

719
00:50:25,813 --> 00:50:27,879
You paint, then you walk.

720
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:31,178
Then you have fun, and that's it.

721
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:35,488
Most of the people here paint for a living.

722
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:39,643
They grew up fighting others like thugs fight in the marketplace.

723
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:41,743
I will not back down easily.

724
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:45,357
You people talk too much about boring stuff.

725
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:46,513
Fighting thugs?

726
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:49,627
I'd like to win that fight.

727
00:50:49,628 --> 00:50:52,053
I'd like to make my family proud.

728
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,922
Hong Cheon Gi.

729
00:51:00,997 --> 00:51:02,203
This contest,

730
00:51:02,968 --> 00:51:06,103
to some high-up noble young man is just a game,

731
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,306
and to some painters...

732
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:10,803
is a fight for money or glory.

733
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:12,442
But to me,

734
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:15,243
it's a lifelong wish.

735
00:51:15,718 --> 00:51:17,783
My whole life is at stake.

736
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:21,252
I will win.

737
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:31,897
With that,

738
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:34,567
I congratulate all 20 people...

739
00:51:34,568 --> 00:51:36,567
who made it to the second round.

740
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:39,632
Are you all ready to begin?

741
00:51:41,508 --> 00:51:45,402
Very well. I look forward to your submissions.

742
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:51,442
I will explain the new rules to the second round.

743
00:51:51,617 --> 00:51:54,612
In this round, you'll paint using paper,

744
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:57,553
brushes, and ink provided by Maejukheon.

745
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,996
You'll each get one sheet...

746
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,826
of oiled bamboo pulp paper.

747
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,993
If you make a mistake, you will not get another sheet.

748
00:52:05,327 --> 00:52:06,962
Instead, you'll be failed on the spot.

749
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:09,902
One wrong stroke and you're done.

750
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,603
Oiled bamboo pulp paper?

751
00:52:11,938 --> 00:52:14,873
Isn't it expensive paper used for portraits at Gohwawon?

752
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:18,076
Do we have to draw someone's portrait?

753
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:20,817
What? Then Nuisance has an advantage.

754
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:23,187
You troublemakers.

755
00:52:23,188 --> 00:52:25,143
Would they make us draw a portrait?

756
00:52:27,387 --> 00:52:29,083
If the paper's oiled,

757
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,583
it depends on how we use the ink.

758
00:52:32,697 --> 00:52:34,996
The brush has no core,

759
00:52:34,997 --> 00:52:37,962
and you only get one thick brush with a long stem.

760
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,033
Those who cannot use this brush...

761
00:52:41,137 --> 00:52:43,766
or those who used special tailored brushes...

762
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,873
Just one brush? That's unbelievable.

763
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:48,007
What are we supposed to do?

764
00:52:48,008 --> 00:52:49,446
Just one long-stemmed brush?

765
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:51,676
I really want to cry now.

766
00:52:51,677 --> 00:52:53,476
A long-stemmed brush with no core.

767
00:52:53,477 --> 00:52:56,283
It'll be hard for most to even draw a straight line.

768
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:58,786
If we use the wrong amount of water,

769
00:52:58,787 --> 00:53:00,556
we can't make any delicate touches.

770
00:53:00,557 --> 00:53:02,223
The delicate touches,

771
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:04,687
you can make by using just some of the brush hairs.

772
00:53:04,688 --> 00:53:05,696
(To split the hairs)

773
00:53:05,697 --> 00:53:06,993
We know that much.

774
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:08,257
Split the hairs?

775
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:10,667
If we compete using the same paper, brush, and ink,

776
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:12,732
the difference in skill will be apparent.

777
00:53:13,298 --> 00:53:15,937
Experienced people will realize...

778
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:17,732
how to use the brush in no time.

779
00:53:18,008 --> 00:53:20,603
It will come down to skill and energy.

780
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:22,373
The painting type...

781
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:24,277
is landscape.

782
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:27,772
(Paintings of scenery such as rivers or mountains.)

783
00:53:27,947 --> 00:53:29,212
And the theme...

784
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:34,252
I ask Seomungwan's Scholar Ha to provide that.

785
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,822
Your Highness, I do not dare.

786
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:43,563
Scholar Ha is my close friend...

787
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:46,132
and an astronomer acknowledged by the King.

788
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:47,737
His poems...

789
00:53:47,738 --> 00:53:50,803
are also just as astronomical.

790
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:52,703
Step forward.

791
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:08,982
One more step.

792
00:54:09,657 --> 00:54:10,982
Do your best.

793
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,096
Spring is everywhere on the mountain,

794
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:19,837
(Spring is everywhere on the mountain)

795
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:21,696
and I play among the peach blossoms.

796
00:54:21,697 --> 00:54:24,536
(I play among the peach blossoms)

797
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:27,277
I suddenly wish for a peach,

798
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:31,877
(I suddenly wish for a peach)

799
00:54:31,878 --> 00:54:34,877
so I look for it morning and night.

800
00:54:34,878 --> 00:54:41,183
(I look for it morning and night)

801
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:45,556
In this round, if your painting moves us,

802
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:47,123
you'll get extra points.

803
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:51,763
Also, paintings that show courage and energy...

804
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:53,962
will gain extra points.

805
00:54:57,037 --> 00:54:58,232
Are you...

806
00:54:58,907 --> 00:55:00,772
really Ha Ram?

807
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:03,902
The time you get

808
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:05,473
is two hours.

809
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:29,902
Everyone's painting so smoothly as if they knew the theme.

810
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:32,703
This is really bad.

811
00:55:35,177 --> 00:55:37,143
Let's paint horizontally.

812
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:50,553
Hey. I don't know what's going on, but focus.

813
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:55,623
(Number 39)

814
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:01,933
Yes. I'll ask after the contest.

815
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,382
You drew the fake Sochundo?

816
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:25,893
I still cannot believe it.

817
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:37,533
Is it really you?

818
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:39,502
Is it you?

819
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:42,643
There's a lot I want to ask,

820
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:44,542
but I'll save it.

821
00:56:57,488 --> 00:57:00,522
The peach orchard, 19 years ago.

822
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:06,862
Do you still remember that place?

823
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:08,493
I'd like to know.

824
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:11,263
Even if I once adored you,

825
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:15,002
I am already a dead man.

826
00:57:15,977 --> 00:57:17,772
You listened to me,

827
00:57:18,048 --> 00:57:21,612
and you held my hand with such warmth.

828
00:57:22,488 --> 00:57:24,612
I cannot forget it.

829
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,152
Did you look forward to it?

830
00:57:28,787 --> 00:57:30,853
To the tomorrow I promised?

831
00:57:32,188 --> 00:57:33,453
I want to hear...

832
00:57:34,298 --> 00:57:37,322
the reason you couldn't return.

833
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:20,010
(Lovers of the Red Sky)

834
00:58:20,085 --> 00:58:22,113
Why do you tell me to forget so easily?

835
00:58:22,114 --> 00:58:24,249
I did not come back to see you...

836
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,723
because I had forgotten about you.

837
00:58:26,724 --> 00:58:29,194
For how long will you keep quiet?

838
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:32,493
Is it that wrong for a painter to enter a painting contest?

839
00:58:32,494 --> 00:58:34,334
Do your paintings even contain...

840
00:58:34,335 --> 00:58:35,564
your energy and soul?

841
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:38,664
People are not moved by a painter's skill.

842
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:39,774
You're giving up like this?

843
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:42,303
What do you know about me for you to say that?

844
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:43,970
It wasn't your fault.

845
00:58:44,244 --> 00:58:45,870
Don't blame yourself.

846
00:58:46,045 --> 00:58:47,870
Don't blame yourself.

847
00:58:49,284 --> 00:58:50,439
Ha Ram.

848
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:52,479
It's you, isn't it?
