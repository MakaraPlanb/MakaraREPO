Love at Night
EP18

2
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,680
Xu Qingyou, you...

3
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,040
Again?

4
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:49,919
A lipstick mark.

5
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,239
You despicable spy!

6
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,480
Hey, calm down.

7
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,080
I'm standing by you.

8
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,440
Lin Siyu

9
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,240
I have to answer the phone.

10
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,720
Okay.

11
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,800
Well, I'll be back soon.

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,960
Qingyou

13
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,960
There's something urgent. I have to go.

14
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,559
Okay.

15
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,320
Help yourself.

16
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,759
How dare you, Xu Qingyou!

17
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,320
Lingze was in your room

18
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,559
that day, right?

19
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,720
Now that you've known everything,

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
I'll tell the truth.

21
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,520
Yep, you are right.

22
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:11,600
You...

23
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
Why you're not keeping your end of the bargain?

24
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,839
I asked you to help me keep an eye on Lingze,

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,320
but you stole his heart!

26
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,000
Miss Lin

27
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,399
I understand your feeling.

28
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,240
But I've never promised to help.

29
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,919
Then you didn't reject me either.

30
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,759
Your traitor!

31
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,279
Now that you know that we are together,

32
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,279
are you sure to be so rude to me?

33
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,759
I would tell him.

34
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,720
May I ask you that

35
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,559
why you think Mo Lingze loves you?

36
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,160
Because he treats me very well.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,240
When newly arrived Golden Capital,

38
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,320
no one but he was willing to be my guide

39
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,639
and told me what to do.

40
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,320
He taught me everything.

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
When I made mistakes,

42
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,000
he would help me clean up the mess in no time.

43
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,839
Do you know Wang Ji?

44
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,919
Mo Lingze never blames him for his lack of experience.

45
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,200
And Fang Qi, do you know her?

46
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,839
If it weren't for Mo Lingze's tolerance,

47
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,760
she would have been kicked out of Shangger Capital

48
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,000
because of a work error.

49
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,640
Do you think Mo Lingze loves them?

50
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,320
You're a liar.

51
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,440
I won't believe you.

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,399
Why?

53
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,959
I've pursued him for so long.

54
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,559
Why did he choose another woman?

55
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Mo

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,799
The concealment of our relationship

57
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,679
failed on the first day.

58
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,839
Well,

59
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,760
you're still unshakable?

60
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,119
What's wrong? Why do you put your luggage here?

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,920
Wanna live here?

62
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,200
No way.

63
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,519
How could I be kicked out

64
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,079
if it weren't for your ridiculous ideas?

65
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,359
According to common sense,

66
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,799
you should compensate me for my mental damage.

67
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,640
As we both are laborers,

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
I forgive you this time.

69
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,279
I can sleep on the sofa.

70
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
It's blackmail.

71
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,880
Just judge the situation

72
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,799
and play it by ear.

73
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,279
You taught me that.

74
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,760
I have nowhere to go anyway,

75
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,000
you can't get rid of me.

76
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,440
Okay, you win.

77
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
Let's meet each other halfway.

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
You have to go to work

79
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
though you were dumped.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Hurry up and make money.

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,760
No love, no gains.

82
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,160
Stand on your own feet.

83
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,399
Hope he was not really traumatized.

84
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,679
I'm not good at making money,

85
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,119
but I can tip off.

86
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,119
Wang Ji, this document...

87
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,839
The information of the Taikang Biological Project is all on it.

88
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,720
I'll leave if there is nothing else.

89
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,239
Halt.

90
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:24,959
What happened to you today?

91
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Nothing. I'm okay.

92
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,200
Dissatisfied with me?

93
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,880
Not a bit.

94
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,959
Because of Lin Siyu?

95
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,160
I've heard about it.

96
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,119
What Lin Siyu

97
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,040
has been busy with is all for you.

98
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,279
Don’t be so cruel

99
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,720
even though you don’t like her.

100
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
Besides, her leg is hurt.

101
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,600
If I had known that you were so hard-hearted,

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,239
I wouldn't have worked for you at the beginning.

103
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,519
Or I won’t be suffering.

104
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,440
If you like her, let her see your heart.

105
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,440
It's time to show

106
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,440
the fruit of your training at the reception tonight.

107
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,840
Okay, I'll try my best.

108
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:18,799
Hello?

109
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,239
Youyou, can you come to the hospital?

110
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,320
What's wrong?

111
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,119
Mr. Mo, haven't seen you for years.

112
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,559
It's been a long time.

113
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,599
Talk to you later.

114
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:32,960
Okay.

115
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,599
See you.

116
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,119
Okay.

117
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,479
Siyu, long time no see.

118
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:07,640
Mrs. Zhang

119
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,760
You're stunning tonight.

120
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,679
How is Mr. Lin?

121
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:24,080
Are you running away?

122
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,520
Sorry. It's urgent.

123
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm in the hospital now, maybe I can't come to you.

124
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,479
Are you sick?

125
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,760
Not me.

126
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,239
It's Fan Yunxi's mother.

127
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,919
She suddenly became dizzy.

128
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,760
Now she is undergoing a surgery.

129
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,960
She's always kind to me.

130
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,320
I can't just sit by.

131
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,159
I won’t leave here until the surgery is over.

132
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,679
Okay, I get it.

133
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,880
Where is your plus one?

134
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,479
She stood you up?

135
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,200
Lingze

136
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,119
You also know that

137
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,799
industry receptions are meant for resource exchanges.

138
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,559
Why not let me be your plus one?

139
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,440
I'll put in a word for you,

140
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,719
then you will get twice the result with half the effort.

141
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,880
No need.

142
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,320
I wore this dress for you.

143
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,719
It was tailored for me with half a year.

144
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,159
The embroidery was stitched by hand.

145
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,840
Everyone is impressed by my beauty,

146
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,479
but you don't want to look at me.

147
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,719
Lie to you, exploit your innocence.

148
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,840
Take your love

149
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,640
as a stepping stone for profits and status.

150
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,479
This is what you want?

151
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,840
Isn't it because of Xu Qingyou?

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,119
She's just a white-collar worker.

153
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,679
An eye candy.

154
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,200
What can she do for you?

155
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:34,799
First,

156
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,239
she is not an eye candy.

157
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,520
She earns her own living.

158
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,080
Second,

159
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,599
my heart

160
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,039
belongs to her.

161
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,159
I don't mind others' comments.

162
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,679
Am I inferior to her?

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,960
You are not inferior to her.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's just that you are not her.

165
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:27,840
Qi.

166
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,880
Not in the mood？

167
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,200
I got it.

168
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,919
No wonder you're tired.

169
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,200
Yunhai Technology's case has not yet been closed.

170
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,760
Taikang Biological Project also needs your attention.

171
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,359
Mr. Wang of Yunhai Technology

172
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,919
always changes his mind after negotiations

173
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,280
and adds some unequal clauses.

174
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,440
It's impossible. I'm speechless.

175
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,880
Taikang's case is a sticky business.

176
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,479
It'll take us great efforts

177
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,320
to solve it.

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,000
I have an evil thought.

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
It would be not bad

180
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,440
if this project ended up a failure.

181
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,159
At least we could rest for a few days.

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,280
Hello, boss.

183
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,760
The reception for venture capital investment,

184
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,960
come here and pick up Lin Siyu.

185
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,200
She will get drunk.

186
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,840
Qi

187
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,239
Our boss asked me to pick up someone.

188
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,039
I have to go.

189
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:26,719
Okay.

190
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:28,760
Hang on.

191
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:29,880
Let's go together.

192
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,760
Go home and do it.

193
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,280
Don't forget your key, Qi.

194
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,400
It doesn't matter. Someone...

195
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,520
Thank you.

196
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:46,799
Let's go.

197
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,080
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

198
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,559
Why is her situation so serious all of a sudden?

199
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,880
Her condition is not good all the time.

200
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,239
She's worried about us recently.

201
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,119
I am a bad son.

202
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,280
I always feel that I can company her for a long time in the future,

203
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,080
but now I found she was sixty.

204
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,760
Heaven always provides for good people.

205
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,359
She will be fine.

206
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,919
Youyou

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
Can you stay with me forever?

208
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,080
I used to think

209
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,359
we would be together forever.

210
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,719
I didn't expect that...

211
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
I came today

212
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,679
is because I was worried about her.

213
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,840
She is really nice to me.

214
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,799
Youyou, can you forgive me?

215
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,919
Sorry,

216
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,440
I was being frivolous.

217
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,280
I just didn’t expect that

218
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,440
one day I would lose the two most important people

219
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,000
in my life at the same time.

220
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,119
The past has passed.

221
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,599
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,679
Are you Miss Xu?

223
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,320
A gentleman left it here just now and said it was for you.

224
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,520
Who is he?

225
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,599
He just put it here and left.

226
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
Okay, thank you.

227
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,919
You're welcome.

228
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,599
Hello,

229
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
have you come to the hospital?

230
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,760
Hmm....

231
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,679
Why don't you tell me?

232
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,679
Are you angry?

233
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,679
Why don't you tell me.

234
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,599
You're so large-hearted.

235
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,359
You'll forgive me, right?

236
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,520
Don't flatter me.

237
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,359
This time you ruined

238
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,119
my quality time with my girlfriend.

239
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,520
So you have to

240
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,000
make a sound compensation plan.

241
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,159
You're thoughtful.

242
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,599
Do you have extra conditions

243
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,559
or restrictions on the plan?

244
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,799
It's up to you,

245
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,719
but I want to see your sincerity.

246
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:54,760
I used to think

247
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,200
we would be together forever.

248
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,479
I didn't expect that...

249
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,319
Answer my question.

250
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,839
Am I gorgeous?

251
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,560
Yeah.

252
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,560
Am I gentle?

253
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,439
Probably.

254
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Why does he choose that old lady instead of me?

255
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,680
She's thirty years old.

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,359
Thirty is not old.

257
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,319
You...

258
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,640
Why do you stand by her?

259
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,439
The investment circle is so sinister,

260
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,400
I can help him and protect him.

261
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
As long as my dad promises,

262
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,000
he could get any project he wants.

263
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,599
Can Xu Qingyou do that?

264
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,839
Is he crazy?

265
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,760
Have you ever thought

266
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,760
that these don't matter to him?

267
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,280
Then what matters?

268
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,439
What matters

269
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,959
is whether he likes the girl.

270
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,520
You know, we are

271
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,439
calculating every day in business.

272
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,000
Calculate numbers or others' hearts.

273
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,439
Argue about little details and weigh the gains and losses.

274
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
We can't lose even a bit.

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,719
Once

276
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,560
we meet someone

277
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,719
we love genuinely,

278
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,760
we stop calculating.

279
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,640
You think so?

280
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,400
Are you crazy, too?

281
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,560
The tastes of dishes are great.

282
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,079
Their environment is greater.

283
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,599
You want to treat me to a big meal?

284
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,640
You bought new slippers?

285
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,359
Okay.

286
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,560
You take all the blue ones. I'll use the pink ones.

287
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,880
You're back.

288
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,119
Get easy on the alcohol.

289
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,119
You'll feel uncomfortable every time you drink too much.

290
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't drink icy water.

291
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:25,959
You'd better drink some hot water

292
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,079
after drinking wine,

293
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,239
or I can make you some ginger tea.

294
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,880
He's left here for so many days.

295
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,719
I haven't got used to his absence.

296
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,640
No biggie.

297
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
I've been alone for so many years.

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,439
Don't be so sentimental.

299
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,719
See ya.

300
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,680
I want the blue one.

301
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,239
Sorry,

302
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:16,839
my fault!

303
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,760
Don't be angry.

304
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,880
It's eleven o'clock.

305
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,000
She must have arrived home after working overtime.

306
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,599
He's crazy.

307
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,479
Completely crazy.

308
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,599
I should eat better as I lives alone.

309
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Halt my weight loss plan tonight.

310
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,959
Let me see.

311
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,119
I usually cook for her.

312
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,439
What will she do today?

313
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,160
Too talkative.

314
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,280
I've bought her all the ingredients

315
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,119
and cut the vegetables.

316
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,599
She only has to put these into the pan.

317
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,920
Will she cook for herself?

318
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,959
Order a takeaway.

319
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,119
If you ask me...

320
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,040
But she is so lazy,

321
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,560
how can she do it herself?

322
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,359
What should I do?

323
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Come here, take you seat.

324
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,000
Is that your plan to starve yourself

325
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,160
and frighten Fang Qi?

326
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,520
Give me.

327
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,640
Give me.

328
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,359
Take it.

329
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,119
Take it.

330
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,640
Eat it.

331
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,040
What's wrong?

332
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
Why are you crying?

333
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,079
Why do you buy the hot pot?

334
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,280
Why can't you buy anything else?

335
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,839
Must you buy the hot pot?

336
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,239
Okay, my fault.

337
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,160
There's no such thing even in girls-oriented love comic books.

338
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,239
Doctor, how is my mom?

339
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,319
The operation was successful.

340
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,040
But she has to stay in the intensive care unit

341
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,599
for a few days.

342
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,640
Thank you doctor, thank you.

343
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,199
You're welcome.

344
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,520
Now you'll be relieved.

345
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:07,880
Youyou

346
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,400
I am really grateful

347
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,560
for your company.

348
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,439
Auntie regards me

349
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,160
as her own daughter.

350
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,760
Although we broke up,

351
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,239
I will definitely come to her if she needs me.

352
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,239
You know,

353
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,079
last night

354
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,719
I suddenly realized that

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,800
only you were my spiritual support

356
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,119
when I was afraid and suffering.

357
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,680
Youyou, can we...

358
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,160
We've broken up.

359
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,439
I have my own life.

360
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,359
You should move on too.

361
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,040
I really hope that our relationship

362
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,520
can recover from an operation

363
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:55,520
like my mother.

364
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,439
Some things

365
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,520
can be saved,

366
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
but something cannot be retrieved,

367
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,280
just like the spilled water.

368
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I have work to do.

369
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:09,920
I'm leaving.

370
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,040
I'll see auntie in a few days.

371
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,599
Have a good rest.

372
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,839
I won't let you go.

373
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:34,560
Mr. Mo

374
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,599
Your coffee.

375
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,319
Thank you, Director Xu.

376
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,839
Have you finished

377
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,040
the plan you promised yesterday?

378
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,800
Remember, your sincerity.

379
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,640
As to the plan,

380
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,479
it's better to talk while walking.

381
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,439
Okay.

382
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,160
Follow me.

383
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,239
Are you satisfied?

384
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:12,920
Not enough.

385
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,640
Not enough?

386
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,280
I'll treat you to lunch.

387
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,760
I'm looking forward to it.

388
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,760
I'll go to work.

389
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,319
Hang on.

390
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,119
I have to

391
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,880
make a mark on you

392
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,560
to prevent potential rivals.

393
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:35,719
See you.

394
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,640
I'm here to confirm that

395
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,880
whether he is still alive or not.

396
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,640
Check and leave.

397
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:36,959
Xu Wei

398
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:39,640
Xu Wei

399
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,599
My painting!

400
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,479
You are crazy! What are you doing?

401
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,479
Can't you find a better way to kill yourself?

402
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,119
My painting!

403
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,920
Make way!

404
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,599
Take the fire extinguisher.

405
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:05,920
Fire extinguisher.

406
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,680
I didn't try to kill myself.

407
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,800
I wanna pain my internal feelings.

408
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,079
Just an error.

409
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,239
It's on fire. Don't care about your painting.

410
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,719
What's important? The painting or your life?

411
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,800
What did you paint?

412
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,160
Let me have a look.

413
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,560
Here you are.

414
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,160
Have you changed your mind?

415
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,400
I came here today to tell you

416
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,439
that I'll not,

417
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:47,719
no,

418
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,199
never accept your love.

419
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,760
We are both single.

420
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,160
Why is it impossible?

421
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,079
Xu Wei, I'm eight years older than you.

422
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,359
I've thought about this problem.

423
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,560
Here you are.

424
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,359
The solution for our age gap.

425
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,280
If our relatives don't understand us,

426
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,319
let's convince them with a sincere attitude.

427
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,040
If friends don't accept us, let's break up with them.

428
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,239
If strangers...

429
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,880
Never mind the strangers.

430
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,160
In terms of the natural law,

431
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:19,160
the average life span of women is longer than that of men.

432
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,959
A puppyish boyfriend is the best choice

433
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,239
to share your life with.

434
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,560
I've also collected some historic cases

435
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,079
of couple with age gap.

436
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,160
Empress Wu Zetian in Tang Dynasty is four years older than Li Zhi.

437
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,359
The queen of the Northern Zhou Dynasty is twelve years older than the emperor.

438
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,520
And the Emperor Zhu Jianshen of the Ming Dynasty...

439
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,000
Hang on.

440
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,119
Stop it.

441
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,839
Others can accept it,

442
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,119
but it's not workable for us.

443
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:38,040
I’ve witnessed your growth.

444
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,760
You are too childish.

445
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,479
Childish.

446
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,000
I also wrote a solution to my childishness.

447
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,079
I have my own work plan.

448
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,520
Go to exhibitions and start my own business.

449
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,800
Then I'll learn to cook a lot of dishes.

450
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,640
I can take care of you.

451
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,239
My ultimate goal

452
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,640
is to be more mature than you.

453
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,439
Enough is enough.

454
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,239
We are like brother and sister.

455
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,959
In other word, like relatives. Am I clear?

456
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,239
Even if we are in the same room,

457
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,680
I won't fall in love with you.

458
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:04,520
Got it?

459
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,479
Well,

460
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,199
I'm really busy these days.

461
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,199
I’ve been troubled by many contracts.

462
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,439
I haven't completed the tasks

463
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,479
assigned by my boss yet.

464
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,640
I really don't want to be trapped

465
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,920
in this kind of things.

466
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,959
Don't put your mind on me anymore.

467
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,560
Let's not waste each other's time,

468
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:27,719
okay?

469
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,719
I was ready

470
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,400
to be rejected by you a hundred times.

471
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,079
This is the second time.

472
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:35,839
It's okay.

473
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,439
I'm not afraid of your rejections,

474
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,280
but your ignorance.

475
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,040
Don't beat around the bush.

476
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,959
How on earth will you give up?

477
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,680
Although we've achieved our goal,

478
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,760
it's not the time to rest on the laurels.

479
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,199
The focus of the next stage

480
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,079
should be on the output of high-quality content.

481
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,959
Improve user growth with high-quality content.

482
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:56,680
Luluo's pilot is popular with netizens

483
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,800
as our first foray into the streamer market.

484
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,239
I think

485
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,000
we should expand this business as soon as possible

486
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,479
By the way, Pang.

487
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,040
These popular streamers

488
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,319
are all our candidates.

489
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,680
Among them, the most popular one

490
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,719
that best matches our audience

491
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,880
is Ah Qiao.

492
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,119
Not her.

493
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,920
I've contacted her two months ago,

494
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
but she

495
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,880
is really hard to deal with.

496
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,000
Use your head and go upstream.

497
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,119
I'll try again.

498
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,479
Only one question to Qingyou

499
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
before implementing the plan.

500
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,560
What's for lunch?

501
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,479
You guys go to eat.

502
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,000
I want to take a rest alone.

503
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,400
Bye, see you in the afternoon.

504
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,800
Then we'll go.

505
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,359
Okay.

506
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,520
Go.

507
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,119
Have you noticed that Qingyou is a little different recently?

508
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,560
Sister Qingyou seems a little different recently.

509
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,959
Good mood and ruddy complexion.

510
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,520
Could it be that

511
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,839
she's in love again?

512
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,400
Are you kidding?

513
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,280
Sister Qingyou devoted herself to work.

514
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,359
Don't like you guys.

515
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,280
One loves food,

516
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,079
the other loves handsome guys.

517
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,280
Let's go to have lunch.

518
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,560
Mr. Mo

519
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,680
The compensation plan for the breach of appointment is done.

520
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,959
Please review it.

521
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,119
Director Xu

522
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,239
I've been waiting for your plan for a long time.

523
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,040
Have a look.

524
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,920
The place is up to me.

525
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,439
Why are you bringing me here?

526
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,800
What do you think?

527
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,319
It's the noon.

528
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,359
The break.

529
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,479
What are you thinking?

530
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,040
So what?

531
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,359
I object.

532
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
I stayed in the hospital all night yesterday

533
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,040
and I am exhausted now.

534
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,040
Objection overruled.

535
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,880
Don't forget our promise.

536
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,199
The place

537
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,359
is up to me.
