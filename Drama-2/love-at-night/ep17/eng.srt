Love at Night
EP17

2
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,080
Mr. Mo

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,639
What do you think of

4
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:36,480
our team-building event?

5
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:37,160
Not bad.

6
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,879
It's much more interesting than that of Shangger.

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,919
Then welcome to join us

8
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:41,440
in future team-building activities.

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,559
OK.

10
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,919
Brother Lingze

11
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,440
Will you attend an investor's reception

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
the day after tomorrow?

13
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,120
Pretty well informed.

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,519
Of course.

15
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,440
I just got a couture dress

16
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,760
and I'm waiting for an opportunity to wear it.

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,160
Then I'm afraid you don't have a chance.

18
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,720
I have a female companion, sorry.

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,080
You guys go ahead.

20
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,599
I got to go.

21
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,440
We're not drunk,

22
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,880
we're true love.

23
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,279
For all the work you've been up all night doing,

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,240
I really admire your true love.

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,440
But Qi doesn't think so.

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,399
She treated me like that,

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,199
how could she deny it when she woke up?

28
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,520
I should have filmed it

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
as evidence.

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,160
She's a girl with poetry in her heart,

31
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:43,279
and you're a boy with shit in your heart.

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,320
Don't look at me like that.

33
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,720
I'm not Qi.

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,880
Dayan

35
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,199
What should I do?

36
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,240
Am I just done with this?

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,520
No story?

38
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,080
Stories come out of your own mouth.

39
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,600
Well.

40
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,320
It's okay to be rejected.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
The most important thing for you right now

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,559
is to maintain your identity

43
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,720
as Qi's roommate

44
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,880
and not get evicted.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,199
As the saying goes:

46
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,960
Where there is life, there is hope.

47
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,800
As long as she doesn't really reject you,

48
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,600
you can impress her

49
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:17,960
with your enthusiasm,

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,880
activeness

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,919
and diligence.

52
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,960
And the following matters can be discussed in the long term.

53
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,039
That makes sense.

54
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,080
Take it easy.

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,440
As long as she doesn't kick me out.

56
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,000
Move. I want to move in right away.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,559
Requirements?

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,199
I don't have any special requirements.

59
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,119
A one-bedroom apartment

60
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,399
with fine decoration is okay.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,479
And the most important is to be able to move in immediately.

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,240
Money's no object.

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,720
OK, OK, OK.

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,320
Thank you very much.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He must be moved away.

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,000
If not,

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,600
I don't know what's gonna happen.

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,919
Fang Qi, I'm at the supermarket.

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,639
What would you like to eat tonight?

70
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,679
I have prepared three set meals.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,119
They are grilled lamb chops,

72
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,559
and braised beef brisket in red wine.

73
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,440
How could I be moved by this?

74
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,239
I've bought all three.

75
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm on my way home now.

76
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's have dinner together tonight.

77
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,040
Mr. Mo, I don't think Miss Lin's leg is well yet.

78
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,839
Shall I see her off?

79
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,279
And you and Director Xu please go back first.

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,480
OK.

81
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,440
Brother Lingze

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,720
If you change your mind about the reception,

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,160
let me know.

84
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,760
Although I am very busy every day,

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,359
and my schedule is quite full,

86
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,760
but if you ask,

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,480
I'll be there immediately.

88
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:12,880
I know.

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,119
Let's go, Director Xu.

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,519
It’s all your fault.

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,239
You always tell me to be noble.

92
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,239
I am noble now,

93
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,519
but Brother Lingze

94
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,799
still go with another girl.

95
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,480
Look at your leg now,

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,559
and you still want to go.

97
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,040
You can have a rest and recover at home,

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,480
it's not too late to go another day.

99
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Not late?

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,640
He said he had another date.

101
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,200
My leg is hurt.

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,399
I ran to him

103
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,880
and didn't even say a word.

104
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,440
You owe me as I helped you as a relationship instructor all night.

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,920
Well, well.

106
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,760
I remembered that there is something urgent at company,

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,559
so I have to go.

108
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,519
The team building event is on the weekend,

109
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,200
what's the urgent matter for the company?

110
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,519
Weekly reports.

111
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,799
I haven't written my weekly reports yet.

112
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,000
You can do it at home.

113
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,320
I don't think it's convenient to write at home.

114
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,279
Xu Qingyou, are you avoiding me?

115
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,200
Can't you just pretend I'm false respect

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,720
and suddenly get a little timid?

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,679
Well,

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,239
is it stressful to be with me?

119
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,359
Actually, it's not serious.

120
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:18,239
Hello?

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,640
Kill you three thousand.

122
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,279
Fang Qi is looking for me in a hurry. I need to go.

123
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,720
Hey, where are you?

124
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,359
Kill you three thousand?

125
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,119
Fang Qi

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,399
Fang Qi

127
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,720
What’s the matter?

128
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,559
I’m exhausted.

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,640
And you set up

130
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,519
the highest alert "kill you three thousand".

131
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,399
I remember the last time you said it

132
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,640
is when you divorced your ex-husband.

133
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,720
Let me catch my breath.

134
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,679
What the hell is wrong with you?

135
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,239
I can't say it.

136
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,200
Couldn't say?

137
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
Have a drink, then you can...

138
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,239
I won't drink anymore.

139
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,640
It's not good.

140
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,679
Drinking leads to mistakes and regrets easily.

141
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,479
You made mistakes?

142
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,239
No, no.

143
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,640
I'm kidding.

144
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,719
How could I make mistakes?

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,799
I just want to stop drinking

146
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,239
from now on.

147
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,039
Let's

148
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,159
turn grief into appetite,

149
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,479
and eat two bowls of cold noodles.

150
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,599
Director Xu, you don’t wanna eat your own words, do you?

151
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,520
Hello.

152
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,520
Cold noodles are not OK.

153
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,280
What's wrong with cold noodles?

154
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,039
Cold noodles are too cold and may hurt stomach.

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,679
Didn't you say cold food

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,239
is bad for your stomach?

157
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,840
It won't be cold after eating.

158
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,640
Director Xu, my patience is limited!

159
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,159
Fang Qi, when will you be back?

160
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,039
I made you soup. Waiting for you.

161
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,440
Let me sleep over

162
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,119
at your house tonight.

163
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm just about to say that I haven't been to your place for a long time.

164
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,119
Why don't we…

165
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,119
Pair five.

166
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,039
Pair nine.

167
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,119
Pair Ace.

168
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:21,960
Pair two.

169
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
Bomb.

170
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,799
Sorry, rocket.

171
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,039
I made a mistake and I regret it.

172
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,479
Wait.

173
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,280
Let me make a change.

174
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,440
No way.

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,119
Eh.

176
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,799
Here's a song for you:

177
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,479
why do women baffle women?

178
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,559
Sorry, I'm a man.

179
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:42,919
Open your mouth.

180
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,760
OK.

181
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Fortunately, we can stay overnight here.

182
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,280
And it's great to grow up.

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,159
Even if we don't go home, we don't need to call parents.

184
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,719
Yeah, we just come out to relax.

185
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,679
It's definitely not because of something on our mind.

186
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
It's certainly not because of

187
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,159
doing something terrifying.

188
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,440
It's not because of some tough problem.

189
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,400
How scary is it?

190
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Really scary.

191
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,880
How tricky is it?

192
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,919
Pretty tricky.

193
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,400
If one day

194
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,960
I do something

195
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,599
that you may not be able to accept,

196
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
will you still be with me?

197
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Are you trying to steal my job or my man?

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,119
It's like you have a man.

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,559
If one day

200
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,280
I do something that against myself,

201
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,679
would you laugh at me?

202
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,080
Are you making any progress with Poker Face?

203
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,039
Tell me about it.

204
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,280
What progress can we make?

205
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,200
No progress at all.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,239
Then you just keep working hard.

207
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,640
I'll teach you some tricks later.

208
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,400
No, thanks.

209
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,799
Your methods don't work on me.

210
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,599
Too superficial.

211
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,960
What's up? Will you retreat?

212
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,400
Not really.

213
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:23,840
I don't have a chance.

214
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,320
What?

215
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,239
Do you think

216
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,119
that adult should be more

217
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,640
cautious about the relationships,

218
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,320
right?

219
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,960
Of course you should be cautious.

220
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
This is called self-preservation.

221
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,640
So keep it quiet

222
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,119
is a customary thing for adults, right?

223
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,799
That's right,

224
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,760
but,

225
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,159
everyone has their own story,

226
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,840
and everyone has their own insistence.

227
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,919
I think

228
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,840
love is mutual understanding

229
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,640
and mutual tolerance.

230
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,479
What do you think?

231
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,719
Long live the understanding.

232
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,320
One more game.

233
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,960
No more stickers.

234
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,520
Why?

235
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,359
You have six,

236
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,080
I only have two.

237
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't remember in my head.

238
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,000
Hurry up.

239
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:10,760
Admit your defeat for bet.

240
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,799
How about eating fruit if I lose?

241
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,520
You shuffle the cards, I won't.

242
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,000
Good times are always short.

243
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
It's time to go home.

244
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,280
But...

245
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,320
What about...

246
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,760
That's too much.

247
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Well.

248
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,719
Just go back home, bye.

249
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,640
Kill you three thousand!

250
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
Don't you have work emails to answer?

251
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,200
Why are you looking at me?

252
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,840
I'm working on it.

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,559
Stop acting.

254
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,520
Thank you.

255
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,239
Work or friends,

256
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,200
Director Xu always put her heart into it.

257
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,760
Then, what about us,

258
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:06,840
when can you figure it out?

259
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,359
I'm not regretting it,

260
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
nor am I unwilling to make it public,

261
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,359
I just...

262
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,080
I just don't want to lie to you.

263
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,799
Because it's really not easy for us to be together,

264
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,159
and we are colleague in the workplace,

265
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,280
so I want to take care of it.

266
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm afraid that once it is made public,

267
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,719
we will be forced to break up.

268
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,119
Break up?

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,119
Do you have no faith in me,

270
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,679
or in yourself?

271
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,559
Of course I have no confidence in myself.

272
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,119
For the last ten years,

273
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,960
I thought I was doing well

274
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,880
in relationships.

275
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,359
And then,

276
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,440
You have seen it.

277
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,520
This is the first time I've been such a tricky situation.

278
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:57,679
I don't know

279
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,440
if I can do well in this relationship,

280
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,359
and I don't know what the outcome will be.

281
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,440
Xu Qingyou

282
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,400
I don't want you to punish yourself

283
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,520
for other's mistakes.

284
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,239
And I certainly wouldn't be like him.

285
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,479
Then

286
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,080
how long will you

287
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,119
get used to my style?

288
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,039
You need to show me your promise.

289
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:27,760
Three months.

290
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
Give me three months,

291
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
I'll do my best.

292
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,440
Three months.

293
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,400
It's okay to keep it private.

294
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,719
Really?

295
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,719
How are you gonna make it up to me?

296
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,039
Make up for you...

297
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,200
I got it. Come with me.

298
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,880
I haven't answered my E-mail yet.

299
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
It's the weekend now.

300
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,919
What are you doing?

301
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,719
What are you doing?

302
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,559
What are you doing?

303
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,159
No, no, no.

304
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,239
What are you thinking about

305
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:01,960
all day long?

306
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,599
Whose is this?

307
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,239
Yours.

308
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,040
Put it on.

309
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,359
This...

310
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,040
Put it on.

311
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,000
How's that?

312
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,199
Is it nice?

313
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,800
How's that?

314
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,479
What do you mean? Not pretty?

315
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:12,719
Just so so.

316
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,040
Just so so.

317
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,640
What do you mean?

318
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Only so-so.

319
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,079
Only so-so.

320
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:18,560
Fine.

321
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,400
I've sent the time and location of the reception

322
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,640
to your phone.

323
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm sorry,

324
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,000
I didn't promise you I'd be there, did I?

325
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,599
Well, who said

326
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,839
she would make up to me?

327
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,839
It's me.

328
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,560
But I regret it.

329
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,479
OK?

330
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,000
No.

331
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:46,839
What's the sound?

332
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,160
Come on, let's eat.

333
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,439
Can I stay here?

334
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,280
No.

335
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,119
You are not a child now,

336
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,439
and it is inconvenient for us to live together.

337
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,880
But you promised me.

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,119
You can't back out.

339
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,199
I promised you at that time

340
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:31,119
because I didn't think so much.

341
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,599
Now that we are adults,

342
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,599
we have to solve the problem

343
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,000
in time when we find it,

344
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,479
right?

345
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,400
Well，

346
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,280
the rent for the house you found for me

347
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
is too high.

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,160
I can't afford it.

349
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,479
I just graduated.

350
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:44,920
You don't have to worry about that.

351
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,439
I'll take care of the rent.

352
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,079
As for the money,

353
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,119
you can pay it back at any time.

354
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,160
Come on. I'll take it for you.

355
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,280
I, I have a lot of deliveries to pick up.

356
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,520
I'll bring it to you when them arrive.

357
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,239
I haven't told my sister yet.

358
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,560
I'll tell her.

359
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,199
Well,

360
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,560
before you grant me death,

361
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,000
please give me one last wish.

362
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:08,640
Come on.

363
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,319
Uh,

364
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,079
before I leave,

365
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,640
I want to make one last meal for you.

366
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,640
Wasn't there always a meal for prisoners

367
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,920
before death in ancient?

368
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,199
OK.

369
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,000
OK, go.

370
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,239
Let's get started.

371
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,239
Maybe

372
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,680
I can stay?

373
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,199
We just said it.

374
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,359
Just eat it and go.

375
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,319
Have you noticed any changes

376
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,800
in your house recently?

377
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,119
No.

378
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,520
I like you.

379
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,920
You were drunk that day,

380
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,880
and you might not remember what I said.

381
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,239
Then I will

382
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,479
say it seriously again.

383
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:39,959
Fang Qi

384
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,800
I've liked you for a long time.

385
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,680
When you were running

386
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,680
in a white dress in the sunflower field,

387
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,599
the first time,

388
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,599
I already fell in love with you.

389
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:52,920
You may not know that

390
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,160
the day you got married

391
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,760
was the darkest day in my life;

392
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,719
the day you got divorced

393
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,880
was the saddest day in my life.

394
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,640
Because I saw you

395
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,599
crying alone,

396
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,239
but I didn't know

397
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,400
how to comfort you.

398
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,280
Fang Qi

399
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm really serious.

400
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,359
I don't think that kiss

401
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,400
is a joke.

402
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,400
I really want to protect you all my life.

403
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,439
Stop it.

404
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,560
I haven't finished.

405
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,599
Do you want to hear me?

406
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,439
Firstly,

407
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,199
on the day of my divorce, I didn't cry,

408
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,000
and I was very happy to order Japanese food.

409
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,719
You saw me crying,

410
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
maybe it was because I add too much mustard.

411
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Besides,

412
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,199
stop telling me

413
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,479
about sunflower fields.

414
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,520
Actually I'm allergic to pollen.

415
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,160
Since I was a child,

416
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,280
I've been to the sunflower field only once.

417
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,680
It's because they played pranks

418
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,640
and threw my keys into it.

419
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,319
Lastly,

420
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,760
Xu Wei, I want to tell you

421
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,119
I'm a face-saving woman

422
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,760
with strong self-esteem.

423
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,599
If I find that the other person

424
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,040
show a little bit dislike,

425
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,119
I will sentence the relationship

426
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,160
to death.

427
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,400
From your description of me just now,

428
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:21,800
I can feel that

429
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,520
you have imagined a better me.

430
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,079
I...

431
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,199
Maybe

432
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,560
the person you like

433
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,520
is just the Fang Qi in your imagination.

434
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,560
Of course not.

435
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,199
I know you so well.

436
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,000
We've known each other for a long time.

437
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,319
I advise you to be a good younger brother,

438
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,119
so that our relationship

439
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,599
will last longer.

440
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,920
But that day...

441
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,479
I've told you

442
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,439
a thousand times.

443
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
I was drunk.

444
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
And I made a mistake.

445
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,040
If you need an apology.

446
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,560
I'm really sorry.

447
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,760
I don't need your apology.

448
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:11,599
I just want to ask you,

449
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,319
have you never liked me?

450
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,239
Xu Wei

451
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,400
It is meaningless now.

452
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,880
The house locates in the city center,

453
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,040
very close to your studio,

454
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,000
and it's convenient to work.

455
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,239
You don't have to

456
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,479
worry about the rent,

457
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,800
you don't need to pay it back.

458
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,640
You don't need to spend money,

459
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,560
I'll find it myself.

460
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:57,040
Find it yourself? Where are you going to stay?

461
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,560
Are you caring about me?

462
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,920
Wherever you live.

463
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,040
Just eat.

464
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,719
I won't send you off.

465
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,079
Go ahead.

466
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,839
Hello?

467
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,359
I made a lot of meals for you,

468
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
and divided them into three lunch boxes,

469
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,959
and put them on the top of the refrigerator.

470
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,760
So that you can eat it for three days

471
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,560
before it's stale.

472
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:43,800
I see.

473
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,920
You should eat less.

474
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,520
Just eat.

475
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,119
Look at you!

476
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,079
I'm not eating. I want to lose weight!

477
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,959
You don’t need to lose weight,

478
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,719
you are so thin.

479
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,400
Mr. Mo

480
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,680
Why does Mr. Mo come today?

481
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,520
Mr. Mo, this way please.

482
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,239
He must be here for Mr. Zhai.

483
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:38,839
By the way,

484
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:39,800
I heard that

485
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,280
Mr. Mo seems to have taken the investment of Taikang Biological Project.

486
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Is it the titan that is making a lot of noise?

487
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,719
That's a leading company.

488
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,479
Great.

489
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,239
Yes.

490
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,479
Many big men want this case.

491
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,520
Unexpectedly, Mr. Mo won

492
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,280
so many established companies by himself.

493
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,239
That's amazing.

494
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,280
A man like Mr. Mo

495
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,119
is not only successful in his career,

496
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,599
but also looks so handsome.

497
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:06,719
He is simply my ideal man.

498
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You?

499
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,479
Stop dreaming.

500
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,520
Mr. Mo's girlfriend must be like

501
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,719
the little princess of Golden Capital,

502
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,239
right?

503
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,280
I don't think so.

504
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:25,800
Don't you boys all like

505
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,119
the empty-headed beauty?

506
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,319
You?

507
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,280
Not always.

508
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,439
I think

509
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,239
the strong woman

510
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,520
also goes well with Mr. Mo.

511
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,119
Win-win co-operation, perfect pair.

512
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,959
Qingyou, isn't it?

513
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,680
A man

514
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,160
looks so good,

515
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,280
and is single with wealth.

516
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,439
He must be...

517
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,680
Waiting for someone.

518
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,359
Uh.

519
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:48,479
Uh

520
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,719
He must have set high standards

521
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,760
for the one.

522
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,640
It figures.

523
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,680
We mortals just forget it.

524
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,319
Director Xu

525
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,719
You've said to practice the hard mode,

526
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,479
don't be late.

527
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:58,239
Let's eat something.

528
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,079
Qingyou

529
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,839
Have you seen this?

530
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,040
Anyone who has been employed for more than five years can participate.

531
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,280
Would you like to try?

532
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,839
Let's have a look.

533
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:08,680
What?

534
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,560
What?

535
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,280
This.

536
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,880
Would you like to try it?

537
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,359
No, I have no chance.

538
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
Can I?

539
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,640
You want to try?

540
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,119
A bit hard.

541
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,000
In your dreams.

542
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:22,920
All right.

543
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,760
With such elites as Qingyou,

544
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,920
I'd better to do my own work.

545
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,439
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,359
Remember to turn over.

547
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,680
You said too much.

548
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,839
There's one thing I'm still thinking.

549
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,199
About the competition?

550
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,239
How do you know?

551
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,359
Investors have the responsibility to follow

552
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,680
the personnel changes of the client company.

553
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,560
I forgot.

554
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
You're a big contributor to our company.

555
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:08,920
Well,

556
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,199
Director Xu is afraid?

557
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,760
I'm not scared.

558
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,439
I just haven’t made up my mind yet.

559
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,760
Why do you want to compete the job?

560
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,479
I've been in Lemi since graduation,

561
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,560
and have been with Lemi all the way till now.

562
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,760
My feelings for Lemi

563
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,880
are not easy to explain in a few words.

564
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,319
I want to do more for Lemi,

565
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,319
and I want to prove that

566
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,640
and I want to prove that I can be trusted.

567
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,719
No matter what decision you make,

568
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,599
the most important thing is to be responsible for yourself.

569
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,599
Decided?

570
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,599
I had it all figured out.

571
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,640
But thank you for the encouragement.

572
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,160
Thanks have to be sincere.

573
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,040
Then this meal is on me.

574
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,359
Please show me

575
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,560
what else you have later

576
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,439
and I'll pick something out.

577
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,719
