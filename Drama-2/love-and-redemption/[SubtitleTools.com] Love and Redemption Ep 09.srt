00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,448
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:06,582
<i>EPISODE 9</i>

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,759
You’re wearing this mask because of me.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,599
But don’t worry, I’ll find a way to
remove the Loveless Mask for you.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,559
I told you before. This was my decision.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,159
Brother Liu, you don’t
need to blame yourself.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,399
To become emotionless and focus on
my training is a good thing as well.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,519
How is that a good thing?

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,239
Our training is hard enough by itself.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,198
But now, you have to
force yourself to be emotionless as well.

11
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,561
That’ll make your life meaningless,
you know?

12
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:45,959
It’s not a good thing.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,639
It’s fine. Don’t worry.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,888
I’ll definitely find a solution for you.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,980
By the way,

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,639
come out now.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,948
Come out.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,418
I’ll return you your spirit beast.

19
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:07,119
Ascending the Heavenly Realm
was tough indeed.

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,890
Silver Snake, you were naughty.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,730
Thank you, Brother Liu.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,010
Why are you thanking me?

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,799
Okay.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,060
I’ll leave now.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,090
Xuan Ji, are you done with your training?

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,918
Ling Long.

27
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,837
Isn’t this the bell Si Feng gave you?

28
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:40,207
I’m sure you kept in touch, right?

29
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,532
How is he doing?

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,760
Senior Hao Chen confiscated

31
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,799
everything I had when I went to
Xuyang Peak.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,039
That’s why I didn’t contact him
for four years.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,239
You didn’t contact him at all?

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,519
Xuan Ji, before Si Feng left,

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,219
he wanted you to contact him
once you woke up, you know?

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,349
Besides, even if he did
confiscate everything,

37
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,127
you could still write him letters.

38
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,719
Write letters?

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,829
I was busy with my training every day.

40
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,080
I never thought about that.

41
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:09,216
You’re too heartless.

42
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,507
Did you forget him already?

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,268
And you never contacted me as
well after you went to Xuyang Peak.

44
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,159
I would’ve severed my ties with you
if you weren’t my sister.

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,206
Ling Long, how could that be?

46
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,678
I missed you so much.

47
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:25,239
But I think it’s fine
if I keep you all in my heart.

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,919
Besides, sisters and our friends
will stay with us forever, right?

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,799
Initially, I wanted
to finish my training

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,879
as soon as possible so that
I could meet up with you sooner.

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,399
Same goes for Si Feng as well.
We made a promise.

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,279
We’ll train together once
I leave the mountain.

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,679
That’s why I didn’t contact him
for four years.

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,399
That doesn’t matter, right?

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,234
But Xuan Ji, you need to
maintain your relationships.

56
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,519
No one will wait at the same spot for you.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,687
I thought you would’ve
learnt about other things

58
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:52,128
besides your training.

59
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,907
I didn’t expect you to still be
a blockhead in relationships.

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,177
Ling Long, will Si Feng be angry
because I didn’t contact him?

61
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,759
Will he ignore me?

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,719
About that, I
can’t say for sure.

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,008
I’m sure he won’t do that.

64
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,152
Si Feng must be very busy in Lize Palace.

65
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:11,349
He needs to train as well.

66
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,721
I’m sure he forgot about this
due to his busy schedule.

67
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:16,159
It’s fine. I’ll find him immediately
after we leave Mount Shaoyang.

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,305
And the four of us
can roam the world together.

69
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,664
I’m sure it would be fun.

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,383
Have some fruit wine.

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,714
Great wine.

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,650
Xuan Ji, I didn’t ask this before
because it was inconvenient.

73
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,130
Did you find any shards
when you went to Xuyang Peak?

74
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,959
It’s fine. Maybe we could find them
when we roam around.

75
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,690
Sixth Senior, I’ll stop finding them.

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,576
Senior Hao Chen told me that
everyone has a different purpose in life.

77
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:53,266
And I should treat it as such.

78
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,440
I should be protecting
the Mirror of Origin

79
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,759
instead of searching for them
in order to recover my six senses.

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,410
What if I become obsessed with it?

81
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,170
Is that so?

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,770
Did the strange power appear again
during your training?

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,129
That’s good. We won’t look for it then.

84
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,490
Oh right, Sixth Senior, I
have some good stuff for you.

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,284
There’s an immortal tree on Xuyang Peak.

86
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,865
Its fruit is delicious.

87
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:24,053
But it only bears fruit once
every five years.

88
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:28,984
That’s why I’ve saved some
for you, Ling Long, and Si Feng.

89
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,690
You little glutton.
You actually saved some for us?

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,130
Not bad at all. Seems like
my efforts were not in vain.

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,173
You’re unlike your sister at all.

92
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:41,104
I have no idea
what she’s thinking about.

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,879
- Min Yan!
- Ling Long...

94
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,610
Ling Long is going to dance
with a fellow male disciple!

95
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,450
Sixth Senior, what about this?

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,879
Xuan Ji, your senior doesn’t
like the drink and the fruit.

97
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,101
I’ll take them for myself.

98
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,889
I...

99
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:10,239
My lord, after the failure of
Shadow Demon in Shaoyang Sect,

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,930
we’ve planted spies in the four sects
successfully.

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,039
But, due to Shadow Demon’s failure,

102
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,039
and to avoid any further
suspicions, I think we should

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,919
stay in the shadows for now.

104
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,479
We should wait for the right time
to grab the spirit keys.

105
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,079
We still need to wait?

106
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,460
How long do I need to wait?

107
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,250
My lord, we...

108
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,051
Who’s there?

109
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,029
You didn’t manage to locate

110
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,999
the God of War and the Star of Mosha
these few years,

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,799
and you didn’t obtain
the spirit keys as well.

112
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,599
Wolf, aren’t you too merciful?

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,010
Isn’t that the reason
you got nothing done at all?

114
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,639
Wu Tong, do you think you have
the right to speak in this place?

115
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,439
Our lord is keeping you here

116
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,309
because he just wanted you to tell us
more about the Five Great Sects.

117
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,257
Just be a good dog.

118
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:02,188
When you’re a dog,

119
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,290
you shouldn’t just come out
and bark like this.

120
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,959
The Sky Hall only appreciates
capable people.

121
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,519
Those who got nothing done
should just keep quiet.

122
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,959
Wolf, what do you think?

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,810
I just didn’t want to reveal
our true strength too soon.

124
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:20,039
My lord, I just wanted
to avoid casualties

125
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,559
from dealing with the Five Great Sects.

126
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,017
The demon tribe has been
training in secret for 1,000 years.

127
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:26,519
Your strength is much greater
than the Five Great Sects.

128
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,964
If they aren’t willing to
cooperate with us,

129
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:31,199
it’s the best excuse for us
to execute them without mercy.

130
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,425
Why should we hide?

131
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,107
You’re just trying to get your revenge
against the humans who had driven you out.

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,592
Wu Tong, don’t try to manipulate
us due to your personal hatred.

133
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:45,163
It’s precisely because of that.

134
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,919
Only a human knows how to
force another human to submit.

135
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,561
To manipulate and destroy them.

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,581
My lord,

137
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,079
why don’t you give me this chance?

138
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,159
I’ll destroy the Five Great Sects
and obtain the spirit keys.

139
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,797
My lord, Wu Tong is just a dog
who has been driven out from its shelter.

140
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,079
We mustn’t trust him.

141
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,479
But this pathetic dog managed to find out
that the Xuanyuan Sect is lying to you.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,969
- What?
- Someone!

143
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,639
You were misled by
Xuanyuan Sect’s spirit stone all along.

144
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,170
One of the spirit keys was actually
hidden inside the Destiny Pearl.

145
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,290
You didn’t know about that.

146
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,069
Tell us.

147
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,359
Yes!

148
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,319
The spirit key is hidden inside
the Destiny Pearl in our sect.

149
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,429
But only Sect Leader Zhu Shi knows about

150
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,997
the location of the Destiny Pearl.

151
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:58,970
Wolf, you chose the
wrong person to threaten.

152
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,730
Instead of threatening those
who are loyal to the sect,

153
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,359
isn’t it easier for you if you threaten
the weaklings in the sect?

154
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,634
Darn it.

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,413
My lord, please give me a chance.

156
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,239
Let me obtain the spirit keys for you.

157
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,697
We’ve been hiding for too long.

158
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:23,570
It’s time to create a scene so
that our prey would be attracted.

159
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,349
Wu Tong, from today onwards,

160
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,920
you’ll be the leader of
Mount Buzhou’s hideout.

161
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,879
The Five Great Sects
can’t reach Mount Buzhou.

162
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,865
You don’t need to fear anything.

163
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,266
You don’t need to fear
the Five Great Sects.

164
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:49,719
You can use any method
to obtain the spirit keys.

165
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,359
Yes, my lord.

166
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,279
The Sky Hall has been
in the shadows for too long.

167
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,650
It’s time for us to make an entrance.

168
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,770
Greetings, Master, Vice Palace Lord.

169
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,959
Si Feng, you’ve
mastered your skill.

170
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,936
I’m very relieved to hear that.

171
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:45,079
You were always the most talented.

172
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,850
As long as you aren’t distracted
and focus on your training,

173
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,599
I’m sure you’ll be the leader
of the Five Great Sects.

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,570
You’ll take over Lize Palace
sooner or later.

175
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,869
My lord, your effort wasn’t wasted.

176
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,880
It’s good that you forced him
to choose this mask.

177
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
Yu Si Feng,

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,944
you mustn’t disappoint your
master and repeat the same mistakes.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,679
Let bygones be bygones.

180
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,079
Just forget about them.

181
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,159
I’m just reminding him.

182
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,586
Although the Loveless Mask
can render him emotionless

183
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,416
and stops him from having any feelings,

184
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:37,387
if he faces a situation where
he couldn’t control himself

185
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,178
and feels for someone,

186
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,752
a Loveless Curse will form
and he’ll be done for.

187
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:46,279
You only talk about useless things.

188
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,850
Si Feng, you do understand the
purpose of the Loveless Mask, right?

189
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,679
By getting rid of emotions, it will
save us from unnecessary trouble.

190
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,966
That’s good to hear.

191
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,370
And you must remember that

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,410
outsiders

193
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,090
are just like mirages.

194
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,959
Your only home is Lize Palace.

195
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,319
Yes, my lord...

196
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,535
I’m not finished yet.

197
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,292
All of you mustn’t risk
your lives for an illusion

198
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,767
that you cannot hold.

199
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,239
And create unnecessary trouble.

200
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,570
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

201
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:34,959
That’s enough.

202
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,319
Let’s return to the main point.

203
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,519
- Vice Palace Lord.
- Do you understand what to do?

204
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,530
Once you exit the palace tomorrow,
you should never break the rules.

205
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,512
I’ve received letters from Shaoyang Sect.

206
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:51,239
They stated that some demons
are causing trouble outside.

207
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,545
Coincidentally, you
will leave the palace soon.

208
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,436
Investigate the matter as well.

209
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,998
Those demons have
nothing to do with us.

210
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,402
They can’t reach Xiyang on either side.

211
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:07,138
If they want to create trouble
in Zhongyuan, just let them be.

212
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,839
Senior, you’re ignoring
everything except for our sect.

213
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,759
But you must respect
the other sect leaders as well.

214
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,730
Since we belong to
one of the Five Great Sects.

215
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,554
You make the shot.

216
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,559
Investigate the matter.

217
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,854
Yes.

218
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,937
Xuan Ji, you have
the Transmission Charm with you.

219
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,828
Do you know your task
when you leave the mountain?

220
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,373
- What’s my task?
- Silly Xuan Ji.

221
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,242
Senior Hao Chen wants you
to write letters to him.

222
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:45,052
But Senior Hao Chen,
we’ll be busy when we leave.

223
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,439
She’ll think it’s troublesome.

224
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,850
Or maybe she’ll forget about it.

225
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,649
Remember to write letters to me.

226
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,039
You’re pure and innocent.
You haven’t recovered your six senses.

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,647
The outside world is complex and chaotic.

228
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:03,279
I was reluctant to let you go,
but I have to abide by the rules.

229
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,570
If not...

230
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,519
So, after you leave, you need
to report to me every single detail.

231
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,519
Firstly, you can reflect on your progress.

232
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,139
Secondly, I can know
your progress as well.

233
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,759
Do you understand?

234
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,770
Yes, Senior Hao Chen.

235
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,174
You must be careful.

236
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,959
You two must remember this.

237
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,383
After you two leave the mountain,
you must deal with situations

238
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,059
according to your own capability.

239
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,430
You two mustn’t be reckless.

240
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,090
Xuan Ji, remember to listen to
your Sixth Senior.

241
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,315
Ling Long, you must
control your temper as well.

242
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:45,680
Father, I know that.

243
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,079
It’s the first time
you two are leaving here.

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,999
Your father is worried.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,155
You must remember his words.

246
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:52,930
Yes, I’ll remember them. I’ll leave now.

247
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,370
You!

248
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,479
This child...

249
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,039
Father, Aunt Ying Hong, Senior Hao Chen,

250
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,422
don’t worry. We know what to do.

251
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,319
Master, Aunt Ying Hong, don’t worry.

252
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,290
I’ll take good care of them.

253
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,343
- Ling Long, wait for us!
- Ling Long!

254
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:15,673
Wait for me!

255
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,810
This is so beautiful!
We finally left the mountain!

256
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,282
This is too beautiful!

257
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,199
Senior Hao Chen, we
had another uneventful day.

258
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,759
Today, Sixth Senior ordered
a dish that was not tasty

259
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,130
at a restaurant on Mount Mengxi.

260
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,916
It’s not delicious?

261
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,875
Fine, we won’t order that tomorrow.

262
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,092
We can save some money as well.

263
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,424
This is great!

264
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:37,559
We’ll go to Xishu tomorrow.
There are many delicious food over there.

265
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,090
There are pork trotter jelly,
cold noodles, and peppered chicken.

266
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,358
You’re going to finish our money soon.

267
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:49,399
We can only depend on Si Feng
in Lize Palace later on.

268
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,546
We’ve been out for seven days.

269
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:53,079
But there are no demons to be seen.

270
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,199
I don’t feel like a hero at all.

271
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,839
Look at the letters Xuan Ji
wrote for Senior Hao Chen.

272
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,450
I’m so happy today.
I’ve eaten a lot today.

273
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,878
Okay, we’ve finished
our mission for today.

274
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,764
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

275
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,536
Senior Hao Chen, we
had another uneventful day.

276
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:17,219
Today, Sixth Senior ordered
a dish that was not tasty

277
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,590
at a restaurant on Mount Mengxi.

278
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,250
It’s lucky that the vegetables
were delicious.

279
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,970
I’m happy today.

280
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,410
Where are we? We should ask someone.

281
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,781
Excuse me.

282
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,039
Sorry for the interruption.

283
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,079
Judging by your attire,
I’m sure you are cultivators.

284
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,039
Do you know how long it will take
for us to reach Mount Shaoyang?

285
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,179
Mister, are you going to Mount Shaoyang
because there are demons around?

286
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,439
Yes.

287
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,090
We came from Wangxian Town.

288
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,503
Demons are wreaking havoc
in our town these days.

289
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,428
They cried in the middle of the night.

290
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,638
All of us were too afraid to go out.

291
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,319
This situation has lasted for
three months. This can’t continue on.

292
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,830
After that, a wandering priest
told us that

293
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:13,364
Shaoyang Sect is famous
for slaying demons.

294
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,119
That’s why we’re trying to
seek their help.

295
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,599
Wangxian Town?

296
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,759
We need to pass by there before
we reach Lize Palace and Xuanyuan Sect.

297
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,079
We can meet Si Feng
after we slay the demons.

298
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,279
This is great! We finally
have demons to slay!

299
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,781
Mister, we have decided
to slay the demons for you.

300
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,032
But...

301
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,669
You three are?

302
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,026
We’re members of the Shaoyang Sect.

303
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,305
This is our name tag.

304
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,952
Mister, please tell us more
about the demons.

305
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:42,719
We will try our best to help.

306
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,250
I think you are too young.

307
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,185
These two ladies look
very fresh and innocent.

308
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:51,239
I think you shouldn’t
sacrifice your lives for this.

309
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,199
I think we should seek for
your master’s help instead.

310
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,239
- Goodbye.
- Wait!

311
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,599
Mister, wait a minute.

312
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,079
We may look young, but we’re
famous in the pugilist world.

313
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,519
Especially this girl.

314
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,479
She may look weak and feeble,

315
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,433
but she can slay
dozens of demons at one go.

316
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:11,130
Dozens of demons?

317
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,039
- They’re pretty good.
- Sixth Senior,

318
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,580
since when could I slay dozens of demons?

319
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:18,759
You defeated Shadow Demon
and his clones, right?

320
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,279
That’s a different matter!

321
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,125
This is a rare chance.
We should grab hold of it.

322
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,410
I’m her senior.

323
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,655
As for her,

324
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,919
she’s not important.

325
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,239
Little Six!

326
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,979
We came down the mountain
in order to slay demons.

327
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,073
You don’t need to
travel far to seek help.

328
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,093
Since that’s the case, please help us out.

329
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,285
In Wangxian Town, there’s Mount Haiwan.

330
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,536
On that mountain, there’s a grass
called Zhuyu Grass.

331
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,370
And only our town has that grass.

332
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,044
But the strange thing is
it can’t be planted.

333
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:05,842
It can only grow on its own.

334
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:08,442
But three months ago,

335
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:11,493
some of our townsfolk went
to pick some Zhuyu Grass.

336
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,710
But all of them were
devoured by demons.

337
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:24,599
After that, some brave youngsters
went up the mountain as well.

338
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,257
But they never came back.

339
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:30,839
Mister, do you have any idea
what the demon looks like?

340
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,359
The demon always assaulted
people from the back.

341
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,359
That’s why nobody
has seen their true face.

342
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,337
I have a grandson
who only learnt how to speak recently.

343
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:44,890
Two days ago, he said
he saw a demon that cried.

344
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,506
It cries, it has two huge talons,
and it can fly as well.

345
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:52,479
But he’s just a child. I don’t think
we should treat this seriously.

346
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,045
It has wings,

347
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:57,005
and it cries as well?

348
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:58,999
Isn’t that scary?

349
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,593
Ling Long, look.

350
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:05,410
From the Demon Manual, a
demon who cries and has wings,

351
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,370
- it is a Quru Bird?
- Quru Bird?

352
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,330
But it didn’t state that the demon
likes to eat Zhuyu Grass.

353
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,827
Is it possible that someone is behind this

354
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:20,079
in order to obtain more provision?

355
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,143
Since that’s the case, we must act now.

356
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:23,354
Let’s check it out.

357
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,359
We must be cautious later on.

358
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,176
It’s just a Quru Bird.

359
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:38,890
Since it likes to eat, I’ll give it
a taste of my power.

360
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,583
I’m sure there are more than one of them.
We must be careful.

361
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:44,274
Even ten of them won’t scare me away.

362
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,890
It’s really desolate here.

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,970
Of course. There are demons
roaming around.

364
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,128
The Zhuyu Grass is pretty fragrant.

365
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:21,570
Ling Long, it’s such a waste
since Zhuyu Grass is delicious.

366
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,999
Xuan Ji, it’s dirty, you know?
Why are you eating it?

367
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,319
- Ling Long, it’s delicious. Try it.
- No way.

368
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,253
- Sixth Senior?
- I’ll skip this time.

369
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,787
Silly girl.

370
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,599
Ling Long, look.

371
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,827
The cuts are uneven.

372
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,591
I don’t think this is caused
by something sharp.

373
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:39,058
It looks like it was ripped.

374
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,319
You’re right.

375
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,719
- Look here.
- Seems like we’re facing a tough demon.

376
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,194
Little Six, why are you so timid?

377
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,445
- You’re afraid of this?
- You!

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,323
I smell a demon.

379
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,570
Watch out!

380
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,759
- It’s the Quru Bird!
- It has escaped!

381
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,968
Let’s chase after it!

382
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,129
What a strong demonic scent!

383
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,199
I smell that too.
It’s thick and disgusting.

384
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,439
It stinks!

385
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,850
It’s dark down there.
We don’t have a clear view.

386
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,066
- Xuan Ji!
- Ling Long, be careful!

387
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:18,479
Ling Long, are you okay?

388
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,856
I’m fine. You must be careful.

389
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,039
Little Six!

390
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,409
Ling Long!

391
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,119
Ling Long, are you okay?

392
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,373
I’m fine.

393
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,199
Be careful!

394
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,493
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

395
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,170
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

396
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,690
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

397
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,638
Si Feng?

398
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,897
Si Feng!

399
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,239
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

400
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,533
Xuan Ji!

401
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,383
Why are you bleeding?

402
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,675
I’m fine.

403
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:03,875
Silly girl, you’re not fine.

404
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:05,806
I’m Ruo Yu from Lize Palace.

405
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:07,119
Greetings.

406
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,970
Si Feng will return later, right?

407
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,228
Miss, Si Feng is...

408
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:14,510
We’re his friends. This is great.

409
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,538
I didn’t expect to see him here.

410
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,145
You said you were his friends?

411
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,604
That is bizarre.

412
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,300
What’s bizarre?

413
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:25,559
I heard that the members of

414
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,279
Lize Palace weren’t supposed
to make friends with outsiders, right?

415
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,523
But Si Feng is different from others.

416
00:28:30,524 --> 00:28:33,010
- There are no exceptions.
- Si Feng is an exception.

417
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,519
Si Feng!

418
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,839
Did you capture it?

419
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,959
The Quru Bird fled because
it was frightened.

420
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,251
It fled?

421
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,559
It’s all because of you three.

422
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,423
- You!
- Save your breath.

423
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:48,714
Ruo Yu, let’s go.

424
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,948
Si Feng!

425
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,330
Si Feng, is this really you?

426
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,919
You got yourself a new mask.

427
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,799
I almost couldn’t recognize you.

428
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,218
I thought my skills would’ve been
better after four years.

429
00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:06,039
I thought I could protect everyone.

430
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,682
But I didn’t expect you
to improve this much.

431
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:10,490
You saved me once again.

432
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,266
Quru Birds hunt in groups.

433
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:17,709
We need a tactic to hunt them down.

434
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,239
Next time, you
better prepare yourselves.

435
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,570
Don’t create trouble for other people.

436
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,199
Si Feng, my brother, long time no see.

437
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,039
Si Feng, it’s been four years
since we have met.

438
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,847
We wanted to find you in Lize Palace.

439
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,683
Let go! All of you,
stay away from Si Feng!

440
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:34,199
You’re rude! Who exactly are you?

441
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,759
That is none of your concern.

442
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,081
Please calm down.

443
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:39,879
She is Miss Lu Yan Ran
from Dianjinggu Sect.

444
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,358
She was separated from her friends.

445
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,039
That’s why she’s travelling with us.

446
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,639
- We...
- We’re not here to save you.

447
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,021
We prepared an ambush for the demons.

448
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:48,775
We were waiting for them
to return to their nest.

449
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:51,928
But you just came
and went all out on them.

450
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:53,455
And that messed up our plan.

451
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:55,331
How should we know you have a plan?

452
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,714
You speak as if this is our fault.

453
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:59,004
Wasn’t it your fault?

454
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,540
Si Feng, since we didn’t
manage to find their nest,

455
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,039
we should return to our inn and rest.

456
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,049
Sure! Where are you staying?
We can stay together.

457
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,791
And we can travel together afterwards.

458
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,322
We’re not going on the same path.

459
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,319
Miss Xuan Ji, first, we need to help
Miss Lu find her friends.

460
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,599
So, it’s inconvenient for us
to travel together.

461
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,959
Please forgive us.

462
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,495
Save your breath. Let’s go.

463
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:24,737
Si Feng, are you leaving us?

464
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:26,064
We missed you.

465
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:28,159
And we’ve finally met after so long.
Please don’t leave.

466
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,319
That’s right. Why are you leaving us?

467
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,493
Si Feng, are you angry
at us because Xuan Ji

468
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,024
didn’t contact you at all?

469
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,639
Yes. Ling Long said you
must’ve been waiting for my news.

470
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,679
Si Feng, I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

471
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,159
- But the Sound Bell...
- No.

472
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,995
I lost mine as well.

473
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:49,646
It’s an useless item.

474
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,304
That’s good. I knew it.

475
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:54,882
Si Feng, you were so busy.

476
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:57,136
There’s no need for us
to contact each other, right?

477
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:59,927
- Since we’ll meet anyway.
- I’m busy indeed.

478
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:01,879
I won’t waste any time here.

479
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,917
- Si Feng!
- Everyone, farewell for now.

480
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,290
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

481
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,690
- Xuan Ji, what’s wrong?
- Xuan Ji!

482
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,424
What’s going on?

483
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,079
Xuan Ji was poisoned.

484
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,770
Wait, Quru Birds aren’t poisonous.

485
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,999
Si Feng, seems like
Miss Xuan Ji has a serious injury.

486
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,519
We...

487
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,866
Are we going to leave them for real?

488
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,355
Si Feng, I heard that your sect
is an expert in neutralising poison.

489
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,166
Are you really going to ignore her?

490
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,290
Little Six, will Xuan Ji be fine?

491
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,119
But the Demon Manual stated
that Quru Birds aren’t poisonous.

492
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,719
How did this happen?

493
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,954
You’re right.

494
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:18,439
That’s why we suspect that
someone is manipulating them.

495
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,839
And the manipulator must’ve applied
poison on their talons.

496
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,959
We would’ve captured that demon
if it weren’t for someone.

497
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,759
But in the end? We’re stuck here
because of them.

498
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,158
Such bad luck.

499
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,062
What do you mean by that?
Si Feng is our old friend.

500
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,279
We will travel together sooner or later.

501
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,514
And we still have plenty of things
to catch up as well.

502
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:37,086
You can leave if you don’t want to stay.

503
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,559
You are thinking too much.

504
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,359
Si Feng has nothing to catch up
with you.

505
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,799
Didn’t you see that?
He ignored you just now.

506
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,985
- You!
- To me, you are here because the Quru Birds are too strong

507
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:50,783
and you wanted to seek Si Feng’s help
to defeat them.

508
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:53,079
- You!
- Some people are useless by themselves.

509
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,919
That’s why they want to seek help
from Lize Palace.

510
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,174
I...

511
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,384
What?

512
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:01,676
Stop it now.

513
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,539
Si Feng.

514
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:13,010
Si Feng, don’t leave.

515
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,450
Si Feng.

516
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:19,781
Don’t leave me.

517
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:24,599
I had just neutralized the poison.

518
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,770
You better not move around.

519
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:37,640
Si Feng, I know you’re angry.

520
00:33:38,202 --> 00:33:39,599
I was too dumb.

521
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,798
When I went to Xuyang Peak
for my training with Senior Hao Chen,

522
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,388
he confiscated the Sound Bell you gave me

523
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:50,679
because he didn’t want me
to be distracted.

524
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,211
And I didn’t think of other ways
I could use to contact people.

525
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:57,768
That’s why I didn’t write one letter
to Ling Long nor Sixth Senior.

526
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,519
Ling Long was very angry with me.

527
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,210
You don’t need to explain that to me.

528
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,610
It’s fine even if
we didn’t contact each other.

529
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,860
Si Feng, why are you
still trying to leave?

530
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:11,211
We wanted to find you
in Lize Palace initially.

531
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:13,434
Isn’t it a great thing when
we meet each other here?

532
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:15,479
Why are you still insisting on leaving?

533
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,399
Why must we stay together?

534
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,567
Because we made a promise.

535
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:23,690
The four of us are
going to travel together, right?

536
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,582
So childish.

537
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,690
Is that so?

538
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,290
But after that, I realized that

539
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:32,273
nothing is permanent in this world.

540
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,330
Same goes for a friend’s promise.

541
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,079
Si Feng.

542
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,279
I don’t understand.

543
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,879
- Initially...
- I did promise you

544
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,823
that I’ll find the Mirror of Origin
with you initially.

545
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,194
And I will keep my promise.

546
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,959
I obtained one shard by accident.

547
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,123
Here.

548
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,610
Si Feng, I didn’t mean that.

549
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,450
And, regarding the Mirror of Origin,

550
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,370
I don’t need it

551
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,330
anymore.

552
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,711
Senior Hao Chen said that
I will become obsessed

553
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:16,119
with desire and
greed if I search for it.

554
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,799
It’s not good for my training.

555
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,420
So, I promised Senior Hao Chen
that I won’t search for it anymore

556
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,631
after I leave the mountain.

557
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,850
But Si Feng, I still need to thank you.

558
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,339
So,

559
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,970
you don’t want to recover
your six senses anymore.

560
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,250
I was born without them.

561
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:45,447
I think it’s fine even if
I don’t recover them.

562
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,010
They don’t seem that important to me.

563
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:54,064
The current Chu Xuan Ji isn’t
that bad anyway, am I right?

564
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,450
The human heart is indecisive

565
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,854
and unstable.

566
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,638
I’ve witnessed it for myself.

567
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:03,323
Si Feng, what did you say?

568
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,345
Since it’s useless to you,

569
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,530
that means we don’t need to meet anymore.

570
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,290
Farewell.

571
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,079
Si Feng!

572
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,558
Si Feng, don’t leave us!

573
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,119
- Si Feng!
- Xuan Ji.

574
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,759
Xuan Ji, why are you here?

575
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,742
Si Feng, did you neutralize the poison?

576
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,920
She can move after some rest.

577
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:24,719
You may leave after some time.

578
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,253
We’ll handle the Quru Birds. Let’s go.

579
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:28,646
- Wait, Si Feng.
- Si Feng.

580
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,079
What do you mean by this?

581
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,559
Aren’t we your companions?

582
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,769
That’s right. I thought we were going to
capture them together?

583
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,566
There’s no need for this many people.
It’s troublesome.

584
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:37,039
That’s not the point.

585
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,479
Si Feng, I thought
this is a happy occasion?

586
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,949
But why are you treating us
like the plague?

587
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,319
You’re trying to avoid us.

588
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,158
Si Feng, what’s wrong with you?

589
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:48,056
Si Feng, there’s no need for explanations.

590
00:36:48,057 --> 00:36:49,359
Let’s go.

591
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,708
Si Feng!

592
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,567
What’s going on?
Why are they approaching us?

593
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:01,877
There are so many of them!

594
00:37:01,878 --> 00:37:03,403
There are too many of them!

595
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:04,694
Set up the barrier!

596
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,610
Why are there so many Quru Birds?

597
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,279
Didn’t you say someone
was manipulating them?

598
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,634
They’re still not leaving
even after the barrier was set up.

599
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,359
I’m afraid they’re trying to trap us here.

600
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,999
You won’t be trapped
if you’re capable enough to break through.

601
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,222
Hero Zhong, you’re quite skilled.

602
00:37:24,223 --> 00:37:26,849
But it’s hard when you have
two amateurs around.

603
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:28,909
Stop looking down on us!

604
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,554
You can leave if you’re that capable!

605
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:34,759
We’ll deal with the birds and the demon
once Xuan Ji recovers her strength.

606
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,959
Miss Lu, it’s fine.
We can escape by ourselves.

607
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,119
Silly girl, she’s not saying that
out of concern!

608
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,159
These Quru Birds
all came out of their nests.

609
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,319
And their talons were coated with poison.

610
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,159
It’s too risky to try and break through.

611
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,968
Si Feng, what do you think?

612
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,799
We’ll just destroy their nest then.

613
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,119
- Are you going to use that?
- We must deal with the mastermind first.

614
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,771
It’s better for us to
end this fast as well.

615
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,718
Si Feng, what are you doing?

616
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:02,679
He’s going to cast the secret spell
of Lize Palace, Soul Chaser.

617
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,599
It can detect the location
of the culprit behind this.

618
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,759
Inside the palace,
among the stars,

619
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,074
chase the cursed soul,
with the speed of the wind.

620
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:11,395
Search!

621
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,050
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng, are you okay?

622
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,719
To the west, there are ten caves.

623
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,383
Take the middle cave,
and you’ll reach a valley.

624
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,549
The demon manipulating
the birds is located there.

625
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,774
I’ve injured the demon
and he can’t move around.

626
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,919
You can go and capture him.

627
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,686
Si Feng, we’ll let them go
since they wish to capture it so badly.

628
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:14,799
Your breathing is a mess.
You need to recuperate.

629
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,799
- I’ll stay here and guard over you.
- No need.

630
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,599
That demon is quite powerful.
All of you should go.

631
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,612
- But what if something...
- Stop wasting time!

632
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:25,159
If the demon flees,
I’ll blame it all on you.

633
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,401
Be careful then.
Send us a signal if you’re in danger.

634
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:28,719
Let’s go.

635
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,679
- Si Feng, you...
- Xuan Ji, let’s go.

636
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,868
I...

637
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,665
Si Feng, are you okay?

638
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,039
Why are you here?

639
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,359
I’ve thought about it.
I can’t leave you alone here.

640
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,050
I’ll stay by your side
until you get better.

641
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,194
No need.

642
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,330
Si Feng, you mustn’t rush
the recovery process.

643
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,365
Don’t move. It’s dangerous for you
to activate your energy by force.

644
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,293
Si Feng, why is your breathing
getting more and more unstable?

645
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,519
Do you feel uncomfortable?
Are you in pain?

646
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,909
Why are you sweating so much?

647
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,810
This won’t do. I need to
transfer some of my energy to you.

648
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,298
- But your mask...
- Don’t touch it!

649
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,130
- I want to help you.
- You’re helping me by not touching it.

650
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,250
I knew it. Si Feng was still angry at me
for not contacting him.

651
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,279
What should I do to appease him?

652
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,431
Oh right, what did Sixth
Senior do every time

653
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:51,562
he makes Ling Long angry?

654
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,421
Si Feng.

655
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,395
Why are you sweating so much?

656
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:01,966
You’ll catch a cold.

657
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,192
Here.

658
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,279
What are you doing?

659
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,341
Si Feng, I’m wiping away your sweat.

660
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:15,888
You’ll catch a cold like this.

661
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:18,367
I’m not trying to scold you,
but you’re not taking care of yourself.

662
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:19,938
You can’t do anything without me around.

663
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,316
My sweat is gone.

664
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,454
Si Feng, this dried fruit is very sweet.

665
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,546
I can’t even bear to eat it.
I kept it specially for you.

666
00:41:34,547 --> 00:41:35,757
Try it.

667
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,703
Chu Xuan Ji, what exactly
are you trying to do?

668
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:43,148
I... I’m trying to
make you happy.

669
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:44,439
I’m trying to coax you.

670
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,312
Please don’t be angry anymore.

671
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:48,083
Please don’t hold it against me.

672
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,587
Si Feng.

673
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,759
Isn’t this funny?

674
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,412
Si Feng, please smile.

675
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:12,092
You’ll get younger when you smile.

676
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:13,319
Si Feng.

677
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,770
Chu Xuan Ji, that’s enough.

678
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,919
Isn’t this funny?

679
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,730
Never mind. I have another trick.

680
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,330
Si Feng, let me tell you a joke.

681
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:24,879
Listen closely.

682
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,399
Once, there was a phoenix
who tried to attain nirvana.

683
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,679
Guess what happened in the end?

684
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,976
Listen carefully.

685
00:42:30,977 --> 00:42:33,027
It overheated!

686
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,759
Isn’t it funny?

687
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,052
Si Feng, isn’t that funny?

688
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,536
It’s funny, right?

689
00:42:37,537 --> 00:42:38,867
Answer me.

690
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,199
It’s not funny?

691
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,434
I have another trick up my sleeve.

692
00:42:44,135 --> 00:42:45,879
Si Feng, look.

693
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,999
I’ve hidden a treasure in one of my hand.

694
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,970
Take a guess. If you’re
correct, I’ll give you the treasure.

695
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,279
You think it’s this hand, right?

696
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,490
You’re wrong. There’s nothing inside.

697
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,028
Are you done?

698
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,879
Si Feng, don’t be angry.

699
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,673
Although you’re wrong, I hate
it when our Si Feng gets angry.

700
00:43:07,674 --> 00:43:10,710
So, even though you’re wrong,
I’ll still give you the treasure.

701
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,219
Are they nice?

702
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,966
Sixth Senior used this trick
every time when Ling Long was angry,

703
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:22,330
and he succeeds every time.

704
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:26,925
I like Sixth Senior.

705
00:43:26,926 --> 00:43:28,180
Min Yan?

706
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:29,511
You like Min Yan?

707
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,359
Chu Xuan Ji, listen carefully.

708
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,610
I’m not angry.

709
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:46,999
You can stop your silly acts.

710
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,526
Si Feng, you’re not angry?

711
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,096
Why are you acting like this then?

712
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:54,148
Why did you change so much?

713
00:43:54,149 --> 00:43:56,044
You don’t want us
to be your friends anymore?

714
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:57,375
Do you hate me now?

715
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,690
The pupils of Lize Palace weren’t
supposed to have friends anyway.

716
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,339
There’s nothing for me to like or hate.

717
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,279
Four years are a long time.

718
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,530
It’s normal for people to grow and change.

719
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,839
There’s no need to dwell on the past.

720
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,517
No, you weren’t like this in the past.

721
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:19,801
We had plenty of things
to talk about in the past.

722
00:44:19,802 --> 00:44:21,219
And many things we could share.

723
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,790
You taught me many things as well.

724
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,195
Si Feng, you even told me that

725
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:28,126
meeting me was the best thing
that had happened in your life.

726
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,570
Although I was asleep,
I did hear what you say.

727
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:35,959
I was rash then.

728
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,213
I never think before I speak.

729
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:38,559
You mustn’t hold it to your heart.

730
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,679
- It’s meaningless.
- It’s not.

731
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,919
The past you, and everything you had said,

732
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,735
all of them were meaningful to me.

733
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:46,652
I don’t want our relationship to change.

734
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:48,383
Si Feng, I don’t want to lose you.
