00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,399
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,588
<i>EPISODE 38</i>

3
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,418
Xuan Ji!

4
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:45,839
Xuan Ji.

5
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,885
You put your trust on the wrong person.

6
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:50,922
But now that you’ve realized
it, it’s still not too late.

7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,269
- Master, this is bad!
- What happened?

8
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,485
Wu Tong attacked us
with the demons of Sky Hall.

9
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,519
Ling Long and Min Yan
have been surrounded.

10
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,671
Wu Tong is a scum!

11
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,980
Explain to them that
you are not a demon, Si Feng.

12
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:10,582
Si Feng.

13
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,712
I’m sorry.

14
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,112
Leave!

15
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,842
I don’t want to see you anymore!

16
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,599
Wu Tong, Sky Hall.

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,847
I’m going to kill these demons!

18
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,439
God of War defied her superiors
and started a rebellion.

19
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,530
Bring her to the Altar of Banishment
at once.

20
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,319
You Asuras have defied the heavens.

21
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,926
Die now!

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,922
Xuan Ji?

23
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,281
It’s you?

24
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,839
What happened to Xuan Ji?

25
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,854
Her God of War’s power has awakened.

26
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,319
Xuan Ji.

27
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,919
At this time?

28
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,958
Those useless demons from
Lize Palace can’t even defeat you?

29
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,147
Wu Tong.

30
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:18,964
Today, I’m going
to turn you into dust!

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,279
I already know that you are
God of War from the heavens.

32
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,959
I put in so much effort to find the scales
of Candle Dragon from Mount Buzhou.

33
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,319
The scales of Candle Dragon can
withstand holy power.

34
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,998
It’s specially used against it.

35
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,981
Now, I’ve made them into a shield.

36
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:47,263
I want to see how powerful you are.

37
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,279
Scales of Candle Dragon?

38
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,542
I never thought that
the things I used before

39
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,870
will be used against me now.

40
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,239
Not only the things you’ve used before
are used to fight you,

41
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,350
even your lover, Yu Si Feng,
is against you.

42
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,710
Fine.

43
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:10,009
Today, I’ll kill every demon
that is here right now.

44
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,630
Ninth Heaven Fire!

45
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,281
Get into your formation.

46
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,799
There’s a cave there. Let’s get in!

47
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,999
- Follow me!
- Take shelter!

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,159
- Xuan Ji.
- Master.

49
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,091
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

50
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,321
Let’s go now.

51
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,853
Retreat!

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hurry up.

53
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,786
Ling Long.

54
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:11,679
Xuan Ji is too powerful. She’s a monster!

55
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,741
What nonsense are you talking about?
Xuan Ji is protecting us.

56
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,917
She is the God of War who had once
killed demons and monsters.

57
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:19,230
Haven’t you heard of that?

58
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,584
Xuan Ji, stop now!

59
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,553
- Hao Chen!
- Hao Chen!

60
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,592
Xuan Ji!

61
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,805
Enough, Xuan Ji!
The demons have retreated.

62
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,130
Stop hurting others.

63
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:53,974
Xuan Ji.

64
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:56,661
Xuan Ji!

65
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,159
Xuan Ji. What’s wrong with her?

66
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,631
Sect Leader, I think she’s fine.
But Ninth Heaven Fire is very powerful.

67
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,109
We have to send her back and
get rid of this pure fire.

68
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,399
Alright. Hurry up.

69
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,410
Hurry up.

70
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,490
Don’t worry. Xuan Ji will be fine.

71
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:20,910
Ling Long.

72
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,077
What’s wrong?

73
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:24,426
I’m fine.

74
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:29,367
Si Feng!

75
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,772
Si Feng!

76
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,453
Si Feng!

77
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,310
Si Feng!

78
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,445
- Si Feng, don’t go!
- Let go of me!

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,734
Si Feng.

80
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,734
Si Feng.

81
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,250
Si Feng.

82
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:04,073
Si Feng.

83
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,367
Si Feng.

84
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,641
Si Feng.

85
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,808
Si Feng, didn’t you say that
you’ll take care of yourself

86
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,300
so that you won’t get hurt?

87
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:19,960
Si Feng.

88
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:25,199
You said that you’ll be with me
and never leave me.

89
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,285
Si Feng.

90
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,047
Si Feng!

91
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,316
Xuan Ji.

92
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:42,649
You had a bad dream.

93
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,050
I...

94
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,529
I dreamed about Si Feng.

95
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,668
I already told you that
demons are cunning.

96
00:08:58,669 --> 00:08:59,973
You can’t trust them.

97
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,694
In order to revive Star of Mosha
and disrupt the three realms,

98
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,692
nothing is too extreme for them.

99
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,839
Pretending to be kind
and acting selfless

100
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,919
are just tricks they use to appeal to you.

101
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,092
It’s fake.

102
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,850
Everything is just a trick?

103
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,497
Of course.

104
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,987
Yu Si Feng has never
treated you sincerely.

105
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,239
He approached you since the beginning

106
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,900
to get close to the secret ground

107
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:34,908
to find out what is sealed inside it.

108
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,517
He approached you because
you are the daughter of Shaoyang Sect.

109
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:41,039
He approached you because
you are innocent, kind and

110
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,679
put up no defense against others.

111
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,958
When he found out that
you can wield Dingkun Sword,

112
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,078
he guessed that you are the God of War.

113
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,887
God of War is the demon clan’s
biggest enemy.

114
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:56,700
So, he advanced on you gradually
to get close to you and soften you.

115
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:00,621
Then, he made you fell in love
with him so that you can’t leave him.

116
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:03,510
Then, he can easily affect your feelings

117
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:06,359
so that you’ll lose the will
to protect the three realms

118
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,119
or even work for the demon clan.

119
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,702
Everything he did

120
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,828
is to make you
waver and use you.

121
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:26,321
I didn’t want you to go to the real world
for your trial back then

122
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,932
because you are kind and can’t
distinguish between good and evil.

123
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,130
I never thought that

124
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:37,079
you’d still fall into the trap
of demon clan.

125
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,673
Now, you’ve finally realized the truth.

126
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:44,530
Just think of it as a test for you
in this life.

127
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,419
I’ll stay by your side

128
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,315
and help you pass this trial in
order for you to become a deity.

129
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:01,880
A deity?

130
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,479
You are the God of War.

131
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,300
You belong to the heavens.

132
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:08,937
Of course you have to go back in the end.

133
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:17,623
Forget it.

134
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,470
Have a good rest.

135
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,672
I’ll go out first.

136
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,257
Si Feng.

137
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,370
Si Feng will be fine.

138
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:46,490
Si Feng.

139
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,216
Xuan Ji.

140
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,224
Ling Long.

141
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,701
Do you still think of me as your sister?

142
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:10,496
Dummy, why won’t I?

143
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,768
You’ll always be my sister.

144
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,465
Don’t think too much, okay?

145
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,071
Tell me.

146
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,404
Was Si Feng

147
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:38,378
sincere towards me?

148
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,473
Xuan Ji.

149
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:46,573
Demons are never sincere.

150
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:49,115
People from Lize Palace
are always wearing masks.

151
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,718
Everything we saw are fake.

152
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:54,300
You still remember what happened to

153
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,096
Uncle Dong Fang, right?

154
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,419
Sixth Senior.

155
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:05,332
Si Feng

156
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,157
was not sincere towards me?

157
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,967
Is everything fake?

158
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,809
Si Feng is a demon.

159
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,642
And he indeed lied to us.

160
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,141
But he risked his life
so many times for us.

161
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:22,247
And he even gave up his life to save you.

162
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:26,709
So, I think that Si Feng
must be sincere towards you.

163
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,205
Are you trying to get Xuan Ji killed?

164
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,891
Don’t listen to him, Xuan Ji.

165
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:34,160
Yu Si Feng is 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird
and the first disciple of Lize Palace.

166
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:38,030
He must have known about
Lize Palace’s plan to attack Dianjinggu.

167
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:40,188
If he was sincere towards you,

168
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:44,311
he wouldn’t keep quiet and just
watch while our sects bled to death.

169
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:47,281
Things have already
turned out to be like this.

170
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,639
Xuan Ji.

171
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,591
Stop lying to yourself.

172
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,551
I have to find Si Feng
and ask him in person.

173
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,319
You want to be tricked by him again?

174
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,654
I don’t want to be tricked.
But I have to get to the bottom of this.

175
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:08,527
Whether he was sincere or
not, I have to hear it from him.

176
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,239
But everyone saw it very clearly
during yesterday’s battle.

177
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,901
Lize Palace is the accomplice of Sky Hall.

178
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:17,653
Everyone who is in contact
with Sky Hall will become evil.

179
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:21,381
Even if Yu Si Feng was not evil
in the past, he’s a demon now.

180
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,740
He is now Sky Hall’s accomplice.

181
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:26,685
I won’t let you be in contact
with anyone from Sky Hall.

182
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:28,261
Ling Long.

183
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:30,079
I know that you are worried about me.

184
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,279
Si Feng is someone I care for.

185
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,919
I am sincere towards him.

186
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,317
I don’t believe that
he is a part of Sky Hall.

187
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:39,069
Ling Long, Xuan Ji’s God of War power
has awakened.

188
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,950
Sky Hall won’t be able to hurt her.

189
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:45,854
Maybe it’s better if she
can talk to Si Feng in person.

190
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:48,359
Sky Hall can’t hurt her
but Yu Si Feng can.

191
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,350
What if Sky Hall made use of Yu Si Feng?

192
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,159
Then, Xuan Ji will be trapped.

193
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,719
Have you ever considered
Xuan Ji’s safety by suggesting this?

194
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
Those people worked for Sky Hall
because Sky Hall has something on them.

195
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,679
Si Feng has always been smart. He won’t
become someone else’s puppet so easily.

196
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,373
May I beg for your audience?

197
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,909
Greetings, God of War.

198
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,030
Greetings, God of War!

199
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:14,177
We’ve committed a grave crime

200
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,919
by not realizing sooner that
you are here, God of War.

201
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,723
Our valley master has ordered me
to invite you and

202
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:23,606
Lord Flying Snake to stay in the main hall
as a form of apology.

203
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:26,661
Don’t. Just call me Xuan Ji, Elder Kou.

204
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:31,125
I... I haven’t recovered yet.
Please tell valley master that

205
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:33,096
I’ll visit him another time.

206
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:38,072
But Lord Flying Snake said that
you’ve already fully recovered.

207
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:44,119
Have you recovered already?
Have you done the things I asked you to?

208
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,418
This minor injury is nothing to me.

209
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,622
You too
You’ve recovered your power.

210
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,548
Now, you just need to
use your power to heal.

211
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,861
They gave me a peach.

212
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,087
I can’t just reject
their generosity, right?

213
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,591
- Do you want it?
- You...

214
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,841
God of War.

215
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,693
Every sect leader is waiting
for your arrival.

216
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:13,035
Sect Leader Chu has been waiting
a long time for you too.

217
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,533
Okay, I’ll go with you.

218
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,479
God of War.

219
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,765
After you.

220
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,185
Stop right there.

221
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:35,066
The main hall is a place of discussion.
Only people from a sect can enter.

222
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,740
You have been expelled from Shaoyang.
Don’t make things hard for us.

223
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,890
- But...
- God of War.

224
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:40,947
After you.

225
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:43,119
Xuan Ji, we’ll wait for you in your room.

226
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,285
Go.

227
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,441
What is the meaning of this?

228
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:58,518
This is God of War’s residence.

229
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,799
You can’t stay here.
You better wait for her in the courtyard.

230
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,188
I am Xuan Ji’s senior. She is
Xuan Ji’s sister. We are not outsiders.

231
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,692
You’ve been expelled by Shaoyang.

232
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,359
So, you are no longer her senior.

233
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,949
As for her sister,

234
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,013
you’ll just make Shaoyang look bad
by staying in Shaoyang.

235
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,799
You better wait in the courtyard.

236
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,163
This young lady of Shaoyang had
a colorful past with that Wu Tong.

237
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,528
No wonder she can be rescued
from Sky Hall.

238
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,679
She is not rescued.
She was just saving herself.

239
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,029
What did you say?

240
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,520
Don’t be so cynical.

241
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,587
Make yourself clear.

242
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,701
Forget it. Let’s go.

243
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:36,776
Apologize. Or else, don’t
blame me for what I’ll do.

244
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:39,868
Hero Zhong, tell us then.

245
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,985
What should I apologize for?

246
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,710
Tell us about it so that
we know what to apologize for.

247
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:49,853
Ling Long.

248
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,927
<i>SHENJI PAVILION</i>

249
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Father.

250
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,810
Father, are you okay?

251
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,965
I’m fine.

252
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,762
Go and listen to the valley master.

253
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:55,286
During yesterday’s battle, many
of us were either injured or dead.

254
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,468
And we lost our last spirit key.

255
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:02,574
If it wasn’t for you, Dianjinggu
would’ve been annihilated by now.

256
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,999
I never thought that Sect Leader Chu’s
daughter will have such power.

257
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,316
I never thought that there
will be a deity among us.

258
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,973
I’ve been disrespectful to you.

259
00:19:11,974 --> 00:19:14,070
- I’ve been disrespectful to you.
- I...

260
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,594
I just found out
about it as well yesterday.

261
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:21,383
My daughter was just a normal girl.

262
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:25,399
I don’t know how she became like this.

263
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,844
This might be something that
us mortals can never understand.

264
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:35,221
No matter what,
the appearance of God of War

265
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:37,918
must be a blessing
from the heavens.

266
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,759
We invited you here today because

267
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,205
first, we want to thank you
for what you did yesterday.

268
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,247
Second...

269
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,097
Second, I have
a request for you.

270
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,731
If you need me to do anything,
just tell me about it.

271
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,386
- Valley Master Rong.
- Please lead us

272
00:19:57,387 --> 00:20:00,261
to destroy those demons
and protect the human realm.

273
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,310
This...

274
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:08,930
Please lead us to destroy those
demons and protect the human realm!

275
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,381
Valley Master Rong, Uncle Dong Fang.

276
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:20,310
This is too sudden.

277
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:22,210
This is too great of a responsibility

278
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:25,205
for me to bear.

279
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,750
Please find another one to do so.

280
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,679
Sect Leader Chu.

281
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,036
If God of War doesn’t
agree, we won’t get up today.

282
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,799
Okay.

283
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,519
Xuan Ji.

284
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,214
I’ll kneel down and beg you too.

285
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:45,239
What are you doing, Father?

286
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,079
Father, are you okay?

287
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,639
Why are you like this?

288
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,099
What’s wrong, Father?

289
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,318
Why are you like this?

290
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,111
- Father.
- He has been hurt by Yu Si Feng’s master.

291
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:59,142
He should be resting in bed.
But he’s forcing himself right now.

292
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:00,670
Father.

293
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,506
Could it be that there’s
a Gu bug inside his body?

294
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:07,903
It must be because of that
Rose Gold Bird. What should we do now?

295
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:08,959
No, Father.

296
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,790
Flying Snake!

297
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,519
Come and take a look at him!

298
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,663
Father!

299
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,949
Hurry up!

300
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:18,512
Father.

301
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:28,519
Isn’t this the Intracavitary Sparrow?
It’s very common.

302
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,838
It feed on the organs of the host.

303
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,119
It’ll bring the host great pain
until death is a much better option.

304
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,639
Can he be treated?

305
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,999
You were once...

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,765
Since you can recognize it,
it means that you know how to treat it.

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,130
- You are really...
- Hurry up!

308
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,359
Yes.

309
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,009
He can be treated.

310
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,180
No need to treat him.
Just take that sparrow out.

311
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,057
Father, get up first.

312
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,041
Get up first.

313
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:25,919
Father.

314
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:28,439
Xuan Ji.

315
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,279
Take a good look.

316
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,890
This is how vicious and cruel
the demon clan is.

317
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,519
This is their nature.

318
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,440
If we don’t eradicate them, how can
we bring peace to the three realms?

319
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,038
Xuan Ji.

320
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,665
- Xuan Ji.
- Father.

321
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,821
We are not trying to force you
to be our chief.

322
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:52,270
But you are our only choice.

323
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,541
The demons took advantage of our feelings

324
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,293
and planted spies
to get the upper hand.

325
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:03,781
We have all suffered serious loss.

326
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,082
Now, only three sects are left
out of the five sects.

327
00:23:07,894 --> 00:23:11,704
The loss of our sect
is just a surface wound.

328
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,777
If this continues, I’m afraid that

329
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:20,015
we’ll be divided and we
can’t stand together anymore.

330
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,133
Xuan Ji.

331
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:25,365
You are the reincarnation
of the God of War.

332
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:32,841
Within us three sects now, you
are the only one who can lead us.

333
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,245
- I...
- Do you understand our pains?

334
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:38,597
My child.

335
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,664
Just say yes.

336
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,150
Father.

337
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:54,555
Okay.

338
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,647
I agree to be the chief.

339
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,879
Great.

340
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,302
Good.

341
00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:05,821
Good girl.

342
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,382
Good.

343
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:14,597
From today onward, we’ll have a chief.

344
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:16,242
Get me the Spirit Scroll.

345
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,239
Everybody.

346
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,919
This Spirit Scroll has
all the names of the disciples

347
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,286
who died in the hands of demons.

348
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,144
There’s a total of 372 people.

349
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,101
Their bones have gone cold now.

350
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:43,477
But those demons are still
roaming the earth.

351
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,096
Please lead us to eradicate
Sky Hall, annihilate Lize Palace

352
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,279
and avenge them.

353
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,559
Eradicate Sky Hall,
annihilate Lize Palace!

354
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,289
Avenge them!

355
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,399
Annihilate Lize Palace?

356
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,479
Yes.

357
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,931
Please give your order.

358
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,930
I...

359
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,879
Do you still have the illusion that
Lize Palace is good?

360
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,559
Are you not willing
to seek revenge for us?

361
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,610
I...

362
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,469
Xuan Ji has another plan.
Don’t misunderstand.

363
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,189
Sky Hall and Lize Palace are accomplices.

364
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,366
They have all four spirit keys now.

365
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:43,078
Then, their next step must
be reviving the Star of Mosha.

366
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,295
If we only think about revenge right now,

367
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:48,759
it’ll just drag us down.

368
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,654
And we’ll give them
an opportunity to do so.

369
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:52,665
What do you mean then, Elder Hao Chen?

370
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:55,696
Our first priority

371
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:58,554
is to foil those demons’ plan.

372
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:03,399
If they want to revive the
Star of Mosha, their last barrier

373
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,138
is the secret ground of Shaoyang.

374
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,750
So, I suggest for Shaoyang Sect to
go back and protect the secret ground.

375
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,552
The rest will gather your people
and meet us at Shaoyang.

376
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,932
By doing so, we can protect
the secret ground together

377
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:18,663
and discuss about our plan
to avenge our people.

378
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:24,970
I was thinking of
the same thing too.

379
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:29,542
Okay.

380
00:26:29,543 --> 00:26:32,157
We’ll let them live for
a few more days then.

381
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:35,815
We’ll discuss about it when we are
all gathered at Mount Shaoyang.

382
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:39,533
But we know that

383
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:43,639
you are very close with
the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

384
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,966
I hope that Shaoyang Sect
can give us a promise

385
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:50,285
to stay away from that demon from now on.

386
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:51,856
Give us a peace of mind.

387
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:56,794
Valley Master Rong.

388
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:59,480
Xuan Ji has already agreed
to be our chief, right?

389
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:02,691
In the past,
Xuan Ji was kept in the dark too.

390
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:04,885
Now that she knows about
Yu Si Feng’s identity.

391
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:08,754
I believe that the next
time she meets Yu Si Feng,

392
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:12,654
she’ll burn him to ashes to
avenge the people who we’ve lost.

393
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,619
<i>LIZE PALACE</i>

394
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:18,248
Si Feng, are you feeling better now?

395
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,669
This is the cure for
the Loveless Curse. Eat it.

396
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,177
Don’t make me worry about you again.

397
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,770
Master.

398
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,841
Didn’t you say that there’s
no cure for Loveless Curse?

399
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,490
There’s no such thing as
curse without a cure.

400
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,526
It’s just that you have to
pay it with another thing.

401
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:45,159
Loveless Curse is activated
based on your feelings.

402
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,330
This cure is for you to clear your mind.

403
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:54,373
After you eat it, you’ll
forget about everything.

404
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:56,297
You’ll forget about that person forever.

405
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,962
And your Loveless Curse will be broken.

406
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:03,533
You can’t get this in the mortal world.

407
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,835
There’s only one of this in Lize Palace.

408
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,049
Eat it.

409
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,210
I can’t eat it.

410
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,290
And I don’t want to forget about her.

411
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,378
You are still not willing
to forget about her?

412
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,198
As soon as she heard that you are
a Rose Gold Bird Demon,

413
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,590
she immediately chose to
stand on their side.

414
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,829
Can’t you see where she stands?

415
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,447
I am the one who lied to her first.

416
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:01,933
It’s not her fault.

417
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,505
Lize Palace has been in peace
for hundreds of years.

418
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:09,909
Master.

419
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,575
Do you really want to destroy it?

420
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,869
Another thing.

421
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,075
Are you really the one

422
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,849
who killed Xuan Ji’s mother?

423
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:24,782
It’s her fault for being a busybody

424
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,563
who wanted to take away Hao Feng from me.

425
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,732
In this world,

426
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:34,497
nobody can separate me and Hao Feng.

427
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,653
Those who forced her

428
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,094
and made her killed herself.

429
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:41,705
Don’t they deserve to die?

430
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:45,688
I was avenging your mother!

431
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:50,982
Master.

432
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,132
Forget it.

433
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,973
Do you want to see your mother?

434
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,693
Si Feng.

435
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:12,161
This is your mother.

436
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,655
Has she

437
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,575
always been here?

438
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,496
But why

439
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,655
didn’t you tell me about it before this?

440
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,908
I was waiting.

441
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:39,336
I was waiting for her to wake up

442
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,455
so that I can tell you
everything about us.

443
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,086
What kind of a person

444
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:50,337
my mother is?

445
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:53,681
She is the best woman in this world.

446
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,173
I remember that when I first
met your mother, I was your age.

447
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:01,140
It was my first trial
in the outside world.

448
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,181
When I saw her again,
she was seriously wounded

449
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:36,959
after a fight with someone.

450
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,209
I saved her and treated
her wounds with care.

451
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:41,811
And we fell in love.

452
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:47,984
Is this a phoenix?

453
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,639
It doesn’t look like one.

454
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,079
No.

455
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,470
This is a Rose Gold Bird.

456
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,367
Let me put it on for you.

457
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,642
We hid our relationship

458
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,574
pretty well at first.

459
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:19,905
She got pregnant.

460
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,247
And we were looking forward to you.

461
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:30,354
But on the day of her labor, our
old palace lord found out about it.

462
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:32,008
He rushed to us in fury

463
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:34,381
and almost killed you on the post.

464
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,802
After that,

465
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:41,038
he changed his mind because
you inherited the 12 Feathers bloodline.

466
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:45,831
Then, he took you back to Lize Palace
without a second word.

467
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,601
And he forced me to wear
the Loveless Mask.

468
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,125
I was so lucky.

469
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,131
Your mother understood and cherished me.
She had no regrets.

470
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:59,632
She didn’t abandon me even when
she found out that I’m a Rose Gold Bird.

471
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,550
Her only regret is,

472
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:06,876
you were not by her side.

473
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:12,094
Until those despicable people from
the sects went looking for her.

474
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:14,037
They knew that she had a union with demon.

475
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:16,118
They forced her to tell them
about my whereabouts.

476
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,264
In order to

477
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,248
protect us,

478
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,684
your mother...

479
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,339
Ever since I brought her back, every day,

480
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,834
I look for a way to revive her.

481
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,437
Now,

482
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:38,617
I finally found the way.

483
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,337
Si Feng.

484
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,497
I already gave your mother
the 1000-year-old stalactite.

485
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:46,249
After she wakes up,

486
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:50,773
she’ll be very happy
when she sees you.

487
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,644
Master.

488
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:14,368
Until now, you
still call me master.

489
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,359
I know.

490
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,896
You hate me because
I didn’t tell you about this earlier.

491
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:23,630
We are not allowed to have
a wife and child in Lize Palace.

492
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:28,099
The old palace lord used your
mother to force me to swear an oath.

493
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,890
I can’t tell you about this until
you’ve become an adult.

494
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:33,857
Then,

495
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,877
you can go through your trial
earlier and become our clan’s hope.

496
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,091
In this world, there is no father
who will abandon their own child.

497
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,009
You’ve always treated me very kindly.

498
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,319
Can you

499
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:56,858
call me father?

500
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:11,642
Forget it.

501
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,159
Twenty years have passed.

502
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,261
There’s no point in forcing you.

503
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:27,617
Father.

504
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:38,782
What did you say?

505
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,810
Father, I’ve been unfilial.

506
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:43,897
I’ve caused you much trouble.

507
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:54,313
Hurry up and get up.

508
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,261
My good child.

509
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,785
I am

510
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,053
very happy.

511
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,422
Hao Feng, did you see that?

512
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:18,767
Our child

513
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:21,399
has grown up.

514
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,010
He called me father!

515
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:25,061
It’s almost time.

516
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:31,654
When you wake up, the three of
us can chat with each other happily.

517
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:34,008
Hao Feng.

518
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,487
Finally, you came out, Senior.

519
00:39:05,488 --> 00:39:08,115
You broke the rule by burning
the Crimson Tusk by yourself.

520
00:39:08,116 --> 00:39:09,829
What do you want?

521
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,817
Burning the Crimson Tusk means
that something major is going to happen.

522
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:17,035
It’s time for Lize Palace
to have a new master.

523
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:20,479
Vice Palace Lord, how could you
say something like that?

524
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,509
Vice Palace Lord is just being loyal.

525
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,177
Are you trying to revolt?

526
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:27,189
Guards! Take them to the Discipline Hall!

527
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,630
My fellow elders.

528
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,514
Do you want to hear me out first
before making the decision?

529
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:36,197
Lize Palace’s identity
has already been exposed.

530
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:37,919
Lize Palace is supposed to

531
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,797
take preventive measures
for our future now.

532
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:44,416
But my senior, the
head of this palace,

533
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,959
is hiding underground to
accompany a dead person.

534
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,690
He has no care for the safety of
Lize Palace. Should we change him out?

535
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:54,901
- You want to change the palace lord?
- Yes.

536
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:56,639
I have the same thought too.

537
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,726
I’m sick of being a palace lord anyway.

538
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:01,239
I’ll use this chance

539
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:04,225
to step down from my position.

540
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:08,213
Let’s call for a meeting!

541
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,485
Si Feng.

542
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:25,692
Stand here.

543
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,977
I’ve been leading Lize Palace
for 20 years.

544
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:54,159
But during these 20 years,
I’ve been living in a state of ignorance.

545
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,043
No wonder someone wants me
to step down from my position.

546
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:02,988
Palace Lord.

547
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,965
Lize Palace has been
so peaceful because of you.

548
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,335
How can you say that you are
living in a state of ignorance?

549
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:14,125
All these years, the vice palace lord
is the one handling everything.

550
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:17,358
How can you say that it’s all
thanks to the palace lord?

551
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,079
You are just lying brazenly.

552
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,770
- Elder He!
- Enough.

553
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,839
I know myself the best.

554
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,053
Stop arguing.

555
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:30,239
I’m sick of being a palace lord already.

556
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,210
It’s time to hand over Lize Palace
to someone with a clear mind.

557
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,002
Listen to my order, Yu Si Feng.

558
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,050
From today onward, you’ll
be the new lord of Lize Palace.

559
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:22,328
I’ll hand over the palace lord’s
Gold Feather Medallion to you.

560
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:28,245
The Crimson Tusk is burning
and I’ve already passed down my decree.

561
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:31,094
You are the successor of
the 12 Feathers bloodline.

562
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:33,354
No one else comes from
a better bloodline than yours.

563
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,950
I’m passing down
the Gold Feather Medallion to you today.

564
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:39,489
You are the new lord of Lize Palace.

565
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,048
- Come, let’s greet our new lord today.
- Wait.

566
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:55,839
Junior.

567
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,597
I’ve already stepped down
from my position.

568
00:42:57,598 --> 00:43:00,629
What is it? You are still not satisfied?

569
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,760
Yu Si Feng has no rights
to become the palace lord.

570
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,392
You are out of your mind.

571
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:10,617
We can’t trust the words of a lunatic.

572
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,787
Are you courting death?

573
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,518
Why are you angry?

574
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,772
I know that you don’t think of yourself
as being crazy.

575
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,049
But let me ask you a question.

576
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,989
After giving us your answer, I’m sure that
the elders will make up their mind.

577
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,405
What do you want to ask?

578
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,132
After stepping down from your position,

579
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:40,679
what are you going to do?

580
00:43:41,374 --> 00:43:44,393
Hao Feng and I love each other.

581
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:47,806
Of course I’ll travel
far and wide with her.

582
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,810
Why are you laughing?

583
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:12,355
Shut up!

584
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,798
Where did you learn this from?

585
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:24,980
Old palace lord taught me this
to defend against you.

586
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:28,626
He asked me to keep an eye on
you so that you won’t lose your mind.

587
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,490
I’m not crazy!

588
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,093
Senior. If Hao Feng was
still here, she would hate you.

589
00:44:38,094 --> 00:44:39,838
You love each other?

590
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,982
I think you’ve really gone crazy.

591
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,479
Nonsense.

592
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,969
Nonsense!

593
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,413
Senior.

594
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,889
I’m here.

595
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,797
In your mind, Hao Feng was so loyal
to you and never abandoned you.

596
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:02,837
She even took down
the Loveless Mask for you.

597
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:04,341
But the reality is,

598
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:09,821
she only loved you before
she found out that you are a demon.
