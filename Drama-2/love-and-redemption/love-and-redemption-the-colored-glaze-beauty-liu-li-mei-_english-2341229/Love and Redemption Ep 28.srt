00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,270
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,270
<i>EPISODE 28</i>

3
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:48,158
Si Feng!

4
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,214
Si Feng!

5
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,319
Si Feng, don’t leave!

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,559
I was heartless in the past.
I know I’ve hurt you.

7
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,974
It’s my fault.

8
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,214
But...

9
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:09,199
But Si Feng, you mustn’t leave me!

10
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,830
You can teach me or reprimand me.

11
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,901
But please don’t leave me, okay?

12
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,719
I’ve recovered my six senses now.

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,140
I’m different from the past now.

14
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:21,611
I will treat you
in the nicest way possible.

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,470
During all my nine tribulations,

16
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,736
there’s one person

17
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,790
who told me that

18
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:34,991
she would remember me every single time.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,544
In the end?

20
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:38,935
It was only my wishful thinking.

21
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:49,921
Si Feng, I don’t remember anything
about our previous nine lives.

22
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,879
I only remember this life.

23
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,990
Si Feng, I like you!

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,990
I want to stay by your side forever.

25
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,145
Si Feng,

26
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,393
can you...

27
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,943
Si Feng,

28
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,530
are you still leaving?

29
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,894
When did I say I was leaving?

30
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,907
But... I just wanted the ferryman
to bring me some lotus seed pods.

31
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:14,965
I’m just here to take them.

32
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:18,827
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

33
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,573
Are you regretting your words?

34
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,190
Everyone here

35
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:27,627
had heard you.

36
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:30,399
They will be my witnesses.

37
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,990
It’s too late for you to regret.

38
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,970
Si Feng, you became naughty.

39
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,149
Xuan Ji,

40
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:41,034
I told you that

41
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:42,984
I’ll teach you how to
fall in love with me.

42
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,049
Why would I leave?

43
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,689
The past is not important anymore.

44
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,201
I only care about

45
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:52,885
the current you.

46
00:04:57,593 --> 00:04:58,858
If we are

47
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:03,106
constantly worried about our
past, we won’t be able to truly live.

48
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:07,190
This time, you won’t
be able to forget me.

49
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,725
Here.

50
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,519
Enough. Stop staring at them.

51
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,718
Pour me another drink.

52
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,750
Xuan Ji and Si Feng have finally
found their happily ever after.

53
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,230
But why do you look like
you’re troubled by something?

54
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,430
Of course I’m happy for them.

55
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,639
It’s just that love fades away
when destiny gets to its end.

56
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,199
It’s an unpredictable road.

57
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,724
When destiny gets to its end?

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,239
Tell me, do you think our
fates are predetermined?

59
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,563
Why are you asking this suddenly?

60
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,017
I’m worried about Ling Long.

61
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,630
If our fates are really predetermined,

62
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,069
I’m really scared of the fact that

63
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,780
we aren’t predestined to be together.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,156
That’s why I wanted to find
some clues within the mirror shards.

65
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,544
But there’s no clue at all.

66
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,439
The shards only contain
fragments of the past.

67
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,159
Our current lives
have nothing to do with it.

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,970
Min Yan, Ling Long and you
are childhood friends.

69
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:09,513
Many people are envious of that fact.

70
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,159
Now, we’ve found Ting Nu.

71
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,884
We will reach Mount Buzhou soon.

72
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,039
And everyone will save Ling Long together.

73
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,550
You should think about how you’re going to
treat her when she returns.

74
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,150
I didn’t expect you
to be this good at consolations.

75
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:24,390
I’m not trying to console you.

76
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:25,623
I believe that it will happen.

77
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,282
If you want to talk about consolations,

78
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,784
Ruo Xue is the best.

79
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:32,897
Ruo Xue?

80
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,461
Ruo Xue is my younger sister.
We are orphans.

81
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:43,747
She’s a very obedient girl.

82
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:45,498
No matter how much she suffers outside,

83
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,721
she’ll always say it’s fine

84
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:51,211
when she returns home.

85
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:53,204
You’ve never mentioned her before.

86
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,355
Where’s your sister?

87
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,405
We can’t see each other often.

88
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:03,950
It’s all because I didn’t
fulfill my responsibility as her brother.

89
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,285
Min Yan, you can eat them.

90
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,879
Why are you hiding in here?

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,319
I want to hide in here.

92
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,919
I want to hibernate for 500 years.

93
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,255
What’s wrong?

94
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,312
Are you angry at Si Feng again?

95
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:51,205
My master is so dumb!

96
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:52,973
He doesn’t learn his lesson at all.

97
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:54,959
He was so disappointed in her,

98
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,999
yet he forgave her when
Chu Xuan Ji apologized to him.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,479
But he doesn’t want to
listen to me at all.

100
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,870
He doesn’t even want to look at me.

101
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,799
You.

102
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,190
You’re a dummy too.

103
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,159
Miss! Mister!

104
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,132
Miss, mister, today is Qixi Festival.

105
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,839
You two are a perfect match.

106
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,559
You two mustn’t miss out
on them when you’re on the Magpie Bridge.

107
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,879
- Magpie Bridge?
- Yes. It’s our tradition here.

108
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,719
Your wishes will come true if
you make a wish with our clay figurines.

109
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,423
Sure. Make one for us.

110
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,239
Let me pay for them.

111
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,510
I want two pairs of them.
Si Feng, it’s my gift for you.

112
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,110
Sure. Anything you say.

113
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,171
One pair for our wish,
one pair for us to bring back.

114
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,682
Okay. Please wait.

115
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,020
Si Feng, after you receive my gift,

116
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:04,719
you need to give me something as well.

117
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,976
What do you want?

118
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:12,163
I want the hairpin
you gave me last time.

119
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,038
Can you give it to me again?

120
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,724
You mustn’t regret this.

121
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,836
After you take my hairpin,

122
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:30,671
you’ll be mine

123
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,048
from now on.

124
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,958
You’ll be mine as well after
you take my clay figurines.

125
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,434
I’m more than happy to oblige.

126
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,030
Excuse me, your figurines are ready.
You two can make your wishes now.

127
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,658
Let’s go.

128
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,579
Little Phoenix, have you
thought this through?

129
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,290
You want to fall at the same spot
for the tenth time?

130
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,064
Brother Liu, can’t you
be more optimistic?

131
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,799
Maybe I won’t fall this time.

132
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,965
The past is the past.

133
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,790
They’re not me, I’m not them.

134
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,879
They only know how to tolerate and wait.

135
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,053
I won’t let Xuan Ji wait until
the last second before I tell her

136
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,870
how much I care about her.

137
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,470
Now, you’re much better
at flirting than me.

138
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,679
But don’t forget, the person
you love isn’t ordinary.

139
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,335
She’s the God of War.

140
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,832
Xuan Ji is Xuan Ji.

141
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,423
She’s not the God of War in this life.

142
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:41,919
Why are you lying to yourself?

143
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,159
Xuan Ji encountered Dingkun Sword
and the Mirror of Origin.

144
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,799
It’s fated that she won’t
stay as someone ordinary.

145
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,959
She’ll become the God of War
sooner or later.

146
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,039
What will you do if she does
become the God of War one day?

147
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,245
Brother Liu, that’s enough.
Stop talking about that.

148
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,914
This isn’t my matter alone.

149
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,941
I will definitely lead a
peaceful life with Xuan Ji.

150
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,752
That’s for the best.

151
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:14,230
I used the celestial eye,
yet I can’t see the future of you two.

152
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,034
You better be careful.

153
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,719
I thought Purple Fox’s primordial spirit

154
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,863
had returned to her body
as well, but I was wrong.

155
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,247
Look.

156
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,119
- This shard...
- Her primordial spirit is still inside.

157
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,999
Si Feng and I had returned to our bodies.

158
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,524
Why is she still trapped within?

159
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,115
I’m afraid she’s not trapped.

160
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,952
She just doesn’t want to
recognize reality.

161
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:10,972
If this continues,
she’ll forget about reality.

162
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:15,119
Her primordial spirit will
dissipate, and she’ll never wake up.

163
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,445
- How do we save her?
- There’s only one way.

164
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:20,886
Either you or Si Feng
has to enter the mirror again.

165
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,478
You two went in there before.
You won’t be fooled by it.

166
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,358
Only you two can save her.

167
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,559
No. This is too dangerous.

168
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,039
Sixth Senior, Purple Fox
is following us to Mount Buzhou.

169
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,599
I can’t just abandon her.

170
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,799
Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.

171
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,459
Ting Nu, let me in.

172
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,883
Xuan Ji, let’s go in together.

173
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:42,225
Si Feng.

174
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:45,053
Did you forget that you said
you were going to depend on me?

175
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,739
Wu Zhi Qi,

176
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,605
you spend your days drinking
in this remote place.

177
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:21,676
Isn’t it a waste of your abilities?

178
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,893
Why don’t you come with me and assist the
King of Asura in invading heavenly realm?

179
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:30,479
It’s glorious for us demons
to conquer the three realms, isn’t it?

180
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,679
Yuan Lang, you said you were
going to have a drink with me today.

181
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,152
Yet you didn’t drink at all.

182
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,743
Aren’t you too petty?

183
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,630
Little fox, bring me some wine.

184
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:59,106
This is Purple Fox in the past.

185
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:01,839
That man who’s drinking is Wu Zhi Qi.

186
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,710
- Who’s Yuan Lang then?
- I think it’s his friend.

187
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,035
Yuan Lang, let’s drink.

188
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,545
Why don’t you consider my proposal
regarding the war?

189
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:20,598
Come to the Demon Citadel
if you have thought it through.

190
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,509
We’ll fight together with
the Star of Mosha, Rahu and Ketu.

191
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,669
I’ll wait for you.

192
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,956
Wu Zhi Qi, don’t listen to that villain.

193
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:41,858
You’re not allowed to join the war.

194
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,399
I don’t like violence,

195
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,132
but there’s nothing here.
Not even a pretty lady.

196
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,572
I’m so bored.

197
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:52,759
Are you blind?

198
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,679
Aren’t I a beauty?

199
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,519
I’ve trained for so long for your sake.

200
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,199
And I finally acquired a human form.

201
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,125
I managed to transform
into the look you like.

202
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:01,724
Isn’t this enough?

203
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,359
Little fox,

204
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,066
have you never seen yourself in the mirror
after you acquired your form?

205
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,559
Here.

206
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,801
Take a good look. You’re ugly.

207
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,039
I’ve asked other people about this.

208
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,030
Everyone said that I am a beauty.

209
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:24,503
Why are you so heartless?

210
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:27,119
Can’t you even praise me for once?

211
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,519
I hate praising people the most.

212
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,999
Moreover, you want me to
praise an ugly demon like you?

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,559
No way in hell.

214
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,365
Either you transform
into your original appearance,

215
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,636
or you get out of my sight.

216
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,270
Are you saying that
you’ll ask me to leave

217
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,812
if I don’t return to my fox form?

218
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,118
Yes. The further you are, the better.

219
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,109
I don’t want to see you again.

220
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,212
You’re so noisy and annoying.

221
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,060
It’s much better without you around.

222
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,100
Are you serious about that?

223
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,971
Fine.

224
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,745
I’ll leave.

225
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,378
I’ll never return

226
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:20,403
once I leave.

227
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,200
You better don’t regret it.

228
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,998
Is that phantom Purple Fox?

229
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,219
Yes.

230
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:10,711
Don’t leave Wu Zhi Qi.

231
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:13,630
You’ll never be able to see him again
if you leave.

232
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,279
Don’t leave him!

233
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,225
Return to his side right now!

234
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:21,279
He’s just trying to make you angry.

235
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,831
Don’t leave this place!

236
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,399
She’s gone?

237
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,677
That’s good.

238
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,356
I have nothing to worry now.

239
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,734
Wu Zhi Qi!

240
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,451
Wu Zhi Qi, don’t leave yet!

241
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:41,865
Wait for her.

242
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:45,816
The little fox is just
throwing a tantrum.

243
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,836
She’ll return to you!

244
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,239
30 minutes.

245
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,906
No, she’ll return to
you within 15 minutes.

246
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:55,759
- Just wait for her.
- Flirting

247
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,030
- Please wait for her!
- With each other, more than once.

248
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,559
With - a fateful promise,
- She’ll return for sure!

249
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,959
- It lasts an eternity.
- I beg you!

250
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,738
- Please wait for her!
- It’s hard for us to meet,

251
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:13,119
but everything is not working out.

252
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,264
How do we reunite?

253
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:16,530
I beg you!

254
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:22,659
- Time to leave!
- I beg you! Don’t leave!

255
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:29,031
Let’s try this again.

256
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,542
I’m sure it will work this time!

257
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,185
She’s expending her primordial spirit
in order to reverse time.

258
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:43,536
If this continues, she’ll disappear.

259
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,238
Purple Fox, that’s enough.
You should return with us.

260
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,069
Go away!

261
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:59,077
Purple Fox, your primordial spirit
will be gone if you continue this.

262
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,759
- Go away!
- Just ignore me!

263
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,433
I don’t need your concern!

264
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,722
Wu Zhi Qi!

265
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:22,908
Purple Fox.

266
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,431
I saw my past in the mirror as well.

267
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,302
That’s why I understand
what you’re going through.

268
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,432
But the answer you’re looking for
is in the real world.

269
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:36,516
If you trap yourself here,
you’ll only be more frustrated.

270
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,190
Let’s leave together, okay?

271
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:43,620
We’ll find Wu Zhi Qi together.

272
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,750
I... I’m so dumb!

273
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,403
I’m so dumb!

274
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,546
Purple Fox!

275
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,430
This is great. You’re finally awake.

276
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,399
You saw my most
embarrassing moments.

277
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,817
It’s fine.

278
00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:42,310
You’ll be a beauty no matter what you do.

279
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,565
Xuan Ji, you promised me that
you’ll help me save Wu Zhi Qi

280
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,636
when we were inside the mirror,

281
00:24:50,313 --> 00:24:51,569
am I right?

282
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,688
I promise.

283
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,759
Xuan Ji, don’t promise that yet.

284
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,712
You’re a cultivator.
Your role is to slay demons.

285
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:04,039
Wu Zhi Qi is the Left Lieutenant
of the demon tribe.

286
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,479
And you still want to find him?
That’s impossible.

287
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,748
Sixth Senior, I’ve already promised
Purple Fox.

288
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:12,765
And, although I don’t know
Wu Zhi Qi personally,

289
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:15,883
he has been locked up for 1,000 years
for what he has done.

290
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,691
I think that’s more than enough.

291
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:19,002
So what if you find him?

292
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:22,319
1,000 years ago, Wu Zhi Qi
left without a care.

293
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,569
What makes you think that
you can keep him by your side?

294
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,491
I must go.

295
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,351
I told you before.

296
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,342
I will surely save Wu Zhi Qi.

297
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,309
If I can’t save him,

298
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:37,839
I’ll stay there and accompany him.

299
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,135
I’ll accompany him no
matter how long it takes.

300
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,829
I want him to know that

301
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,630
I’m the only person good to him
in this world.

302
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:52,569
And I will always stay beside him.

303
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:56,208
You’re not the naive demon I knew anymore.

304
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,519
Fine. I won’t try to persuade you again.

305
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,204
But you must remember this.

306
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:04,475
You need to deal with the consequences.

307
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,830
Si Feng, please persuade Xuan Ji.

308
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,169
We’ve promised Purple Fox that
we’ll go to Mount Buzhou together.

309
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,526
And she helped us to find Ting Nu.

310
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:16,997
That’s why we must keep our promise.

311
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,611
Fine.

312
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:24,282
Since you are so insistent,
my words are useless.

313
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,481
Let’s do this together then.

314
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,150
Oh right, Ting Nu,

315
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,190
tell us how to
enter Mount Buzhou.

316
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:40,785
Mount Buzhou is not in the human realm.

317
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:43,599
We need to prepare ourselves
before we enter the mountain.

318
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,162
Let me make some preparations.
You will depart tomorrow.

319
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,201
Brother Liu.

320
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,752
Little Phoenix, you’re generous indeed.

321
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:05,263
You even gave her your precious hairpin.

322
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,149
I traded my future for it, you know?

323
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,310
Xuan Ji is right.
It’s a great deal for me.

324
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,150
My goodness. What smell is this?

325
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,479
I know now.
It’s the foul stench of love.

326
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,199
- It stinks.
- What? Can’t we do this?

327
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,568
Just go.

328
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,998
Let’s go.

329
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,202
You’re leaving when it’s this late?

330
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,318
Why aren’t you asleep yet?

331
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,309
I’m preparing for Mount Buzhou.

332
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:11,830
But I still don’t understand one thing.

333
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,102
What?

334
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:18,325
Sky Hall planned this out because they
want to awaken the power of God of War.

335
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:22,845
But how could they be sure that
Xuan Ji will fall for it?

336
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:26,876
Don’t tell me they knew that Xuan Ji will
meet with the celestial eye’s bearer?

337
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,399
Who knows what
those scoundrels are planning?

338
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,430
Maybe they used it to their advantage
because Little Phoenix found me.

339
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,824
No.

340
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,495
I can’t sleep.

341
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,409
I need some wine.

342
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,716
Mr. Liu, you’re late.

343
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,679
I haven’t got the chance to strike.

344
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,755
Please ask your leader
to give me more time.

345
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:07,759
I will awaken the powers of God of War.

346
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,285
Mr. Liu, our leader knew
what happened inside the manor.

347
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:17,276
You used the celestial Eye
to stop her awakening.

348
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,349
I was forced to do so.

349
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,919
You were forced to do so?

350
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,637
Mr. Liu, you lied to us.

351
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,525
It makes perfect sense for us
to show you some colors.

352
00:29:26,526 --> 00:29:30,197
But our leader is magnanimous.
He’s giving you a second chance.

353
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:34,199
You’ll never see your daughter
if you mess this up again.

354
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,319
Fine. Tell me.

355
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,011
What do you want me to do?

356
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:42,298
Kill Yu Si Feng and
enrage Chu Xuan Ji.

357
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,369
So that you may awaken her powers.

358
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,485
No way.

359
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,556
I will never hurt Little Phoenix.

360
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,152
Do you think you have the right
to negotiate with us?

361
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:56,692
You better don’t be too much!

362
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,157
You just used the celestial eye.
You’re weak and feeble.

363
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:06,108
Do you want your daughter to die?

364
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,559
- Who are you?
- I’m a friend of Mr. Liu.

365
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,955
If you don’t believe me, you can ask him.

366
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,470
He’s...

367
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,455
He’s from Sky Hall.

368
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,870
Liu Yi Huan, why are you meeting
someone from Sky Hall?

369
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,098
Everyone, I’m sorry.

370
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,915
He’s from Sky Hall?
Tell Wu Tong to meet me.

371
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:52,631
I only follow my leader’s order.
I don’t know any Wu Tong.

372
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:54,652
God of War.

373
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,396
- You know her identity?
- I know many things.

374
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,830
Since the God of War is here,
I’ll capture you for my leader!

375
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,234
Be careful! That’s Xuanyin Chain!

376
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,938
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

377
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,199
You old fox, how dare you betray us!

378
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,239
How dare you join hands with them!

379
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,704
Who’s the old fox here?

380
00:31:20,705 --> 00:31:22,507
You’re the old fox!

381
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,509
I betrayed Sky Hall?
I was never with Sky Hall.

382
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,239
You stole my beloved and ruined
Mount Gao, and you call me old?

383
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,751
You’re old!

384
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,950
He’s dead?

385
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,265
- So, it’s a fish.
- He’s dead?

386
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,849
So weak.

387
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,590
So, you’re the God of War?

388
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:53,436
You’re not that beautiful.

389
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,737
Enough. We mustn’t stay around.

390
00:31:57,738 --> 00:31:59,246
Let’s speak after we return.

391
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,368
So, you were the one behind everything.

392
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,430
Everyone, I’m sorry.

393
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,644
But I couldn’t just ignore Yu’Er.

394
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,775
I’ve harmed you.

395
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,159
Brother Liu was forced to do so.

396
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,127
Besides, I managed to recover
my six senses

397
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:32,546
because he gave us the Mirror of Origin.

398
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:35,279
He even used his celestial eye
to save Si Feng.

399
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,950
He did help us out.

400
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,119
Brother Liu, you don’t need to
blame yourself.

401
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,352
I just didn’t expect Sky Hall
to know that Xuan Ji is the God of War.

402
00:32:47,353 --> 00:32:53,026
And they did all this because
they want her to regain her powers.

403
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:54,319
Oh right,

404
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,959
didn’t you say that the nemesis
of Star of Mosha is God of War?

405
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,270
But why are they trying to
let Xuan Ji regain her powers?

406
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,879
The only logical explanation
is that the God of War’s power

407
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,154
is vital to Star of Mosha’s revival.

408
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,999
It’s a pity that

409
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,732
I only got to see the God of War
when I was treating her wound.

410
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:16,259
I know almost nothing about her.

411
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,325
One part of the God of War’s
memories will always be blurry.

412
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:22,596
My guess is that the heavens
sealed away that part.

413
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,991
Maybe not.

414
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,463
The heavens love to
kick up a cloud of dust.

415
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,879
They said the God of War
was a gorgeous beauty.

416
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,962
- But just look at Xuan Ji.
- I...

417
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:35,137
So, maybe

418
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,391
they didn’t seal her memories at all.

419
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,302
Purple Fox, seems like
you don’t like the God of War.

420
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:43,719
She hates the God of War because

421
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,471
rumor has it that Wu Zhi Qi
was captured by the heavens

422
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:49,411
because he fell in love with her.

423
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:52,119
Wu Zhi Qi doesn’t love her!

424
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,150
Wu Zhi Qi was framed by
the devious Yuan Lang.

425
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,839
Who’s Yuan Lang?

426
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,119
I think I saw him in your memories.

427
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,070
Yuan Lang is a scum.

428
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,425
1,000 years ago, the demons lost the war.

429
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:10,230
He was the reason Wu Zhi Qi
was captured by the heavens.

430
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,898
Yuan Lang thought he could
escape punishment by doing that.

431
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,408
That poor monkey doesn’t even know
who was the one responsible.

432
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,157
It’s a pity that Yuan Lang
is too cunning and devious.

433
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:25,365
I couldn’t find him
even after 1,000 years.

434
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:29,559
Maybe he’s hiding in Sky Hall?

435
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,154
Impossible.

436
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,915
He was marked with a sinner’s mark.

437
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,955
He can never enter Mount Buzhou.

438
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:40,439
If he is hiding inside Mount
Buzhou, I’ll tear him to pieces.

439
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,778
Mount Buzhou?

440
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,619
Sky Hall’s headquarters
is in Mount Buzhou!

441
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,530
I finally know where Yu’Er is right now!

442
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,759
Ling Long’s primordial spirit, Yu’Er,

443
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,513
the captured Wu Zhi Qi,
secrets of Sky Hall,

444
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,150
all questions will be answered
in Mount Buzhou.

445
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:02,763
We just killed Sky Hall’s messenger.

446
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:04,771
They’ll notice soon.

447
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,242
You should depart tomorrow morning.

448
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,887
Oh right, Ting Nu. You should tell us

449
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:15,556
how to reach the entrance of Mount Buzhou.

450
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:18,545
At the West, there’s a town
called Qingmu Town.

451
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:20,239
It’s at the base of Mount Buzhou.

452
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,940
Find two mountains with the same altitude
from the North and South.

453
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:25,731
The altar to Mount Buzhou

454
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,879
is located at the peak
of the northern mountain.

455
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,102
Okay.

456
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,426
These Birth Candles were made from

457
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:35,912
Merman’s Tear, Dragon Scale
and Sansheng Wood.

458
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:38,605
I only made five of them
as the ingredients are very rare.

459
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:40,505
Mount Buzhou is not located
in the human realm.

460
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,689
You can enter Mount Buzhou
if you light this candle.

461
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,479
Purple Fox.

462
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,611
Didn’t you grow up in Mount Buzhou?

463
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:53,159
Do you need the Birth Candle as well?

464
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,024
I’ve retained my human form
for 1,000 years.

465
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:59,111
Of course I need the candle
if I want to enter Mount Buzhou.

466
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:00,912
There’s nothing strange about this.

467
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,526
We only have five.

468
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,618
Where’s mine? I need to
go there to save Yu’Er!

469
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,538
I told you.
The ingredients were very rare.

470
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:20,399
And Mount Buzhou is a dangerous place.

471
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,119
You’re injured. You mustn’t go.

472
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,457
I need to save Yu’Er
no matter how dangerous it is!

473
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:25,783
I...

474
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,118
Brother Liu,
this will be a dangerous trip.

475
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,679
And you’re seriously injured.
If you insist on going there,

476
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,359
you’ll be a burden to everyone.

477
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,230
Don’t worry. I’ll save Yu’Er.

478
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,950
I can’t even help
during crucial moments like these.

479
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,326
I’m really useless.

480
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,286
Si Feng.

481
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,894
I’ll leave Yu’Er to you.

482
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,843
You must save her, okay?

483
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:01,828
Don’t worry.

484
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,603
I was marked with
the sinner’s mark as well.

485
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,081
I can’t enter Mount Buzhou.

486
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:13,071
Hero Liu and I will hide
once you depart tomorrow

487
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:14,519
so that Sky Hall can’t find us.

488
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,310
When you return, I’ll find a way
to contact you.

489
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,239
You must wear these bracelets too.

490
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,996
The bracelet will show you
the duration of the candle.

491
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,710
You must leave that place
before the candle is used up.

492
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,790
We understand. You’re so naggy.

493
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,804
There are signs of spells
used by the Shaoyang Sect.

494
00:37:57,805 --> 00:37:59,689
Xuan Ji and the rest were here indeed.

495
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:10,969
Although the Mirror of Origin
was shattered, I’m still too late.

496
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,882
Xuan Ji, will I fail
to stop you again?

497
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,677
Why are we stopping here?
Have we arrived at our destination?

498
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,018
You are country bumpkins indeed.

499
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,663
Mount Buzhou is a forbidden ground.

500
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:42,399
If you use powers to enter the place,
the mountain god will punish you.

501
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,150
That’s why we need to travel by foot.

502
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,470
Come. Over here.

503
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,364
You can’t suppress her forever.

504
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:04,631
The God of War will awaken soon.

505
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:07,222
King Bailing needs to fret over her again.

506
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:28,282
My lord, what are you looking for?

507
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,250
Tales of the Three Realms.

508
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,909
Are you talking about this book?

509
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,149
Yes!

510
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,140
You can see me?

511
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:45,864
Of course I can.

512
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:48,577
The Siming Hall is the place
where fate converges.

513
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:50,822
Your spell of deceit won’t work here.

514
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:54,399
I haven’t finished writing it yet.

515
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,150
If you want to read it,

516
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:59,226
you’ll have to wait until
I’m almost done with it.

517
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,359
Give it to me!

518
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,762
Why are you stealing it from me?

519
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,524
That’s all?

520
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:14,079
Where are the stories of God of War?

521
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,778
I told you I haven’t finished writing.

522
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:17,577
I’m still in the conceptual phase.

523
00:40:17,578 --> 00:40:19,208
Conceptual phase?

524
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,990
That means you have the stories
inside your head, right?

525
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,319
Tell me about it!

526
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,079
Her armor can disappear
and re-appear at will.

527
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,051
Tell me the reason I couldn’t find her!

528
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:35,601
Flying Snake, there are so many
immortals here. Of all the immortals,

529
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:37,885
why are you trying to
fight with the God of War?

530
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,781
Although there are many immortals here,

531
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:43,716
none of them can defeat me.

532
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,599
- Will you tell me or not?
- No.

533
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,030
You won’t? Fine.

534
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:59,436
Do you believe that I’ll burn this book?

535
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,839
- You dare to do so?
- Tell me!

536
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,499
- Tell me!
- You! Don’t do it!

537
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,719
Don’t burn it!

538
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,967
I’ll tell you everything!

539
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,871
My lord, please calm down!

540
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,271
Put it down!

541
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,450
Extinguish it.

542
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,199
In dramas, there are always
a male lead and a female lead.

543
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,479
It’s the same for my story.

544
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,441
Nine hundred years ago, during
the wedding of God of Gold,

545
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,240
the God of War caught the bouquet
which King Bailing had tossed.

546
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,525
She believed that
King Bailing will marry her.

547
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,518
And she even picked a Love Flower for him.

548
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,207
It’s my fault for letting you go.

549
00:41:57,739 --> 00:41:59,985
I didn’t detect your feelings for me.

550
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:01,896
That’s why I’m in this plight.

551
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:06,082
I’m sure there’s a way for me
to redeem myself.

552
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,959
What?

553
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,750
God of War and King Bailing?

554
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,663
You mean that cold King Bailing
who puts on a long face every day?

555
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,458
He even gave her a Love Flower?

556
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,110
Is this your own story?

557
00:42:25,786 --> 00:42:27,279
Are you listening or not?

558
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,572
Stop asking me if you’re not.

559
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,551
Fine. I’ll listen.

560
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:34,064
If God of War and King Bailing
do fancy each other,

561
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:36,265
why were they separated then?

562
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:40,124
After the war between immortals and
demons ended, the world was devastated.

563
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,405
We needed the strength
of the Southern immortals

564
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:44,519
in order to restabilize
the heavens.

565
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,083
That’s why King Bailing married
the daughter of the Southern Lord.

566
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:51,999
King Bailing had no choice
but to marry the princess of the South.

567
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,265
But God of War was enraged
when she knew about that.

568
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,153
After that, she became eccentric.

569
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,431
Besides speaking to the Crimson Birds
by the Heavenly Pond,

570
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:04,142
she had never spoken with anyone else.

571
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,759
- After that?
- After that...

572
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,039
One day,

573
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:15,199
Wu Zhi Qi, the Left Lieutenant,
stole the Yuntian Loop and Chehai Hook.

574
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,839
And the God of War broke into
the Demon Citadel in search of him.

575
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,733
But when she returned,
she was possessed by anguish.

576
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:22,284
Thus, she began to have inner demons.

577
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,119
Guess what’s next?

578
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,906
She went to the Southern immortals
and slew the Southern Lord.

579
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,470
How did she fight? Was she strong?

580
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:33,759
And it became a huge problem.

581
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,888
After that, Queen Bailing
forced King Bailing

582
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:40,319
to execute God of War
in order to avenge her father.

583
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,599
The Heavenly Court was in turmoil then.

584
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,085
But at the same moment, King Bailing
wanted to protect God of War.

585
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,916
He went to the Altar of Banishment
to persuade the God of War.

586
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,268
The Jade Emperor gave her one last chance
since she had made huge contributions.

587
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:59,127
She’ll be able to return here
if she goes through ten tribulations.

588
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:02,359
I told King Bailing about God of War’s
nine tribulations before.

589
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,570
But he threw a tantrum
and said that it’s none of his concern.

590
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:07,510
Actually, I know that
he couldn’t bear to give up on her.

591
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,977
Their relationship is very complicated.

592
00:44:10,978 --> 00:44:13,777
Our king has to face
his tribulation this time.

593
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,039
- Is that all?
- Yes.

594
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,724
I’ve been speaking for
a long time, you know?

595
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:29,399
I asked you how strong she was!

596
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,398
Why did you tell me her entire love story?

597
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:34,598
Violence isn’t an interesting topic.

598
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:35,771
Love.

599
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,248
Love is the essence of
Tales of the Three Realms.

600
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,945
I don’t believe it.

601
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:46,749
God of War is a great general.

602
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,705
She won’t rebel against us
just because of something like this.

603
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:52,799
I’m sure there’s another reason behind it.

604
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,159
You made up this story.

605
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,389
Story writers like you love to
make up stories.

606
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,879
Mind your words.

607
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,639
That’s the truth.

608
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,719
What do you know? You have
never been in a relationship.

609
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,999
Listen, God of War is a woman.

610
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,799
Women will turn
their jealousy into hatred.

611
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,659
No fun at all.

612
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,439
You don’t know how to appreciate this.

613
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,784
What a barbarian.

614
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:26,095
Barbarian!
