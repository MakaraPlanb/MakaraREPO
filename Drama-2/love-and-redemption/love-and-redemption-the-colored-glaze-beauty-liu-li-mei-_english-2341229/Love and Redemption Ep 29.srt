1
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,159
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,520
<i>EPISODE 29</i>

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,240
Are you cold?

4
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:55,840
I didn’t expect the
night to be so cold.

5
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,520
It doesn’t feel good to be cold, right?

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,320
Don’t go there.
I won’t be able to see you.

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,360
It’s warm like this too.

8
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
Looking at the distance, the altar

9
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,350
should be located at a forest
100 li away from the west of Qingmu Town.

10
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,359
We will reach there soon.

11
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,198
The entrance to Mount Buzhou
will appear on a full moon’s night.

12
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,622
Today is the 14th.

13
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:51,326
It will be the 15th at midnight.

14
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:52,920
We will leave at midnight.

15
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,342
- Sect Leader.
- Hao Chen, how is it?

16
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,319
Did you find Xuan Ji and the rest?

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,942
You left a note asking us
to wait at Qingmu Town.

18
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:12,399
- Why did Xuan Ji...
- This is the closest town to Mount Buzhou.

19
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,719
They have to pass this place
to go to Mount Buzhou.

20
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,949
The time is near.
According to my prediction,

21
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,879
Xuan Ji and the rest will be here.

22
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,839
In that case, since Qingmu
Town is big, let’s split up.

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,079
Yes.

24
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,759
- Hao Chen. Both of you, go there.
- Yes.

25
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,880
Junior. You will go there.

26
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,919
Ling Long.

27
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,640
I will definitely save you.

28
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Master.

29
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,200
Master.

30
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,719
You came here alone without telling me.

31
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Do you still think of me as your master?

32
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,159
Master.

33
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,519
I dare not.

34
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,239
I just want to save Ling Long.

35
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
Please forgive me.

36
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,190
But now that I’m outside
Mount Buzhou, I will not go back.

37
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:58,040
I have to save Ling Long no matter what.

38
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:02,558
You are my best disciple.

39
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,934
You also treat Ling Long wholeheartedly.

40
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,359
How will I blame you?

41
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,600
Stand up.

42
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:15,719
I thought you are
here to bring me back.

43
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,320
Why would I do that?

44
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,280
Min Yan.

45
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:26,374
When I first met you, you
were only eight years old.

46
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,310
You were cold and hungry
out on the streets

47
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:33,749
yet you still hold on to the family
heirloom dagger and wouldn’t sell it.

48
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,310
I knew at that time

49
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:40,159
that you are a strong-minded person.

50
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,000
That is why I came
to find you without anyone knowing.

51
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,566
- Master.
- Are you really willing

52
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:51,080
to save Ling Long no matter the cost?

53
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,118
Fine.

54
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,039
You didn’t disappoint me.

55
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,542
But this is not just to save
Ling Long’s life.

56
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:02,400
I have a more
important mission to give you.

57
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,920
I will not bring shame to you.

58
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,400
Why haven’t we walk the
100-li distance after walking for so long?

59
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,804
The road is getting steeper.

60
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:56,439
- We can’t climb anymore.
- No. I can’t wait another month.

61
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,736
I don’t want to wait too.
We have to find a way.

62
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:02,245
Ting Nu’s drawing is totally wrong.
It’s not detailed at all.

63
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:04,319
It’s almost time.

64
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,398
If the entrance appears with a full moon,

65
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,279
I think the time is not yet right.

66
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,480
Don’t be anxious.

67
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,160
Si Feng, look at that!

68
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,319
The moonlight of a full moon.

69
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,759
The road lit up by the moonlight.
This is the road to Mount Buzhou.

70
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,040
That’s right.

71
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,839
Yan Ran.

72
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,158
Si Feng.

73
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,959
Wait for us out here.

74
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,679
No. I’m your spirit beast.
I will follow you.

75
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,598
If you have to go in, you won’t
have the protection of Birth Candles.

76
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,439
You will show your true form.
You can’t use any spells too.

77
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,719
Isn’t that a trouble for you?

78
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,012
No.

79
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,320
Spiritual transport.

80
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,840
Opening dark clouds.

81
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,440
Energy grows.

82
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Connecting to the underworld.

83
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,560
- The gate is open.
- Wait.

84
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,597
Since we have a limited time,
it’s better to discuss

85
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:02,318
on how to use our time.

86
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,359
What do you want?

87
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,758
Let’s find Ling Long’s primordial spirit
before saving Yu’Er.

88
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,399
After that, we’ll go
to Fenru City to find Wu Zhi Qi.

89
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,365
We’ll act according to
the situation at that time.

90
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,024
I’m going to Mount Buzhou
to save Wu Zhi Qi.

91
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,359
Do you think I will delay you?

92
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,600
Fine. Let’s move separately
and not interfere with each other.

93
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,520
Let’s light our candles.

94
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,040
I’ll keep it, so I won’t lose it.

95
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
Let’s go.

96
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Xuan Ji, Min Yan.

97
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,301
- Master.
- Don’t go in.

98
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,960
Listen to me.

99
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,278
Father, I have to disobey you.

100
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
I must go to Mount Buzhou.

101
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,999
Xuan Ji, no matter what you are thinking,

102
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,366
I’m begging you to think about the oath
that you made when you leave the sect.

103
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,950
I won’t forget about the oath.

104
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,518
I will not change my mind too.

105
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,800
Foolish children.
You are gambling with your life.

106
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,079
I’ve made my decision.
I promise to come back safely.

107
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,245
Father, senior.

108
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:43,680
Take care.

109
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
Xuan Ji!

110
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
Master.

111
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:09,120
Take care.

112
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,759
- What is this place?
- This is outside the mountain.

113
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,999
- We’ve been shifted here.
- Let’s split up to find a way up

114
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
and go to the altar.

115
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,478
But now that the Birth Candles are lit,
all of them went in to Mount Buzhou.

116
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,199
We have to be careful.

117
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,799
If we extinguish the candles rashly,

118
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,866
they will be expelled
by Mount Buzhou’s law.

119
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,870
They will be in danger if that happens.

120
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,639
You are right.

121
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,680
Our main focus is to be quick
on bringing them back safely.

122
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,159
Is this Mount Buzhou?

123
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,880
You fools!

124
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,600
Your direction is wrong. Turn around!

125
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,845
Mount Buzhou is reversed
from the mortal realm.

126
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,480
Hurry and change our direction.

127
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,309
Look at you.
Making such a mess in the air.

128
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,760
Useless.

129
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,439
This is Mount Buzhou.

130
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,000
So, this is how Mount Buzhou that connects
the three realms look.

131
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,800
As expected.
I thought Sky Hall will be

132
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,839
hiding somewhere in Mount Buzhou.

133
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,359
Seems like the Demon Citadel
wasn’t totally destroyed.

134
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,846
It became a chaos void that
lingers on Mount Buzhou instead.

135
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,759
The demonic aura fills the shadows.

136
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,742
I think no one dares
to get close except for demons.

137
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:13,683
No wonder Sky Hall
places their hideout here.

138
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:15,246
Normal person cannot enter easily.

139
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:18,719
This demonic aura will surely
increase the power of the demon clan.

140
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,040
We have to be very careful when we go in.

141
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,150
Defeating Sky Hall is your problem.

142
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:28,560
Look along the shadows
if you want to find Sky Hall.

143
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,480
I’m going to Fenru City to save Wu Zhi Qi.

144
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,960
Fenru City?

145
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,982
Oh. Remember not to use spells here.

146
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,799
Otherwise, you will be discovered by
Shen Shu and Yu Lu who guard this place.

147
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,999
Don’t say that I didn’t remind you.

148
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,119
Alright. Farewell.

149
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,080
You’re leaving just like this?

150
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:53,350
Didn’t you say I’m wasting
your time if we stick together?

151
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:56,319
Why don’t we split up then?

152
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you want to stick together?

153
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:00,600
You have to be careful over there.

154
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,800
Look.

155
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,640
Shen Shu and Yu Lu?

156
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,919
It’s bad. I forgot.

157
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,379
It’s the seventh month.

158
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,359
What’s wrong with the seventh month?

159
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,874
Inside Fenru City,
fallen gods who fail trials, unruly beasts

160
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,668
and all the demons are locked inside.

161
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:35,079
Every 15th of the seventh month,

162
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,039
Shen Shu and Yu Lu will
let them out of Fenru City.

163
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,920
Today is the 15th of the seventh month.

164
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,038
The numbers of fallen gods
and spirit beasts are too big.

165
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,214
They’ve been locking them up
since hundreds of years ago.

166
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:51,920
That’s a given.

167
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,039
Alright. Enough talking.

168
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,839
Remember. Never use your spells here.
Those who enter with Birth Candles

169
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,998
will have their power weakened.

170
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,119
Don’t get me involved in your troubles.

171
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,200
I won’t be able to save you.

172
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,362
Alright.

173
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:12,960
I’ll be leaving.

174
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:17,920
Let’s go.

175
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,812
Whatever.

176
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:22,600
I will find Wu Zhi Qi
once I reach the bottom.

177
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,920
Purple Fox?

178
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,880
Wu Zhi Qi!

179
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,255
Wu Zhi Qi!

180
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:59,160
Where are you?

181
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,840
Wu Zhi Qi!

182
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,160
Wu Zhi Qi!

183
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,880
Where are you?

184
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,801
Wu Zhi Qi! Where are you?

185
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,080
Who is it?

186
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,701
Someone’s coming.

187
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:29,999
Someone’s coming!

188
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,800
After a thousand years,
someone is finally coming to see me!

189
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,359
Wu Zhi Qi.

190
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,920
Wu Zhi Qi!

191
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,800
Pretty lady.

192
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
I finally found you.

193
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,999
Pretty lady, don’t cry.
Why are you crying?

194
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,439
Am I dreaming?

195
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,709
I didn’t talk
for more than a thousand years.

196
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,719
I don’t know how to speak anymore.
Pretty lady. Here.

197
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,120
Pretty lady.

198
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,637
Pretty lady. Why are you crying?

199
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:41,919
Don’t cry.

200
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,120
Did my look scare you?

201
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,270
Is this better?

202
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:49,910
Pretty lady, how old are you?

203
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,760
Are you single?

204
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,520
Stupid monkey.

205
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,980
I finally found you.

206
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,600
It’s been more than a thousand years.

207
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,960
You’ve suffered.

208
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,159
This...

209
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,440
Pretty lady,
you’re just going to touch me?

210
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,534
Pretty lady, we’re not in a hurry.

211
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,149
Let’s take it slow.

212
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,920
Why don’t we chat over a drink?

213
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,439
I scolded Shen Shu and Yu Lu for 300 years
to get this wine cup.

214
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
Hold it carefully. Let’s drink.

215
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,643
Oh.

216
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:43,959
Grapes.

217
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,240
Pretty lady, here, have some grapes.

218
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,719
Stupid monkey.

219
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,639
Calm down.

220
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
Let me take a look at you.

221
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,000
What did you call me?

222
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:01,829
Darn monkey.

223
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,261
Stupid monkey.

224
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:05,007
What do you think I will call you?

225
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,680
You know me?

226
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,989
Why wouldn’t I know you?

227
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,480
This...

228
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,500
You don’t remember me?

229
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,440
You don’t know who I am?

230
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,766
Look closely.

231
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,000
It’s me.

232
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,000
We didn’t know each other, right?

233
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,160
I know. Pretty lady,
we’ve met in your dreams, right?

234
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,966
Stupid monkey.

235
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:43,004
I’ve been waiting and looking for you
for more than a thousand years.

236
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,012
Can’t you recognize me?

237
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:46,320
I am...

238
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,400
Pretty lady.

239
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,280
Pretty lady!

240
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,920
Wu Zhi Qi!

241
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,125
- Ling Long?
- Xuan Ji, what’s wrong?

242
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:20,800
I just saw...

243
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,840
Am I mistaken?

244
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,000
Look!

245
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840
- Purple Fox?
- Why did Purple Fox come out?

246
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,960
- Danger!
- No! Xuan Ji. Don’t use spells.

247
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,840
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

248
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,120
- You will be discovered.
- No!

249
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,879
Don’t mind me.

250
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,934
You will be discovered if you use spells.

251
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,120
No way!

252
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,720
Don’t mind me!

253
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,600
Purple Fox!

254
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,840
Xuan Ji!

255
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,080
Xuan Ji.

256
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,480
Who is it?

257
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:48,800
It’s bad. Let’s hide. Come on!

258
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,592
Who dares to enter
the forbidden land of Fenru City?

259
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:01,240
You can’t hide!

260
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,199
By the Jade Emperor’s orders,

261
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,079
Fenru City is the place
of punishments for the three realms.

262
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,119
Trespassers will be killed!

263
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,280
You are all mortals!
Accept your punishment!

264
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,174
Dingkun the godly sword?

265
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,828
It’s the God of War.

266
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:28,959
You know me?

267
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,044
Both of us have been guarding
Fenru City for more 10,000 years.

268
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,677
The God of War was punished
for nine lives and came by here.

269
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,919
Of course we know you.

270
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,646
God of War should be currently
punished in the mortal realm.

271
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:39,039
Why did you trespass Fenru City?

272
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,222
I’m not the God of War.
I am Chu Xuan Ji.

273
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:43,880
My sister’s primordial spirit
was captured. I’m here to save her.

274
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,499
We don’t care about
your name in the mortal realm.

275
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,182
You will always be the God of War.
How dare you break the laws of god

276
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,879
before you clear your own crimes?

277
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,240
God of War, are you trying
to enrage the heavens again?

278
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,759
This is our duty.

279
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,725
No matter where you come from,
you’d better return obediently.

280
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:01,079
It will add to your crimes otherwise.

281
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,719
We don’t mind killing another god
with the Zhuxie and Qumo swords.

282
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,559
Don’t scare me with the heavens.
I said I’m not the God of War.

283
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,648
Also, don’t punish me for the crimes
that I’ve never heard of.

284
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:14,080
I’m here to save my sister.

285
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:15,319
No one can stop me.

286
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,005
God of War is unmatched
at the heavens.

287
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:20,919
Unfortunately, this is our turf.

288
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,845
You used illegal ways
to trespass Mount Buzhou.

289
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:27,079
You don’t even have 10% of your power.

290
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,600
Let us battle with the God of War.

291
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
Xuan Ji! Be careful!

292
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,200
Keep your spells and
they won’t see us. Let’s go.

293
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,840
- Where did they go?
- Where are they?

294
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,920
- Si Feng. Xuan Ji. How are you?
- We are fine.

295
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,799
Where are you? Come out!

296
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,319
Zhuxie and Qumo were shattered.

297
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,880
We can’t locate them.

298
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,197
It’s time.
Fenru City’s gate is opening.

299
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:13,550
We have to go back.

300
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,600
Don’t let me catch you again!

301
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,800
Purple Fox.

302
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:34,320
Purple Fox won’t...

303
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:40,470
Purple Fox said it’s worth it

304
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:43,182
to devote everything
to a person she likes.

305
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:46,719
She did her best, for Wu Zhi Qi.

306
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,796
I believe she won’t have any regrets.

307
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,199
If I meet Wu Zhi Qi one day,

308
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,960
I will definitely tell him
what she did for her.

309
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
He should know.

310
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,558
After getting along on the way,

311
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,262
she was really not as bad as I imagined.

312
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:04,759
She was actually

313
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,262
a genuine person
who doesn’t mind sacrificing herself.

314
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:10,556
I wanted to find a chance to reconcile.

315
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:12,120
Unfortunately...

316
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,013
Let’s not be sad for now.

317
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,302
A section of
the Time Bracelet is lost again.

318
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:27,880
We won’t make it if we delay any longer.

319
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,598
The area below the Shadow Citadel
that Purple Fox told us is big.

320
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,684
We have to find the location of Sky Hall.

321
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:36,040
Let’s go.

322
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,145
- Did we beat the God of War?
- Of course.

323
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,748
When I said that her power is weakened,

324
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,143
it was just to embolden me.
I didn’t expect to be right.

325
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,579
Perhaps our powers
have increased recently.

326
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,040
We have to talk about it
at the heavens next time.

327
00:26:57,638 --> 00:26:59,600
Let’s piss the Four Sacred Beasts off.

328
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,359
I’m still alive.

329
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,120
I’m still alive?

330
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,798
The candle.

331
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,000
Who touched my Birth Candle?

332
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,757
Who extinguished my Birth Candle?

333
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,400
I will kill him!

334
00:27:54,942 --> 00:27:56,880
You sound confident.

335
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,686
You are long-lived as well.

336
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:04,799
You weren’t dead after
being beaten by Shen Shu and Yu Lu.

337
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
You did that?

338
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:09,126
It was me indeed.

339
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:10,640
Was it fun?

340
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,919
It’s been so long.
Do you like the surprise?

341
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,440
Who are you?

342
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,586
It’s you?

343
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:32,079
Yuan Lang.

344
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,719
You didn’t die!

345
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,350
How can I die when my brother,
Wu Zhi Qi, is still alive?

346
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:39,540
Nonsense.

347
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,821
Aren’t you ashamed to speak of him?

348
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:44,270
Why are you still so fierce?

349
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:46,199
You didn’t change after so long.

350
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,183
I spent so much effort to build Sky Hall

351
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:52,461
just to save my brother, Wu Zhi Qi.

352
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:53,920
You were the one

353
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,039
who built Sky Hall?

354
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,520
Yes.

355
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,559
I spent so much efforts
to save your Wu Zhi Qi.

356
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,165
How could you interfere me all the time?

357
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,639
Stop pretending.

358
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,219
If it weren’t for you,

359
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,799
do you think Wu Zhi Qi
will end up in Fenru City?

360
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,560
You were just trying to
get the Divine Weapon on him!

361
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,680
Little fox.

362
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,080
You know many things.

363
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,360
Take a guess then.

364
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,800
What will I do to you next?

365
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,614
Now, all of you will know that

366
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:01,079
Mount Buzhou
is a place that’s hard to enter

367
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,600
and even harder to leave.

368
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,840
Why is one Birth Candle missing?

369
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
A demon?

370
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,198
Demonic aura.

371
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,640
Who are you?

372
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,279
Xuan Ji.

373
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,501
Aren’t you curious
about what Shen Shu and Yu Lu

374
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:18,239
told you about committing crimes?

375
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,613
They are talking about the God of War.
Not me.

376
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:24,844
Furthermore,
the heavens is so secretive.

377
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:27,957
Even the God of War’s memories
are sealed.

378
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:31,454
Why should I care about
the crimes that I don’t even know of?

379
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,599
Also, I have something
important that I need to do now.

380
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,120
I have to save Ling Long and

381
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,760
be with you together.

382
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,500
Oh, Si Feng.

383
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:49,488
Why do you think powerful gods
like Shen Shu and Yu Lu

384
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:52,640
don’t even know
about Sky Hall’s demon entering here?

385
00:31:53,318 --> 00:32:00,080
Sky Hall must have some spells
or objects to hide their own identity.

386
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,278
The Black and White Ring?

387
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,518
Maybe.

388
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,159
There’s not even a rat here.

389
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,951
Maybe Sky Hall
might not be here after all?

390
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:10,519
How could that be?

391
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,520
But I’m sure I saw...

392
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:16,306
Was I really mistaken?

393
00:32:16,307 --> 00:32:18,919
Since we’re already here,
we might as well believe that it’s here.

394
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,200
- Let’s find again.
- Let’s go.

395
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,333
What should we do?
We’re running out of time

396
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,280
but we still have nothing.

397
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,520
By the looks of it,
is there a vision-blocking barrier around?

398
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,200
They are Xuanyuan Sect’s disciples.

399
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,800
It’s Ling Long.

400
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,760
Why is Ling Long here?

401
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,040
Look out!

402
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,040
Go there!

403
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,919
Ling Long, are you alright?

404
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,453
Are you alright, Ling Long?

405
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:31,920
Why are you here? Were you abducted?

406
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:33,919
You’ve recovered. You can move.

407
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,118
Are you really recovered, Ling Long?

408
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,439
What are you doing? Let me go.

409
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,125
- Ling Long.
- Let me go.

410
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:40,480
Ling Long.

411
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,084
Si Feng, what are you doing?

412
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:46,640
Where did you come from?

413
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,440
Ling Long, you don’t recognize us?

414
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,565
I’m telling you. I will slit his throat
if you move closer.

415
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,479
Ling Long, what are you doing?

416
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,799
- Ling Long, what’s wrong with you?
- I said not to move!

417
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,879
Ling Long, I am Min Yan.

418
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,221
I am Little Six.

419
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:05,439
Why do all of you know my name?

420
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,966
Are you the new human slaves?

421
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:09,519
Human slaves?

422
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,639
Ling Long, look closer. It’s us.

423
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,084
If you aren’t slaves,
then you must be spies.

424
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,839
- You want to abduct me.
- We are here to save you.

425
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,499
What’s going on?

426
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,564
Ling Long, we grew up
and practiced together.

427
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:23,920
We caught Quru Bird
and killed the Gudiao together.

428
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:26,022
You call me Little Six.
You like to argue with me.

429
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,510
You like to force me to eat your dishes.
Can’t you remember anything?

430
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,446
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

431
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:33,520
But it feels like...
It feels like...

432
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,959
Ling Long, I am your sister, Xuan Ji.

433
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,119
We are the closest people around you.
Let go of Sixth Senior now.

434
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,080
All of you must be lying.
Fine. I’ll teach you a lesson.

435
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,520
Why don’t we release her?

436
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,470
Min Yan, don’t be rash.

437
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:03,560
Something fishy is going on.
Let’s decide after we can be sure.

438
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,362
I’ve warned you. You better let me go.

439
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:10,639
If Brother Tong comes back,
he will definitely make you suffer.

440
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,719
Brother Tong?

441
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,222
- Don’t tell me it’s...
- Of course, it’s Brother Wu Tong.

442
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:16,639
He is Sky Hall’s most handsome

443
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,159
and powerful North Superintendent.
Feeling afraid now?

444
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,000
You call him Brother Wu Tong?

445
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,839
Did you forget how Wu Tong treated you?

446
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,999
How dare you talk bad
about Brother Wu Tong. I’ll kill you!

447
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,639
What’s going on, Ling Long?

448
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,639
She keeps protecting Wu Tong.
Don’t tell me that

449
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,359
it was Wu Tong who
abducted Ling Long from Fuyu Island?

450
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,679
Besides the few seniors from Shaoyang,

451
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,799
the other sect leaders
should still be on Fuyu Island.

452
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,109
It is impossible
for Wu Tong to abduct Ling Long.

453
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,840
Perhaps she isn’t Ling Long at all.

454
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,520
Here. Get up.

455
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,558
Please tell us honestly.

456
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,549
How did Miss Ling Long come to Sky Hall?

457
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,039
I am just a human slave

458
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,062
who got picked to play with
Miss Ling Long half a month ago.

459
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,053
Half a month ago?

460
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:05,262
Ling Long was with us at that time.

461
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,077
I smelled a demonic scent.

462
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:10,229
I thought it came from
Xuanyuan Sect’s disciples initially.

463
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,399
Now that I smell
clearly, it’s her!

464
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,720
She isn’t Ling Long but a demon!

465
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,239
Impossible.

466
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,040
This is Ling Long.

467
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,159
That’s right. Ling Long has
a mole on her right wrist.

468
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,600
What are you doing? Let go of me!

469
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,320
It’s really not there.

470
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,156
You are a demon. Who are you?

471
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,519
Why do you look exactly like Ling Long?

472
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,989
Let me tell you.
Brother Wu Tong loves me dearly.

473
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,410
If you still won’t release me,

474
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,213
Brother Wu Tong will
teach you a lesson when he returns!

475
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:43,000
- You...
- Min Yan.

476
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,879
Min Yan.

477
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,520
This demon doesn’t know a lot.

478
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:53,034
If we want to know the truth,
we still have to enter Sky Hall.

479
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:56,598
Yes. Isn’t that our goal
of coming to Mount Buzhou?

480
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,342
Ling Long doesn’t have much time left.
We have to think of a way quickly.

481
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,120
Don’t worry. I have an idea.

482
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,320
Silver Snake.

483
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,199
What is this?

484
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,039
Bring us to Sky Hall.

485
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,240
- Forget it!
- Forget it?

486
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,910
Silver Snake is extremely venomous.

487
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:18,944
If you don’t agree, it’s not very patient,
and will bite you.

488
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,640
You will immediately become
a green venomous corpse.

489
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,005
This is the place.

490
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:36,917
Here? We came here before.

491
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:38,440
Where is the entrance?

492
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,239
Alright. You are here. I’ll be leaving.

493
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,999
Hold on.
Where is Ling Long’s primordial spirit?

494
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,360
- Are you mad? Of course it’s with me.
- You...

495
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,039
Aren’t you killing me if you want
Ling Long’s primordial spirit?

496
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,880
All of you are mad!
What do you want anyway?

497
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,165
Wait. Don’t bite her.

498
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:29,120
By the looks of it,
she really doesn’t know.

499
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,214
What should we do?

500
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,165
If you don’t know
about the primordial spirit,

501
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,190
do you know where
is Shaoyang Sect’s Second Senior

502
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:44,679
being locked up at?

503
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,502
There’s also a demon spirit.
I’m sure you know about that.

504
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:49,278
Shaoyang Sect?

505
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:51,559
There are so many people.
Why would I know?

506
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,204
But there’s indeed a demon spirit
called Yu’Er or something.

507
00:38:57,205 --> 00:38:59,926
Yes. It’s Yu’Er. Where is she now?

508
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:01,560
Fine. I’ll bring you there.

509
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:02,999
You have to release me.

510
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,359
Bring us to Yu’Er first,
and Second Senior later.

511
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,421
We’ll talk about releasing you after that.

512
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:09,960
Let’s go!

513
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,739
Miss Ling Long,
why did you come to the dark dungeon?

514
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,789
Why do you care
if Brother Wu Tong doesn’t?

515
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,400
Can’t I bring my friends here? Get lost!

516
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,960
Open the door.

517
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,800
Get lost.

518
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,479
Yu’Er.

519
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,199
It’s you.

520
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,668
- Save me!
- We will save you immediately.

521
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,359
It’s fine now.

522
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,273
I won’t be naughty anymore.

523
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:53,574
I will listen to Old Fogey next time,
and not play with these bad demons.

524
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,760
I’m bringing you back to your father now.

525
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,830
Be careful! She isn’t Ling Long.

526
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:02,999
She is a flower demon.

527
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,680
Don’t be fooled by her.

528
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,679
I’m a flower demon and Ling Long.
What are you talking about?

529
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,222
You mistook me for someone else.
Now, you say that I am not Ling Long.

530
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:14,159
Do you think there are
two identical Ling Longs in this world?

531
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I’m not talking to you anymore.

532
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,972
Yu’Er, have you saw or heard of
any secrets around when you’re here?

533
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:27,280
A place where
Wu Tong never let anyone close.

534
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,445
I think it’s Wu Tong’s bedroom.

535
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:33,186
No one is allowed to enter
beside this flower demon.

536
00:40:33,187 --> 00:40:36,652
I even heard that Wu Tong killed
a small demon who entered

537
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:38,520
without notifying anyone.

538
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,599
Ling Long’s primordial spirit
must be in Wu Tong’s bedroom.

539
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,238
Primordial spirit?
There are indeed many of them there.

540
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,846
When Wu Tong
used me to threaten Old Fogey,

541
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:49,879
- he brought me inside.
- What primordial spirit?

542
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,840
But I don’t know
if Ling Long’s primordial spirit is there.

543
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,715
- Bring us to Wu Tong’s bedroom.
- You are really greedy.

544
00:40:56,716 --> 00:40:58,119
Didn’t you agree to release me?

545
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,880
If you cooperate with us,
we will definitely not harm you.

546
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:04,973
Yu’Er, hide your body and follow us.

547
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,840
Don’t let anyone find out.

548
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,399
There are so many of them.

549
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,240
Which one is Ling Long’s?

550
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,160
The primordial spirits here
are all the same.

551
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,310
We can’t even
differentiate which is which.

552
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:50,630
Ling Long!

553
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,022
Can you hear me?

554
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:53,520
Can you answer me?

555
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,119
What should we do?

556
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,845
Why don’t we bring
all these primordial spirits back?

557
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:02,742
I’m sure my father will find it.

558
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:05,560
Let’s do that.
We can’t be here for long.

559
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,439
Ling Long!

560
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,960
- Ling Long!
- It’s Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

561
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,800
Brother Tong.

562
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:41,600
Brother Tong.

563
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,880
The thing you’re
looking for is with me.

564
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,013
Old friends visiting me at Sky Hall.
Don’t you have to inform me?

565
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:56,119
How dare you be rude and search my place.

566
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,199
Just tell me if you want to find anything.

567
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,079
Ling Long.
Ling Long’s primordial spirit...

568
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,959
Calm down. This might not
be Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

569
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,359
He is trying to provoke you.

570
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,599
Wu Tong.
You’ve already got the spirit keys.

571
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,839
What do you still want?

572
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,800
Return Ling Long’s
primordial spirit to us!

573
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,871
Ling Long is only worth a few spirit keys
in your eyes?

574
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,879
In that case, it’s better if you
serve me by my side.

575
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,560
- What do you think, Ling Long?
- Shut up!

576
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,799
She is not Ling Long.

577
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,839
I won’t allow you to call her Ling Long!

578
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,285
How is it?

579
00:43:30,286 --> 00:43:32,654
Is the Ling Long I make lifelike?

580
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:35,079
Did I confuse all of you too?

581
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,882
Brother Wu Tong, what are you saying?

582
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:38,760
Why don’t I understand you?

583
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,800
- Ling Long.
- Shameless.

584
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,520
So, didn’t you say
you want to rescue Ling Long?

585
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,376
Fine. I’ll grant your wish.

586
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:57,789
- You can take Ling Long.
- Brother Tong. What are you doing?

587
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,840
I want to stay by your side.

588
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,280
Now what?

589
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:08,107
I had my eyes
on Chu Ling Long a few years ago.

590
00:44:08,108 --> 00:44:11,637
Surprisingly, Ling Long belongs to me now.

591
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,320
I can’t even chase her away.

592
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,870
Stop dreaming.

593
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,981
Ling Long will not like someone like you.

594
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:22,270
No.

595
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:24,479
Someone who’s neither a human nor a demon.

596
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,733
You should know clearly that you
will never capture Ling Long’s heart.

597
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:33,719
That is why you find this
flower demon to fool yourself.

598
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,557
What a joke.

599
00:44:35,558 --> 00:44:38,840
You are a joke
and a pitiful person.

600
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,277
Sixth Senior!

601
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:45,320
If you dare move,
I will smash his head with this.

602
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,120
Even if you kill me, you will
still not get Ling Long forever.
