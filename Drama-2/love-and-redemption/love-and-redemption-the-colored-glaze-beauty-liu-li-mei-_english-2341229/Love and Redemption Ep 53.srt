<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:32,938
<i>EPISODE 53</i>

3
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,228
The Snow Lingzhi?

4
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,799
Si Feng!

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,271
Look at the Snow Lingzhi!

6
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:48,732
It has matured!

7
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,900
Si Feng, you will be saved!

8
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,820
Xuan Ji,

9
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,119
I told you I wasn’t that unlucky.

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,471
You... You can rest at ease now.

11
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,759
Silver Snake!

12
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,275
Silver Snake!

13
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,478
Silver Snake! Wake up!

14
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,408
Wake up!

15
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,363
Is the thunderous calamity over?

16
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,644
Your blood contract has been terminated.

17
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,334
The thunderous calamity
has passed as well.

18
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:36,554
You’re free now.

19
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,079
- I’m free now?
- Yes.

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,400
- You’re free now.
- I’m free now?

21
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,580
Master!

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,902
No!

23
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,399
Snow Lingzhi!

24
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,494
Si Feng! What should we do
without the Snow Lingzhi?

25
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:02,395
Si Feng, how can I save you?

26
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,620
Si Feng, I want you to stay alive!

27
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,678
Si Feng!

28
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,832
- I’m fine.
- Master will die?

29
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,333
What’s going on?

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,340
Tell me!

31
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,447
Yu Si Feng, you
couldn’t kill me.

32
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,679
You’re going to die
in front of me instead.

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,479
What a funny turn of events.

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,775
Yuan Lang?

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,079
Yes.

36
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,460
I’m the only one who wishes
to send you to an early grave.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,416
It’s all thanks to
your stupid spirit beast.

38
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,717
Thanks to her, my plan went smoothly.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,620
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,919
I knew from the start that

41
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,167
Yu Si Feng was waiting for
the Snow Lingzhi to be matured.

42
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:54,799
That’s why I lured you into my plan.

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,111
Actually, you don’t need to feed
the moths with Lingzhi at all.

44
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,231
But if they consume Lingzhi,

45
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:03,719
they’ll feed on Lingzhi once
they become moths.

46
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,916
This rare Snow Lingzhi which only
grows around the Glacial Pool,

47
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:11,159
the moths will detect it
even from 100 miles away.

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,177
And once they consume it, there’ll
be no way to save Yu Si Feng.

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,461
You think you’re that lucky?

50
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:21,908
You think you could find the moths
vital in terminating the contract

51
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,345
by just exploring the huge Demon Citadel?

52
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,326
The book even told you
how to feed it, you know?

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,199
It’s all because my powers
haven’t recovered.

54
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,456
I couldn’t seek revenge by myself.

55
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,652
That’s why I placed the lure there.

56
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:40,033
I didn’t expect a dumb spirit beast
like you to fall for it

57
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:42,239
and become my weapon.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,498
Die!

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,060
General, you’re so fierce.

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,399
It’s a pity my real body isn’t here.
You can’t hurt me.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,068
Chu Xuan Ji,

62
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,894
I know you want to abandon
your identity as the God of War

63
00:04:56,895 --> 00:05:00,279
and you want to live with Yu Si Feng.

64
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,999
It’s a pity that you
can’t escape your fate.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,719
Not just me, the entire heavens
won’t let you off.

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,559
I’ll kill every one of you then!

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,499
Until you regret your actions!

68
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:15,399
Chu Xuan Ji, you don’t need to be angry.

69
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,119
Isn’t helping Yu Si Feng
to survive this ordeal

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,678
the most important thing now?

71
00:05:21,306 --> 00:05:22,594
Xuan Ji.

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
Xuan Ji.

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,171
Just let him go.

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,279
Just accompany me

75
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:30,702
for the rest of my days.

76
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:32,163
Don’t waste your time

77
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:37,188
on unnecessary feuds.

78
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,260
No! If you die, I
don’t want to live.

79
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,479
Silly girl.

80
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:54,745
Besides me,

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,022
you still have

82
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,110
your father,

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,961
your sister and the rest.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,500
How could you abandon them?

85
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,740
No matter what happens to me

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,860
in this lifetime,

87
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:15,776
I’m content.

88
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,958
Because

89
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,144
I know

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,420
I am always

91
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,037
in your heart.

92
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,412
I have no regrets

93
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,873
in this life.

94
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,980
Xuan Ji.

95
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,739
You need to

96
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,765
take care of yourself.

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,659
Actually, it’s too early for you
to say your goodbyes.

98
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,199
Yu Si Feng may still survive.

99
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,639
What?

100
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,585
Although the divine weapon
are draining his life,

101
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:57,389
there’s a way to save him.

102
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,457
You need to unseal the Jade Cup
and revive Star of Mosha.

103
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,319
The divine weapons are a part of
Star of Mosha all along.

104
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,079
If you revive Star of Mosha
and he absorbs divine weapons,

105
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,460
Yu Si Feng will be saved.

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,460
God of War,

107
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:15,166
it all depends on your choice.

108
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,308
Yuan Lang!

109
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,349
Don’t sprout nonsense!

110
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,072
You’ll know whether I’m
lying if you think about it.

111
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,693
I don’t need to say much.

112
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,199
God of War, it all depends on
you whether to save him or not.

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,544
Farewell.

114
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,733
Xuan Ji, don’t believe him.

115
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,538
Yuan Lang is trying to trick you.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,892
Master, I was wrong!

117
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,164
I didn’t do this on purpose!

118
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,232
I didn’t know that this was his plan!

119
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,394
Please don’t abandon me!

120
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,149
Silver Snake.

121
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,702
I’m not your master anymore.

122
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:05,465
The blood contract has been terminated.

123
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,439
You don’t need to kneel before me.

124
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,658
Now,

125
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,660
I don’t have much time left.

126
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,323
I just want to...

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,101
I want to

128
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,580
spend my remaining time

129
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,837
with Xuan Ji.

130
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:30,590
You should leave.

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,770
Xuan Ji,

132
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,541
Silver Snake

133
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:38,623
was deceived.

134
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,209
This is

135
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,230
my fate.

136
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,504
We don’t need to blame anyone else.

137
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,201
Let’s go.

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,149
Let’s go.

139
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,859
Master!

140
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,959
Stop following us.

141
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,340
If you follow us,

142
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:13,123
I’ll show you no mercy.

143
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:05,841
Xuan Ji!

144
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,119
Let me help.

145
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,299
Come.

146
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,799
This is Vermilion Bird’s blood fog.
Xuan Ji,

147
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,403
the thunderous calamity has
attracted the Four Sacred Beasts.

148
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:17,779
First, it’s Yuan Lang.

149
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,490
Now, it’s the Four Sacred Beasts.

150
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,399
Why are they pursuing us?

151
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,774
Why can’t they just let Si Feng and I
lead a peaceful life?

152
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,487
I don’t care who comes,
I’ll defeat all of them!

153
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,098
Flying Snake, take care of Si Feng for me.

154
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,207
Show yourself!

155
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,599
So, it’s the God of War?

156
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,342
Long time no see.

157
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,944
Why are you so angry?

158
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:58,053
Is it because my song
wasn’t good enough for you?

159
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,834
I’ve tried my best
to tolerate your actions.

160
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,278
Why are you still trying to force me?

161
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,519
You should know the best whether
Si Feng is Star of Mosha or not.

162
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,493
Why is the heavens
still pursuing him?

163
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:10,118
General, seems like you’re mistaken.

164
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,628
We’re not trying to pursue Yu Si Feng.

165
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,607
God of War, we’re trying to pursue you.

166
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:15,773
Me?

167
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,900
I’ve experienced ten tribulations in ten
lifetimes. I’m not the God of War anymore.

168
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,159
Why are you pursuing me?

169
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,903
God of War, we came here to arrest you

170
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:27,879
under King Bailing’s order.
You better cooperate with us.

171
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,294
If not, innocent
people will be harmed,

172
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:33,235
and I know you don’t wish to see that.

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,620
Thank you for the reminder,

174
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,619
but I’m not interested
in the heavens.

175
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,080
I won’t follow you back.

176
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,787
General, seems like you
care about him very much.

177
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,839
But he’s annoying to me.

178
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,156
Why don’t you let me destroy him
with my blood fog?

179
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,517
So that it’ll be more interesting!

180
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,726
Stinky woman, let me help you.

181
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,747
Flying Snake, what do you mean by this?

182
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,375
We’re your peers in the heavens.

183
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,919
It’s fine if you don’t want to help us,

184
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,860
but are you trying to betray us?

185
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,207
I just don’t like it when you
are trying to bully her as she’s alone!

186
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,787
We from the heavens...

187
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,919
Us from the heavens
need to obey justice and righteousness.

188
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,639
You can’t just bully her as she’s alone.

189
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,370
- I won’t stand for it.
- She’s the God of War.

190
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,878
She’s not a random demon.

191
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,049
You want us to fight her fairly?
That’s digging our own grave!

192
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,869
Flying Snake, are you acting like this
because you’re drunk?

193
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,112
Black Tortoise,

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,782
don’t you understand?

195
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,561
He’s doing this on purpose.

196
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:40,932
It’s obvious that
he wants to go against us.

197
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,279
Lord Flying Snake,

198
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,940
I heard long ago that you were
tamed by the God of War.

199
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,803
At first, I didn’t believe it.

200
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:50,044
But, judging by this situation,

201
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,280
it seems that it wasn’t just a rumor.

202
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,038
Nonsense!

203
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,644
I... It’s because I get along well
with her! That’s why

204
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,141
I take her as my subordinate!

205
00:12:59,142 --> 00:13:01,817
I won’t stand for it
if you bully my subordinate!

206
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:04,479
Flying Snake, capturing her
is King Bailing’s order.

207
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,368
I can ignore everything you’ve done,

208
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,919
but if you fight us today, it means that
you’re going against his order.

209
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,239
Have you thought it through?
Are you trying to disobey King Bailing?

210
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,799
King Bailing?

211
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,620
Naturally, I respect him.

212
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,940
But I can’t just leave
Xuan Ji in the lurch!

213
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:22,148
If you touch Xuan Ji,
I’ll fight until the end!

214
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,319
You ignorant imbecile!

215
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,300
We’ll capture you as well!
Prepare for your punishment!

216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,918
You are trying to bully me as well?

217
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,066
Flying Snake, you’re a heavenly officer.

218
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,679
You shouldn’t join this fight.

219
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,159
Let’s fight then! Stop wasting time!

220
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,474
- Come on!
- Be obedient!

221
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,823
Be obedient?

222
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,180
Why? I’m not your spirit beast!

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,650
Thank you, Flying Snake.

224
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:56,160
But I won’t put you in a plight.

225
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,780
Come on.

226
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,719
So, it was you?

227
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,500
Today, we’ll settle our debts
once and for all!

228
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,687
Ninth Heaven Fire!

229
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,020
This is as close as we can get.

230
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,999
No. I’m sure someone released
the blood fog on purpose.

231
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,319
Si Feng...

232
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,757
He’s hurt.

233
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,279
What if he’s in danger?

234
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,545
Yan Ran.

235
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,300
The blood fog is dangerous.
You’ll die if you inhale it.

236
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,721
That’s fine.

237
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,859
I was supposed to die anyway.

238
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,166
I want to save Si Feng.

239
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:20,601
You don’t need to follow me.

240
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,279
I can go by myself.

241
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,363
Yan Ran.

242
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,986
You and I are the same.

243
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:28,487
You can’t forget him,

244
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,912
and I can’t forget you.

245
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:33,041
I’ve promised to
see this through with you.

246
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,422
If you want to die,

247
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,639
I’ll die with you.

248
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,719
So...

249
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,340
Don’t blame me if you die.

250
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,363
Silly girl, this is not
how you should die.

251
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:48,373
Now, there is no wind, yet
the blood fog is floating around.

252
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:51,633
Seems like it’s following the direction
of the Southern Seven Stars.

253
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,324
If I’m not mistaken, the path

254
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,478
should be over there.

255
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,660
Set up the Sacred Beasts Formation!

256
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,275
Yan Ran!

257
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,300
Silver Snake, how do you feel?

258
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,519
Little Beauty, were they strong?

259
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,199
Why were you so angry at them?

260
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,759
They’re mediocre.

261
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,981
They’re using the Sacred
Beasts Formation to buy time.

262
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,776
Which one of you
hurt my Little Fox?

263
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,959
Come out!

264
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,591
- I’ll get even for her!
- Let’s go!

265
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,709
The Sacred Beasts are quick
in escaping, huh?

266
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,571
Si Feng!

267
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:44,519
Master!

268
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,739
Master!

269
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,361
Yan Ran!

270
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:50,919
- Master!
- Yan Ran, look at me.

271
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,039
- How do you feel?
- Where’s Master?

272
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,467
Where’s Master?

273
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:55,691
I’ll bring you to him.

274
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,902
Silver Snake!

275
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,138
Master!

276
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,428
Master!

277
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:14,809
I’m here.

278
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,852
Silver Snake,

279
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,751
why were you hurt?

280
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,027
Master,

281
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,180
are you alright?

282
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,540
I’m really sorry.

283
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:40,895
I can only offer my life
to atone for my sin.

284
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,740
Please don’t hate me,

285
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,002
okay?

286
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,542
I’ve never hated you.

287
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:50,879
Close your eyes.

288
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,180
I’ll treat your wound.

289
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,007
No need.

290
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,540
I can’t last for long.

291
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,453
Master, can I lie on your hand?

292
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:10,967
Just like the past?

293
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,660
I always thought that

294
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,700
if I regain my freedom one day,

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,540
I can become a real human.

296
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,610
And I can pester you

297
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,079
just like Chu Xuan Ji.

298
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,967
I can do everything she does.

299
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,100
But now, I finally understand.

300
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,260
I’m really naive.

301
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,380
The more I try to imitate her,

302
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,220
the further you are from me.

303
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,877
Chu Xuan Ji.

304
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,021
I will die soon.

305
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,340
No one will talk bad about you
in the future.

306
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,015
I’m sure you’re happy, right?

307
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:34,360
Silver Snake.

308
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,583
I know you treat

309
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Si Feng as the most important person

310
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:41,705
in your life.

311
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:45,919
And I know you did everything
for his sake.

312
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,201
So, Silver Snake,

313
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,540
I’m very sad.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,338
I’m really sad.

315
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,293
You cultivators

316
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,407
speak beautiful lies.

317
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:03,917
I don’t believe you.

318
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,817
Master,

319
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:21,806
how great would it be

320
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,850
if I’m a cultivator like you

321
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,660
in my next life?

322
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,154
Forget it.

323
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,300
Actually, to me,

324
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,372
staying as a little snake

325
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:56,511
and stay by your side

326
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,778
forever

327
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,276
is a good thing as well.

328
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,837
Master,

329
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,540
I’m so tired.

330
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,300
Can I take a nap?

331
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,420
Just for a little while.

332
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,027
Master,

333
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,940
please don’t wake me up.

334
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,817
Silver Snake.

335
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,155
Silver Snake.

336
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,060
Although you’re my spirit beast,

337
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,860
we’re mere friends.

338
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,317
Why did you insist on

339
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,660
achieving the impossible?

340
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,263
Why can’t you

341
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:01,281
take a look at the person
who’s beside you all the time?

342
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,624
Ruo Yu,

343
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,614
where are you going?

344
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,380
Yan Ran had a harsh life.

345
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,986
I’ll send her to West Coast.

346
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,231
That’s the place where we first met.

347
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,300
She’ll rest in peace over there.

348
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,741
Wait.

349
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:55,888
Si Feng!

350
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,794
- Your body!
- I’m fine.

351
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,620
Let me send her off.

352
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,516
Master, I’m your spirit beast.

353
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,839
I’ll follow you wherever you go.

354
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,906
I’m your master. If I die,
you’ll have nowhere to go.

355
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,478
Master, please don’t die!

356
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:37,896
If she dares to hurt you,
I will never let her off!

357
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,799
The Loveless Curse is triggering!

358
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,961
Master, please don’t hurt yourself!

359
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:48,068
If you hurt yourself, I can only
commit suicide to atone for my sin!

360
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,457
I don’t want to terminate
our blood contract!

361
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,082
I know my fault now!

362
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,286
I really do!

363
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:57,124
Master, I promise that
I won’t hurt Chu Xuan Ji again!

364
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,109
You mustn’t hurt yourself!

365
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,094
And you mustn’t abandon me!

366
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:03,679
I’ll follow you forever!

367
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,632
I will never leave you
and I will protect you forever!

368
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,944
In your eyes, I’m
only a spirit beast.

369
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,161
I disobeyed your command
because I didn’t want you to get hurt.

370
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:16,702
Because I only have you in my heart.

371
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,247
I was always beside you.
Can’t you just take a look at me?

372
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:22,754
If you think this is too tough,

373
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,749
you may leave me.

374
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,627
Fine.

375
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:29,239
You’ll regret this.

376
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,620
Just you wait. I’ll find a way
to terminate our blood contract.

377
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,332
Si Feng,

378
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,483
thank you for sending her off.

379
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,496
I’m sure she would be happy if she knows.

380
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,941
Si Feng.

381
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,856
Brother Liu.

382
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,250
Does your wound still hurt?

383
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,500
The wound is nothing.

384
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,639
I stole the celestial eye in the first place.

385
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,100
It’s fine if they want to take it back.

386
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,713
I’m just worried about Yu’Er.

387
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,158
She was implicated because of me.

388
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,279
I don’t even know where she is right now.

389
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,719
I told them to come at me for my misdeeds!

390
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,780
I will make them give me an explanation!

391
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,158
Those dogs in from the heavens
are too much!

392
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,185
I just wanted to lead a peaceful life!

393
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:41,809
Yet they’re coming for us!

394
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,868
I’ll destroy every single one of you!

395
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,678
Wu Zhi Qi, we were just hurt.

396
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,053
We’ll be fine after some rest.

397
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:49,679
Don’t be so angry.

398
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,278
Moreover, you said I was ugly, right?

399
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,388
This is better. I can train
for a few hundred years

400
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:57,182
and take on the appearance that you like.

401
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,519
How is this better?

402
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,047
I’ll make the call whether
you change your appearance or not!

403
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:02,520
They have no right to interfere!

404
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,297
- Ting Nu.
- Ting Nu.

405
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
How’s Si Feng?

406
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,940
He’s very weak, and his qi was damaged.

407
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,420
I’m afraid he can’t withstand
the power of divine weapons anymore.

408
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,900
How much time does he have?

409
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,190
Even if he’s lucky,

410
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,044
he’ll survive for one month at most.

411
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,467
Ting Nu, although
the Snow Lingzhi is gone,

412
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:40,758
are there any similar
herbs or grasses in the world?

413
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,317
There are so many
great herbs in this world.

414
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,721
Don’t tell me all of them are useless?

415
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:46,998
Just like you, I want to
save Si Feng too.

416
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,062
But the divine weapons aren’t
from the mortal realm.

417
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:52,363
His body can’t stand it
if he absorbs them by force.

418
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,255
We can’t do anything about it.

419
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,610
Don’t tell me Little Phoenix has to face

420
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:01,599
the same fate again?

421
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,830
No.

422
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,869
There’s another way.

423
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,331
Ting Nu.

424
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:13,040
If I unseal the Jade Cup
and revive Star of Mosha,

425
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,222
Star of Mosha will absorb divine weapons,

426
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:16,803
and Si Feng will be saved, am I right?

427
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:20,998
That’s possible.

428
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,631
But once Star of Mosha is revived,

429
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,352
the three realms will be
plunged into chaos!

430
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,817
That’s right, Xuan Ji.

431
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,479
Star of Mosha is a violent
and cruel entity.

432
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,707
If you revive him, everyone else will die!

433
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,644
Yes. If the three realms
are plunged into chaos,

434
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:36,932
the lines between immortals and humans
will be blurred.

435
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:39,259
And everything will be too late by then.

436
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,833
Si Feng.

437
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,479
Here.

438
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,691
Have some soup.

439
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,076
I’m really lucky.

440
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,077
I have someone to feed me

441
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,976
If you like it,

442
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,560
I can feed you every day.

443
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,300
Doesn’t that make me useless?

444
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,693
But judging by your condition,

445
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:08,634
you’re useless indeed.

446
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:10,576
Don’t worry, Si Feng.

447
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,660
You’ll get better soon.

448
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,319
Xuan Ji.

449
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,500
Are you trying to
revive the Star of Mosha?

450
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,220
Are you trying to unseal the Jade Cup?

451
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,860
That’s the only way I can save you.

452
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,712
This is Yuan Lang’s trick.

453
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:44,413
You mustn’t believe him.

454
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,582
Yes.

455
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:50,684
I know Yuan Lang is trying to
revive the Star of Mosha.

456
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:56,109
But I can save you
with this method as well.

457
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,420
If you do revive Star of Mosha,

458
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,645
the mortal realm

459
00:31:02,516 --> 00:31:03,976
may be pushed into

460
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:06,924
an endless sea of torment.

461
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,639
I know that.

462
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,780
But that’s just a possibility.

463
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,119
I don’t know what exactly will happen

464
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,604
once the Star of Mosha is
revived, but I know that you will die

465
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,888
if I don’t unseal the Jade Cup.

466
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,902
Don’t worry.

467
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,133
I’m the God of War.

468
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:42,319
I’ve recovered my powers.

469
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,653
I defeated Star of Mosha 1,000 years ago

470
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,114
and sealed him into the Jade Cup.

471
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,736
And now, for your sake, I can
defeat him and seal him again.

472
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,940
I won’t let him wreak havoc in the world.

473
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,755
No.

474
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,782
You won’t be able to seal him away.

475
00:32:01,783 --> 00:32:03,203
Don’t you believe in me?

476
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,790
Xuan Ji,

477
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,500
it’s not that I don’t believe in you.

478
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:14,471
But everything is uncertain.

479
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,719
If you fail,

480
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,839
the Star of Mosha will be revived, the
three realms will be plunged into chaos.

481
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,501
Your father, Shaoyang
Sect, Min Yan and Ling Long,

482
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,730
everything around us will be engulfed

483
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,159
by the hatred of Star of Mosha.

484
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,759
What can we do by then?

485
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,816
What else can we do?

486
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:38,397
We’ve missed out on too many things.

487
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,860
Si Feng, I just wish that
we can live together

488
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,414
and grow old together.

489
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,979
Xuan Ji,

490
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,096
that’s

491
00:32:56,231 --> 00:32:57,697
my wish as well.

492
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,780
But as a human,

493
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,539
I wish to live without guilt.

494
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:07,523
If the three realms are
plunged into chaos because of me,

495
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,159
I will be the biggest sinner.

496
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,460
Even if I live,
I will never live in peace.

497
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,722
Xuan Ji,

498
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,725
promise me.

499
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,201
Promise me that you’ll never do it.

500
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,735
Si Feng!

501
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,359
Si Feng!

502
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,649
Si Feng!

503
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,146
Si Feng!

504
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,348
I promise you! Please don’t move!

505
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:43,053
You mustn’t exert your body!
I promise you!

506
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,154
Okay?

507
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,351
Xuan Ji.

508
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,479
Let’s cherish our remaining days.

509
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,424
With you by my side,

510
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,300
I have no regrets now.

511
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,919
But Si Feng, I still need to
return to Shaoyang Sect.

512
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,511
My father’s birthday is arriving.

513
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:19,826
Ling Long has prepared a banquet for him.

514
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:21,727
She knows that I’ve found you.

515
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,836
She wants us to return together.

516
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,959
And...

517
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,805
There’s another important thing

518
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:35,307
that I must do.

519
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,109
Marry me.

520
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,957
But I don’t have much time left.

521
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,556
Won’t this

522
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,660
ruin your future?

523
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,820
I won’t marry anyone else

524
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,140
besides you.

525
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,140
So, no matter how much time you have left,

526
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,980
I want to leave no regrets behind,

527
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:00,305
just like you.

528
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,429
So, you must promise me
that you’ll marry me.

529
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,700
I promise you.

530
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,700
I promise you.

531
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,318
Greetings, King Bailing.

532
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,359
Flying Snake, seems like you’ve
been leading a carefree life.

533
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,692
I don’t dare to do so.

534
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,038
You don’t dare to do so?

535
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,447
You came to the mortal realm
without permission.

536
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:11,719
And now, you’re turning against
the heavens.

537
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,501
- This is bad.
- You’re too daring for your own good.

538
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,843
My king, please listen to my explanation.

539
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:21,194
No need for that.

540
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,460
I’ll give you one day
to return to the heavens.

541
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:28,730
If not, I’ll strip you of your powers
and charge you with treason.

542
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:30,639
The longer you delay this,

543
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,980
the heavier the punishment
your servants will get.

544
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,097
You better know what’s good for you.

545
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,259
So delicious.

546
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,263
Why are you acting so nice today?
You even prepared food for me.

547
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:52,284
I bought the buns from a distant town.

548
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,660
Save your breath. Just eat.

549
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,273
Just tell me what’s going on.

550
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,053
Xuan Ji, please think of a
way to terminate our contract.

551
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:09,240
Or just grant me
permission to leave forever.

552
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,201
I’m going to leave.

553
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,919
You don’t have a fever.
Why are you speaking nonsense?

554
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,199
Stop pretending.

555
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,940
Didn’t you say that you’ll allow me
to leave whenever I want to?

556
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,340
But Flying Snake, why are you
leaving right now?

557
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,708
Did I make you upset?

558
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,020
Is it because there is
no delicious food here?

559
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:35,561
Or is it because there are
no fights over here?

560
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,317
I’m a heavenly officer.

561
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,498
I can leave whenever I feel like it!

562
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,320
I don’t want to be
your spirit beast anymore.

563
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,913
You’re lying. We’ve been through
thick and thin together.

564
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:49,332
And you didn’t say you want to leave.

565
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,584
Why are you...

566
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,260
Is it because you know why
the heavens is pursuing me?

567
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,041
I don’t know!

568
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,032
What? You think I’m happy
when I’m with you?

569
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:03,079
I have to obey your command!
They even said I’m a spirit beast!

570
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,375
You recalled me in front
of the Four Sacred Beasts!

571
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,456
Have you ever thought of my feelings?
I have my own pride, you know?

572
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,676
I had enough!

573
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,335
Just tell me the reason
you’re upset with me!

574
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:16,156
Why are you trying to terminate
our contract? It’s upsetting, you know?

575
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,999
You’re a heartless person in
the first place. Why would you be upset?

576
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,729
- You!
- I don’t want to be your spirit beast.

577
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,700
- You better let me leave!
- You!

578
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,660
Did you forget how we made our pact?

579
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,412
So what if you defeat me?

580
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:37,999
I’m unhappy now!

581
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,359
You shouldn’t force me
to be your spirit beast!

582
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,342
If you’re unhappy with me,
just turn me into ashes!

583
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:45,163
If not, you better let me leave!

584
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:47,167
You can die alone if you want to!

585
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,143
It’s hard for me to obtain this position.

586
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:50,684
I don’t want to die with you!

587
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,319
Fine! You want to leave?

588
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,746
Leave now! I grant you my permission!

589
00:39:55,747 --> 00:39:57,708
No matter what happens to me
in the future,

590
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:59,639
it has nothing to do with you!

591
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,053
Great! I’m free now!

592
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,407
By the way, stinky woman, I
need to tell you one last thing.

593
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,400
You mustn’t unseal the Jade Cup.

594
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,759
You’ll regret it.

595
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,450
It won’t matter to you
since you’re leaving anyway!

596
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,624
You!

597
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,814
That’s right.

598
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:26,235
Both of us are stubborn.

599
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,124
My goodness.

600
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,879
- This is the end.
- Leave now!

601
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,213
I will never acknowledge you
even if you return!

602
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,519
Fine.

603
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,769
We’ll go on our

604
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,628
separate paths.

605
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,630
That little snake belongs to
the heavens in the first place.

606
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:11,304
If he stays, he’ll make
it difficult for everyone.

607
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,260
It’s the best choice
for him to leave now.

608
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,213
I know that.

609
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,559
I just can’t bear to part with him.

610
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,447
Enough already. You’re making me
uncomfortable with this.

611
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:23,708
We need to discuss our next plan.

612
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,361
Wu Zhi Qi.

613
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,639
Do you know the reason
the heavens is pursuing me?

614
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,570
You went to the heavens before.

615
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:36,316
Do you know why?

616
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,879
I think it may be connected to
your meeting with King Asura.

617
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,794
The time when you stole divine weapons
and lured me to the Demon Citadel?

618
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:46,985
Yes.

619
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,039
God of War, you murdered me.

620
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,479
With my last breath, I
leave you a huge gift!

621
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,097
You better take a good look

622
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,199
at the secrets hidden within
King Bailing’s hall!

623
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,828
You deserved all of this!

624
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:08,267
About the paintings within Demon Citadel,

625
00:42:08,887 --> 00:42:10,831
I don’t remember them.

626
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:14,069
I didn’t see them when
I went to Demon Citadel last time.

627
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,200
What exactly is King Bailing hiding?

628
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,399
Why did the God of War pursue him after

629
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,124
she returned from Demon Citadel?

630
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,555
While I was in the Mirror of Origin,

631
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:25,496
I think I saw an argument between
God of War and King Bailing.

632
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,799
She suffered a huge injustice.

633
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,290
She said the heavens used her.

634
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,252
And she wanted to destroy the heavens.

635
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,303
After that, she was sent to
the Altar of Banishment.

636
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:38,120
But I couldn’t see the entire
situation clearly.

637
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:39,566
I think the heavens

638
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:42,380
is hiding secrets about the God of War.

639
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,039
I think all of them are connected
to the Jade Cup and Star of Mosha.

640
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,310
You see, the heavens didn’t
pursue you for so many years.

641
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:57,839
But after the attack on Shaoyang Sect,
after the Jade Cup was disturbed,

642
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,079
they hurt Little Fox and took back
Liu Yi Huan’s celestial eye.

643
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,278
Now, they send the
Four Sacred Beasts after you.

644
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,459
I think all of them are connected somehow.

645
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,305
I won’t offend them if
they don’t offend me.

646
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,100
Seems like I need to
get to the bottom of this.

647
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,179
And I need to unseal the Jade Cup
no matter what.

648
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,894
That’s the only way I can save Si Feng.

649
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:20,157
Have you decided?

650
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,519
Wu Zhi Qi, you must help me
once I return to Shaoyang.

651
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,158
Don’t worry. I’m glad
to be of assistance.

652
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,218
Flying Snake is gone.

653
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,591
If you can’t get over him...

654
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:40,056
It’s fine. He’s heartless.

655
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:42,637
It’s better for him
to stay in the heavens.

656
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:47,479
Si Feng.

657
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,773
We can ask for my father’s permission
once we return to Shaoyang.

658
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:52,554
And we can be together forever after that.

659
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:00,719
Xuan Ji.

660
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,279
Listen to me.

661
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,620
In my current state,

662
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,515
I’m afraid that

663
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,940
I will leave you soon.

664
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,909
And it may

665
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,009
ruin your future.

666
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,700
Si Feng, we’ve been
through so many ordeals.

667
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,940
Don’t you understand?

668
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,460
I’ve recovered my six senses.

669
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:27,930
I’ve thought it through.

670
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:31,717
I will only be happy if I stay with you.

671
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,100
Are you going to
meet your father like this?

672
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,659
Do I look ugly?

673
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,182
I’ve spent a long time
to doll myself up, you know?

674
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:53,750
Take out your accessories.

675
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,803
Si Feng, I want you to
draw my eyebrows every day

676
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:20,462
after we get married.

677
00:45:27,163 --> 00:45:28,567
Okay.

678
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:30,148
I’ll draw them for you every day.

679
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,859
Si Feng, you even know
how to draw eyebrows?

680
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,528
This is my first time
drawing them for others.

681
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:03,784
I’m not an expert yet.

682
00:46:03,785 --> 00:46:05,980
But I’ll improve gradually.

683
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,463
- Don’t move.
- It’s itchy.

684
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:09,964
It’ll end up badly if you move.

685
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:11,654
I’m almost done.

686
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,831
Si Feng, my father always
told me this when I was young.

687
00:46:28,832 --> 00:46:31,372
He drew my mother’s eyebrows for her
when I was young.

688
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,674
It’s different for your
father and mother.

689
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,851
Mister Yi,

690
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:03,775
where are you going?

691
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,801
I have something to attend to.

692
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:07,555
I need to leave.

693
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,661
Will you return?

694
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,652
No.
