<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:32,560
<i>EPISODE 23</i>

3
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,112
The Five Great Sects
were arrogant and selfish.

4
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
All of you didn’t treat
Sky Hall seriously.

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,880
Now that everything has gone to
hell and the spirit keys were stolen,

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,759
you are just trying to find
an excuse for your mistakes.

7
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,559
You want someone to take this blame.

8
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
This blame

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
will not be bear
by me and my spirit beast.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
I will be suffering alone

11
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,200
from this heavy punishment.

12
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,451
Fine.

13
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,360
I knew it’s you.

14
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
You changed?

15
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,915
How is it? Do you like it?

16
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:53,060
You changed for me?

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,439
What if I don’t?

18
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,000
If you don’t, I
won’t dress like this.

19
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,978
What do you like? Tell me.

20
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:10,639
I don’t need it.

21
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,919
What? You don’t like that
I’m trying to make you happy?

22
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,150
You are not the type
who will purposely make people happy.

23
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,366
You are arrogant. You never bat an eye.

24
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:21,359
You will provoke someone
when you are unhappy.

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,717
You were like that
when I first met you under Mount Shaoyang.

26
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,702
Your temper angers people.

27
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:30,159
But I like to make you angry.

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,278
I like to see you getting angry.

29
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,959
I like it when you get impatient.

30
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,560
I like it when you stare at me with anger.

31
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,846
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,007
I don’t know.

33
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,544
Although you’ve forgotten
about everything in the past,

34
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,039
you are still Ling Long.

35
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,239
You can’t change!

36
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,639
You can’t change!

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,879
You can’t change!

38
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,378
What are you talking about?
I don’t know anything!

39
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,680
You are my benefactor.
I just want to make you happy.

40
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,120
I’ll leave if you don’t like it.

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,519
Let me go!

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,400
Who allowed you to leave?

43
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,000
Who asked you to repay me?

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,359
I like how you are right now.

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
Willful. Bossy.

46
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,466
Opposing me angrily.

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,584
You’re crazy.

48
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,418
You don’t know

49
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,440
how charming you look right now.

50
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:58,759
That’s not right.

51
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,943
How could you not resist me?

52
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,199
You were never the type to obey people.

53
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,799
I’m even trying to kiss you.

54
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,279
You should hit me, scold me and oppose me.
You should push me away.

55
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,302
You should slap me! Slap me!

56
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,800
Slap me!

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,920
You asked me to slap you.

58
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,999
What is that expression?

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,100
What do you want me to do?

60
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,959
Yes.

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,440
You are Ling Long.

62
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,520
Just keep it this way and be
by my side obediently, alright?

63
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,719
I have a temper!

64
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,520
I will ignore you if you keep this up.

65
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,793
If you stay like this,
I will listen to you.

66
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,960
Xuan Ji.

67
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:50,480
Xuan Ji!

68
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,639
Xuan Ji!

69
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,880
Xuan Ji.

70
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,080
How are you?

71
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,119
Are you trying to
force your sealed inner force? Nonsense!

72
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,839
Senior Hao Chen’s power
is far greater than yours.

73
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,079
Your inner force sealed by his qi
will not be easily be broken by force.

74
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,119
Unfortunately, I didn’t succeed.

75
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,600
I’m so useless.

76
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,159
What are you doing? You’re still trying?

77
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,520
Do you want to die?

78
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:23,199
I am restricted
with the way I am.

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,559
I can’t help Si Feng at all.

80
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,680
I couldn’t find
the demon hiding on Fuyu Island.

81
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,927
I don’t even know
how is Si Feng right now.

82
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,784
Even if...

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
Even if none of you believe him,

84
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
I still won’t give up.

85
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,414
Sixth Senior.

86
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,359
Don’t mind me.

87
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,919
I will be responsible for my own life.

88
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,119
I’m willing to take
such a risk for Si Feng.

89
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,840
I think you’ve gone mad.

90
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,599
I didn’t say I don’t trust him.

91
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,439
I’ve gotten Master’s approval
to talk to him in the prison.

92
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Let me see how he is doing
and talk about it when I’m back.

93
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,720
Fine.

94
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
My lord.

95
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,890
I fought courageously for you,
and made the plan.

96
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,639
I helped Wolf obtained two spirit keys.

97
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,502
I don’t know why
I deserve this punishment.

98
00:08:45,503 --> 00:08:47,759
You did contribute
at the battle of Fuyu Island

99
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,853
but it’s not enough
to atone for your mistakes.

100
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:52,719
What did you do when I asked you
to fake an attack on Fuyu Island?

101
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,119
You took Sky Hall’s
demon forces and rush to battle.

102
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,639
What a glorious moment
for the North Superintendent.

103
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,495
Do you know how many casualties
our demon force has suffered?

104
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,639
But the sect suffered damages as well.

105
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,759
Isn’t your final aim
to destroy the Five Great Sects?

106
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,920
Why are you just stealing spirit keys?

107
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,079
From this day onwards,

108
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,679
Wolf will be solely responsible
for the spirit keys.

109
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,399
You shall not interfere.

110
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,640
You no longer have the authority
to command Sky Hall’s demon force.

111
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,759
Stay here and wait
for the next order.

112
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Get lost if you understand.

113
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,799
You are wise, my lord.

114
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,199
My lord, I wonder if
the Flower Demon beside Wu Tong...

115
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,199
Do you think I don’t know about it?

116
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,398
He can have fun with her
since I have no use for her now.

117
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,159
She will be of use to me later.

118
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,840
Make the necessary preparations
to take the remaining spirit keys.

119
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,454
Yes.

120
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,519
We have verified that

121
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,062
the Jade Cup sealing
Star of Mosha’s primordial spirit

122
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:04,519
is in Shaoyang’s secret ground.

123
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,094
We are just waiting to gather the
spirit keys and obtain the Divine Weapon.

124
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:10,446
Even the Heaven are helping me.

125
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:14,182
Everything is proceeding
according to our plan smoothly.

126
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:16,501
Looks like the Heaven agree that

127
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:19,782
it’s time to break
the balance of the Three Realms.

128
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,114
Si Feng.

129
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,280
Have a drink.

130
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,880
You should know

131
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,280
that I’m a particular person.

132
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,656
How can I drink this water?

133
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,200
You won’t drink or you
can’t even drink at all?

134
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,680
Don’t tell me that

135
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,120
you can’t even lift this bowl up?

136
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,680
You shouldn’t expose me.

137
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,080
Don’t you think

138
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,320
I will be embarrassed
if you put it like that?

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,680
What good will it
bring you by being stubborn?

140
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Here.

141
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,159
Si Feng!

142
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,560
Are you alright?

143
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:38,639
What is this?

144
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
Don’t worry.

145
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,000
I won’t die.

146
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,799
Why did you torture yourself like this?

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,280
You are here to advise me, right?

148
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,078
Even if I want to advise you,
I still need you to listen.

149
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,326
As your brother, I can’t
bear to see you suffer.

150
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:03,894
Is it necessary to ignore your friends,
and your own life

151
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,560
for that Lu Yan Ran?

152
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:14,240
Lu Yan Ran is her fake name indeed.

153
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,334
But she did adventure and

154
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,440
share our troubles with us along the way.

155
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,400
Isn’t she

156
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,960
our friend as well?

157
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,982
Shouldn’t I protect her?

158
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,479
That’s different.

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,199
She’s a demon.

160
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
By protecting Sky Hall’s demon,

161
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,799
you are destroying
the only hope of saving Ling Long.

162
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,120
Do you know that?

163
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:45,640
Min Yan.

164
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,680
About saving Ling Long,

165
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,439
please find another way.

166
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,600
Silver Snake will not be able to help.

167
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,360
I know

168
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:03,556
this will be the result in the end.

169
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:04,900
Fine.

170
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:10,620
Even if you don’t care about
your friends or your own self,

171
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,720
you should think about Xuan Ji at least.

172
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:17,800
She is risking her life to save you.

173
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:21,200
I couldn’t stop her at all.

174
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,960
You want her to get involved?

175
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:32,422
You should know Xuan Ji’s personality.

176
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,119
I’m really worried that

177
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,837
she might try to
force her way in to save you one day.

178
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:38,520
Think about the consequences.

179
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,999
Actually, I want
to help you too.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,280
- But, Si Feng, you...
- Min Yan.

181
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,280
Tell Xuan Ji.

182
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,440
Tell her that I’m fine.

183
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,840
The sect leaders call me here

184
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
just to ask me some details.

185
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
They will release me

186
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,920
if they can’t get anything from me.

187
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,875
After all,

188
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,000
I’m still someone from Lize Palace.

189
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,480
Don’t worry.

190
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,240
Tell her

191
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,200
that I’m fine.

192
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,399
She wants to protect me out of friendship.

193
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,600
I appreciate that.

194
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,240
This is my own problem.

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,120
It’s none of her business.

196
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,080
Ask her not to cause any troubles.

197
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,799
I will feel better too.

198
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,320
Min Yan.

199
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,640
Can you do it?

200
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,880
Si Feng.

201
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:00,320
Si Feng.

202
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,900
Sixth Senior!

203
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,039
Sixth Senior.

204
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,157
Did you see Si Feng?
How is he? Is he fine?

205
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,639
He’s fine.

206
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,319
Nothing happened.

207
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,677
He said this is his own problem.

208
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:59,240
It’s none of your business.

209
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,240
None of my business?

210
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,120
What is this?

211
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,279
Xuan Ji.

212
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,639
This is Si Feng’s blood, right?

213
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,020
You lie to me. He isn’t fine.

214
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,960
Xuan Ji!

215
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:35,670
Xuan Ji, what are you doing?

216
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:36,960
Senior Hao Chen.

217
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:43,439
Senior Hao Chen. Si Feng went
through interrogation and punishments.

218
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,719
Why isn’t he released yet?

219
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,878
He is innocent.

220
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,479
We have to be careful
with the enemy ahead of us.

221
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,799
He and his demon snake
are involved in two deaths.

222
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,679
There is no evidence at all.

223
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,800
How can the case be solved?

224
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,727
He might be innocent.

225
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:01,479
But there’s also another
possibility where he is the culprit.

226
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,919
He is indeed a demon clan from Sky Hall.

227
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,799
The Four Sects
are walking on thin ice now.

228
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,479
No one dares to guarantee his innocence.

229
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,078
Who will take responsibility
if he is wrongly released?

230
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
Si Feng is innocent. He is not a demon.

231
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,799
When will you grow up?

232
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,960
How are you vouching for his innocence?

233
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,999
With that friendship
when both of you were young?

234
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,598
Do you know that love is
the weakest thing of all?

235
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,039
Isn’t the love deep between
Lord Dong Fang and his wife?

236
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,759
Didn’t he end up getting betrayed?

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,280
Your relationship with him is nothing.

238
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,839
How could you know Yu Si Feng
didn’t pretend to be friends with you

239
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,614
but tried to lurk around
the daughter of Shaoyang’s sect leader

240
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:46,285
to become the spy of Sky Hall?

241
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:49,799
When he first entered Shaoyang,
he baited you to go to the secret ground.

242
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,399
Don’t you think that was pre-planned?

243
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,439
What did I teach you?

244
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,199
Don’t judge with emotions.

245
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,960
Be rational. Think about it!

246
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,693
If that’s the truth, there will be
no real emotions in this world.

247
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:13,439
If I have to sacrifice friendships,
I would rather give up my rationality.

248
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,680
The Si Feng I know
is not that kind of person.

249
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:26,158
Because of him,

250
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,039
you’d rather forget everything
I taught you at Xuyang Peak

251
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,200
and keep acting rashly
without considering the big picture?

252
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,320
You trust him that much?

253
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,760
Yes. I trust him.

254
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,280
It’s no use even
if you trust him.

255
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,600
Open the gate.

256
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,120
What’s wrong?

257
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:42,360
You won’t wait until the sect leaders
are here before interrogating me?

258
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,479
That’s not necessary.

259
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,039
I’m just here to ask you

260
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,640
what is your motive
of getting close to Xuan Ji.

261
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,920
My motive?

262
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,800
Making friends depends on fate.

263
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,280
If we became friends,

264
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,599
we might be normal friends,
we might be a perfect match

265
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,359
or we might live and die together.

266
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,399
Senior Hao Chen.

267
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,088
Don’t you have any friends?

268
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:19,526
What do you think my motive was?

269
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,959
Don’t try to be smart with me.

270
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,589
Didn’t you get close to Xuan Ji

271
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,880
to urge her,
and trick her to find her six senses?

272
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,680
You tempt her to
have greed and be reckless.

273
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:35,040
What kind of friend are you?

274
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,520
Xuan Ji is a human being.

275
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,039
She wants to have feelings
like a normal person.

276
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,520
But you

277
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,894
stopped her from feeling anything human.

278
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:50,440
Let me ask you.

279
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,080
What is your motive?

280
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,999
Xuan Ji is the protector.

281
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,574
That is her fate.

282
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,959
She is destined to have no senses.

283
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
That’s also a blessing.

284
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,495
But you...

285
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:10,199
You taught her to twist her destiny.

286
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,679
She was naive but you let her fall
into unnecessary worries and obsession.

287
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,360
How dare you say
you don’t have a motive in mind?

288
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,719
Tell me.

289
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,999
What are you trying to do
and what did you find out?

290
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,399
I don’t know what you are talking about.

291
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
Fate and destinies.

292
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,200
Xuan Ji’s life should
be decided by her.

293
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,600
You don’t have the right
and authority to decide for her.

294
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,479
When will you stop lying to me?

295
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,559
All these years, I am muddled.

296
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,680
I don’t know
where I am or where I come from.

297
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,159
I have no name because
you don’t dare to tell me.

298
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,279
I have no family or friends

299
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,839
because you are afraid
I might find a hint of where I come from.

300
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,358
Tell me. Why are you doing this?

301
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,799
Si Feng is innocent. He is not a demon.

302
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,440
You trust him that much?

303
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:09,542
Yes. I trust him.

304
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:11,160
I trust him.

305
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,039
This Yu Si Feng.

306
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,599
Xuan Ji opposed me because of him.

307
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,000
I even got angered
by him and lost my rationality.

308
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,399
What’s wrong with me?

309
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,760
He cannot be kept alive.

310
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,182
- Father.
- What are you doing?

311
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,759
I’ve told you.

312
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,822
It’s impossible to release Yu Si
Feng at a crucial time like this.

313
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:19,941
Father. I beg you.

314
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,456
Si Feng just wants
to save his spirit beast.

315
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:25,639
If you have evidence,
I have nothing to say.

316
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,079
But you are only judging from assumptions.

317
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,160
It’s too reckless
to wrong an innocent person.

318
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,240
Stand up.

319
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,830
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

320
00:23:39,831 --> 00:23:42,958
This is related to every sect’s existence.

321
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:46,574
The Four Sects
have reached an agreement on this.

322
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,479
You don’t have to argue.

323
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,159
Whichever is more important
between the lives of everyone

324
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,119
and a person’s life, don’t you know that?

325
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,487
I don’t.

326
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,479
The anonymous letter telling every sects
about the existence of Sky Hall

327
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,960
was written by Si Feng.

328
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,839
The Four Dimension Chain,
spirit keys, Star of Mosha.

329
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,558
Si Feng told me everything.

330
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,023
Everyone knew about the dangers,
but wouldn’t believe him.

331
00:24:09,024 --> 00:24:11,038
Trying to cover up
and finally blaming it all

332
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,598
on an innocent person
after everything happened.

333
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,479
Will you right the previous
wrongs by locking Si Feng up?

334
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,479
There are many things
that you don’t understand.

335
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,439
If the Star of Mosha is released,
many people will be dead.

336
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,439
You don’t know anything,
yet you still argue with me.

337
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,799
Xuan Ji.

338
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,277
You disappoint me.

339
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:32,679
I’m disappointed too.

340
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,743
The cultivator sects claim
to be benevolent and righteous

341
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:37,559
but because of an unproven accusation,

342
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,519
they tried to sacrifice
the innocent Si Feng.

343
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,800
Where is the benevolence
and righteousness?

344
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,880
Master.

345
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,519
What’s right is right and
what’s wrong is wrong.

346
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,199
Treating Si Feng this way

347
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,920
- isn’t fair!
- You...

348
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,318
Master, Dianjinggu’s Elder Zong
caught the escaping Madam Dong Fang.

349
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,719
She’s brought to the prison.

350
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,014
Valley Master Rong
requests your presence.

351
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:12,919
Madam Dong Fang.

352
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,639
She knows who is
the demon hiding on Fuyu Island.

353
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,679
She can prove Si Feng’s innocence.

354
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,639
But Madam Dong Fang has accused Si Feng.

355
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,598
She said he is Sky Hall’s demon
and their accomplice.

356
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,080
What?

357
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,182
No. That’s impossible.

358
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:28,440
I have to ask her.

359
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,159
Xuan Ji!

360
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,800
- Master.
- Lock her up.

361
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,519
What do you want me to say?

362
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,079
I’ve already told you.

363
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,782
He is the demon.

364
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:43,725
The demon of Sky Hall.

365
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:45,360
That’s the truth.

366
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,599
We planned everything.

367
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,320
All of you have to be baited.

368
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:55,246
Once Xuanyuan’s sect leader is dead,

369
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:57,719
no one else can open the Destiny Pearl.

370
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,600
We want the spirit key
and not the stupid pearl.

371
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,479
When Yu Si Feng pretended
to bring Ling Long back,

372
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,159
we’ve already predicted
that all of you righteous sects

373
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,320
will make the exchange
with a fake spirit key.

374
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,999
As expected.

375
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
All of you are hypocrites.

376
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:22,160
Qing Rong.

377
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,039
When did you become like this?

378
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,919
I’m always like this!

379
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,079
You better stay away from me.

380
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,839
You are just like them.

381
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,719
Disgusting.

382
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,574
Do you dare say that you’ve
never killed someone from my sect?

383
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:40,320
- You...
- Stop pretending.

384
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,319
Let me tell you.

385
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,240
I wouldn’t be with you if
it wasn’t for my survival.

386
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:54,886
Now that I think about it.
It’s not worth it to get rid of you

387
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:56,760
by using the Gu Poison.

388
00:26:57,623 --> 00:27:01,360
Why should I get rid of a puppet like you?

389
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,628
Thanks to him making
the act on the island,

390
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:13,935
your suspicions on me was gone

391
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:18,691
and fall for me.

392
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:23,080
You even gave me
the key to the Treasure Vault.

393
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:26,887
I was only satisfied

394
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:30,520
- when I finally broke your heart.
- You...

395
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,422
Look at that.

396
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:35,960
What is that expression?

397
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:40,470
Yu Si Feng.

398
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,400
What do you have to say?

399
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,119
- She’s mad.
- Who is mad?

400
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,079
You are the one who’s mad.

401
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,934
He is a demon. Don’t trust him!

402
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,840
He’s the same as Ouyang Tong!

403
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,680
A heartless demon
who betrays me.

404
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,399
I gave him so much help

405
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,389
yet he abandoned me
after he got the spirit key.

406
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,080
Everything is fake.

407
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:10,599
Every demon of Sky Hall should be dead.

408
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,160
Same goes for you.

409
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:22,280
Worse comes to worst,
we will all just die together.

410
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,319
- Give it to me!
- Don’t touch Qing Rong!

411
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,680
Si Feng!

412
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,479
Si Feng.

413
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,559
Yu Si Feng.
Can’t the Hell’s Nail hold you down?

414
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,800
Hold it!

415
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,078
This is the Demon Corpse Poison.

416
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,439
I saw it clearly.

417
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,600
Si Feng was just trying
to take the poison instead of killing her.

418
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:46,920
Yes.

419
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,559
Let me tell you.

420
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,000
I want to kill all of you.

421
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:58,480
Then, only will he think I’m
useful and come back for me.

422
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,720
Why didn’t all of you die?

423
00:29:05,231 --> 00:29:06,919
Why?

424
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,198
All of you should die.

425
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,239
Die!

426
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,429
- Qing Rong, what are you doing?
- Die!

427
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,678
Wake up!

428
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,526
Let me go!

429
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:18,159
- Are you crazy?
- Let me go!

430
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,239
Someone. Bring her away.

431
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,159
- Let me go!
- Wake up!

432
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,302
He will come back for me!

433
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:29,760
Let me go!

434
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:32,462
Master.

435
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:33,877
She is mad indeed.

436
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:36,069
Her words about Si Feng cannot be trusted.

437
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,320
Valley Master Rong.
Remove the Hell’s Nail from Si Feng.

438
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,349
How do we know that this is
not pre-planned to win our trust?

439
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,719
That’s right.

440
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,159
If this act was
just to clear Yu Si Feng’s suspicions,

441
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,542
his identity is actually more suspicious.

442
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:55,639
Perhaps he is holding more
of Sky Hall’s secrets right now.

443
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,479
Since there are so many doubts,
why don’t we interrogate him again?

444
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,560
What do you think? Lord Dong Fang.

445
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:06,637
Take him away.

446
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,254
- Interrogate him again.
- Hold it!

447
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:10,766
Why do you need to interrogate him again?

448
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,198
Wasn’t it the truth that
Si Feng just saved all of you?

449
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,559
Why do you still have to

450
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,911
judge and interrogate him
through assumptions?

451
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:18,557
They were all mere guesses.

452
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:19,839
Min Yan!

453
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,719
Are you trying to
cause troubles just like Xuan Ji?

454
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
Master.

455
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,000
Min Yan.

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,920
It’s useless.

457
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:38,399
Don’t get involved.

458
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,840
Si Feng.

459
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Raise your head.

460
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,519
Ling Long.

461
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,205
- You...
- Who allowed you to call my name?

462
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,054
Only Brother Wu Tong can call me that.

463
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:38,719
If you don’t know what’s good for you,
I will dig your eyes out

464
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,894
and cut your tongue off.

465
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,320
Someone!

466
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,160
What are you doing?

467
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,480
Since you look honest, I
want you to be my slave.

468
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,480
- Put that on him.
- This...

469
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:56,480
You...

470
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,069
If you play with me obediently,
I will reward you.

471
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,160
- Let’s go!
- You...

472
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,878
Ling Long!

473
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,694
Here. It’s me!

474
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,726
Are you in charge here?

475
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:21,685
Hurry and let me go!

476
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:24,022
Why is everyone calling my name now?

477
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:27,076
I don’t even know where
a rude half-demon like you come from.

478
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:29,679
- How dare you ask me to let you go?
- No way.

479
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,654
You forgot who I am?

480
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:34,214
Don’t pretend that you don’t know me.

481
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:36,918
I even brought
your senior here to look for you.

482
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,279
I got locked up because of you.

483
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,320
You have to live up to your conscience.

484
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,229
I have no time to waste on you.

485
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,240
Let’s go.

486
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:49,206
Don’t go.

487
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,799
You really don’t remember me?

488
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,279
My father is Liu Yi Huan.

489
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,799
The weird old man who has a celestial eye.

490
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,120
Why don’t you remember me?

491
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,560
Sky Hall’s next target will be
either Lize Palace or Dianjinggu.

492
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,382
We can’t let them waste our time.

493
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:08,360
We have to learn of their plan.

494
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,711
I think Yu Si Feng is trying to delay us.

495
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:15,279
But he won’t say anything no matter what.

496
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,488
Everyone, what do you think we should do?

497
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:20,163
Yu Si Feng is stubborn indeed.

498
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,878
He could even endure
the Lize Palace’s 13 Punishments

499
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:28,414
except for
Valley Master Rong’s Hell’s Nail.

500
00:33:28,415 --> 00:33:30,840
I do have a mythological object
on my hands.

501
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,759
This Demon Whip was passed down
by Dianjinggu’s Grand Ancestor.

502
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,878
I just need everyone to work with me,
and activate the Demon Whip’s power.

503
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:03,479
After three whips on Yu Si Feng,
his demonic soul will show itself.

504
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,280
He will no longer be stubborn.

505
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,607
Pure Yang force is needed
to activate this Demon Whip

506
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:12,511
and its holy force.

507
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:15,278
Among us, I’m afraid

508
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:17,987
only those who have
mastered the purest Yang Jue Skill

509
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:20,760
will be suitable
to activate the Demon Whip.

510
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,320
In that case, I’m
willing to contribute.

511
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,182
- Xuan Ji.
- Sixth Senior.

512
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,595
How is Si Feng? Bring me to him.

513
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,730
Xuan Ji. Master’s orders.

514
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,277
You are forbidden to cause any trouble.

515
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:51,440
But he was accused as a demon.

516
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:54,118
But the elders will never listen to us.

517
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,653
Why is this happening?

518
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:59,759
If the elders won’t listen,
I will save him myself.

519
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,600
You will even oppose the elders?

520
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,439
Sixth Senior.

521
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,734
I don’t care anymore.

522
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:12,919
When I saw Si Feng getting
caught, somewhere in my heart hurts.

523
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,278
Do you know?

524
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:18,366
When I was young, I accidentally
smashed Mother’s favorite vase.

525
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,199
That was my saddest memories.

526
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,959
But I think... the vase
broke once again.

527
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,599
I want Si Feng to come back.

528
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,559
I want him to come back safely.

529
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,009
No matter who tries to stop me,
I will still save him.

530
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,399
It’s bad!

531
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,559
- Ruo Yu?
- Great. Everyone’s here.

532
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,999
Valley Master Rong is going
to use the Demon Whip

533
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,719
on Si Feng tomorrow
to verify his identity.

534
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,879
He needs to take three whips
to prove that he is not a demon.

535
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,599
They even want to use the Demon Whip?

536
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,559
What is a Demon Whip?

537
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,199
It is Dianjinggu’s mythological object.
It is very powerful. Any...

538
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,559
Any demon
that gets whipped will lose their power

539
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,439
and show their original shape.

540
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,839
What if it’s a human being?

541
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,199
If it’s a human being, they
will be badly hurt if they didn’t die.

542
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,479
Sky Hall has greatly harmed
the Five Great Sects.

543
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,109
Every elder hates demons badly.

544
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,720
They’d rather kill wrongly
than release someone.

545
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,253
Sixth Senior, I don’t care
anymore now that it’s come to this.

546
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:07,679
I have to save Si Feng.

547
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,866
What happens today
is none of your business.

548
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,440
Wait. I’ll go with you.

549
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,943
- Alright.
- Let’s go.

550
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,359
Master! Hand me over to them.

551
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,319
Otherwise, they will
not stop torturing you.

552
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,319
Hurry and release me!

553
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Our blood ties have yet to sever.

554
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,160
I am still your master.

555
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,775
I will not send my spirit beast to death.

556
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:33,726
If I am your spirit beast,
my duty is to protect my master.

557
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,910
Now that my master
is suffering because of me,

558
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:38,182
I would be better off dead
than be a spirit beast.

559
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:41,719
- Master. Release me!
- That’s enough.

560
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,440
I will never go back on my decisions.

561
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,800
- Let’s move separately.
- Alright. Let’s go.

562
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,440
Si Feng!

563
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,080
Xuan Ji.

564
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,759
Xuan Ji.

565
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,200
Si Feng.

566
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,000
They hurt you to this extent.

567
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,320
I will take you away now.

568
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:40,080
Don’t come here!

569
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,880
What are you doing? Si Feng.

570
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,320
Xuan Ji.

571
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,879
This place is too dangerous.

572
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,318
You shouldn’t be here.

573
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,886
They’ve wronged you and locked you here.

574
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:55,399
They even hurt you.

575
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,440
I have to save you.
Let me go to you. Si Feng.

576
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,519
They are just external injuries.

577
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,159
I will be fine.

578
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,079
You on the other hand,
trespassing the prison to save me

579
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,184
and take such a risk.

580
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:13,199
How will your father
explain to other sect leaders?

581
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,279
I don’t care about that.

582
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,894
They said you are a demon
and even plan to use the Demon Whip.

583
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,680
I have to save you.

584
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
Si Feng.

585
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,880
Xuan Ji.

586
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,216
Do you trust me?

587
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,278
You are Si Feng.

588
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:52,119
Of course I trust you, Si Feng.

589
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,479
I know you are not a demon.

590
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,920
You’re not related to Sky Hall at all.

591
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,080
I am not Sky Hall’s demon clan.

592
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,439
I knew about that.

593
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,120
Silver Snake went to Sky Hall
because of other reasons, right?

594
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,920
Actually,

595
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:18,080
I asked Silver Snake to go to
Sky Hall to find the Mirror of Origin.

596
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,320
I want to know where it is.

597
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,559
I want to restore your six senses.

598
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
This is our promise.

599
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,360
I have to fulfill it.

600
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,600
If I tell them, they will
find out about your secret.

601
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,000
That overwhelming power of yours.

602
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,742
They will see you as someone weird again.

603
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:44,360
That is why I can’t tell them.

604
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,199
Just let them think
that I’m someone weird.

605
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,960
That is much better
than you losing your life.

606
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,119
Even if I tell them,
they will not believe me.

607
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,320
Furthermore, I can’t let you
become their topic of gossip.

608
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,680
Si Feng.

609
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,599
You are always making decisions
for me yet you won’t tell me anything.

610
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,440
It’s not worth it to do this.

611
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,080
I don’t care

612
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,160
whether it’s worth it or not

613
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,800
as long as I’m willing to do it.

614
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,439
Si Feng, Xuan Ji, Master is here.

615
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,640
Let’s go!

616
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
The Sword Trap was repaired.

617
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,380
Yu Si Feng, Xuan Ji.

618
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:53,960
Put down your sword.

619
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,649
Do you hear me? Put down your sword.

620
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,334
Father, Senior.

621
00:40:58,335 --> 00:40:59,599
Si Feng is not a demon.

622
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,359
You cannot use the Demon Whip on him.

623
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,359
Master, we still don’t know the truth.

624
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,239
It’s a heavy punishment
to use the Demon Whip.

625
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,999
Elders, please show mercy.

626
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,559
You want us to show mercy
when you broke out of prison?

627
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,374
Yu Si Feng, you’re trying to escape
when your doubts haven’t been cleared?

628
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,399
Are you absconding?

629
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,959
Sect leaders. Elders.

630
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,086
I am not related to demons at all.

631
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:24,022
Please believe me,
and don’t trouble Xuan Ji and the rest.

632
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,998
We will know about your identity tomorrow.

633
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:30,375
But you are guilty for convincing
someone to break you out.

634
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,919
That’s because you are planning
to use the Demon Whip.

635
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,599
I begged everyone to rescue Si Feng.

636
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,942
He is unrelated to this.

637
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:37,638
I will say it again.

638
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,927
Put down your sword!

639
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,119
Xuan Ji.

640
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,639
Listen to your father
and put down the sword.

641
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,359
Senior.

642
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,156
Forgive me for defying orders.

643
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:48,639
Xuan Ji.

644
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,029
Fine.

645
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,359
You are getting bolder.

646
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,799
You are still holding your sword.

647
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Are you trying to fight me
and your senior?

648
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,639
Father.

649
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,758
Senior.

650
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:02,599
I was brought up and taught by all of you.

651
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,133
I dare not disrespect.

652
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:08,079
But I won’t stand by while
I see Si Feng getting wrongly accused.

653
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,441
What do you want?

654
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,799
Xuan Ji, you...

655
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,964
If you want to accuse Si Feng,

656
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,599
I will just give you my life!

657
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,240
You are willing to use your life
to threaten your father for him?

658
00:42:25,414 --> 00:42:26,718
Xuan Ji.

659
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,920
Is he worth your recklessness?

660
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:32,320
Si Feng said

661
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,319
he doesn’t care
whether it’s worth it or not

662
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,200
as long as he is willing to do it.

663
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,760
What I’m doing today
is out of my own will.

664
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:47,000
I hope you don’t force me anymore.

665
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,439
Xuan Ji.

666
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,902
I am happy for what you did for me today.

667
00:42:57,903 --> 00:43:00,440
But you shouldn’t
make your father and senior sad.

668
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,520
It’s just three whips.

669
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,840
I can endure it.

670
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,320
I said I will help you
restore your six senses.

671
00:43:13,022 --> 00:43:15,000
I will do it no matter what.

672
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:17,400
Don’t worry.

673
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,560
I won’t die.

674
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:32,440
Si Feng.

675
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:40,320
Someone. Take him away.

676
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,318
Xuanyuan Sect took demon clan’s medicine.

677
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,214
Fuyu Island had a demon clan spy.

678
00:43:50,215 --> 00:43:52,278
Lize Palace has a demon clan disciple.

679
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:55,093
Shaoyang Sect helped with
a demon clan’s prison break.

680
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:58,080
Our righteous sects are really bustling.
