00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,351
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:32,352
<i>EPISODE 51</i>

3
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:42,639
If I’m not mistaken,

4
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,429
you’re an ape demon that just
transformed into human form recently.

5
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,406
Your kind usually lives in Xishu.

6
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,199
Why have you come here to hurt people?

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,944
Ape demon?

8
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,599
When I passed by Xishu before,

9
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,820
I’ve heard that many brides
were captured and killed.

10
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,479
- So, it turns out you’re the culprit!
- You’ve got a good eye.

11
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,985
I never expected a small place like Xigu

12
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:04,286
will have two powerful cultivators.

13
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:05,519
Get out, the both of you!

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,005
Or else, I’ll strangle her to death now!

15
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:10,576
It’s hard for you to take the human form.
Let go of Ah Lan.

16
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:13,550
- I’ll spare your life.
- I’m saving you!

17
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,359
All the women in the word are unfaithful.

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,464
They’re the worst when they’re
wearing red wedding dresses.

19
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:22,510
When I just cultivated to human
form, I almost married such a woman.

20
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:25,165
I didn’t expect that she was a cultivator.

21
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,439
She knew I was a demon long ago,
and set up formation on our wedding night

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,955
to kill me!

23
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:31,647
So that she could raise her cultivation!

24
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:34,238
Luckily, I couldn’t get killed that easily
and so I’ve survived.

25
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,788
However, all my clanmates
were killed by that woman

26
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,719
and those in her sect.

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,319
Tell me, does she not deserve to die?

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,799
So you sought revenge
on all these newlyweds?

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,255
I want the world to know that
when women get married,

30
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:52,680
they might seem affectionate,
but it’s all just an act!

31
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,159
You’re indeed innocent
when you were betrayed.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,050
But as you shifted your grudge
onto these innocent people,

33
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:00,965
you’ve become a great sinner.
You should die!

34
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,918
Why aren’t you leaving yet?
If the worst comes to the worst,

35
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,439
I’ll make her die before I’m going to.

36
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,239
- Believe it or not, I’ll kill her now!
- Stop!

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,840
I understand what you’ve been through.

38
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,839
I can let you go.

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,558
- We’ll leave right now.
- Si Feng, you can’t let him go.

40
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,832
Shut up.

41
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:20,040
How could you possibly
understand the feeling of betrayal?

42
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,200
Back then when you knew I was a demon,

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,040
weren’t you just as merciless
as her and tried to kill me?

44
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,109
I’ve never thought of killing you.

45
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,360
I’ve never wanted you to die.

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,000
You besieged Lize Palace,

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,160
killed the young innocent Rose Gold Birds

48
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:51,240
and tried to kill me with
Vermilion Bird Bottle.

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,960
Even though I’m a demon,

50
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,040
was all the love and affection before

51
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:00,398
completely fake?

52
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:03,920
I really had no idea that they would raid
Lize Palace using the secret passages.

53
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:05,047
As for the Vermilion Bird Bottle,

54
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,862
Senior said it would only trap you,
but it wouldn’t harm you.

55
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:11,159
Si Feng, I was foolish
and I made mistakes,

56
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,920
but I can explain everything!

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,862
What? You’re a Rose Gold Bird?

58
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,119
You’re a demon too?

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,678
That’s right.

60
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,559
I’m a Rose Gold Bird.

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
You and I are both demons.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,760
Demons are each other’s companions, right?

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,919
Aren’t you a demon?

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,039
No matter how splendid your excuse is,

65
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,480
there’s no reason for you to harm others.

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,783
Si Feng.

67
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:59,799
Listen to me.
It’s not that I don’t believe you.

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,703
- I’ve always...
- Chu Xuan Ji.

69
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,800
Mortals and demons
cannot be together after all.

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,360
Don’t you get it?

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,960
The past is over.

72
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
I did love you before,

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,840
but I

74
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,510
don’t want to be with you anymore.

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,039
Still, I won’t leave.

76
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,439
You said that I forgot about you
in all my previous lifetimes.

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,262
You wanted me to remember you in this one.

78
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:44,863
It took me one whole year to find you.

79
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:49,479
This time, even if you hate me
or resent me, I’ll hold you tight.

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,400
I won’t let go no matter what happens.

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,760
If you don’t leave,

82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,120
I’ll die.

83
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,239
This is bad.

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,039
I’ve used too much power just now.

85
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,160
It triggered the divine weapons.

86
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,680
My time is running out.

87
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,880
I’m afraid I can’t wait until you grow up.

88
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,039
My king,

89
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,519
I once saw Chu Xuan Ji
at Beihuang region in the mortal realm.

90
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,240
But lately, it’s been hard to trace her.

91
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,359
My king, I don’t know why I was unable to
trace the aura of the God of War.

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,520
Perhaps she cast a spell
to hide her whereabouts.

93
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,199
In this lifetime,
she’s merely a mortal.

94
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,175
You couldn’t even locate a mere mortal?

95
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,319
What about those fellows who
always fool around with her?

96
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,800
Once you find one of them,
you’ll be able to track her down.

97
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,919
Those people might have cast a spell

98
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,719
to hide their whereabouts as well.

99
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,487
Then find a Rose Gold Bird Demon
named Liu Yi Huan.

100
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,559
Didn’t he steal the celestial eye?

101
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,280
He can hide his own tracks, but
a celestial eye can’t be hidden.

102
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:23,049
My king.

103
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,520
How did you know
the celestial eye is gone?

104
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,160
Are you asking me now?

105
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:34,437
The celestial eye is lost
and yet I’ve to tell you about it?

106
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:37,120
You’re useless!

107
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,719
What are you still here?

108
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,119
Hurry and track down Liu Yi Huan!

109
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
Yes.

110
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,561
You haven’t reconciled with him?
What’s the matter?

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,479
Flying Snake.

112
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,120
Tell me, what should I do?

113
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,799
He still refuses to see me.

114
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,840
He said if I go near him,
I’ll be hurting him.

115
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,367
But I want to keep him by my side.

116
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,400
Am I being too selfish?

117
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,959
As I see it,
you’ve traveled so far to find him,

118
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,999
just to keep him by your side, isn’t it?

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,519
What do you mean you don’t know
whether to stay or leave?

120
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,063
That’s why I disapprove
of mortals’ behavior.

121
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,554
You’re always indecisive.

122
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,519
Stinky woman, are you going in or not?

123
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,639
The sky is already dark.
I’m Lord Flying Snake,

124
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,711
I’ve taken a long journey with you.

125
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,760
Why should I stand here as a punishment?

126
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,180
I want him to stay by my side,

127
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,400
but I wish him to be well.

128
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,959
Brother Liu said, he was already
attacked twice by Loveless Curse.

129
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,959
If it happens again, he’ll die.

130
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,382
If it’s because of me that
Loveless Curse is triggered again,

131
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,519
I’ll never be able to forgive myself.

132
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,440
Are you stupid?

133
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:09,400
If he doesn’t love you,

134
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,959
he would’ve taken the Heartless Pill
to forget about you long ago.

135
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,360
But he didn’t.

136
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,790
Which means he still can’t get over you.

137
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,478
Even if you leave or stay away from him,

138
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,279
there’s still no cure for Loveless Curse.

139
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,079
Loveless Curse will break out one day,
and he won’t be able to escape from death.

140
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,119
So, why don’t you just go for it?

141
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,439
You can either be utterly shameless,
or just wheedle your way in.

142
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,439
However, you’ve to convince him that
you adore him with all your heart.

143
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,479
This is the only way
to cure the Loveless Curse.

144
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,120
Otherwise, if you run away
because of his words, then...

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,182
do you want me to stay
and cure Loveless Curse?

146
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,439
Right. You got a point there.

147
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,144
Why didn’t I think of that?

148
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,640
All in all, this is the only way
to cure Loveless Curse.

149
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,999
You’re usually quite smart, why
are you so dull when it comes to this?

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
Why don’t you understand this?

151
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,760
It smells so nice.

152
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:04,446
Stinky woman, I won’t stand here
as punishment with you.

153
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,479
Are you going in or not?

154
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,720
Anyway, it’s been a while
since we tried Si Feng’s food.

155
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,760
Si Feng!

156
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,192
Why are you eating alone?
You even made three dishes.

157
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,399
That doesn’t seem right.

158
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,553
How about this?

159
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:30,400
Both of us will force ourselves
to share your burden.

160
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,600
Well, it’s raining out there
and so I came in to shelter from the rain.

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,599
Why are you being so polite?
We’re old acquaintances.

162
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,479
- Come here. Take a seat.
- My poor house is small,

163
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,039
there’s no room for so many people.

164
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,320
Please leave.

165
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:45,919
Si Feng!

166
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,622
We’re well-acquainted,
and haven’t met for such a long time.

167
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:50,143
Why don’t we catch up with each other?

168
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,791
Stop pulling a long face,
you’ll get old easily.

169
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,799
Besides, the weather
is freezing cold out there.

170
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
We may fall and break our legs at night.

171
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,239
Don’t you know how to fly on a sword?

172
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
Fly on a sword?

173
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:08,807
We can still get into an accident.

174
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,000
Right?

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,599
Did I not make myself clear enough?

176
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,920
Chu Xuan Ji, I never imagined
you to be so annoyingly persistent.

177
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,079
Si Feng, people change.

178
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
I’ve changed.

179
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,319
Si Feng, three dishes do not
seem enough for three people.

180
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,599
You’re so good at cooking.
Why don’t you make a couple more dishes?

181
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,735
It’s just enough for me.

182
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:41,679
Don’t you feel you’re not welcomed here?

183
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,599
No, not at all! I’ll go make it.

184
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,239
I know what Si Feng likes to eat.

185
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
I’ll do it.

186
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,799
How much longer are you
going to keep this up?

187
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,519
I should be the one asking the question.

188
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,359
How much longer do you want to avoid her?

189
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,159
Others might not know about it,
but I know it very well.

190
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,759
The reason why you’re here

191
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,455
is because of the Snow Lingzhi
in the Glacial Pool, right?

192
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,959
- It’s because your body is about to...
- Flying Snake.

193
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,479
I don’t want to talk about this.

194
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,399
Don’t bring it up again.

195
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,800
Why? Since you’ve done it, why would
you be afraid of others talking about it?

196
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,479
Life is short.

197
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,439
But you shouldn’t push away Xuan Ji
just because of a reason like that.

198
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,880
You’re overthinking.

199
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,839
I just don’t have any extra energy

200
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,320
to deal with unnecessary people or things.

201
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,759
Is there any point lying to yourself?

202
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,080
You’ve done so much for her.
Why can’t you forgive her one more time?

203
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:13,800
Xuan Ji tried every means to look for you.
She has had a hard time.

204
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,800
She used to be a condescending God of War.

205
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,440
Back then when we were in the heavens,

206
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,359
she would come and talk to me
because she was afraid of being alone.

207
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,400
What she’s doing now
is just the same as before.

208
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:32,200
Actually, some people are like wine.

209
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,479
You feel warm as you get closer with them.

210
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,719
But some people are like water.

211
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,919
The more you drink, the colder you get.

212
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,480
As time goes by,

213
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,280
you will feel reluctant to drink it again.

214
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,967
Fine.

215
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,719
Since you’re so disappointed now

216
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,959
and don’t believe Chu Xuan Ji anymore,

217
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,160
you won’t care whether she lives or dies.
Just leave her to her own devices then.

218
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:58,536
She’s the God of War.

219
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:00,040
What could have happened to her?

220
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:03,359
You don’t need to lie about that.

221
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,679
Let’s stop beating around the bush.

222
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,239
We both know very well about
the mystery of Xuan Ji’s identity.

223
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,118
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have
gone to great pains,

224
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,639
and pretended to be the Star of Mosha.

225
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,840
I can’t figure it out.

226
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,320
The two identities are totally different.

227
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,657
How could they exist within
the same person?

228
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
I don’t know. What I saw was...

229
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,359
I can’t describe it.

230
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,560
But I guess that the heavens
is probably looking for her.

231
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:35,759
Whoever holding a post in the heavens
must return once the mantra is recited.

232
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,119
I’ve disobeyed the decree once.

233
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,566
Also, I have a vague feeling that
they’re calling everyone back

234
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,443
because of Chu Xuan Ji.

235
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,618
You don’t have to lie to me.

236
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,343
The Jade Cup is still intact.

237
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:54,120
Xuan Ji won’t be sanctioned
by the heavens.

238
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,799
How would I know about that?

239
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,870
Regardless of anything,
she’s my master.

240
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,660
I should get back to the heavens,
and fish for some information.

241
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,095
I’ll leave the stinky woman
with you for now.

242
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,439
There’s nothing much I can do
about your issues,

243
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,720
but I still have to find out

244
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:13,553
what fate awaits my master.

245
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,320
It’s so hot!

246
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Are you alright?
Did you burn yourself?

247
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:49,703
Look, I’m blistering already.

248
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,592
Why are you covering the wound then?

249
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:56,679
Si Feng.

250
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:00,695
You do care about me, right?

251
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,160
I have some medicine inside, come in.

252
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,719
Second cabinet on the left.

253
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,800
Start counting from the right side,
there’s some ointment in the drawer.

254
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,600
Mix it with water and apply it.

255
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,400
Si Feng.

256
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,539
Are you not going to apply it for me?

257
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,320
Mister Yi.

258
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:49,680
Mister Yi.

259
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,200
Miss Ah Lan, what
can I do for you?

260
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,279
Dear, have you eaten?

261
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,799
I’ve brought many dishes for you.

262
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,479
Yesterday, we finally got rid
of the annoying person.

263
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,000
We can celebrate it now.

264
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:12,639
By the way, I’ve heard from the
boss that you carried me back.

265
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,959
Thank you.

266
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,080
I’ve learned from this matter that
you’re someone I can trust with my life.

267
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,840
I know your marriage was a sham.
Stop lying to me.

268
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,119
So what if it’s real or fake?

269
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,679
Mister Yi has said that
he doesn’t welcome you here.

270
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,119
Yet you still linger around.

271
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,600
You should stop pestering him.

272
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:39,479
Miss Ah Lan,
I’ve known Si Feng for many years.

273
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,999
We only separated because of
some misunderstandings.

274
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,639
Now that I finally found him,
I’ll never leave him.

275
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,719
You just want to tell me

276
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,199
about your past relationship with
Mister Yi, right?

277
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,559
So what?

278
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,599
He’s no longer that Si Feng now.
He’s Mister Yi.

279
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,119
He already said he wants to
let go of the past and start over.

280
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,759
Why are you bringing up the same boring
old affairs for?

281
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,920
Don’t try to use it as an excuse to stay.

282
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,497
You better get going.

283
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,320
This hairpin...

284
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,759
Si Feng, I’ve been
searching everywhere for it.

285
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,239
- It turns out...
- It’s something you’ve discarded before,

286
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,600
there’s no need to put up an act.

287
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,199
Mister Yi gave the hairpin to me.

288
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,039
Don’t bother about it.

289
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,199
How could I possibly discard it?

290
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,640
You broke it off,
and discarded it in Qingmu Town.

291
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,799
Didn’t you mean to cut all ties with me?

292
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,344
Broke it off?

293
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:49,846
Si Feng, how could I
have broken it into two?

294
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,574
There must be some misunderstandings.

295
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:53,079
Enough.

296
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,400
That’s all in the past.
There’s no point in bringing it up.

297
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,280
If you’ve done applying the ointment,

298
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,360
hurry and leave.

299
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,599
Did you hear that?

300
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,319
Mister Yi requested you to leave.

301
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,800
Get out.

302
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,039
I won’t leave.

303
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,079
I finally found you.
I won’t leave you this way.

304
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,399
Besides, this...

305
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,079
Flying Snake isn’t here.
I’m severely injured now,

306
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,960
if no one carries me, I can’t even walk.

307
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,640
Don’t be so shameless.

308
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,560
Si Feng, do you really want
to kick me out?

309
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:33,215
Look outside.

310
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:34,639
It’s so late at night.

311
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,159
It’s so dark and cold.

312
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,159
And my leg is...

313
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,600
You’re not going to let me
limp all the way back to the inn, right?

314
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,680
Miss Ah Lan, call the staffs
from the inn to carry her back.

315
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,240
That can be easily arranged.

316
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,479
What’s the point of finding an inn for me?

317
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,440
There’s no physician in the inn.

318
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,519
Si Feng, don’t you practice medicine now?

319
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,599
I’m severely injured now,

320
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,540
I need you to take care of me.
You can’t abandon me.

321
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:11,559
Stop being so unreasonable.

322
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,975
I know such a minor
injury is nothing to you.

323
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,279
Si Feng, do you really
want to oust me like this?

324
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,599
Once when I didn’t have
pain sensation, you told me

325
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,399
to inform you when I’m in pain.

326
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,519
In the future, don’t ever say
that it doesn’t hurt or that it’s fine.

327
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,399
You’re clearly bleeding.

328
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,679
Although you can’t feel
the pain, your body knows it.

329
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,000
Even though I don’t know it,
my body knows it.

330
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,505
Look, I’m in so much pain right now.

331
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,400
Do you not care about me at all?

332
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,760
We only parted ways for two years.

333
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,000
Where did you learn such knavish tricks?

334
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,720
It’s true! Take a look
if you don’t trust me!

335
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,760
That’s not necessary.

336
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,239
Miss Ah Lan, you can go back.

337
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,159
I’ll settle this myself.

338
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,839
She’s here with you.
I feel uneasy about it.

339
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,960
Why don’t I stay as well?

340
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:21,439
Fine then.

341
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
I’ll come visit tomorrow.

342
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,359
I’m warning you.

343
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,280
Don’t hit on Mister Yi.

344
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,240
Si Feng.

345
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,040
You’re letting me stay?

346
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,719
You’re a girl. If you stay here,
it’ll be bad for your reputation.

347
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,480
You can marry me then.

348
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,040
I’ll boil some herbal medicine for you.

349
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,240
Si Feng.

350
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,719
Si Feng.

351
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,080
Where have you been early in the morning?
I couldn’t find you anywhere.

352
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,599
Si Feng.

353
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,720
I made this Sanqing tea
according to your habits.

354
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,000
Try it.

355
00:25:09,544 --> 00:25:11,060
Mister Yi.

356
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,240
Mister Yi.

357
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,399
- Miss Ah Lan.
- I’ve brought you breakfast

358
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,119
and the milk tea I made myself.

359
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,040
Try and see if it’s nice.

360
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,672
Si Feng usually drinks Sanqing tea
in the morning.

361
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:26,360
He doesn’t drink milk tea.

362
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,080
I’ve lost the habit long ago.

363
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,199
Right. The past is past,
he’s different now.

364
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,359
Mister Yi, have a sip.

365
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,040
I promise you’ll like it!

366
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,080
Is it good?

367
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,038
It’s sweet and fragrant.

368
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,600
Quite refreshing.

369
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,800
Take a bite of my crispy cake.

370
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:19,880
Here, try it.

371
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,222
It seems like your cooking skill
has improved a lot.

372
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:34,040
It took me long enough to learn them.

373
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:37,759
Right, Mister Yi,
are you going to collect herbs today?

374
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,239
Bring me along with you.

375
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,560
You promised to
take me with you to practice medicine.

376
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,360
I do need to collect herbs up the hill.

377
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,832
Let’s go together then.

378
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
Si Feng...

379
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,559
Your wound is much better than yesterday.

380
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,200
If you’ve stayed here long enough,
hurry and leave then.

381
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,097
Let’s go.

382
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:24,679
Mister Yi, I’ve helped
you out again just now.

383
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,255
How are you going to thank me?

384
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:28,319
Thank you very much, Miss Ah Lan.

385
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,559
But I’m using you when I did it.

386
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,520
My conscience smites me.

387
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,079
It’s fine. That Xuan Ji is so annoying.

388
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,919
I don’t want her to pester you either.

389
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,560
Besides, I’ve to get rid of her
so that I can come and visit you.

390
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,919
Miss Ah Lan,
if you want to learn medical skill,

391
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,679
you can come and look for me.

392
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,560
If you have any other
intentions, then it’s unnecessary.

393
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,800
Mister Yi, don’t you
understand my feelings?

394
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,239
I’m sorry, Ah Lan.

395
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,120
I don’t want you to get the wrong idea.

396
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,951
I’ve no feelings for you.

397
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:18,239
Not now, not ever.

398
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,119
Why?

399
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,039
Am I not good enough for you?

400
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,559
No.

401
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,080
You’re very good.

402
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,160
But...

403
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,159
Alright, say no more.

404
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,119
I didn’t hear anything.

405
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,439
After this, I’ll only learn
medical skill from you.

406
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,799
And learn how to capture demons.

407
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,600
We’ll talk about that in the future.

408
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,916
Okay.

409
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:43,039
Right.

410
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,320
I spent ages to fix this hairpin,

411
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:47,600
so that it’s exactly the same as before.

412
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,959
Thank you.

413
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,279
Si Feng!

414
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,119
Si Feng! Wait for me!

415
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,559
Si Feng!

416
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,599
Wait for me! Si Feng!

417
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,439
She’s everywhere!

418
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,919
Mister Yi, don’t worry.

419
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,559
I’ll help you chase her away.

420
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,919
Never mind.

421
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,599
Let’s go.

422
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,640
Si Feng! Wait for me!

423
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,160
Mister Yi, let’s go.

424
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,120
Double-winged rainbow butterflies?

425
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,823
She finally left.

426
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:44,431
You ignored her for so long,
she might have given up.

427
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:45,960
I don’t think she’ll come back.

428
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,399
However, she’s
unable to move freely.

429
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,943
How can she disappear in an instant?

430
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,960
I wonder if she’ll fall again.

431
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,623
Ah Lan, pick some bupleurum
from the back hill.

432
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:01,799
I’ll take these herbs back home.

433
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,160
Okay.

434
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,959
Xuan Ji!

435
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,359
Si Feng! Look!

436
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,080
Double-winged rainbow butterflies!

437
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,160
They’re gone.

438
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,079
Si Feng!

439
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
Si Feng!

440
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:42,560
Did you leave because you’re mad?

441
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:45,919
I don’t want to see you again.

442
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,159
Quickly leave.

443
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,023
I won’t. I won’t ever leave you.

444
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:52,480
It took me so long to finally find you.
I would rather die than leave you.

445
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
If you don’t leave,

446
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,655
I’ll be the one who dies.

447
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,079
If we can’t cure Loveless Curse
in the end,

448
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,919
and if you’re going
to die, I’ll die with you.

449
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,560
Don’t ever think you can escape from me!

450
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,039
What are you doing?

451
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,382
From now on,

452
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:14,039
every time you’re attacked
by Loveless Curse, I’ll cut myself!

453
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,959
If you’re in pain,
I’ll be in pain with you!

454
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,680
If you want to die, I’ll die with you!

455
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:22,759
Don’t treat your life like a child’s game.

456
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,079
I’m not treating my life like a game.

457
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,519
You won’t believe everything I say.

458
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,599
You precipitately jumped to a conclusion.

459
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,287
I didn’t have a heart before,
but can’t I change?

460
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:35,079
I didn’t understand before,
can’t I change now?

461
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,519
I was indeed afraid of loneliness before,

462
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,759
that’s why I refused to let you go.

463
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,199
But later I discovered,

464
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,879
loneliness wasn’t the reason
I wanted to be with you.

465
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,439
I really want to be with you
every day till death tears us apart.

466
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,400
Si Feng, I’ve spent more
than 500 days finding you.

467
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:54,439
If none of these can move your heart,
you can leave again.

468
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,119
But I’ll continue searching for you.

469
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,319
Be it 10 or 20 years.

470
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,520
Until the day when
you finally believe that I love you.

471
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,120
Whether I believe it or not,
it’s meaningless now.

472
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:07,760
It’s too late.

473
00:32:08,648 --> 00:32:10,119
Go and look for your rainbow butterflies.

474
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,599
Si Feng, I wanted to
capture rainbow butterflies

475
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,863
because of a legend I heard.

476
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:19,599
They say double-winged rainbow butterflies
are the guardians of love.

477
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,639
If a couple sees the rainbow butterflies,
they can reunite again.

478
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,279
As for those in love, if they can make
a wish under the rainbow butterflies,

479
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,199
they can grow old together,
and be together for all lifetimes.

480
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,600
But I...

481
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,320
I couldn’t catch them just now.

482
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,560
This is fate.

483
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,360
It’s over for us.

484
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,359
I don’t believe it.

485
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,279
If you don’t go, then I’ll
leave. I’ll leave Xigu Town.

486
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,119
If you don’t want me to
follow behind you, I’ll wait.

487
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,599
I’ll wait until the day
you’re willing to see me again.

488
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,359
What if I don’t return forever?

489
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Then I’ll wait for you forever.

490
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:03,440
Si Feng!

491
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,714
If you truly want to wait forever,

492
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,380
wait as you wish then.

493
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,480
Si Feng!

494
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,160
Si Feng!

495
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,200
Si Feng!

496
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,480
Si Feng!

497
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
Si Feng!

498
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,880
Si Feng!

499
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,760
Si Feng!

500
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,719
Miss Ah Lan, did Si Feng ever come here?

501
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,462
Mister Yi?

502
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,935
Isn’t Mister Yi with you?

503
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,599
But he didn’t come back last night.

504
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,560
- I...
- Mister Yi has disappeared?

505
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,840
He must have been annoyed by you
and so he left!

506
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:49,862
If you truly want to wait
forever, wait as you wish then.

507
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,440
Si Feng!

508
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,199
Si Feng!

509
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,480
Si Feng!

510
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,560
Si Feng!

511
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,080
Si Feng!

512
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
Si Feng!

513
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,400
Si Feng!

514
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:16,440
Si Feng!

515
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,720
Si Feng!

516
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,600
Si Feng!

517
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,160
Si Feng!

518
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,680
Si Feng!

519
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,440
Si Feng!

520
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,200
How could you go off like that?

521
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,280
I’ve so many things I haven’t told you!

522
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:12,479
At that time, I made
the vow to my dad

523
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,902
because he thought you’re
a demon from Sky Hall.

524
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:17,231
I said it because he
threatened me with his death!

525
00:38:17,232 --> 00:38:23,000
But deep inside my heart, I told
God that the vow didn’t count!

526
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,504
You never hear what I just said,

527
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,879
but I don’t mean every word
that you’ve heard.

528
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
Si Feng.

529
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,680
I told you I’ll wait for you here.

530
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,920
I’ll definitely wait for you.

531
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:02,760
No matter how long it takes,
I’ll wait until you come back.

532
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,760
When the time comes,
you’ll know what I truly meant.

533
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,160
Xuan Ji,

534
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,704
so what if I believe your sincere love?

535
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,640
I don’t even know how long I’ll live.

536
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,480
Now...

537
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,440
I hope my disappearance
will make you give up.

538
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,040
Leave this place

539
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,800
and forget about me eventually.

540
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,560
Have you gone insane?

541
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,375
He’s already left.
He won’t know even if you freeze to death!

542
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,199
Hurry go inside the house.

543
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,480
No.

544
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,480
I promised him

545
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:02,960
that if he leaves,

546
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,167
I... I’ll keep waiting
for him here.

547
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:09,880
What if one day,

548
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,959
he suddenly thinks about
me and comes back?

549
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
What if he gets tired one day

550
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:19,920
and comes home?

551
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,640
If I keep my promise to
him, I’ll get to see him again.

552
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,807
No.

553
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:31,926
If you go on like this,
you’ll have frozen to death

554
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,919
before he comes back.

555
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,880
Let’s go in and warm yourself, okay?

556
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,639
I promised Si Feng that I’ll wait for him.

557
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,751
If he doesn’t see me on his way back,

558
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,080
he’ll think I’ve given up on him.

559
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,560
I don’t want that.

560
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:52,120
You want to be crazy?
Just do as you wish then!

561
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,800
- Mister Yi.
- Miss Ah Lan.

562
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,040
Has Xuan Ji left?

563
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,199
I think she’s completely insane.

564
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,839
It’s snowing heavily now,
and yet she’s still sitting by the door

565
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,959
and refused to go inside.

566
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,479
She insisted on waiting for you.

567
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,119
You didn’t see what she’s like.

568
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,887
She’s almost become a snowman.

569
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:29,080
Where did she get her obstinacy?

570
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,959
By the way, Mister Yi,
I’ve brought a winter coat for you.

571
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,998
It’s getting colder and colder.
I think you may need it.

572
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,280
Miss Ah Lan.

573
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:43,600
Do me another favor.

574
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,671
Send this winter coat to Xuan Ji.

575
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,680
Tell her I won’t be coming back.

576
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:53,280
Tell her not to wait any longer.

577
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,919
I’ll surely do as
you instructed.

578
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,280
But...

579
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,240
I’m afraid it’ll be futile.

580
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,719
Do you think Mister Yi
will come back if you act like this?

581
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,359
It’s been so long.

582
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,560
What you’re doing is meaningless.

583
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,559
It’s snowing heavily now.

584
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,000
If you refuse to eat, drink and sleep,
how long can you keep this up?

585
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,839
This is Si Feng’s way home.

586
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,559
Don’t get in the way.

587
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,401
He won’t be able to see me when he’s back.

588
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:45,519
Fine.

589
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,135
I can’t persuade you.

590
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:48,399
Put it on.

591
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,639
If you want to wait for Mister Yi,
don’t freeze yourself to death.

592
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,446
Mister Yi, I’ve said
everything I should say,

593
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:14,280
but she still refused to leave.

594
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,920
If she continues like
this, she’ll freeze to death.

595
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,799
You’ve accepted my hairpin.

596
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,120
So from now onward,

597
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:53,967
you’re mine.

598
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:58,279
You’ve taken my figurine, you’re
mine as well from now onward.

599
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,599
It’s the best I could wish for.

600
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,520
Xuan Ji!

601
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:18,559
Xuan Ji!

602
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,897
Xuan Ji!

603
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:30,639
You’re awake.

604
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,264
Are you still cold?

605
00:45:32,265 --> 00:45:34,163
Do you feel unwell?

606
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,679
Si Feng.

607
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,480
Now that you’re back,

608
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:45,781
can you not leave again?

609
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,728
I’ll go and bring you
the medicine I made.

610
00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:52,149
Don’t leave.

611
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:58,458
- Then I’ll fetch you another quilt, okay?
- I’m not cold.

612
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:00,272
Don’t be so willful.

613
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:01,540
Si Feng.

614
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,159
In all my life,

615
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,493
no matter what I’ve
encountered, I had never felt fear.

616
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:14,234
It’s because I don’t have a heart,
and feelings.

617
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,289
But I’m truly terrified now.

618
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:22,193
I fear that once you leave,
you’ll never ever come back.

619
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:24,359
How long?

620
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,791
How long will it take for you to believe
my feelings for you,

621
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:29,592
so that you’re satisfied?

622
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,959
Si Feng, I went to Fenru City,
and saw our previous nine lifetimes.

623
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,919
I let you down in each and every lifetime.
It was always too late for me to repent.

624
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,120
But then I discovered

625
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:45,079
that I was actually in love
with you in every lifetime.

626
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,639
But it was too late.

627
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,159
It’s not that I didn’t have a heart then,
but I took too long to figure it out.

628
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,080
Can you wait for a while longer,
and be more patient with me?

629
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,080
Xuan Ji.

630
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,640
I’ve been waiting for too long.

631
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,640
You came a little late.

632
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,247
I was really angry.

633
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:20,880
What are you saying?

634
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:24,320
I’m really happy

635
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,000
that you’ve come for me.

636
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,479
Why did you keep kicking me out?

637
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,520
Why did you say all those harsh things?
