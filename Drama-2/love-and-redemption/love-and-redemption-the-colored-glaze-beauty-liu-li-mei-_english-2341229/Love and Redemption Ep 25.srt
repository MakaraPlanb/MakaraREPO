<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,575
<i>EPISODE 25</i>

3
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:36,358
I’m already in human form.
But she’s feeding me rice cake?

4
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,802
She thought I’m still a snake?
I don’t need to be fed.

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,215
Move aside!

6
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:45,437
What happened? Who are you mad at?

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,791
None of your business.

8
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,759
I’m so mad.

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,169
I can’t believe her.

10
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,239
Take it. This is for you.

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,214
Si Feng told me that I have to thank
those who helped me before.

12
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:10,601
So, thank you. This rice cake is for you.

13
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,990
Who wants to eat this kind of thing?

14
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,724
Brother, this rice cake is really tasty.
Have one.

15
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,279
You are really a glutton.

16
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:40,366
Ruo Xue, I am chosen
as a disciple for Lize Palace.

17
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:41,819
Great!

18
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,559
I heard that the disciples of Lize
Palace can eat well and live well.

19
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,103
They can even learn some skills.

20
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:48,719
Go, brother.

21
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,980
That way, nobody
will ever bully you again.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,717
If it wasn’t because Lize Palace
doesn’t accept female disciple,

23
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,559
I would have gone there too.

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,662
But don’t worry, brother.

25
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:02,327
I’ll wait for you to come back.

26
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:30,332
Why are you carrying my sister?

27
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,317
You have to be good.

28
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:36,863
Or else, she’ll never wake up again.

29
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:48,942
Ling Long.

30
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:50,883
Drink some soup, Ling Long.

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,662
Drink a little bit.

32
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,209
Ling Long.

33
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,661
This...

34
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,759
Ling Long is always like this lately.

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,779
She’s always so out of it
and she doesn’t eat much.

36
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,502
What should we do?

37
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,444
She didn’t have any fever.

38
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:22,574
What should we do, Sixth Senior?
She can’t go on like this.

39
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:24,515
What happened to her?

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,340
Si Feng.

41
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:33,707
Si Feng.

42
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,437
This is because her soul
is separated too long from her body.

43
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,937
Ling Long has started to
lose control over her own body.

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,757
We can’t wait anymore.
Let’s go to Mount Buzhou now.

45
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:46,169
Let’s go right now.

46
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,606
We have to go to Mount Buzhou.

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,919
But we don’t know where to go.

48
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,279
Ever since Madam Dong Fang
mentioned about Mount Buzhou,

49
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,911
I’ve been investigating about that place.
But there’s no such place on the map.

50
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:01,228
In ancient myth, Water God Gong Gong
was defeated by Fire God Zhu Rong.

51
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,959
He knocked over Mount Buzhou.
The sky fell and there was a huge flood.

52
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,013
Since this Mount Buzhou
can reach until sky,

53
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,442
it must be on the mountainous area
of Mount Wei’e. Why isn’t it on the map?

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,726
Could it be that maybe
it was too long ago that

55
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:16,601
it has changed its name,
just like Mount Gao?

56
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:21,246
That demon mentioned about west
before he died.

57
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:22,886
If we continue to search at the west,

58
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,085
we might be able to find it.

59
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:29,156
Let’s continue to search at the west then.

60
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,259
- You are not allowed to go anywhere.
- I...

61
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,725
- Father.
- Xuan Ji.

62
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:42,846
If it wasn’t because Dingkun Sword
protected you before this,

63
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:45,296
you’ve would have been
killed by the Demon Whip.

64
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:48,710
Now, you are acting recklessly again.
If you fall into the hands of demons,

65
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:50,986
should I save you or not?

66
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:55,062
Do you want Shaoyang to end
up like Xuanyuan and Fuyu Island

67
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,163
where they lost hundreds
of their disciples?

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,559
You should know how important
Shaoyang is compared to

69
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,291
Ling Long’s personal safety.

70
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,549
You only know how to blame me.

71
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,399
But do you know how it feels
when I have to put the people first

72
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,031
while looking at how
badly injured Ling Long is?

73
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,197
You think that you are
passionate and righteous.

74
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:20,519
But you are just ignorant and reckless.

75
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,998
Well said.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,540
- Greetings, Palace Lord.
- Greetings, Master.

77
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,381
The rebellious disciple of Shaoyang
kept on causing troubles

78
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:33,842
and my disciple was always
dragged down by her.

79
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:37,126
She is really ignorant and reckless.

80
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,029
- What you said...
- I’m talking to my disciple!

81
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:45,181
Si Feng.

82
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:47,959
You went to Mount Gao
because of this girl.

83
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,276
And you sent your spirit beast
to Sky Hall because of this girl too.

84
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,039
Are you going to Mount Buzhou
because of her again?

85
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,372
Can’t you see how useless these
companions from Shaoyang are?

86
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:05,545
They were caught, injured
and even caused you to be punished.

87
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,446
I’ve already warned you.

88
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,907
He that lives with cripples
learns to limp.

89
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,645
But you wouldn’t listen to me.

90
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:17,749
But you have to understand this.

91
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,446
If you lie with dogs,

92
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:22,621
you’ll rise with fleas.

93
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,020
Understand?

94
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,501
Xuan Ji.

95
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:31,047
I want to lecture you too.

96
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:35,921
Shaoyang Sect has always been
open and above board.

97
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,942
You have to stay away from slimy sect
that knows how to use spells only.

98
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:44,559
We may know a person’s face,
but not his heart. Moreover,

99
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,732
they are always wearing masks.
We can’t even read their expressions.

100
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:50,527
You risked your life
to take a whip for someone.

101
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:53,894
But do you think
they’ll be thankful for that?

102
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,276
Father.

103
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,900
Si Feng, listen.

104
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:03,645
You thought that they’ll
be affectionate towards you?

105
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:06,171
They have already
took precautions against you.

106
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,893
You risked your life
so many times for her,

107
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:10,464
but they don’t remember at all.

108
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:12,995
She just took a whip for you

109
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,941
and they already expect you
to kneel down and thank her.

110
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:18,879
So interesting.

111
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,674
Interesting.

112
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,467
Master.

113
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,101
Xuan Ji, the friendship between
gentlemen are pure as water.

114
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:29,799
We don’t fuss over little things.

115
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,727
We should stay away from those
who seek revenge for

116
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:33,814
the smallest grievance.

117
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,239
It’s not like this.

118
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,820
- Master.
- Shut up!

119
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,039
Si Feng.

120
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,221
I’ve already said so much.

121
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,335
But you are still so stubborn.

122
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,545
How about this? From
today onward, I’ll lock you up

123
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,719
so that you can’t spend time
with idiots anymore.

124
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,424
- Master.
- Come. Come back with me.

125
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,947
- Let’s go.
- Si Feng.

126
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,162
- Let’s go.
- Si Feng.

127
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,260
- Si Feng.
- Stop right there!

128
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,658
Looks like you really need someone
to discipline you.

129
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,142
Come with me.

130
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,173
Master, why are you here?

131
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:29,959
I’m here for a happy occasion.

132
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,506
- Happy occasion?
- Xuan Ji.

133
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,361
Your master has something to ask you.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,158
Let me ask you.

135
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,203
What do you think about Hao Chen?

136
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,190
Of course he is very important to me.

137
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:46,589
One more question then.

138
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,439
Are you willing to accompany him forever?

139
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,206
Senior Hao Chen and I already vowed
to protect the secret ground forever.

140
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:55,639
Of course we can accompany
each other forever.

141
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:05,650
Xuan Ji, you’ve always created
troubles for me and you are stubborn.

142
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:08,927
Luckily, your Senior Hao Chen
doesn’t mind. Or else,

143
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:12,838
I really don’t know how I’m
going to find you a good man.

144
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:20,239
I’m willing to take Xuan Ji as my wife

145
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,286
to protect and respect her forever.

146
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,946
Please give us your blessings.

147
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,215
Senior Hao Chen, what nonsense
are you talking about?

148
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:33,151
Xuan Ji, everything I said
is sincere and true.

149
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,599
Xuan Ji, if you marry Senior Hao Chen,

150
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,519
first, you’ll have someone to take care
of you for the rest of your life.

151
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,860
Second, you can practice
Sentimental Tactics together.

152
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,853
Your power will grow.

153
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,974
It’ll be for the best.

154
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,759
Okay. You have my blessing.

155
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,639
I don’t want to marry him.

156
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,959
Ling Long can take care of me.
So can Sixth Senior.

157
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,226
As for the training, Si Feng can teach me.

158
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:58,453
He’s so smart. I’ll definitely improve.

159
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,613
I can’t marry Senior Hao Chen.

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,639
You... You are
really troublesome.

161
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,357
Just now, your master has asked you.

162
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:10,199
And you’ve already agreed. How can you...

163
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,719
How can you change your mind now?

164
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,719
Just now, I said that

165
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,479
I can protect the secret ground with
Senior Hao Chen forever.

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,228
I didn’t say that I’ll marry him.

167
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:20,409
You...

168
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,215
Junior, looks like Xuan Ji
has made up her mind.

169
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:27,999
Let’s not force her.

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,227
Senior, this kid...

171
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,799
I’ve spoiled her too much since young.

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,229
Now, she still wants to be
with that unethical man.

173
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,810
She wouldn’t settle down.

174
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,415
Fine. Since you wouldn’t settle
down, I’ll help you settle down.

175
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,891
I’m going to lock you up now.

176
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:48,149
After we go back to Shaoyang,
don’t ever think of leaving it again.

177
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,492
Father!

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,780
Master.

179
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,479
Are you still acting so foolish
over Chu Xuan Ji?

180
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,530
Have you forgotten what you are?

181
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,997
If it wasn’t because
I reached here on time,

182
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:10,352
you would’ve been beaten to death
in the great hall!

183
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:16,861
But you don’t regret it at all
and still want to be with her.

184
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,925
Have you lost your mind?

185
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:20,684
I’ve never lost my mind.

186
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:23,150
Xuan Ji risked her life to protect me.

187
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:24,731
My heart

188
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,559
is already with her.

189
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,980
What did you say?

190
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,479
You gave her your heart.

191
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,559
Are you going to give her your life too?

192
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,199
There are so many lives in Lize Palace.

193
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,406
Are you going to give her their lives too?

194
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,427
Get up!

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,679
Think about it carefully.

196
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,141
If she finds out about your real identity,

197
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:54,257
do you think she’ll still protect you?

198
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,430
Xuan Ji is different.

199
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,692
She won’t harm me.

200
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:11,293
Fine.

201
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,821
Since you are bent on having
your way, I’ll let you have your way.

202
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,919
Go further away if you want to die.

203
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,877
No matter who is it that
wants to hit you or kill you,

204
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,429
I don’t care anymore.

205
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,330
You are no longer my disciple now.

206
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,740
Senior, can you let me
go out a while to meet Si Feng?

207
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,468
I’ll come back quickly.
My father won’t find out.

208
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,501
Little Xuan Ji,
if we break the master’s order,

209
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:50,959
we’ll be beaten up later.

210
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,410
- Senior.
- No.

211
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,068
My father is keeping me
on such a tight leash.

212
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,561
How can I get out from Fuyu Island?

213
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,496
Silver...

214
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:21,725
Come with me.

215
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,173
- Why are you here?
- Si Feng instructed me to ask you

216
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:29,559
if you are set on going to Mount Buzhou.

217
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,289
I have to go there.

218
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,162
Okay then.

219
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,194
Take these.

220
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,159
What are these?

221
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,036
These are Parrot Charm and
Puppet Charm made by Si Feng.

222
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,309
Si Feng asked me to tell you that
if you follow his plan,

223
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,479
you’ll be able to leave
the island with him.

224
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,755
Really?

225
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,405
Yu’Er!

226
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:01,669
Yu’Er.

227
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,919
Finally, I found you.

228
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,253
I can’t run anymore.

229
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:08,119
Come back with me.

230
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,989
I won.

231
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,125
My dummy. What do you mean that you won?

232
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,998
I’m playing a game with Ling Long.

233
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,559
The one who can lead you here first wins.

234
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,131
Game?

235
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,469
I won. How is it? Aren’t I amazing?

236
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,719
Nobody can win me in a game.

237
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,479
Ling Long?

238
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,229
Who is he? What do you want?

239
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,621
That’s right. You won.

240
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:39,113
As a reward,

241
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,500
- I’ll give you a treasure.
- What treasure?

242
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,898
- What is this?
- Do you like it?

243
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,319
What are you doing?
What are you going to do to Yu’Er?

244
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,999
Don’t worry.

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,239
We won’t do anything to Yu’Er.

246
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,886
She is just a bait.

247
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,639
I am looking for you.

248
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,828
As long as you obey us,
your daughter will be fine.

249
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,439
Wu Tong, you said that
you’ll let me go if I win.

250
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,820
You lied to me.

251
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,439
- Bring them away.
- Yes.

252
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,735
Let’s go.

253
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:35,449
Yu’Er.

254
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,307
Old Fogey,
I didn’t trick you to come here.

255
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:40,608
- Don’t leave me behind.
- Don’t worry.

256
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:48,081
What do you want? Just say it.

257
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:51,995
I’m not the one looking for you.

258
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,197
Welcome, my Lord!

259
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,585
Lord?

260
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:16,435
This is the old lair of Sky Hall.

261
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,853
It’s an honor to be able to see
your celestial eye today, Mr. Liu.

262
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:22,933
You are the head of Sky Hall?

263
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,559
No wonder those from Sky Hall
live in the shadow.

264
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,558
So, it’s because their head
is an unpresentable person.

265
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,519
Don’t you think that
you are too talkative?

266
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,239
I called you here to ask you a question.

267
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,305
You have far-reaching power and
Sky Hall has spies all over the world.

268
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:41,079
What else you don’t know?

269
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,679
I’m afraid that I won’t be
able to help you.

270
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,827
Since you have the celestial eye,
you’ll be able to help me.

271
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:48,646
I just want to know.

272
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:52,247
Is Chu Xuan Ji the God of War
from the heaven?

273
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,223
I’ll lose ten years of my life every time
I open the celestial eye.

274
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:04,119
Moreover, it’s such a difficult question.

275
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,748
I’m afraid that I’ll have no answer
for you. It’ll just waste my life.

276
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:09,438
I don’t have that many ten years to waste.

277
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,516
I won’t open the celestial eye
no matter what.

278
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,959
Let go of him!

279
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,279
No! I have a type of blindness.
I’ll turn blind if I’m beaten.

280
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,279
- Listen. This is Xuanyin Chain.
- Let him go!

281
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,239
The more you struggle,
the tighter it gets.

282
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,952
Don’t play game with me.

283
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,159
Since you can bear the pain of
inserting the celestial eye,

284
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,399
this Xuanyin Chain is nothing to you.

285
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,211
But I’m not sure if your
daughter can take it or not.

286
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,599
Yu’Er!

287
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,181
Stop!

288
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:48,908
I forgot to tell you.

289
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:51,319
When this Xuanyin Chain
is at its tightest,

290
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,621
no matter it’s human or demon,
all will die.

291
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,068
Fine! Stop!

292
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,939
I agree to open the celestial eye for you!

293
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,399
Exactly like what I’ve suspected.

294
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,397
Chu Xuan Ji is the God of War.

295
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:40,588
Finally, I found you.

296
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,485
But she has not awakened yet.

297
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:45,753
I have to find a way to awaken her power.

298
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,439
Old Fogey, are you okay?

299
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,860
Don’t die!

300
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,879
Don’t worry, kid.

301
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,032
I won’t leave you behind.

302
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,277
Who are you?

303
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:03,413
Why can’t I see through you?

304
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,189
If I dare ask you
to open your celestial eye,

305
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,239
I’ll have a way
to block your sight from me.

306
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,220
Save it, Mr. Liu.

307
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:14,850
Treat him well.

308
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,334
I still need him.

309
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,573
I’ll come and get him in a few days’ time.

310
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:19,719
Yes, my Lord.

311
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,580
My Lord, when are we
going to attack the five sects?

312
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,101
My Lord!

313
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:28,380
Kid.

314
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,485
You are too ambitious.

315
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:34,956
I’m afraid that things won’t go your way.

316
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:39,774
- What did you say?
- Although I can’t identify him,

317
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:43,479
I saw the punishment mark
of the heaven on him.

318
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,037
He’s a criminal from the heavens.

319
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,085
If you collude with this kind of person,

320
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:49,279
there’ll be no good ending for you.

321
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,441
I know.

322
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,078
You don’t want to sacrifice
your moral integrity to stay alive.

323
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,918
You want to destroy the five sects

324
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,908
and become the head of the five sects.

325
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:59,341
But he’s someone
who can even hide from the heavens.

326
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,802
Do you think he’ll really keep
his promise to help you?

327
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,380
This is just your wishful thinking.

328
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,214
You want to sow discord between us?

329
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:12,759
Let me tell you.

330
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,057
I believe in only myself.

331
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,039
Take them away and
lock them up separately.

332
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,382
Yes.

333
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,821
He has the punishment mark
from the heavens?

334
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,322
Then, he shouldn’t be able
to enter Mount Buzhou.

335
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:35,280
Could it be that he has a way
to conceal his mark?

336
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,580
Could it be the Dragon Seal?

337
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:45,647
First Senior.

338
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,358
Xuan Ji has been locked inside
for so long. I want to chat with her.

339
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,126
Master asked me to keep an eye on you.

340
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:54,889
Don’t cause any trouble.

341
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,364
Don’t worry. What trouble can I make?

342
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you, Senior.

343
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,519
Are you ready? First Senior
is keeping a close eye on you.

344
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,479
Si Feng’s plan will definitely work. Look.

345
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,746
Good.

346
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:18,486
Sixth Senior, I’m so bored.

347
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,039
Let’s play Morra.

348
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,359
Loser will have to act like a dog.

349
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,199
Sure. Let’s play then. Bring it on.

350
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,799
Two brothers, three shining
stars, four treasures, five leaders.

351
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,159
Xuan Ji, you lost. Bark like a dog now.

352
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,959
Woof!

353
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,513
Louder. Later, I’ll buy you a meaty bone.

354
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,830
Woof!

355
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,915
First Senior.

356
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,319
Good that you are here.
I need to go to the toilet.

357
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,820
- Keep an eye on Xuan Ji for me.
- Yes, First Senior.

358
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
Two brothers, three shining stars.

359
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,079
Xuan Ji, you lost again.
Bark like a dog now.

360
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,368
Woof!

361
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,519
Little Xuan Ji is too dumb.
Why did she keep on losing?

362
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,559
Again.

363
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,439
- Two brothers, three shining stars,
- What are they doing?

364
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,879
Four treasures, five leaders.

365
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,485
Xuan Ji was still heartbroken about
the lad from Lize Palace yesterday, right?

366
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,559
Why is she...

367
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,919
- Well...
- What’s wrong with them?

368
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,223
Let’s continue.

369
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,759
Young people nowadays are too open-minded.

370
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,759
- What’s wrong?
- Two brothers.

371
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,919
- They...
- Yes.

372
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,799
Four treasures, five leaders.

373
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,239
This is bad.

374
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,479
Two brothers, three
shining stars, four treasures,

375
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,452
- five leaders.
- Min Yan.

376
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,008
Puppet Charm and Parrot Charm.

377
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,663
- Inform master about it at once.
- Yes, First Senior.

378
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,461
Lord Dong Fang ordered us to look for
Chu Xuan Ji and Zhong Min Yan.

379
00:23:58,462 --> 00:23:59,831
Don’t let them escape from the island!

380
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,257
All of you, go over there!
The rest, come with me!

381
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,980
- Let’s go.
- Wait.

382
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,933
You discussed in private to save
Ling Long. Why didn’t you tell me?

383
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,628
Am I not your friend?

384
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:19,170
Ruo Yu, you’ve misunderstood.

385
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:21,119
We don’t want to drag you down with us.

386
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,879
Besides, we went against
our masters’ order this time.

387
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,079
We’ll be punished severely
when we go back.

388
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,199
Ling Long is my friend too.
How can I sit back on this?

389
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,777
Even if I’ll be punished,

390
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:33,414
it’ll be worth it as long as
we can save her, right, Si Feng?

391
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:35,828
Good. The more the merrier.

392
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:39,071
If Lize Palace wants to punish
us, we will face it together.

393
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,719
Ruo Yu, thank you.

394
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,119
Let’s not talk about this now.

395
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,837
The Sword Trap is still active.
We have to find a way to leave.

396
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,477
I’ve already asked Silver Snake
to scout out the area.

397
00:24:48,478 --> 00:24:50,805
One part of the Sword Trap
is still broken.

398
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,175
Let’s go there.

399
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,784
Finally, I’m here.

400
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,583
Darn it.

401
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:18,959
What’s so good about Fuyu Island?

402
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,919
Why do they have to put on
this Sword Trap?

403
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,509
If it wasn’t because of the spirit
key, I wouldn’t even come here.

404
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:29,439
It’s the first quarter of moon today.
We can’t fix the formation.

405
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,558
I just need to lure them away.

406
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,255
Silver Snake, go.

407
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,653
Hurry up.

408
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,788
Xuan Ji, no matter
what you think,

409
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,199
you can tell me about it.
We can solve it together.

410
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,839
Why do you have to disobey your father?

411
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,069
Senior Hao Chen, I can’t go back
to Shaoyang with you.

412
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,479
- I...
- I know you want to save Ling Long.

413
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,552
But we need to lay down a plan first.

414
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:16,808
Xuan Ji,

415
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,530
come back with me now.

416
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,513
Sect Leader.

417
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:09,967
Purple Fox, why is it you?

418
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:11,549
Why are you here?

419
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,039
Humans are really rude.

420
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,414
I saved you just now out of kindness.

421
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:18,886
Shouldn’t you thank me?

422
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,933
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

423
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,757
Humans are supposed to be grateful, right?

424
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,553
You can repay me with the spirit key.

425
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,508
You old fox.

426
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:32,903
I knew that you have an ulterior motive
for coming here all alone.

427
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:36,228
Let me tell you. Sky Hall has already
taken away the spirit key.

428
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:38,330
- You are too late.
- What?

429
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,323
Sky Hall is really annoying.

430
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,665
Tell me then. Where are
those stinking demons now?

431
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,479
We want to get even with them too.

432
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,677
But Sky Hall is at Mount Buzhou.

433
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:52,230
And we couldn’t find it on the map.

434
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:53,620
Mount Buzhou?

435
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,911
So, they are hiding at Mount Buzhou.

436
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:01,079
That macaque is being
chained down in Fenru City.

437
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,340
And Mount Buzhou is the entrance, right?

438
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:08,119
I can go with them to find out
the location of Sky Hall and that macaque.

439
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,580
Then, I can save him
after I get the spirit keys.

440
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,279
I want to get even with Sky Hall too.

441
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,679
I’ll bring you with me then.

442
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,399
- You know where Mount Buzhou is?
- Of course.

443
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,622
I didn’t live 1000 years for nothing.

444
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:25,526
Don’t trust her. She might
attack us on the way there.

445
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:26,599
- That’s right.
- We’ll go there ourselves.

446
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,229
Wait. You can’t leave.

447
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,405
Without me, you won’t be able
to find Mount Buzhou.

448
00:28:30,406 --> 00:28:32,815
Mount Buzhou is no longer
in the human realm.

449
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,919
It’s not in the human realm anymore?

450
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,277
You don’t know, right?

451
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:41,399
After Gong Gong knocked down Mount Buzhou,

452
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,239
the sky pillar fell and
the earth caved in.

453
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,816
From then on, Mount Buzhou
is gone from the human realm.

454
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:49,199
Mortals like you won’t be able to find it.

455
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,917
If you really know where it is,
why don’t you go there yourself?

456
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:53,698
Why are you so kind to bring us there?

457
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:56,173
Why should I lie to you?

458
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,959
After Mount Buzhou collapsed
a few thousand years ago,

459
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,199
it became a demon territory
with strong demonic aura surrounding it.

460
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,679
Asura from the demon clan
found this place by accident.

461
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,664
Then, he took over this place and
used the demonic aura to train himself.

462
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,922
As time passes by, that place
has become a demon territory.

463
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:17,814
Let me tell you.
I grew up in Mount Buzhou.

464
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:20,237
So, I’m very familiar with that place.

465
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:22,599
Fine, I’ll believe you for now.

466
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,878
Tell us. Where is Mount Buzhou?

467
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,079
You treat me the best.

468
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,780
Tell us. How do we go to Mount Buzhou?

469
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:35,959
It’s like this. Although
I grew up in Mount Buzhou,

470
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,559
after the battle between
the deities and demons,

471
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,752
the demon clan was exiled
from Mount Buzhou.

472
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:44,767
They moved Fenru City there and
sent celestial knights to guard it.

473
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:46,461
So, I don’t know how to go back.

474
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:48,214
You are playing around with us.

475
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:49,279
Calm down.

476
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,278
Even if I don’t know the way,
Ting Nu will definitely know.

477
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,999
But you have to help me find him first.

478
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,559
Isn’t Ting Nu with you?

479
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,212
When we were at Mount Gao,
you escaped together with Ting Nu.

480
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:01,479
That’s right.

481
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,839
After we escaped from Mount
Gao, I put Ting Nu by the roadside.

482
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,399
At first, I wanted to go to Fuyu Island
to find out the location of spirit key.

483
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,597
But just within an hour, Ting Nu was gone.

484
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:15,629
I found some signs of struggles nearby.

485
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,333
He was captured by a very powerful demon.

486
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:21,149
I don’t know what kind of demon that is.

487
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,702
Is it demon from Sky Hall again?

488
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:25,319
Definitely not Sky Hall.

489
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,961
I’ve fought many times with Sky Hall.

490
00:30:27,962 --> 00:30:30,519
If they have such a powerful demon,
I’ll know about it.

491
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,618
I think he’s just a lone demon
that is hiding in the human realm.

492
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,199
So, after so much talking,
you just want us to help you.

493
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,399
So what if I am?

494
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,839
If you want to go to Mount Buzhou,
you have to help me save Ting Nu first.

495
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,862
Ting Nu is a merman.
He has no legs. He can’t walk.

496
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:48,163
I don’t know how he’ll be tortured.

497
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:52,060
Ting Nu is our friend.
We’ll definitely save him.

498
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:56,001
Besides, he’s the only one
who can save Ling Long now.

499
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,473
Alright. We’ll discuss about it first.

500
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,159
Are you really going to
travel with this fox demon?

501
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,829
She is very cunning.
We can’t fall for her lies.

502
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,479
How about this? We’ll save
Ting Nu together with her

503
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,169
and enter Mount Buzhou together.

504
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:20,060
After that, we just need to keep
the spirit keys away from her.

505
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:23,014
I think we can give it a try.

506
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:26,116
But, I really
don’t want to work with a demon.

507
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,359
Sixth Senior.

508
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,262
The most important thing now
is to save Ling Long.

509
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,479
Okay.

510
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,599
We’ll work together
with that demon fox first.

511
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,129
But if she does anything
suspicious, I’ll not show her mercy.

512
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,786
How is it? Are you done whispering?

513
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,316
We’ll save Ting Nu together first.
After entering Mount Buzhou,

514
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,599
we’ll part ways. How about that?

515
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,542
Good. This is exactly what I want.

516
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,007
No matter how I think about it,
it’s all because of that Yu Si Feng.

517
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,880
Xuan Ji has been led astray by him.
She’s getting bolder.

518
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:08,197
Even Min Yan is getting so disobedient.

519
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:11,559
The most important thing now
is to find them and bring them back.

520
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,844
Xuan Ji is determined to save Ling Long.

521
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:17,159
They must have gone to Mount Buzhou
to look for Sky Hall’s lair.

522
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,159
But Mount Buzhou
is hidden in another realm.

523
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,635
It’s not a place for humans.

524
00:32:21,636 --> 00:32:23,151
How are they going to find it?

525
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:25,559
Even if they can find it,
how can they get in?

526
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,733
No.

527
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:29,230
Mount Buzhou is linked to the human realm.

528
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:32,918
Although it’s hard for humans to survive
in Mount Buzhou, there’s a way in.

529
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,634
How do you know about that?

530
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,301
When I was going through my trial,

531
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:38,758
I met a fallen deity who had
escaped from Mount Buzhou.

532
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,776
He told me a lot about Mount Buzhou.

533
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:41,895
Sect Leader.

534
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:44,199
I know where the entrance
of Mount Buzhou is.

535
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,180
Maybe we can locate Xuan Ji and the others

536
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,361
by searching along the way
towards the entrance.

537
00:32:49,028 --> 00:32:50,359
Okay.

538
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:52,477
Hao Chen.

539
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:55,866
You are so worried about Xuan Ji.

540
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,759
How about this?
After you bring Xuan Ji back,

541
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,508
I’ll find an auspicious date
for your engagement.

542
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:03,853
Without you by her side,

543
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:06,114
she might cause even bigger troubles
in the future.

544
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,304
My Lord.

545
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,489
Tomorrow, send Liu Yi Huan and
his daughter out from Mount Buzhou.

546
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,759
I’ll have a use for them.

547
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,020
Yes.

548
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,462
My Lord.

549
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,749
Where are the people that I asked for?

550
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,852
Why do you need Liu Yi Huan for?

551
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:27,229
Just tell me about it.

552
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,192
I’ll help you settle it.

553
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,636
There’s no need for you to know.

554
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,639
If I don’t know what you want to do,

555
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,781
how can I do my best to serve you?

556
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:42,639
Later, I might be betrayed by you.

557
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,519
What is the meaning of this?

558
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,613
Your goal from the beginning

559
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,159
is to get the spirit keys

560
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,199
to revive Star of Mosha in order to
topple the heavens

561
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,599
and become the leader of all three realms.

562
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,100
Am I right?

563
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,590
So?

564
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:01,589
If the five sects of human realm
are willing to bow down to you,

565
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,214
are you not going to kill them then?

566
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,054
Who lives and who dies,
it all depends on my mood.

567
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:14,035
It’s up to me to decide.

568
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,805
The five sects are unimportant to me.

569
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:23,511
No wonder you were always
so reluctant to let Wolf help me.

570
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:26,719
You’re not going to
annihilate the five sects.

571
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,595
You just lied to me saying
that you’ll annihilate them

572
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,725
so that I’ll serve Sky Hall, right?

573
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:34,158
Wu Tong.

574
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,659
You should be thankful to Sky Hall.

575
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:40,554
Or else, you would’ve been dead.

576
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:46,436
You should be grateful that
you are still serving the Sky Hall.

577
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,531
Of course I’m grateful to you
for giving me this chance.

578
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,232
My Lord.

579
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:54,514
How about we make a deal?

580
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,429
Continue with your dream to become
leader of three realms.

581
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,210
I’ll help you get the spirit keys.

582
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:03,821
But from now on, the soldiers in
Sky Hall will be under my command.

583
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:06,074
I’ll destroy those five sects myself.

584
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,509
You want to make a deal with me?

585
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:13,119
You are really ambitious.

586
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,633
Now, you want to take over Sky Hall?

587
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,198
Listen to me carefully, Wu Tong.

588
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,252
You are just a dog that I picked up.

589
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,340
When I’m happy,
I’ll let you become the superintendent.

590
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,354
But if I’m unhappy,

591
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,386
I can kill you anytime.

592
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,009
Dragon Seal?

593
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:19,181
I almost forgot that

594
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:22,350
you are carrying the punishment mark
of the heavens.

595
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:25,399
Only this Dragon Seal
can conceal that mark

596
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,518
and allow you to enter
and leave Mount Buzhou.

597
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,048
But besides Yuan Lang,
the Right Lieutenant,

598
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:34,192
who had this Rose Gold Bird mark,

599
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:36,224
almost nobody else
has the same mark, right?

600
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,236
You know a lot.

601
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:40,918
If I’m working with the demons,

602
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:44,845
of course I have to find out everything
about the demon realm.

603
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,461
I should know my opponent well.

604
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:47,820
But

605
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,999
I can find out even more secrets
about you.

606
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,424
Wu Tong.

607
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:53,839
You are courting death!

608
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,502
But can you kill me?

609
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,558
Liu Yi Huan told me that you have
the punishment mark from the heavens.

610
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,950
I was curious.

611
00:38:01,951 --> 00:38:03,959
You’ve entered Mount Buzhou so many times.

612
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,239
So, the Dragon Seal should be with you.

613
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,358
But I never heard anything about
Lize Palace losing their Dragon Seal.

614
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,941
And Sky Hall has never had a plan
to attack Lize Palace.

615
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:21,094
So, I was thinking that maybe
you are hiding within Lize Palace

616
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:24,050
where you have easy access to Dragon Seal.

617
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,128
I was right.

618
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,022
You thought that no one will
attack Lize Palace without your order.

619
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:35,237
So, you were not on your guard.

620
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:38,919
I have to thank you for allowing
me to get the Dragon Seal

621
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,662
without any effort at all.

622
00:38:42,694 --> 00:38:46,526
I’ve underestimated
you before this.

623
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:49,239
Besides, I found out about
a groundbreaking secret.

624
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,781
I think nobody in Lize Palace knows that

625
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:54,759
their vice palace lord
is the lord of Sky Hall, right?

626
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,719
Or else, you would have used
Lize Palace as Sky Hall’s hideout.

627
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,862
You don’t have to
go through so much trouble.

628
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:03,279
Am I right, Vice Palace Lord?

629
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,199
Wu Tong.

630
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,799
You follow neither the human rules
or the demon rules.

631
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,505
There is no place for you
within the three realms.

632
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:14,039
I just want to work with you.

633
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,959
You want to get the spirit keys to
become the leader of three realms.

634
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,759
I just want to annihilate the five sects.

635
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,467
We have no contradicting interest.

636
00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:25,119
If you agree to my request, not
only will I help you keep your secret,

637
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,999
I’ll continue to serve you.

638
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,090
You are threatening me.

639
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:32,429
We are just taking what we need.

640
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,027
Isn’t that wonderful?

641
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,479
Fine.

642
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,866
I agree.

643
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,740
Give me the Dragon Seal.

644
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,750
Since you are willing
to cooperate with me,

645
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,501
we should each show our sincerity.

646
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:53,079
This Dragon Seal and the spirit key inside

647
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,292
will become the token of our cooperation.
I’ll keep it for you first.

648
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,439
As for what you want to do
with Liu Yi Huan,

649
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,301
just leave the matter to me.

650
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:06,829
I’ll do it nicely for you to
show you my sincerity first.

651
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,039
You are a demon fox, not a demon dog.

652
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,584
Are you sure that
your sense of smell is accurate?

653
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,180
Ting Nu went that way.

654
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,573
It’s late. Let’s rest
in the forest for tonight.

655
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:42,540
We’ll depart tomorrow morning
and continue to look for him.

656
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,359
Here. Eat this.

657
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,830
I am a fox. I eat only humans or grapes.

658
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:19,207
I don’t want to eat
such a charred sweet potato.

659
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,197
You dare to eat humans with
that courage of yours?

660
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,158
Are you really not going to eat it?

661
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,318
Forget it.

662
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:48,485
After thinking about it, we
are on the same boat now.

663
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:50,714
I shouldn’t isolate you.

664
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:54,055
So, I’ve decided to eat
and stay with all of you.

665
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:04,212
Little Si Feng.

666
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:06,361
Do you want to have a taste of this?

667
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:09,279
He won’t eat it. He won’t eat yours.
He will eat mine instead.

668
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,620
Si Feng.

669
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,839
What is it, Si Feng? Is her corn
better than my sweet potato?

670
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,099
Mine is much better than her corn. Eat it.

671
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:25,361
I can eat it myself.

672
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:33,054
Don’t worry.
I’m not interested in your lover.

673
00:42:33,055 --> 00:42:36,051
That macaque already annoys me enough.

674
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,363
By the way,
you don’t look like an evil demon.

675
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:44,399
Why will you fall in love with
a devil like Wu Zhi Qi?

676
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,309
Wu Zhi Qi is not a devil.

677
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,803
Why is he not?

678
00:42:47,804 --> 00:42:51,279
Sky Hall caught Ling Long
just to save him.

679
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,717
I’ll say it again.

680
00:42:52,718 --> 00:42:55,125
Wu Zhi Qi has nothing to do with Sky Hall.

681
00:42:55,126 --> 00:42:57,676
They have an ulterior motive
for saving him.

682
00:42:58,614 --> 00:43:05,341
Wu Zhi Qi is the most free
and easy person in this world.

683
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,318
Let go of me!

684
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,159
Lately, the floor is littered
with grape skin.

685
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,239
Finally, I caught you today.

686
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,919
Let go of me!

687
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,439
I’m from Qingqiu’s Fox Tribe. I’m vicious.

688
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,060
If you hurt me,
my tribe will definitely avenge me.

689
00:43:39,895 --> 00:43:42,319
How are you going to seek revenge from me?

690
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,319
I’ll eat everything in your grape garden,
watermelon garden and pumpkin garden.

691
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,833
Are you afraid now?

692
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,541
Too bad for you.

693
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:55,754
I’m the fiercest monkey in this world.

694
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,419
Look.

695
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,294
Your fur looks good.

696
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:08,493
I need a scarf.

697
00:44:08,494 --> 00:44:10,834
I’ll skin you to warm my neck for winter.

698
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:15,681
Little fox.

699
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,700
Little fox.

700
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,742
You are really such a coward.
