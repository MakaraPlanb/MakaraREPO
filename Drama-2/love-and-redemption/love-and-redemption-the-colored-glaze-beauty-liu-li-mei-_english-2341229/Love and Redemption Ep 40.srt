00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,260
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:32,920
<i>EPISODE 40</i>

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,310
I’ve told you enough.

4
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,004
Why don’t you show me
your sincerity as well?

5
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,286
I’ll tell you my goal after that.

6
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,470
So, what exactly do you want me to do?

7
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:51,518
Go to Demon Citadel

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,390
and save Wu Zhi Qi
with the power of the 12 Feathers.

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,898
Mortals and demons are enemies
because they’re equal in strength.

10
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:09,183
But if the demons grow much
stronger, no mortals would dare to

11
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,639
disobey us.

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,006
So, by that time,

13
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:18,110
that silly girl will be together
with you naturally.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,950
Do you think I’m in the dark
because you didn’t tell me the truth?

15
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,639
After the Demon Citadel
was destroyed by the heavens,

16
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,413
it is filled with deadly anguish.
It is a death trap.

17
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:31,764
You just wanted to send me to my grave.

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,080
You have no right to talk about

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,991
Xuan Ji and I when you’re this selfish.

20
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,982
I’m doing this for your sake.

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,719
If you don’t help out the
demon clan, next time,

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,990
you’ll die by her sword
when she masters her powers.

23
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:53,008
It’ll be too late for you
to regret it by then.

24
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,127
Scram.

25
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,990
Think about it.

26
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,559
Seems like he’s getting
more and more ambitious.

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,663
Elder Luo, how’s the
situation in Lize Palace?

28
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,759
He forced everyone to join Sky Hall.

29
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,679
For those who disobey his
orders, he’ll either put them in cells

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,270
or execute them immediately.

31
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,395
Please pass this message to everyone.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,550
Sky Hall is powerful now.

33
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,799
We need to compromise with them.

34
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,040
And save our strength.

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,773
We shouldn’t sacrifice
ourselves for nothing.

36
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:49,310
Now, I know what his next plan is.

37
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,874
Give me some time to think of a solution.

38
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,185
I will surely protect our clan.

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,203
Yes.

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,752
These four stupid chains!

41
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,510
Palace Lord, you’ve absorbed 80 souls.

42
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,096
It’s finally working after
absorbing so many souls.

43
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:48,870
Now, we just need another
19 souls to complete it.

44
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,118
You can absorb the God of War’s power

45
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,549
if you complete the Soul Furnace?

46
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,616
Are you interested as well?

47
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,119
The God of War is mighty.

48
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,359
I can’t absorb her powers
by using the Soul Furnace alone.

49
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,519
We need to set up a formation as well.

50
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,790
And I’m the only one who knows
how to set up that formation.

51
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,856
Only I can use

52
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:15,392
the God of War’s powers.

53
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,655
Ruo Yu,

54
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,150
you better don’t try anything funny.

55
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,811
I don’t dare to do so!

56
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:31,512
I’ve always been loyal to you, my lord.

57
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:32,868
I will never betray you.

58
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,559
Rise now.

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,755
Thank you, my lord.

60
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,559
Of course I will succeed.

61
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,030
I’ve planned this for over 1,000 years.

62
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,235
I’ve located the God of War
and had awaken her powers.

63
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,174
Everything is according to the plan.

64
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,239
We need Yuntian Loop and Chehai Hook
to unseal the Jade Cup.

65
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,956
But when we unseal the Jade Cup,

66
00:06:56,957 --> 00:07:01,999
the immense pressure of Star of Mosha
will turn us into dust.

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,950
We’ll only be fine if we have
God of War’s power.

68
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,150
And only her powers can fight against
the Star of Mosha’s power.

69
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,110
I’m not reviving the Star of Mosha
for him to become our leader.

70
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,470
He can only obey me.

71
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,479
So, my lord,
you’ve planned for this all along.

72
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,848
But now, you need Yu Si Feng
to enter Demon Citadel.

73
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,347
I’m afraid he won’t do so.

74
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,150
Even I can’t enter Demon Citadel now.

75
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,799
Yu Si Feng is our only chance
because he has the 12 Feathers bloodline.

76
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,999
I wouldn’t have kept him alive
if it weren’t for that.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,879
The chains trapping Wu Zhi Qi

78
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,759
will only show up when Fenru City’s gate
open on the 15th day of next month.

79
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,832
I’m sure he’ll agree before that.

80
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,072
Yes.

81
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,724
My lord, I have another favor
to ask of you.

82
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,038
I hope you can help me.

83
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,119
My sister is not feeling well lately.

84
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,441
Can I...

85
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,750
Do you think this is the time for that?

86
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,158
What you need to do now is to
monitor Chu Xuan Ji’s movement

87
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,938
so that I can acquire her powers.

88
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,745
- Yes.
- After you complete your task,

89
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,159
I will arrange for you two to reunite.

90
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,524
Yes.

91
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:32,875
Now, we need to think of a way
to deal with Chu Xuan Ji.

92
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,279
You two weren’t even here
when I was still in Lize Palace!

93
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,514
What’s going on?

94
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,399
Old Luo! It’s me, Liu Yi Huan!

95
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,846
Why have you returned?

96
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,463
Can’t I even pay my condolences
to the old palace lord?

97
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,798
These two scoundrels wouldn’t let me in!

98
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,479
I was an elder too, you know?

99
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,150
Old Luo, help me out.

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,106
Let him in.

101
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,897
- But the new palace lord said...
- No buts!

102
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,079
Old Luo, you have a short temper,

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,839
but you’re helping me out today.
What a rare sight.

104
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,239
I’ll treat you to a drink next time.

105
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,119
Si Feng is close with you.

106
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,537
I hope you can console him.

107
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,422
Where’s that chap?

108
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:20,979
He’s at the wake in our Clan Hall.

109
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,199
Today is the seventh day
after his passing.

110
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,150
It’s time for him to come out. Follow me.

111
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,150
It has been seven days.
It’s time for us to bury his coffin.

112
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,124
Wait! I haven’t pay my respects yet!

113
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,589
Palace Lord!

114
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,919
I’m here to pay my respects.

115
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,639
Why did you leave us like that?

116
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,839
I still have many things
left unsaid, you know?

117
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,670
Palace Lord!

118
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,230
I’m here to wail.

119
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,319
And I’m very shy.

120
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,070
You wait outside.

121
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,638
Hurry!

122
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,909
Will you cry for me if I can’t cry later?

123
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,470
Those who are outside can leave as well.

124
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,070
Palace Lord!

125
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,187
Brother Liu.

126
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,999
Are you here to pay your condolences?

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,630
Of course not. I’m here to find you.

128
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,399
I’m here to find you.

129
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,439
Purple Fox has a message for you.

130
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,972
Xuan Ji wants to meet you at Qingmu Town
by 7 a.m. tomorrow.

131
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,919
Xuan Ji?

132
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,199
She’s willing to meet me?

133
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,630
Why should I lie to you?

134
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,159
Both of you are suffering
because of each other.

135
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,796
Since you’re suffering, why don’t you
meet her and explain everything?

136
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,988
So, are you going or not?

137
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,849
Look at you.

138
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,884
You’ve been here the entire
day, staring at that stupid hairpin.

139
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,008
Fine then.

140
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,159
Stinky woman, if you miss Little Chef
that much, you should find him.

141
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,563
Honestly speaking, he’s a great cook.

142
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,114
I’m sure he’s not a bad guy.

143
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,068
Senior Xuan Ji.

144
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,400
A lady wearing a purple dress
wanted me to give you this lantern.

145
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,977
Thank you.

146
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,707
<i>7 A.M., QINGMU TOWN</i>

147
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,235
- Flying Snake.
- What are you doing?

148
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:35,165
Hey, do you want to try every food
around Shaoyang Peak?

149
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,159
Of course I do.

150
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,101
Okay. Do me a favor first.

151
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,062
It’s 7 a.m. already.

152
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,119
Why isn’t Xuan Ji here yet?

153
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,179
I’ve sent the lantern to Shaoyang Sect.

154
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,210
Xuan Ji will definitely come.

155
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,479
How could you be sure?

156
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,339
What if she changes her mind?

157
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,547
That’s possible as well.

158
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,119
You’re such a wet blanket.

159
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,710
Don’t speak. Just wait and see.

160
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,919
What’s with your face?

161
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,825
I learned how to cook this
from my neighbor.

162
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:27,426
This is my first time cooking it.

163
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,042
Si Feng, you must eat more.

164
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,830
So, this is how it feels like

165
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,182
to love someone.

166
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:42,013
Please don’t scare me anymore, okay?

167
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:45,599
Please don’t ever leave me.

168
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,959
Xuan Ji, I will stay by your side forever.

169
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,158
Forever.

170
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,303
Si Feng, you’re even jealous
of my spirit beast?

171
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:55,614
So what if I’m jealous?

172
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,566
I can be jealous of anyone.

173
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,830
Next time, I want a kiss as consolation

174
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,919
We shouldn’t see each other
in the first place.

175
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,039
If my father knows about this,
he’ll be disappointed in me.

176
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,486
Let’s speak like this.

177
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,527
I’m sorry.

178
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,310
I’ve always wanted to tell you the truth.

179
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,950
It must’ve been shocking for you.

180
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,390
Why did you hide it from me then?

181
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,310
Why didn’t you tell me the truth?

182
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,710
I’ve always wanted to
tell you my true identity.

183
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,066
But everything happened at the same time

184
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:22,823
before I got the chance to
tell you the truth.

185
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,870
I swear, this is the only
thing that I’ve hidden from you.

186
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,919
But that is
the most important thing to me.

187
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,679
Si Feng, what I
only care about is

188
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,225
the fact that the person I trust the most
had deceived me, you understand?

189
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,588
Xuan Ji,

190
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,322
I’m sorry.

191
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,639
I will never deceive you in the future.

192
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,686
Nor will I

193
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,710
hide anything else from you.

194
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,379
Let me ask you this.

195
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,290
How much did you know
about Yuan Lang’s scheme?

196
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:02,455
And did you participate in his scheme?

197
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:04,407
Yuan Lang?

198
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,567
Are you talking about
the Right Lieutenant?

199
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:08,998
Was he involved in this as well?

200
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:12,039
Yuan Lang is the vice palace lord
of Lize Palace.

201
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,750
He’s the leader of Sky Hall as well.
Purple Fox discovered that.

202
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,342
So, that’s the case.

203
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,550
It’s no wonder
he’s acting so mysteriously.

204
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,964
Yuan Lang wants to save Wu Zhi Qi
by using the spirit keys.

205
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,385
And he wants to revive the Star of Mosha.

206
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,430
Did you participate in his scheme?

207
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,510
I have never participated in his scheme.

208
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,340
We were on the same page

209
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,891
before Dianjinggu Sect
held the Flower Session.

210
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:39,955
I didn’t know Lize Palace was involved
in Sky Hall’s evil scheme.

211
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,626
I didn’t know about their plans.

212
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,020
I didn’t even know that

213
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,230
my master was my father.

214
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,399
I knew something was wrong
during the night before Flower Session.

215
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,311
My father was used by Vice Palace Lord.
I tried to trap them,

216
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,100
but in the end,

217
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,578
I still failed.

218
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,758
I know.

219
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,069
Everything I’m saying now
seems like an excuse to you.

220
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,947
But Xuan Ji,

221
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,950
can you believe in me?

222
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:15,881
I believe in you.

223
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,051
So,

224
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,598
can I see your face?

225
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,903
No!

226
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,039
Two of them finally have the chance
to see each other.

227
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,118
But why aren’t they hugging each other?

228
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,759
I don’t understand.

229
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,936
An old fox like you doesn’t know anything
about mortals.

230
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,528
This is the delight of life.

231
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,959
Staring at each other
with passionate eyes.

232
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,239
You’re jealous, aren’t you?

233
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,186
Little Phoenix is
an affectionate man indeed.

234
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:57,614
It’s tough being a mortal.

235
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:59,685
But he still insists on being one.

236
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,839
Wu Zhi Qi told me before
that being a mortal is great.

237
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,383
The mortal realm is prosperous,
filled with blue skies and white clouds.

238
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:09,688
Full of songs and dances,
filled with amazing events.

239
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,990
It’s a dazzling realm.

240
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,110
But I think that’s not important.

241
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:18,794
Si Feng.

242
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:22,519
I do believe in you.

243
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,676
But

244
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,550
that doesn’t mean
everything has been solved.

245
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,526
That time,

246
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:33,713
I witnessed my mother’s death personally!

247
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:37,787
She was burned to death by deadly anguish!

248
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,190
And your father was the murderer!

249
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:44,695
If you were in my shoes,

250
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,710
could you treat it as if
nothing has happened?

251
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,383
My father,

252
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,519
he did commit too many mistakes

253
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,423
due to his obsession.

254
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,975
And now,

255
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,830
he’s dead because of it.

256
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,310
But Xuan Ji, my father
didn’t murder your mother.

257
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:14,727
Yuan Lang, the vice palace lord,
murdered her.

258
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,516
Yuan Lang?

259
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,226
What did you say just now?

260
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,460
Say that again.

261
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,630
Yuan Lang admitted that himself.

262
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:39,236
I know I have no prove.

263
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,790
And Shaoyang Sect won’t believe me
without any prove.

264
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:48,110
You said your mother
was burned to death.

265
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,826
I think I know how to
investigate this matter now.

266
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,367
Xuan Ji, please give me some time.

267
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,115
I will get to the bottom of this.

268
00:19:58,116 --> 00:19:59,940
And I’ll bring the true culprit to you.

269
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,136
By that time,

270
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,826
I will stand in front of you.

271
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,720
And you can punish me however you want

272
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,159
for my deceit.

273
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,609
I won’t punish you!

274
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,252
Si Feng, I don’t need you to do anything!

275
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,639
I just want you to leave Lize Palace
and stay with me!

276
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,308
I want you to return to Shaoyang Sect with
me so that my father can believe in you!

277
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:21,149
As for the true culprit, we
can just investigate it together!

278
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,963
Xuan Ji.

279
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,183
Now, I can’t just

280
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,910
do nothing about the situation.

281
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,870
Before my father passed away,
he told me to

282
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:41,955
protect the members of our clan
in Lize Palace.

283
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,800
Now, Yuan Lang is the new palace lord.

284
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,088
If I leave,

285
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,350
he’ll manipulate my clan members
and use them as killing machines.

286
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:56,072
My clan isn’t evil.

287
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,297
So,

288
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:00,662
I can’t just leave them behind.

289
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:05,939
Can you really change them?

290
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,213
What if, one day,

291
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:11,613
you become as evil as
the demons of Sky Hall?

292
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,616
If that does happen,

293
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,390
please kill me.

294
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,085
Kill you?

295
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,910
You want me to kill you?

296
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,639
Do you know this?

297
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,230
Every sect knows that
I’m the God of War now.

298
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,286
And they want me to lead them
to exterminate the demons.

299
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,719
Lize Palace is the first thing
on their mind!

300
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,239
Lize Palace and Sky Hall had killed
too many people in Dianjinggu Sect.

301
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,020
Their sins will never be undone!

302
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,199
I can’t,

303
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,163
and I won’t stop hunting Lize Palace
just because you say that

304
00:22:22,164 --> 00:22:24,274
not all demons in Lize Palace are evil!

305
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,910
When my sword points toward Lize Palace,

306
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,749
when my Dingkun Sword points at your face,

307
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,902
what do you want me to do by then?

308
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,399
Are you going to fight me?

309
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,211
Xuan Ji.

310
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,319
I’m sorry.

311
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,550
I’ve made things difficult for you.

312
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,239
But can you

313
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,830
not sever our ties right away?

314
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,030
Please give me more time.

315
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,999
Let me drive Yuan Lang away
and take over Lize Palace.

316
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,070
After that, I will give
the sects an answer.

317
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,910
And I’ll bear the sins of Lize Palace.

318
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,215
I just hope that

319
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,968
you can wait for me.

320
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,870
Let me think about it.

321
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,270
I’ll give you an answer tomorrow.

322
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,879
Okay.

323
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,186
I’ll wait for your answer.

324
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,870
But Xuan Ji, remember this.

325
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,390
No matter what you choose,

326
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,950
you will never change in my heart.

327
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,279
Why did Xuan Ji run away while crying?

328
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
Did the deal go wrong?

329
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,998
Are you sure you’re a Rose Gold Bird?
You’re more like a crow.

330
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,304
Just shut up.

331
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,764
Master and the rest
had returned to Shaoyang Sect.

332
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:47,155
It’s bad for us to go there now.

333
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,660
Don’t worry about Xuan Ji.

334
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:52,251
I’m sure everyone will take care of her.

335
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,959
I’ll buy some noodles in front.

336
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,959
Why don’t you go to the fabric store

337
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,619
and see if there’s anything
you want to buy?

338
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,370
We’ll decorate our home together later.

339
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:07,050
Okay.

340
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,064
Take care. Please come again.

341
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,244
Miss, please have a look inside.

342
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,863
Goodbye.

343
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,879
Shopkeeper.

344
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,119
Miss, what kind of fabric
are you looking for?

345
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,708
Is there anything I can use
to make a bed sheet?

346
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:27,997
Yes.

347
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,238
Valley Master insisted on
sending us here to follow Shaoyang Sect.

348
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,839
He wants us to follow the God of War.

349
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,157
We left in a hurry. We don’t even
have time to pack our clothes.

350
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,336
Shopkeeper.

351
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:48,327
Hello, gentlemen.

352
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:49,779
Do you sell silk cloth here?

353
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,331
Of course we do.

354
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,342
But please wait a moment.

355
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,878
I need to give this to that lady.

356
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:57,439
Wait.

357
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,881
I think this fabric is quite good.
It’s suitable for us.

358
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:01,163
Wrap it up for us.

359
00:26:01,164 --> 00:26:05,724
Sir, that lady had placed
an order before you.

360
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,721
I thought it was someone else.

361
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,592
So, it’s the young lady of Shaoyang Sect.

362
00:26:15,027 --> 00:26:16,361
Wait.

363
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:18,112
I heard that she has been
kicked out of the sect.

364
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,333
What was the reason again?

365
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,239
- Shopkeeper.
- Miss.

366
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,484
Thank you, miss.

367
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,379
Didn’t you hear me?

368
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,077
This fabric is ours.

369
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,255
Step aside.

370
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,179
She’s scary, huh?

371
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:40,974
Why didn’t you act like this
while you were together with demons?

372
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:44,039
You only like demons?

373
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,380
Humans are not that bad, you know?

374
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,877
- Is that so?
- Yes.

375
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:49,119
Look.

376
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,470
Don’t fight!

377
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,959
You thought you were a real young lady?

378
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,519
In our eyes, you’re worse than
a village girl.

379
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,759
Even village girls know how to
keep their chastity intact.

380
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,143
Shut up!

381
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,748
This is my mouth.

382
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,503
I can say anything I want.

383
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:29,079
Moreover, you had fooled around
with demons before.

384
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,395
Are you afraid people might tease you?

385
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,716
Are you tired of living?

386
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:57,970
Look who’s here.

387
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:00,479
It’s Zhong Min Yan,
the traitor of Shaoyang Sect.

388
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,038
Seems like you’re
the only guy in the world

389
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,509
who will fall for
a woman like Chu Ling Long.

390
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,646
Scram!

391
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,030
Let’s go.

392
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,310
Ling Long, are you okay?

393
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:40,702
I’m fine.

394
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,830
Ling Long!

395
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,135
Ling Long!

396
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,430
Do you remember what I’ve said before?

397
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:55,992
You didn’t do anything wrong.

398
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:58,641
Don’t torture yourself
because of their words.

399
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:02,001
But in the end, I still hear their words.

400
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:04,232
I’m not the past me anymore.

401
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,761
I can’t hide from them.

402
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,817
In my eyes, you’re Chu Ling
Long, the person I love the most.

403
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,959
There’s no difference
between the past and the present you.

404
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,030
Ling Long, I’m beside you.

405
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:19,872
You don’t need to hide.

406
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,028
Do you know

407
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:25,651
what I dream of

408
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,270
every night?

409
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,190
It’s Wu Tong.

410
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,550
It’s like he was implanted in my brain!

411
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,044
I can’t avoid him!

412
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:40,555
There’s no place for me to hide!

413
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,478
Ling Long, that’s not you.

414
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,829
Don’t think about it anymore.

415
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,759
But the images I see
are so clear and vivid.

416
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,679
I can’t avoid him.

417
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,470
I can’t avoid him!

418
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,432
Ling Long, I’m here.

419
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,247
Don’t be afraid.

420
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,061
Don’t be afraid.

421
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,390
I will help you to forget him.

422
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,990
I will help you to forget him.

423
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,633
Ling Long.

424
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,410
Ling Long.

425
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,767
I’m here.

426
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,914
Don’t be afraid.

427
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,311
I’m around.

428
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,736
Ling Long.

429
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,392
Ling Long.

430
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,430
If you stay by my side, you’ll be
despised no matter where you go.

431
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,230
Unless I die,

432
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,470
I’ll never be able
to escape Wu Tong.

433
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,825
I’m sorry.

434
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,790
See you in my next life.

435
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,883
Ling Long.

436
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,052
Ling Long!

437
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,039
- What happened?
- Master.

438
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,255
Ling Long is missing.

439
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,919
- How did that happen?
- She was teased in town yesterday.

440
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,604
And she left without a word this morning.

441
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:09,932
Master, please help me find Ling Long.

442
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:13,159
Lead my men and search the area.

443
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,019
- Okay. All of you, follow me.
- Yes.

444
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,274
Sect Leader.

445
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,637
Your injuries haven’t healed yet.
You better rest.

446
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,602
Ling Long is a generous
and forgiving girl.

447
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:33,753
What exactly did she suffer?

448
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,470
How did this happen?

449
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,205
- Senior!
- Ling Long!

450
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,662
- Senior!
- Ling Long!

451
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,599
- Senior Ling Long!
- Senior!

452
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,079
Ling Long, where are you?

453
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,510
- Senior!
- Senior!

454
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,719
- Senior!
- Senior!

455
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,392
- Senior, where are you?
- Ling Long!

456
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:57,063
- Senior!
- Senior!

457
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,519
Where is Senior Ling Long?

458
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,178
In the past, she would hide in places
we couldn’t find when she was angry.

459
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,909
We never found her.

460
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,152
I’m such a fool.

461
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,581
- Senior!
- Senior!

462
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,595
Duanjin Sword,

463
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,390
I’ve embarrassed Shaoyang Sect.

464
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,310
I’ll leave you here

465
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,870
so that you can slay more demons

466
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,910
and atone for my sins.

467
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,439
- Ling Long!
- Let me go!

468
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,364
Can’t I even choose to end my life
over such a terrible fate?

469
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,677
Chu Ling Long!

470
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,435
I thought you were only willful.

471
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:33,524
But I didn’t expect you
to be this selfish!

472
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:34,902
Think about this carefully.

473
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:37,343
How did you manage to stay alive
after you were captured by Sky Hall?

474
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,570
I risked my life to save you.

475
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,130
Second Senior sacrificed his life for you.

476
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,847
Do you think you can die
when you feel like it?

477
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:45,768
Did you even ask me for my permission?

478
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,919
Don’t you think you’re letting down
our Second Senior?

479
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,883
You love to serve justice
ever since you were young.

480
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:56,875
But now, some other people
are committing misdeeds.

481
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,680
Why didn’t you go and punish them?

482
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:01,311
Why are you trying to punish us
with your death instead?

483
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,590
Are you trying to let your father,
Xuan Ji and I suffer forever?

484
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,900
- It’s not that.
- If you want to die, fine.

485
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:13,913
I’ll die as well.

486
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,116
I’ll die in front of you.

487
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,417
I’ll let you know how it feels like
to see your loved ones die before you.

488
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,321
No! Min Yan! No!

489
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:25,792
Min Yan!

490
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,237
I’m sorry.

491
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,862
I’m sorry!

492
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,903
Please don’t die.

493
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,496
Ling Long.

494
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,430
I will always stay by your side

495
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,510
no matter what happens to you.

496
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,030
Please don’t leave me behind.

497
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,270
You can’t just sacrifice our happiness

498
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,430
because of something that didn’t happen,

499
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,859
okay?

500
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,032
Okay.

501
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,263
She’s fine. She’s unconscious
because she was grieving too much.

502
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:50,934
She’ll be fine after a few days.

503
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,638
It’s all thanks to Min Yan.
It’s lucky that he found her in time.

504
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,969
If not, she would’ve...

505
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,035
We’ll let Xuan Ji accompany her.

506
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:06,786
Maybe she’ll feel better that way.

507
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,219
Where’s Xuan Ji?

508
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,030
This is a huge matter.
But Xuan Ji is not around at all.

509
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:17,480
Didn’t you tell her?

510
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,279
- Where’s Xuan Ji?
- Don’t touch me.

511
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,673
Can I say that I don’t know?

512
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,759
Tell me!

513
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,270
Qingmu Town.

514
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,664
I was actually frightened by a mortal.

515
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,161
Is Xuan Ji’s senior that scary
in the first place?

516
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,480
Little Phoenix is pitiful indeed.

517
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:05,308
His father just died and Xuan Ji
may become his enemy in the future.

518
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:11,937
The heavens are truly messing with him.

519
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,959
He’s the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

520
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,519
I think he was influenced by sentiments
as he has been here for too long.

521
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,399
If he wants to be a demon,
he should learn from Wu Zhi Qi.

522
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,919
If I were Si Feng,
I would’ve eloped with Xuan Ji.

523
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,870
The survival of Lize Palace
has nothing to do with me.

524
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,182
It’s easy for you to say.

525
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,035
Let me ask you.

526
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:40,140
Si Feng chased after Xuan Ji
in his previous nine lives,

527
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:42,199
but did he ever complain about it?

528
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,159
This time, he just wanted her to
wait for a while, yet she’s unhappy.

529
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,559
She even wanted Si Feng to follow her back
and apologize to the other sects.

530
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,670
Being virtuous will cause him
his life, you know?

531
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,693
Let me ask you this then.

532
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:58,799
Did the Rose Gold Bird clan
kill Xuan Ji’s mother?

533
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,439
Did the Rose Gold Bird
hurt Xuan Ji’s father?

534
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,754
Did the Rose Gold Bird clan
slay many of their people?

535
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:07,239
If I were Xuan Ji, I would only be happy
if all of them were dead.

536
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,639
Now, she only wants Si Feng to follow her.

537
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,198
She’s very magnanimous.

538
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,446
She wants her to leave?

539
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:14,599
Tell me, where else can he go?

540
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,386
You said this yourself.

541
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:20,470
The vice palace lord is Yuan Lang,
the leader of Sky Hall.

542
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,279
Now that he has all four spirit keys,

543
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,884
the three realms will be in turmoil soon.

544
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:29,875
Yet you’re asking him to leave Lize Palace
and elope with Xuan Ji?

545
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:32,256
- What did you say?
- What?

546
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,737
Yuan Lang has obtained
all four spirit keys?

547
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,822
Yes.

548
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:43,638
The three realms will be in turmoil soon.

549
00:40:44,263 --> 00:40:46,973
Let’s cherish our remaining days.

550
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:50,496
Yuan Lang is devious.
He’ll surely trick Wu Zhi Qi again.

551
00:40:50,497 --> 00:40:53,167
I need to steal the spirit keys somehow.

552
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:19,406
- Senior?
- Why are you here alone?

553
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:24,276
You don’t need to tell me why.

554
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,530
You’re here to meet Yu Si Feng, right?

555
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,159
I just wanted to clarify things with him.

556
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,439
You saw his true form, the
12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird personally.

557
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,100
He had deceived you for so long,

558
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,039
yet you still wanted to
clarify things with him?

559
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,599
Senior.

560
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,864
Si Feng...

561
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,496
Although he’s a demon,
he has never hurt anyone.

562
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:45,063
I believe in him.

563
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:48,958
You knew that he’s a demon,
yet you’re still trying to defend him?

564
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,308
Xuan Ji, when will you stop
being so naive?

565
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,439
Do you think he’s really in the
dark about Lize Palace’s scheme?

566
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,938
- Si Feng is...
- Enough!

567
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,359
I didn’t expect you to not know
what’s good or evil.

568
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,490
You even ignored the basic rules
of being a cultivator!

569
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:06,315
And you came to meet that demon in secret.

570
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,583
Xuan Ji.

571
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:10,006
I’m too disappointed in you.

572
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,798
Fine.

573
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:18,032
I’ll sever your ties with him now.

574
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,576
Senior, I’m sorry for this.

575
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,999
Xuan Ji.

576
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,630
You actually attacked me
because of a demon.

577
00:42:41,149 --> 00:42:42,879
Senior, I’m sorry.

578
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,570
I don’t want to do this.
Please don’t force me.

579
00:42:45,571 --> 00:42:46,838
Fine.

580
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,710
Since you’ve brought out
your Ninth Heaven Fire,

581
00:42:50,273 --> 00:42:52,103
there’s no way for me to defeat you.

582
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,022
Just forget it.

583
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,587
But I didn’t expect you

584
00:42:57,304 --> 00:43:01,617
to use the God of War’s
power just to protect a demon.

585
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,428
Ling Long’s reputation was ruined
because of a demon.

586
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:09,179
And she almost committed suicide
because of it.

587
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,675
Yet you’re here, fighting against me
because of a demon.

588
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:13,845
Committed suicide?

589
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,599
What’s going on?

590
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,632
Is Ling Long okay? What exactly happened?

591
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:21,423
Although her life is not in danger,

592
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,500
her reputation was ruined.

593
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,977
I’m afraid the trauma in her heart
will never disappear.

594
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,577
Ling Long.

595
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,829
I’ll look for Ling Long right away.

596
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,511
Si Feng, wait for me.

597
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,519
Ling Long!

598
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,757
Xuan Ji.

599
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,390
Why are you so silly? Are you trying to
leave both Father and I behind?

600
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,319
I’m sorry.

601
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,066
How could you do such a silly thing
because of a villain like that?

602
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:08,591
What about Father and I?

603
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:10,224
Sixth Senior will be very sad, you know?

604
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:12,410
Xuan Ji, I’ve thought about it.

605
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,279
I won’t do silly things anymore.

606
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,239
I will stay alive and
take my revenge against Wu Tong.

607
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,869
I will make him pay for all
the humiliations I’ve faced.

608
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,820
I’ll avenge you.

609
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:26,875
I won’t let Wu Tong or
anyone from Sky Hall off.

610
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,928
And Si Feng as well.

611
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:34,399
Si Feng is with them.

612
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,846
You mustn’t show him mercy.

613
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:38,784
Ling Long, Si Feng has nothing to do
with Sky Hall.

614
00:44:38,785 --> 00:44:41,639
Why didn’t he return with you
if he was innocent?

615
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,842
He...

616
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,231
It’s because he’s
busy with something.

617
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:48,878
Xuan Ji.

618
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:51,074
Don’t fall for his tricks again.

619
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:53,127
He’s just trying to acquire your trust.

620
00:44:53,128 --> 00:44:54,718
He’s trying to find another chance.

621
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,039
No! Si Feng isn’t a person like that!

622
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,476
He told me that the only thing
he lied to me was his identity.

623
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:03,879
That’s the only thing he lied to me.
I believe in him.

624
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,724
Xuan Ji, he’s a demon.

625
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:11,158
Even if he’s not a part of Sky Hall,
you two won’t end well together.

626
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,859
I’m your sister. You should listen to me.

627
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,190
The people will forsake

628
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,510
those who affiliate
themselves with demons.

629
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,319
I’ve embarrassed Father and Shaoyang Sect.

630
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,413
You mustn’t disappoint Father anymore.

631
00:45:29,414 --> 00:45:31,004
You’re the only one
he could depend on now.

632
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,916
You mustn’t disappoint him.
You mustn’t follow my steps.

633
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,799
I won’t go anywhere.

634
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,519
I’ll stay here and accompany you.

635
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,919
I’ll stay here. I won’t meet Si Feng.

636
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,527
If Si Feng did commit
those atrocious deeds,

637
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:47,957
I will never let him off.

638
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,183
But

639
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,910
if he’s innocent,

640
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:56,099
please give him
another chance, okay?
