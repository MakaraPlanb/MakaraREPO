00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,279
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,600
<i>EPISODE 50</i>

3
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,359
Where’s the Black Feather?

4
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,839
What’s going on?

5
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,319
Did someone take it?

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,960
Impossible, no one knows I was here.

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,440
Wu Zhi Qi may have destroyed this place,

8
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,880
but the demonic aura is still strong.

9
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Perhaps it has already been consumed.

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,800
He deserved it, I guess.

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,320
Silver Snake, what’s wrong?

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Here, cover your nose.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,119
The demonic aura here
is still too much for you.

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,960
Let’s leave now,
I’ll search the feather for you.

15
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,079
This place is so big.

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,839
We won’t be able to search
everywhere in a day or two.

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,239
I’m staying here to search for it.

18
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,319
Fine, but promise me this.

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,524
You must not stay here long.

20
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,039
You must leave here every seven minutes.

21
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,880
After all, you need to stay alive
to meet Si Feng, right?

22
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Flying Snake, ask them.

23
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,800
Hello, sorry for disturbing.

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
- Have you seen him before?
- No.

25
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,839
Flying Snake.

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,200
Do you see a black crow tailing us?

27
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,994
What crow? Can we eat it?

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
You...

29
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
Where is the God of War now?

30
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,679
Your Highness.

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,759
The God of War is in the mortal world,

32
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,920
searching for the
Rose Gold Bird, Yu Si Feng.

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,360
She’s still entangled with that demon.

34
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,160
Looks like I have
no more need to keep her.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,440
Pass my order.

36
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,720
All celestial soldiers and knights

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,719
shall bring the God of War
and her associates here

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,880
once they are seen.

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,560
Rebels will be prosecuted!

40
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:02,359
Do not spare Flying Snake as well.

41
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,719
Your Highness.

42
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,919
As far as I’m concerned,

43
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,519
Flying Snake was forcibly
captured by the God of War.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,799
He didn’t want to do this.

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,439
He was forced.

46
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,759
Please investigate this.

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,840
I shall hear no more.

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Four Mythical Beasts.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,399
Proceed to the mortal world now

50
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,160
to arrest the God of War
and her associates.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
Yes, Your Highness.

52
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,239
We’ve been searching for ages,
and still no trace of him.

53
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,844
If it weren’t for us trying
not to alarm the heavens,

54
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:39,639
I’d have summoned the Lord of Earth
and get our answers.

55
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Wu Zhi Qi gave us the Perfect Fruit
so we can mask our presence.

56
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,200
Will the heavens
really give us trouble?

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,879
What’s with you and your curiosity?

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,280
Why so many questions?

59
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,199
But when I was destroying
the Jade Cup in the secret ground,

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,280
I think I heard the Star of Mosha
talking with King Bailing.

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,285
I think King Bailing must
have done something wrong.

62
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,364
Don’t spout nonsense.

63
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:05,685
Out of all the deities,
I respect King Bailing the most.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,319
Anyway, Wu Zhi Qi
gave you the Perfect Fruit,

65
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,524
so the heavens won’t find you.

66
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:11,679
Stop thinking so much.

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,519
When I find Si Feng,
let’s live in seclusion.

68
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,040
No mortal or deity will ever find us.

69
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,800
There’s a village there.

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,239
I’m hungry.

71
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,440
Let’s buy something to eat.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,248
- Hot buns!
- Fresh desserts!

73
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:35,940
Want a bun, sir?

74
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:37,501
Delicious desserts on sale!

75
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,559
Hot buns!

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,480
Want some desserts, sir?
Please take a look.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
Money, now.

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,040
Choose whatever you like, sir.

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,079
Where’s the money?

80
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,680
All your food binging has made us broke.

81
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,120
What now, then?

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,799
Listen up.

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,679
I can’t afford to go hungry.

84
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
Go figure.

85
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,591
<i>DEMON SLAYERS NEEDED IN INN</i>

86
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:19,650
<i>Successful demon slayers
will be rewarded handsomely.</i>

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Looks like it’s time to earn some money.

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,519
Sir, do you know where this inn is?

89
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,959
Miss, don’t risk your life.

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,679
That inn has been closed
for about a week now.

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,480
Anyone who tried to kill
the demon has never returned.

92
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,159
You look young and frail.

93
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,920
You sure you’re up for it?

94
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,880
Just tell me where the inn is.

95
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,578
<i>DEMON SLAYERS NEEDED</i>

96
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,719
Didn’t you see the notice?

97
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
We’re not open for business.

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,599
I’m here to kill the demon.

99
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,640
Kill the demon?

100
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,679
Stop joking.

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,359
You think it’s a game?

102
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Go away.

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,279
I said, we’re here to kill the demon.

104
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Let’s go in and see.

105
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,479
Ah Lan, what are you doing?

106
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,359
Didn’t I tell you not to open the door?

107
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,239
Hello, we saw your notice.

108
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,400
We’re here to kill the demon.

109
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,119
You?

110
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,399
Can you?

111
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,639
Don’t worry, we’ve killed
many on our way here.

112
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,439
Let us try, and you’ll see.

113
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Anyway, you can pay us
after we kill the demon.

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,000
If you can really kill the demon,
we’ll appreciate it very much.

115
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,359
Boss, didn’t we agree to wait
for Mister Yi to kill the demon?

116
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,039
He’s foraging for herbs
at the mountains now.

117
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,559
Can’t you wait for him?

118
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,439
Mister Yi’s
whereabouts are mysterious.

119
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,559
Who knows when he’ll be back?

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,959
Besides, we can’t just close our inn

121
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,319
while waiting for him to come back.

122
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,319
We’ve been closed for business
for so many days.

123
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,960
We’re going broke at this rate.

124
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,199
But I’ve already left a memo
for Mister Yi.

125
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,079
He’ll help us when he’s back.

126
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,799
That’s enough.

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,999
I know you’re anticipating his return.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,839
But no one knows if that
mysterious man will ever turn up.

129
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,040
Why don’t we let the masters here
take a look first?

130
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,279
Didn’t you say the inn is closed?

131
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,439
Why is there a room still alight?

132
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,639
Hush, that’s the room with the demon.

133
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,719
Whenever the sun sets every day,

134
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,039
you can see candlelight from the room.

135
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,599
You can even hear someone cry
when you get near.

136
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,439
I didn’t know better back then,
so I let our guests stay there.

137
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,679
Then, every guest who had
stayed in the room all disappeared.

138
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,359
Only then did I know
there’s something fishy inside.

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,959
Actually, we have a resident
demon slayer here named Mister Yi.

140
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,359
But only a few has ever
managed to contact him.

141
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,439
That’s why we put up that notice
to hire a demon slayer.

142
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,399
Boss, Mister Yi
will be back someday.

143
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,840
Let’s not risk this young lady’s life.

144
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,760
Miss, please don’t risk your life there.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,519
It does reek of demons there.

146
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,079
And pretty strong, too.

147
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,399
Looks like it’s highly trained.

148
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Flying Snake.

149
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,079
Do you even need me
to handle that puny demon?

150
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,079
Who’s that, Ah Xiang, Ah Ling, Ah Lan!

151
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,239
Come, serve me tea.

152
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
I’m feeling so thirsty now.

153
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,960
What’s with you?
You haven’t even done anything yet.

154
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,240
It’ll be done before your tea goes cold.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,239
Aren’t you following her?

156
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
Tea, please, hurry up.

157
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
You...

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,039
The lights are out, they’re out!

159
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,440
Is she doing fine?

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,279
Oh dear, that young lady
is going to get killed!

161
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,999
Please take a look!

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,079
Is my tea done?

163
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Faster!

164
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,479
Did that demon eat the young lady?

165
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,359
We still don’t know who’s eating whom.

166
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
I’m starving.

167
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,760
Miss, are you okay?

168
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,519
Here you go.

169
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,560
A weasel spirit.

170
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,679
Weasel?

171
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,479
It said you splashed it
with hot oil three months ago.

172
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,039
That’s why it’s back for revenge.

173
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,959
But we can’t spare it
since it killed so many people.

174
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,165
Three months ago, I did see
an animal eating our chickens,

175
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,199
so I splashed hot oil on it.

176
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,560
So this is it.

177
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,040
You two look so young,

178
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,639
but you’re rather formidable.

179
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,840
Thank you so much.

180
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,679
Ma’am, do you want the weasel’s carcass?

181
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,799
No, no.

182
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,999
You like eating this, don’t you?

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,120
You can grill it.

184
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,120
If you don’t mind, please
stay here for the night.

185
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:21,879
Of course we don’t.

186
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,200
Here, help me grill this.

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,680
By the way, ma’am,
I have a favor to ask.

188
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,679
You’ve been staying here
for so many years.

189
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,040
Have you seen anyone like this?

190
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,919
Well, let me see.

191
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,145
He does look familiar.

192
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:42,199
Really?

193
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,840
But I’ve had so many guests in my inn.

194
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,160
I can’t really remember.

195
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,959
Si Feng.

196
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
Where are you?

197
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,799
I say, Liu Yi Huan is dubious.

198
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,759
We’ve already searched all over
the southern region for a whole year,

199
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,719
but there’s still no sign of him.

200
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,519
Could it be that he doesn’t
want you to find Si Feng,

201
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,560
so he pointed us to the wrong direction?

202
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
No.

203
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,160
That’s not how Brother Liu is.

204
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,200
Perhaps for the past year,

205
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,559
Si Feng has been migrating around.

206
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Fine.

207
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,280
Anyway, we’re about to reach
the southernmost region.

208
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,120
So where should we go next?

209
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,720
I heard Si Feng say that

210
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,720
the Rose Gold Birds
used to live in the west.

211
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,760
Let’s head west tomorrow.

212
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:36,159
Mister Yi.

213
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,200
You’re finally here.

214
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,560
I saw your memo.

215
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Well?

216
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,519
Did someone slay the demon?

217
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,759
Yes.

218
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,639
But it’s just a random girl from nowhere.

219
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,319
We’re still unsure about her skills.

220
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,839
Why don’t you take a look,
Mister Yi?

221
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,039
No need.

222
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,719
The demon is gone.

223
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
Now that you’re finally here,
I can’t make you come for nothing.

224
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,680
Why don’t you stay here for dinner?

225
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
No need.

226
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Mister Yi!

227
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Flying Snake.

228
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,280
Let’s buy some rations for our journey.

229
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,800
What do you want to eat?

230
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,000
Anything delicious will do.

231
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,239
It’s Sanqing tea.

232
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,079
Sanqing tea? What’s that?

233
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,839
It’s made from morning dew,
pine nuts and Buddha’s hands.

234
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,719
Si Feng drinks that every day.

235
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,600
Si Feng is here!

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Si Feng!

237
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Si Feng!

238
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Si Feng!

239
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Si Feng!

240
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,759
Si Feng!

241
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,920
Si Feng!

242
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Si Feng!

243
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:31,713
Si Feng!

244
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Si Feng!

245
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,239
Si Feng!

246
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Si Feng!

247
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,239
Si Feng!

248
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Si Feng!

249
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Si Feng!

250
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
Si Feng, Si Feng!

251
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,159
Si Feng!

252
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Who are you?

253
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,079
I just flew up to get a good view.

254
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,560
I think you’re mistaken.

255
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,599
Si Feng isn’t here.

256
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,039
Impossible, I’m sure I saw Si Feng.

257
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,296
I can’t be wrong.

258
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:20,319
I’m not leaving.

259
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,000
I’m staying here to look for Si Feng.

260
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,719
Masters.

261
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,159
Can you pay a visit to Huangdi Town?

262
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,999
Our livestock has been dying mysteriously.

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,880
I’m afraid it’s the work of the demons.

264
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,160
We’ll go there in a few days’ time.

265
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,600
How much money do you need?

266
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,039
Forget about money.

267
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,280
We just want to look for someone.

268
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,999
Please ask the townsfolk
if they have seen this man.

269
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I’ll ask them.

270
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,599
Masters, please take a look at my place.

271
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,319
I think it’s haunted.

272
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,520
What’s with you?

273
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,479
I thought you’d ask Mister Yi
for help when it comes to demons.

274
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,159
Why are you asking them for help?

275
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,559
Have you forgotten
all about Mister Yi?

276
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,326
We’d love to ask him for help too,
but he’s so mysterious and elusive.

277
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:23,719
Whenever we need his help,

278
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,279
we can only leave a letter
in the town’s mailbox,

279
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,839
and we still won’t get any news from him.

280
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,359
We just couldn’t find him.

281
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,679
That’s right.

282
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,360
We can’t help it.

283
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,799
When are you two leaving?

284
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,399
You’ve been here for over a month.

285
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,599
Aren’t you looking for someone?

286
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,840
You should get moving.

287
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,244
What’s wrong?

288
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:50,879
Do you think that we’re
stealing your crush’s business?

289
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,359
You’re just a bunch of amateurs.

290
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,079
When Mister Yi is back,
you’ll go out of business.

291
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,079
Ah Lan, don’t argue with our guests.

292
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,120
My osmanthus wine is about to mature.

293
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,000
Go give a jar to Mister Yi.

294
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Sure.

295
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,959
You look so happy at
the mention of Mister Yi.

296
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,280
Your crush only appears
once in a blue moon.

297
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,360
Is he a nutcase like they say?

298
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,559
None of your business.

299
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,079
He’s a fine example of a man.

300
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,159
He’s principled, stern and capable.

301
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,159
Besides, he may be cold towards everyone,

302
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,279
but maybe not so towards his wife.

303
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
He’s my type.

304
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,399
Does he have a wife?

305
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,040
No, but he will get one soon.

306
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,080
Are you talking about yourself?

307
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,959
Actually, he does fancy me a bit.

308
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,319
I fancy him too.

309
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,079
If he’s willing to marry me,
of course I’ll be his wife.

310
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,480
I can even marry him tomorrow.

311
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,479
That’s why I’m making this clear.

312
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,279
Don’t you take advantage
of Mister Yi.

313
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,920
Otherwise, I won’t let you off.

314
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,600
She said she won’t let us off.

315
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
This girl...

316
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,160
Sorry for making you witness a farce.

317
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,839
How is that a farce?

318
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,320
I’m envious of her, in fact.

319
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,839
Si Feng.

320
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,200
What color is this?

321
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,239
It’s a light-blue hydrangea.

322
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,159
So this is blue.

323
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,599
How pretty.

324
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,759
I love blue the most.

325
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,440
So you’ve decided to like blue.

326
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
I’ve always liked it.

327
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,640
What are you doing here?

328
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,199
Ah Lan, here’s a question.

329
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,080
Is that the road to
Old Li’s house in Huangdi Town?

330
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,520
Why should I tell you?

331
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,999
Fine, you don’t have to tell me.

332
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,319
I’ll just follow you.

333
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,560
I know you’re looking for Mister Yi.

334
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:01,912
It’s that way, just follow the path down.

335
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,439
Does Mister Yi live nearby?

336
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,240
Why are you looking for his house?

337
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,439
You know we’ve been searching for someone.

338
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,080
I want to see if Mister Yi
might know anything.

339
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:17,159
No need, he hates strangers.

340
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,399
Besides, all he does
is foraging for herbs.

341
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,719
He doesn’t like socializing.

342
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
He won’t know
the person you’re looking for.

343
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
You should go now.

344
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Move!

345
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Mister Yi.

346
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Mister Yi.

347
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:02,745
I’ve brought you some wine.

348
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,559
No rewards come without merit.

349
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,000
How can I take your wine for free?

350
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,919
What merit? I don’t care.

351
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,520
I just want to give you some wine.

352
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,719
Take it back.

353
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,959
No.

354
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,839
You’ve taught me so much about
medicine and spells.

355
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,559
I’ve never paid you.

356
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,800
Take this wine as payment, please?

357
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,359
Mister Yi, listen.

358
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
Lately, there are two
wandering cultivators in town.

359
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,839
They’re annoying.

360
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,279
They just won’t leave now,

361
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,559
and everyone’s been
seeking their help instead of yours.

362
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,519
They’re stealing your business.

363
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,279
You should show them a thing or two.

364
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,880
Let them know you came here first.

365
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,640
Since someone is doing my business,

366
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,199
that saves me a lot of trouble.

367
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,960
What if you go out of business?

368
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,999
It’s fine.

369
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,119
I’m satisfied with a simple life.

370
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,240
Let them be.

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,240
It’s true that you can
fend for yourself now,

372
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:10,153
but what if you have
a family in the future?

373
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,759
It’s fine, though.

374
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,920
Even if you don’t have a penny
to your name, I’ll take care of you.

375
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,079
Mister Yi!

376
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,639
I’ve finally found you.

377
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,559
Uncle, what brought you here?

378
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,200
I’ve heard you mention about this place.

379
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,359
This is my uncle.

380
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,000
He lives at the neighboring
Huanglong Town.

381
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,159
Mister Yi, our town is in trouble.

382
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,120
I’m here to ask for your help.

383
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,119
This is what happened.

384
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,159
Lately, every wedding in town
will become a funeral the day after.

385
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,519
Newlyweds have been dying
from mysterious circumstances.

386
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,360
I wonder what demon
has been targeting newlyweds.

387
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,239
Last night, another couple died.

388
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,159
Now, my son is over 30 years
old, and he’s finally found a wife,

389
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,279
but we have to delay his wedding.

390
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,119
If he doesn’t get married soon,
the bride’s family is going to cancel it.

391
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,879
That’s why we’re asking for
your help, Mister Yi.

392
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,520
Please slay the demon
for us, Mister Yi.

393
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,640
There are two new demon slayers
in Xigu Town lately.

394
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,720
Since they’re a man and a woman,
they can act as the newlyweds.

395
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,720
They’re more suitable for this job.

396
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,840
You should look for them.

397
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,759
It’s not that I don’t trust them,

398
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,959
but we’ve hired many
demon slayers and monks,

399
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,199
and they’re all kidnapped
by the demon too.

400
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,959
None of them have returned yet.

401
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
The demon is too strong.

402
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,199
Mister Yi, take me along.

403
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,199
We can act as newlyweds too.

404
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,360
Since you’ve been teaching me,
I can help you too.

405
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,439
No, this demon is too vicious.

406
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,120
You’re no match for him.

407
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,719
That demon is so strong, and
those cultivators are just amateurs.

408
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,959
If we let them go,
they might just die.

409
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,119
That’s right, Mister Yi.

410
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,439
Please help us.

411
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,040
Our town’s prospective couples
are all counting on you.

412
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,440
If that’s the case, I shall go there.

413
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,400
Sir, hold the wedding as planned.

414
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,199
Ah Lan, sorry to bother you.

415
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,800
I need you to act as my bride tomorrow.

416
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,159
It’s not a bother.

417
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,560
I don’t mind even if it’s for real.

418
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
I have nothing valuable on me.

419
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,320
Please take this

420
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,120
to buy a pair of wedding attire.

421
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,480
You can use the rest for the banquet.

422
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,960
He approached me instead of someone else.

423
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,559
And he gave me such
a huge luminous pearl.

424
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,040
That means he does fancy me, right?

425
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,479
Once we go through the ceremony,

426
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,799
I’ll get my uncle to propose for real.

427
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,479
I’m sure Mister Yi won’t reject.

428
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Ah Lan!

429
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,879
Aren’t you going to serve the guests?

430
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,400
What are you grinning at?

431
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,359
Boss, I’m marrying Mister Yi!

432
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,479
What nonsense is that?

433
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,079
It’s true, I’m going to be
his bride tomorrow.

434
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,760
By then, I’ll be the envy of the town.

435
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:30,606
I don’t think you’re sick.

436
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,992
Miss Ah Lan, here are your wedding robes.

437
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,964
- Put them here.
- Sure.

438
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:37,009
Boss, I’m taking two-day off.

439
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,490
I’m going to get married.
I won’t be back for the next two days.

440
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,999
Please keep this luminous pearl for me.

441
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,560
Mister Yi gave me this
as a token of our love.

442
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,720
I’m going to get married.

443
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,124
Ah Lan!

444
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,325
What’s wrong with that stupid girl?

445
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,639
What now?

446
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,600
No one has seen Si Feng.

447
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,364
I say, you must be mistaken.

448
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:07,999
I’m sure he wasn’t Si Feng.

449
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,550
Impossible, I can’t be wrong.

450
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:10,671
He is Si Feng.

451
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,760
Miss Chu.

452
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,359
I know you’re knowledgeable.

453
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,559
Can you help me and see
if this thing is worth much?

454
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,200
How much money can I get from it?

455
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
Isn’t this a luminous pearl
from Lize Palace?

456
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:30,169
Look carefully.

457
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,799
I’ve seen this before.
I saw it on Si Feng.

458
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,640
Ma’am, where did you get this?

459
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,239
Mister Yi gave Ah Lan this
as a token of their love.

460
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,359
- Well, is it worth much?
- Mister Yi?

461
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,520
Or was Ah Lan scammed?

462
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,519
Where are they?

463
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,399
Ah Lan was rambling about
marrying Mister Yi.

464
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,159
I don’t know what’s going on too.

465
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,119
I heard that man is sickly.

466
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,240
I don’t know what she sees in him too.

467
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
Here comes the couple!

468
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,280
Bow to the heaven and earth.

469
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:45,559
Si Feng.

470
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,040
We’ve finally found him here.

471
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,800
What a surprise.

472
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,680
Bow to your elders.

473
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,000
Bow down.

474
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,040
Bow to each other.

475
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
I sense demons.

476
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,920
What are you doing here?

477
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,741
We saw a demon here,
so we were worried and came.

478
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:51,599
You mindless wench.

479
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,199
Did we ask for your help?

480
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,960
Do you know you’ve ruined my wedding?

481
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,920
So, you’re Mister Yi.

482
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:09,976
Why are you looking for Mister Yi?

483
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,239
Si Feng.

484
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,760
We’ve finally found you
after searching everywhere.

485
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,218
Thank goodness you’re here.

486
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:19,280
Otherwise, we’d still be searching.

487
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
You’ve lost weight.

488
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,296
No wonder you look
different from the portrait.

489
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,560
Is there anything you need, miss?

490
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,120
What are you talking about?

491
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,279
Who is Si Feng?

492
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,160
Mister Yi, do you know them?

493
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,359
I have never met them.

494
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,800
I’m afraid you’re mistaken.

495
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,599
Little Phoenix.

496
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,239
She’s Xuan Ji!

497
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,680
Should I know this name?

498
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,320
Si Feng, you...

499
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,144
Don’t you remember me?

500
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:13,816
I came late, after all.

501
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,400
Have you eaten the Heartless Pill

502
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,080
and forgot all about us?

503
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Then...

504
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,239
Look at this.

505
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,199
This...

506
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,279
You made this lock puzzle.

507
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,959
I’ve read your note inside.

508
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,311
I know you didn’t mean
to hide the truth from me.

509
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,639
I was wrong to blame you.

510
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,679
And this bell.

511
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,879
We contacted each other
with this, Si Feng.

512
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,559
Si Feng, look.

513
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,199
Don’t you remember?

514
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,279
Don’t you remember one single bit?

515
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,400
Si Feng.

516
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
If my guess is correct,

517
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,080
you’re the new demon slayers, are you not?

518
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,360
I don’t know why you’re
showing me these knick-knacks

519
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,080
while rambling nonsense on my wedding.

520
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,359
I’m sure you can see
I’m getting married tonight.

521
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
I’d like to request you two

522
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,520
to not interfere in our ceremony.

523
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:16,504
If we had any history, miss,

524
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,720
I’d like to tell you this.

525
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,760
All is in the past.

526
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
I hope you will not take them to heart.

527
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,679
If you wish to stay for the banquet...

528
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,840
Auntie, please take them to their seats.

529
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
If you don’t,

530
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,800
please leave.

531
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,640
Si Feng, you’re crazy!

532
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,199
You’ve been through so many
hardships for this stinky woman.

533
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,239
How can you forget her?

534
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,360
And you’re marrying another woman now.

535
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:53,999
Are you done yet?

536
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,879
I know you want to make a quick buck here.

537
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,959
That’s fine.

538
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,119
But if you disturb
our wedding because of this,

539
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,039
don’t you think you’re too mean?

540
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,439
What do you know?

541
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,599
How long have you known him?

542
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,239
He’s known stinky woman
for ten lives, and you?

543
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,919
Ten lives?

544
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,679
More like ten lice.

545
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,400
What are you talking about?

546
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,639
I don’t care what you say.

547
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,279
I only care about this life.

548
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,519
In this life,
Mister Yi belongs to me.

549
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Right?

550
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,599
Uncle, the auspicious hour
is coming, right?

551
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,505
That’s right, you should go now.

552
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:49,866
Don’t miss the auspicious hour.

553
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,279
Yes, go now.

554
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,879
Fine, Si Feng.

555
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,480
Let’s fight,
and you’ll remember everything!

556
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:58,993
Stop that, Flying Snake.

557
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:03,952
Actually,

558
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,824
if you’ve really taken the Heartless Pill,

559
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:11,040
at least you will be safe.

560
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,559
I wanted to find you

561
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,080
to stay by your side
and ask for your forgiveness.

562
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
But...

563
00:34:19,912 --> 00:34:23,760
If you have found someone
you love, and you’re happy now,

564
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:25,560
then I’m satisfied.

565
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:33,359
Yes.

566
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,120
I am happy now.

567
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:38,759
We’re running out of time.

568
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,880
Please exchange your gifts now,
dear newlyweds.

569
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,559
So, Si Feng.

570
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,439
There are so many colors in this world.

571
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,000
Which color looks best?

572
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,119
It’s red.

573
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,440
That’s because a girl looks the prettiest

574
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,360
when she wears her red bridal robe.

575
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
You just have to know that

576
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,240
only those who anticipate for love

577
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,320
can remove this mask.

578
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,160
You have removed it.

579
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
I know

580
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,200
you and me

581
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,720
are in the same wavelength now.

582
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,760
When we leave here,

583
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,040
we’ll return to Lize Palace.

584
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,440
We’ll get wedded in front of my master.

585
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,440
Enter the bridal chamber.

586
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Stinky woman!

587
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:25,199
Stinky woman!

588
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,119
I thought the worst scenario
was him forgetting you.

589
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,655
No, listen to me.

590
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:31,500
We’ve finally found him
after going through so much.

591
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:33,381
We can’t let this rest!

592
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:34,952
Stinky woman.

593
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,120
Stinky woman, say something!

594
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:44,759
This is it. I’m going to knock him out
and bring him here!

595
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,280
Let’s see if he’d still forget you!

596
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:50,631
Say, you’re the God of War after all.

597
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:52,236
Can’t you show him what you’re made of?

598
00:36:52,237 --> 00:36:54,597
Who cares, you can just kidnap him first!

599
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,679
I was wrong.

600
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,764
I hurt him again and again.

601
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:02,960
I thought that no matter
what I do, wherever I am,

602
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,920
Si Feng would never leave me.

603
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,983
He would always be there, right behind me.

604
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:10,224
But I was late.

605
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,544
He already has a new life.

606
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,040
And I’m not included in it.

607
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,480
He has taken the Heartless Pill,

608
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,960
so he’s free from the Loveless Curse now.

609
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:31,519
At least he’s forgotten about
the hurtful things I’ve done to him.

610
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,804
That’s good too.

611
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:34,125
Brother Liu was right.

612
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
That’s the best ending for him.

613
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:40,000
Stinky woman.

614
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,400
Are you out of your mind?

615
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,364
I came late.

616
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,160
Have you eaten the Heartless Pill

617
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,640
and forgot all about us?

618
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,199
You made this lock puzzle.

619
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,119
I’ve read your note inside.

620
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,479
I know you didn’t mean
to hide the truth from me.

621
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,639
I was wrong to blame you.

622
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,639
And this bell.

623
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,599
We contacted each other
with this, Si Feng.

624
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,079
Si Feng, look.

625
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,520
If my guess is correct,

626
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,959
you’re the new demon slayers, are you not?

627
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,200
I don’t know why you’re
showing me these knick-knacks

628
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,120
while rambling nonsense on my wedding.

629
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:29,448
If we had any history, miss,

630
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,440
I’d like to tell you this.

631
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
All is in the past.

632
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,440
I hope you will not take them to heart.

633
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,720
I’ve hurt Xuan Ji so deeply.

634
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,720
Is she upset too?

635
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:47,768
Xuan Ji.

636
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:50,105
This is the only thing I can do.

637
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:51,794
Mister Yi.

638
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Mister Yi.

639
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Mister Yi!

640
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,600
Or...

641
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,120
Should I call you Si Feng?

642
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,440
Just call me Mister Yi.

643
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,175
They’re your past acquaintances, right?

644
00:39:15,176 --> 00:39:16,176
Yes.

645
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:26,928
Then why did you lie to them
that you’re getting married?

646
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
I have some history

647
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:38,119
that I do not wish to recall or repeat.

648
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,560
That’s why I wanted them
to take my hint and leave.

649
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,440
It has to do with Ms Xuan Ji, right?

650
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,000
Was she your significant other?

651
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,984
I do not wish to talk about it.

652
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
I’m sorry.

653
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,280
I should be the one apologize.

654
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,480
I dragged you into the mess just now.

655
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Thank you for cooperating with me.

656
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,879
It’s fine, Mister Yi.

657
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,280
I’m glad to help you.

658
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,080
Even if...

659
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:21,520
I have to help you
forever, I don’t mind.

660
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,079
Your hands are cold.

661
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,120
Are you fine?

662
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
I’m fine.

663
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,919
All stinky woman did the entire day
was crying and starving herself.

664
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,040
I’m famished too.

665
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,964
Why are there only leftovers here?

666
00:40:57,965 --> 00:40:59,485
This family must be a bunch of misers.

667
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,120
Can’t they prepare something
better for a wedding?

668
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
A wedding?

669
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,319
At least they should have
something better for the newlyweds.

670
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,400
To the bridal chamber!

671
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:17,504
Yu Si Feng isn’t asleep yet.

672
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,120
I think I shouldn’t peek
on their wedding night.

673
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:24,159
Mister Yi.

674
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,079
Why don’t I sleep outside?

675
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,239
It’s cold outside, and you’re frail.

676
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,320
You’ll catch a cold.

677
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,039
Since we’re putting up an act,
we have to make it look real.

678
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,879
Don’t worry, this demon targets newlyweds.

679
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,360
I’m sure he holds a deep grudge
towards newlyweds.

680
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,479
Local tradition dictates
three days of wedding celebration.

681
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,319
I’m sure the demon will be back
within three days.

682
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,919
If you sleep outside, it’ll be
bad if the demon finds us out.

683
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,440
You should spend the night here.

684
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,079
Then, why don’t I sleep on the floor?

685
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,159
You can take the bed.

686
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,360
No need. Rest early.

687
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,585
So, Yu Si Feng,
you’re not really married.

688
00:42:06,586 --> 00:42:09,024
You’re playing me and stinky woman
around like two fools.

689
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,454
- Really? Si Feng’s not married?
- That’s right.

690
00:42:14,455 --> 00:42:17,153
Who’d sleep separately
on their wedding night?

691
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,799
One sleeps on the bed,
and the other on the floor.

692
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,199
They’re treating
each other like strangers.

693
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,919
They’ve fooled us!

694
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,559
I think they’re setting
a trap up for some demon.

695
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,760
I’m going to find him.

696
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:29,879
For what? Steal his business?

697
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,679
- I...
- Please don’t embarrass us, will you?

698
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,719
But what if he did take the pill,
forget about me

699
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,320
and marry that girl for real?

700
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,719
If you ask me,
something fishy is going on.

701
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,079
Think about it,
a lady approaches him and cries.

702
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,919
Even if he doesn’t know her,
he would’ve asked something.

703
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,080
But he didn’t, isn’t that weird?

704
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,960
Well, let me test him,
and we’ll know.

705
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,720
Ah Lan, stay here.
Don’t go anywhere.

706
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,759
This is bad, we followed
the demon all the way here,

707
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,239
but that demon is too strong!

708
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,639
He even kidnapped Xuan Ji!

709
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,360
- Where did they go?
- Over there.

710
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,160
She’s the God of War.

711
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,680
What kind of demon can kidnap her?

712
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,279
Haven’t you forgotten about her?

713
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,959
Why do you remember
that she’s the God of War?

714
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,879
Stinky woman, come out.

715
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,039
Little Phoenix didn’t take
the Heartless Pill after all.

716
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,920
He’s never forgotten about you.

717
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,719
Si Feng!

718
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,880
Si Feng, don’t go.

719
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,400
Do you think this is fun?

720
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,719
Si Feng, don’t go.

721
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,559
I’ve been searching for ages,
and I’ve finally found you.

722
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,320
Since you wouldn’t
acknowledge me, I had to do this.

723
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,359
Don’t be angry.

724
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,239
Come on, stinky woman went through
a lot just to search for you.

725
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,559
You two can talk it
out or even fight it out.

726
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,279
Settle your scores once and for all.

727
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,880
Stop hiding around.

728
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,039
I’ve been looking for you
for the past year.

729
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,800
No one knows where you went.

730
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,880
It was Brother Liu
who said you’re in the south.

731
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Why must you search for me?

732
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,719
Ting Nu told me about the Loveless Curse.

733
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,239
If you didn’t take the Heartless
Pill, then how is your health now?

734
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
Does it hurt?

735
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I’m fine now.

736
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,360
As long as you don’t show yourself to me,

737
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,200
I won’t die.

738
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,879
Si Feng, I know I was wrong.

739
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,560
You can do anything to me,
but don’t leave me without a word.

740
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,640
Xuan Ji.

741
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,839
I’ve never been angry at you.

742
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,080
The past is all but history to me.

743
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,799
I don’t believe that.

744
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,159
If you don’t care about me,

745
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,360
what does the hydrangeas
in front of your house mean?

746
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,839
Hydrangeas are common in Xigu Town.

747
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,960
If that confuses you,
I shall pull them out.

748
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:08,999
Si Feng, I do know I was wrong.

749
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,759
I’ve done you wrong.

750
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,479
I regret not trusting you.

751
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,599
I was a fool, so please don’t go.

752
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,240
If you do feel regret,

753
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:19,592
please do me a favor.

754
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,720
Tell me, I can do anything for you.

755
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,200
Stay away from me as far as possible.

756
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
Mister Yi, help!

757
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,679
Mister Yi, help!

758
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Ah Lan!

759
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,200
Si Feng!

760
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,519
That’s a lot of bridal gowns.

761
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,200
This must be the demon’s nest.

762
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,920
While killing demons is your clan’s
duty, you can’t kill the innocent.

763
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,479
I didn’t mean it.

764
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,880
I couldn’t see clearly.
