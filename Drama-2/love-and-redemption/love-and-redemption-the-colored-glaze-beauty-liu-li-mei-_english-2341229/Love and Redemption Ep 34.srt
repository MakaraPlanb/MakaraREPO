<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:32,642
<i>EPISODE 34</i>

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,039
North Superintendent,

4
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,780
that person released
Zhong Min Yan and Ruo Yu.

5
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,260
What happened to you?

6
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:52,611
Who asked you to
change your appearance?

7
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,649
Brother Tong,

8
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,115
you said you’ll like me
no matter what I look like.

9
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:00,039
This is my original look.

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,870
Brother Tong, I look good, don’t I?

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,949
What I want is Ling Long!

12
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,340
Where is my Ling Long?

13
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,918
I...

14
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,709
I just didn’t want to
live with another person’s appearance.

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,620
I’ve returned
her primordial spirit to them.

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,147
How dare you steal my Soul Bell!

17
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,268
I just wanted to become myself.

18
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,029
I just wanted you to like the original me.

19
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,556
Brother Tong,

20
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:31,427
you should stop thinking about her.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,937
Although my look had
changed, I’m still me!

22
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,808
How dare you touch
Ling Long’s primordial spirit!

23
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:40,017
And you even released those two fellows!

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,110
You’re digging your own grave!

25
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,299
How dare you hit me!

26
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,039
So what if I did?

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,590
Kill me if you dare!

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,650
You...

29
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:02,241
Why are you still upset?

30
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,679
You weren’t like this in the past.

31
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,447
You told me to get angry at you
if you’re upset.

32
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:10,808
You’ll be happy after I scold you.

33
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,304
I did say that before.

34
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,175
But that is only applicable to Ling Long!

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,830
Since you’re not Ling Long anymore,

36
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,273
there’s no point in keeping you here.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,510
Brother Tong!

38
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,465
Chu Ling Long,

39
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,710
you’re mine.

40
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,350
I will bring you back no matter what!

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,664
Report!

42
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,070
My lord, the Flying Dragon Seal
and the spirit keys are missing!

43
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,917
The Flying Dragon Seal?

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,592
Shaoyang Sect doesn’t know that
I have that seal with me.

45
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:52,023
I’m sure Zhong Min Yan isn’t the culprit.

46
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,017
Who’s the culprit then?

47
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:57,917
This is bad!

48
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,240
North Superintendent,

49
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,991
where are you going in such a hurry?

50
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,625
Didn’t you ask me to come
and take the Flying Dragon Seal?

51
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:21,909
Here I am.

52
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,507
Hao Chen, you just
came out of your retreat.

53
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,819
You should rest more.

54
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,626
You don’t need to rush here.

55
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:31,909
Dianjinggu Sect will hold
the next Flower Session soon.

56
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,759
I don’t dare to delay this.

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,639
Sect Leader, did you find any clues
around Mount Buzhou?

58
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,248
My spirit beast, Hong Luan,
searched the area.

59
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:42,759
And it finally found this.

60
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,089
Indeed.

61
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,713
This piece from my Demon Whip,

62
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:54,183
it fell off when I fought
with that demon back then.

63
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:55,959
What do you mean?

64
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,965
No other disciples were around
when my Demon Whip broke.

65
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:01,719
Only the elders and sect leaders
of the four sects were around.

66
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,952
So, one of them
must be the culprit.

67
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:09,039
So, the demon who
had fought with me

68
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,359
was one of the elders or sect leaders.

69
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,150
That means there’s a spy
from Sky Hall among us.

70
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,839
How should we identify who’s the spy then?

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,253
Sect Leader, don’t worry.

72
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:24,884
I will surely think of a way.

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,879
Sect Leader, Xuan Ji has returned.

74
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,326
She even brought Sixth...
She brought Zhong Min Yan as well.

75
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,942
Sixth Senior, don’t worry.

76
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:41,639
I’ve sent Flying Snake to find out
where Ruo Yu is.

77
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,478
As for Father, just try to
explain everything to him.

78
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,185
Si Feng and I will help you.

79
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:47,389
Xuan Ji!

80
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,999
Why did you bring him back?

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,186
Father.

82
00:06:58,374 --> 00:06:59,549
Master.

83
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,679
I don’t have
a traitorous disciple like you!

84
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,549
Today, I’ll get rid of
the evildoers in Shaoyang Sect!

85
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,180
Father, Sixth Senior
has bitter reasons for that.

86
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:10,149
We only brought back
half of Ling Long’s primordial spirit.

87
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,479
Sixth Senior joined Sky Hall

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,959
because he wanted to retrieve
the other half of her primordial spirit.

89
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,025
Father, he didn’t betray us.

90
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:18,284
What did you say?

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,221
Master.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,310
I know I’ve committed a grave mistake.

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,398
I will never be forgiven.

94
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,909
You can punish me

95
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:30,081
however you want.

96
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,210
But Master,

97
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,749
please save Ling Long for now.

98
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,479
Sect Leader Chu,

99
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,639
Xuan Ji isn’t saying that
because she wants to defend him.

100
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,389
She’s telling the truth.

101
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,999
Ling Long’s primordial spirit
has left her body for too long.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,087
If we don’t return it to her now,
her life will be in danger.

103
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:52,038
Sect Leader Chu, please save Ling Long.

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,113
Sect Leader!

105
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,270
- No! I’m Ling Long!
- Ling Long!

106
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,173
Ling Long, you’re awake!

107
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:37,284
It’s fine now.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,309
Look at me.

109
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,056
Father.

110
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,590
Aunt Ying Hong.

111
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,953
Am I really home now?

112
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,959
I’m Xuan Ji. We’re in Shaoyang Sect.

113
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,153
You’re home.

114
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,679
In the future,

115
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,150
I won’t let anyone bully you again.

116
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,159
- Xuan Ji.
- In the future, I’ll take care of you.

117
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,590
You’ll be my little sister.
I’ll protect you.

118
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,343
Okay?

119
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,390
I’m home!

120
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,554
You’re home.

121
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,059
My child.

122
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,242
Father!

123
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
- Father!
- It’s fine now.

124
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,104
Good to see you back.

125
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,710
My precious child.

126
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,006
Xuan Ji, where’s Little Six?

127
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,347
Why isn’t he around?

128
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,508
Sixth Senior went to
make some food for you.

129
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,699
- He’ll return soon.
- Yes.

130
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,559
Ling Long, your primordial spirit
had just returned to you.

131
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,759
I’m sure you’re exhausted.

132
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,679
You should rest.

133
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,197
Yes. Rest now.

134
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:10,186
Raise your head.

135
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,958
I was incapable.

136
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,759
I couldn’t accomplish the task
you gave me.

137
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,839
I couldn’t retrieve the spirit keys
and I’ve harmed Second Senior.

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,407
- I’m ashamed to see you.
- What did you say?

139
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:22,598
When did I give you such tasks?

140
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,336
Master,

141
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,823
didn’t you tell me
to become a spy in Sky Hall

142
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:31,134
and try to retrieve her primordial spirit
and the spirit keys?

143
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,518
What a load of nonsense!

144
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,074
Even until now,
you’re trying to find excuses

145
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,665
for the crimes that you had committed?

146
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,760
Impossible.

147
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,075
Impossible!

148
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,719
Master, you assigned
the tasks to me in person!

149
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:50,959
Min Yan.

150
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,509
Tell us everything that had happened.
Do not leave out anything.

151
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,839
Yes.

152
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,432
That day, I left Fuyu Island.

153
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,094
I was going to Mount Buzhou.

154
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:01,925
During my night in Qingmu Town,

155
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,346
Master, you suddenly appeared.

156
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,937
You asked me to become a spy in Sky Hall.

157
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,408
And try to retrieve Ling Long’s
primordial spirit and the spirit keys.

158
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:14,112
Are you willing to

159
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,303
do anything it takes to save Ling Long?

160
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,679
Good.

161
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,599
I wasn’t wrong about you.

162
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,119
But not only do you
need to save Ling Long,

163
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,039
you need to complete
an important task as well.

164
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,106
I want you to become a spy in Sky Hall.

165
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:35,764
Try to retrieve the spirit keys
while you’re there.

166
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,274
Master, please tell me
how to retrieve them.

167
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:43,346
Pretend to surrender to them
while you’re there.

168
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:45,879
And prove that you’re loyal to them.

169
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,354
Only by doing so, you’ll be able to
stay there and retrieve the spirit keys.

170
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:51,959
Hereby, I grant you special permission.

171
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,262
You may sacrifice righteousness

172
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,644
during crucial moments.

173
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,550
You may even sacrifice
your fellow disciples.

174
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,327
Master.

175
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:08,550
Please tell me that
you were the person I saw that night.

176
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,337
No.

177
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:15,248
I wasn’t even there.

178
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,510
And I had never assigned
such tasks to you.

179
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,519
During your night in Qingmu Town,

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,976
Sect Leader and the rest were
trying to find out where you were.

181
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,887
How could he approach you personally?

182
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,190
Min Yan, you’re so gullible.

183
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,881
This can’t be.

184
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,135
This can’t be!

185
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,969
Why is this happening?

186
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,129
Why is this happening to me?

187
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,839
Master.

188
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,959
Master, are you trying to test me?

189
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,479
Are you angry because
I didn’t retrieve the spirit keys?

190
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,690
Or...

191
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,352
Or is it because you still have
some special tasks for me?

192
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:56,024
Master, please tell me.

193
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,199
Please tell me that you’re lying.

194
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,090
- Master.
- On Fuyu Island,

195
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:03,599
Wolf from Sky Hall
disguised himself as Sect Leader Zhu Shi.

196
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,430
Even Xuan Ji, who’s so sensitive
to demons, couldn’t detect him.

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,896
Min Yan, maybe the sect leader
you met that night

198
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,381
was Wolf in disguise.

199
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,080
What have I done?

200
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,607
What have I done?

201
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,509
I actually believed in a demon!

202
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,300
I fell for his trick!

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,582
I’m stupid!

204
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,279
I’m so stupid!

205
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,439
That’s why I fell for his trick!

206
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,719
It’s all because I’m stupid!

207
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,433
- It’s my fault!
- Min Yan, calm down.

208
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,759
Min Yan,

209
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,279
you said that demon
wanted you to retrieve the spirit keys.

210
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,559
Where are the spirit keys?

211
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,910
Spirit keys? I was in possession
of them for a moment.

212
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,718
But the demons had cornered us.

213
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,219
- To protect me, Ruo Yu...
- Ruo Yu?

214
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,319
Ruo Yu from Lize Palace?

215
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,843
Ruo Yu fell off a cliff.

216
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:58,788
I’m afraid the spirit keys

217
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,558
are in the hands of the demons now.

218
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,519
First, you said you possessed them.
Now, you say Ruo Yu fell off a cliff.

219
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,927
It’s all your claim!
How do you prove them?

220
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,079
Senior,

221
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,036
Min Yan has been with us
since he was a child.

222
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:17,383
I believed that
he wouldn’t betray Shaoyang Sect.

223
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:20,116
I’m afraid that he fell
for the demon’s trick.

224
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:23,071
Even if you’re saying the truth,
even if you were

225
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,884
deceived by the demon,

226
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,399
how do you explain Min Jue then?

227
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,840
You grew up with him together!

228
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,631
How dare you murder him!

229
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,199
- Second Senior.
- Don’t look at me with those eyes.

230
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,830
My beloved Ling Long was the one
behind your Second Senior’s death.

231
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,790
Master, I can never be forgiven.

232
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:43,824
Please kill me!

233
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,930
Do you think death
can clear your name?

234
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,281
Senior, Min Yan did
commit a grave mistake.

235
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,222
But he had saved Ling Long as well.

236
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,355
- This...
- The Shaoyang Sect will never

237
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,151
forgive disciples who kill their seniors!

238
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:02,119
We’ll lock him up for now.

239
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,995
After this, I’ll hold
the general meeting of Shaoyang.

240
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,496
We’ll put him through an open trial!

241
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,990
<i>LIZE PALACE</i>

242
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,353
You did excellent in your last mission.

243
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,079
Armies are to be maintained for years
but used on a single day.

244
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,999
I’ve raised you for so long.

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,276
I’ve covered the fact that
you lost your mask as well.

246
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:50,039
Now, this is the time for you to repay me.

247
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,956
Vice Palace Lord,
I’ll risk my life for you.

248
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,990
You don’t need to risk your life.

249
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,190
You’re friends with
Chu Xuan Ji and the rest, right?

250
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:02,506
Continue to be friends with them.

251
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,190
I don’t really understand.

252
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,559
Just stay beside them
and observe their movement.

253
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,070
Report their every move

254
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:15,648
to me.

255
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,350
Yes.

256
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,319
This is an order from our leader.

257
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
You and Zhong Min Yan
are to stay beside Wu Tong.

258
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,959
Besides acquiring the Flying Dragon Seal
and the spirit keys,

259
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,350
you need to kill Yu Si Feng as well.

260
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,510
What? Kill Si Feng?

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,745
But why?

262
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,253
Only a huge shock will
stimulate Chu Xuan Ji

263
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,644
and to awaken the powers within her.

264
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,500
But Yu Si Feng belongs to Lize Palace.

265
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,999
- To kill him...
- Shut up!

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,759
What’s wrong?

267
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,620
Are you trying to disobey

268
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,211
the orders of the Vice Palace Lord?

269
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,477
Don’t forget.

270
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:16,469
He wanted you to mix with them
for them to let down their guard.

271
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,762
Don’t tell me

272
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,989
you treat them as your true friends?

273
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,398
I did so much in order to send you
and Zhong Min Yan into Mount Buzhou.

274
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,368
You didn’t disappoint me indeed.

275
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:38,018
Vice Palace Lord, I’ve accomplished
the task you gave me.

276
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,990
It’s been some time since
the last time I met my sister.

277
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,115
Can I...

278
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:45,995
What are you saying?

279
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,530
You did such a good job.

280
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:52,577
Of course I’ll let you
reunite with your sister.

281
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,234
Thank you, Vice Palace Lord.

282
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,750
You have 15 minutes.

283
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,350
Xue Er!

284
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,837
Brother.

285
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:34,908
Why did you injure your face?

286
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,124
- Does it hurt?
- I’m fine.

287
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,479
Xue Er,

288
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,150
- I bought you a gift.
- It’s nice.

289
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,134
This bracelet, it’s...

290
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,420
A good friend of mine chose it for me.

291
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,494
But I wish he will

292
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,961
never meet a friend like me again.

293
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:58,239
You’ll be free as long as

294
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,857
I accomplish Vice Palace Lord’s tasks.

295
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,870
It’s worth sacrificing everything.

296
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,510
I’ll bring you home soon.

297
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,070
I’ll bring you home.

298
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,853
Senior Hao Chen.

299
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,657
I haven’t got the chance to say this.

300
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:18,028
But thank you for saving me
in Qingmu Town.

301
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,439
You don’t need to thank me.

302
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,759
I wouldn’t have saved you
if Xuan Ji didn’t

303
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,990
risk her life for you.

304
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,479
I wonder how Min Yan is doing?

305
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,910
Senior, please plead with your sect leader
on behalf of Min Yan.

306
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,910
Hero Yu, you don’t need to worry
about our internal affairs.

307
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,025
I know.

308
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:42,416
I shouldn’t interrupt.

309
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,964
But Min Yan is my brother.

310
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,512
Senior, please plead with Sect Leader Chu.

311
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,950
Please beg him to forgive Min Yan
since he had saved Ling Long.

312
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,026
It’s all because

313
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:57,239
he cares too much about Ling Long.

314
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,230
That’s why he was deceived by the demons.

315
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,199
Zhong Min Yan was deceived
because of his love for her.

316
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,119
But this isn’t an excuse for his crimes.

317
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,024
It was precisely because of love
that he was deceived.

318
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,599
That’s why he couldn’t
comprehend the situation clearly.

319
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,031
So,

320
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:17,145
if someone tries to use love
as an excuse to deceive Xuan Ji,

321
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:18,736
I will make sure he pays.

322
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,119
Senior,

323
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,590
why do you always
treat me like your enemy?

324
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,799
Even until now,
you still think that

325
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,630
I have ulterior motives
for loving Xuan Ji?

326
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,239
Shouldn’t I think so?

327
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,077
After Xuan Ji left Xuanyang Peak,

328
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:42,161
you instigated her to find her six senses.
She almost fell for Sky Hall’s ploy.

329
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:44,238
You persuaded her to leave Fuyu Island
without permission.

330
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,528
You brought her to Mount Buzhou.

331
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:47,799
And she almost
lost her life because of that!

332
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,550
I really don’t know what’s your motive
for approaching my junior.

333
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,626
Senior Hao Chen, I heard that

334
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:58,319
you changed from the Heartless Tactics
to the Sentimental Tactics.

335
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,799
But now, you look like

336
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,550
you don’t believe in love at all.

337
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,150
Isn’t this ironic?

338
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,817
Don’t try to be a smart aleck.

339
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,534
I can’t stop you from meeting my junior.

340
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,063
But

341
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:17,493
if I find out that you have
ulterior motives for loving her,

342
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,110
I won’t let you off.

343
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,799
Senior Hao Chen,
something happened in the secret ground!

344
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,707
- What’s wrong?
- The barrier is getting weaker.

345
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,359
And now, there’s
a huge gap in the barrier.

346
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,950
Master has issued an order.
He wants every elder to be there.

347
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,359
I told you already.

348
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,536
I’m the friend of Chu Xuan Ji.

349
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:42,807
Let me in.

350
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,759
This is the rule of Shaoyang Sect!

351
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,799
What rule? My patience is running thin!

352
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,139
Get out of the way!

353
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,750
Hey, where’s the kitchen?

354
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,030
Who are you? Why are you intruding?

355
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,812
Why did you pull out your sword
when I asked you about the kitchen?

356
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:12,639
- You must be crazy.
- Sound the alarm!

357
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,940
Stinky woman!

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,957
How did such a big hole appear?

359
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,057
Much of our powers
have been absorbed by it,

360
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,839
yet it has no effect at all.

361
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,269
Don’t tell me the Heartless Tactics
doesn’t work anymore?

362
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,270
Senior Heng Yang, what should we do?

363
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,521
I’ll set up the Secret Formation.

364
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:54,354
Maybe it can hold on for a short while.

365
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:56,487
But it can’t last for long.

366
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:59,133
If we want a long-term solution,

367
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:02,589
we can only depend on
Xuan Ji and Hao Chen.

368
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,478
You and Hao Chen need to get married.

369
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:07,721
And the two of you need to
practice the Sentimental Tactics together.

370
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:13,898
Only then, the barrier will be stabilized
and we can protect the secret ground.

371
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:16,644
Senior Hao Chen and I? No way!

372
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,755
You and Hao Chen are
destined to be together.

373
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,238
And you two have been together
all your lives.

374
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,364
Why can’t you practice
the Sentimental Tactics

375
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,839
with him?

376
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,519
I’ve explained this to my father already.

377
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,879
Father, I...

378
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,759
What? You’re marrying your senior?

379
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,124
Who are you?

380
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,020
This is my friend, Flying Snake.

381
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:39,743
What’s wrong with you?

382
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:41,740
It’s fine that you forgot
about King Bailing.

383
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:44,320
But why are you abandoning
that great chef?

384
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,831
Is your senior a great chef as well?

385
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,763
I feel like I’ve seen him before.

386
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,559
Outsider, how dare you
invade our secret ground?

387
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,934
Leave now!

388
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,991
Mortal! How dare you shout at me!
Do you want to die?

389
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:02,525
Why should I enter your secret ground?
There’s nothing good in there!

390
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,649
I won’t enter unless there’s some
delicious food in there.

391
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,706
But there’s nothing inside!

392
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,319
There’s only a short-tempered
one-eyed dragon!

393
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,935
I’m sure it’s not delicious.
There’s no reason for me to enter!

394
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:12,995
How did you know that
the Candle Dragon is our guardian?

395
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:15,439
Don’t tell me you’re a spy from Sky Hall?

396
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,577
Father, he’s not from Sky Hall.

397
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:19,559
- He’s my spirit beast.
- Spirit beast?

398
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,870
I’m your friend!

399
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,215
He’s my friend as well.

400
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:25,496
When did you tame a spirit beast like him?

401
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,557
Is he just like Lu Yan Ran?

402
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:29,468
A spirit beast who acquired a human form?

403
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,239
Father of stinky woman,

404
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,239
can you not compare me
with that low-class creature?

405
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,630
I’m a divine snake who has
trained for 1,000 years!

406
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,425
I would never become her spirit beast

407
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,362
if it weren’t for my careless mistake.

408
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:45,767
So, according to what you’ve said,
you’re a heavenly officer?

409
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:47,119
Yes.

410
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,650
I’m the one and only Lord Flying Snake.

411
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:54,868
You’re 25 years old at most.
You don’t look like a heavenly officer.

412
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,559
Xuan Ji, you mustn’t let him deceive you.

413
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,356
I... I’m a heavenly officer!

414
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:03,799
You mortals have no common sense at all!

415
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,039
Do you know that King Bailing
begs me to do his tasks for him?

416
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,270
He sent me and the Four Sacred Beasts
here to construct your secret ground!

417
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,400
Heartless Tactics and Sentimental Tactics?

418
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,999
You even want stinky woman
to marry another guy?

419
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,879
Listen up. Do you believe it or not?

420
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,239
I can fix your stupid barrier
by using a tiny bit of my power.

421
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,639
This barrier is constructed
by beings of the heavenly realm.

422
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,902
It’s fine for you
to crack inappropriate jokes,

423
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,719
but how could you disrespect them?

424
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,765
Father, Flying Snake
is a heavenly officer indeed.

425
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,597
Just let him try and fix the barrier.

426
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:35,926
Nonsense!

427
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:37,790
This concerns the three realms!
How could you joke around?

428
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,879
Xuan Ji,

429
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,914
you better leave with your spirit beast.

430
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,567
Fine. You mortals
are looking down on me, huh?

431
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:48,238
I’ll show you my power.

432
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,310
He did fix the barrier.

433
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,360
Stinky woman, I’ve solved your trouble.

434
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:34,679
You better ask Yu Si Feng
to cook something delicious for me.

435
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,564
Sure. Thank you, Flying Snake.

436
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,931
He’ll cook everything you want.

437
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,039
Sect Leader, please look.

438
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,190
He does look like the painting.

439
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,390
Stop it already. Let me have a look.

440
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,790
What an ugly painting.
I’m much more handsome.

441
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,310
- Greetings, Heavenly Officer.
- Greetings, Heavenly Officer.

442
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,559
Father, what are you doing?

443
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,333
Heavenly Officer, the
entire Shaoyang Sect

444
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,804
needs your help.

445
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,078
Uncle, can you stop scaring me?
Speak in a normal tone.

446
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,892
Heavenly Officer, you may not know this.

447
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:25,244
The Flower Session will be held
once every four years.

448
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:27,420
Now, Dianjinggu Sect
is the one holding it.

449
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:30,022
And every sect leaders
are fretting over this.

450
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,639
If Sky Hall steals the spirit keys
during the event,

451
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,336
the secret ground will be in danger.

452
00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:38,114
Heavenly Officer, you came just in time.

453
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,644
My lord, I hope you can help us out.

454
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,464
Now that Xuan Ji has immense powers,

455
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:45,216
my lord, if you accompany her
to the Dianjinggu Sect,

456
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:47,327
you two will surely be able
to defeat all the demons.

457
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,079
What is she saying?

458
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,879
- You can fight.
- I can fight?

459
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,224
Sure.

460
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,475
No!

461
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,279
As a heavenly officer, you mustn’t
interfere with mortal affairs.

462
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,079
If not, the heavens will punish you.

463
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,430
That is the heavenly law.

464
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,039
Am I right, my lord?

465
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,350
How did you know all that?

466
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,979
Wait, you look familiar.

467
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,810
Have I seen you before?

468
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,910
Fine. Let me test you.

469
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,197
Flying Snake!

470
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,049
- You mustn’t bully him!
- Your senior is weak!

471
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,870
You trained with him?
It’s no wonder you’re weak too.

472
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,119
Senior, I have an idea.

473
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,638
Heavenly officers can’t
interfere with mortal affairs indeed.

474
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:49,002
But now, he’s my spirit beast.

475
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:52,759
If the Sky Hall comes for me
and puts me in a dangerous situation,

476
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,039
I don’t think he’s breaking the law
if he assists me by then.

477
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,317
Xuan Ji!

478
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,079
Stinky woman, you’re smart!
That’s decided then.

479
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,424
Come, let’s slay some demons
and enjoy some good food.

480
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,705
Sect Leader.

481
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,104
Heavenly Officer, if that’s the case,

482
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:08,425
please travel with us
to Dianjinggu Sect then.

483
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:09,587
I...

484
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,519
Listen, I’ve searched
around Mount Buzhou.

485
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,963
I didn’t discover Ruo Yu’s body.

486
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:22,399
There’s only a bloody shirt.

487
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,310
It was too dirty. I didn’t bring it back.

488
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,839
Only a bloody shirt was left?

489
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,078
Don’t tell me Sky Hall
has captured Ruo Yu?

490
00:29:35,464 --> 00:29:36,628
My king.

491
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,119
What’s with that Flying Snake?

492
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,755
Well...

493
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:46,439
I’ve ordered guards
to keep watch over him.

494
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,079
I don’t know when Lord Flying Snake
descended to the mortal realm.

495
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,309
But it’s fine.

496
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,159
He’s someone’s pet now.

497
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,710
He deserved that.

498
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,407
He didn’t create trouble
in the heavens.

499
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,168
But he came and create trouble for me!

500
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,670
Can you remove that
annoying snake somehow?

501
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,447
About that...

502
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,988
Flying Snake is
Xuan Ji’s spirit beast now.

503
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,639
This is a mortal affair now.

504
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,999
I can’t do anything.

505
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,759
If I do anything,
the Jade Emperor will be able to sense it.

506
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,519
When he senses this, he’ll be able to
detect your presence too.

507
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,756
I really can’t do anything.

508
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:27,755
What’s the use of keeping you?

509
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,696
My king, there’s another thing.

510
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:36,199
You asked me to seal
God of War’s life pillar, right?

511
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,999
But I can’t suppress it anymore.

512
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,399
I’m afraid the God of War
will awaken sooner or later.

513
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,579
What?

514
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,346
My king, please forgive me.

515
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,870
The Mirror of Origin is a heavenly item.

516
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:53,439
Since it has triggered her
to recover some of her memories,

517
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,840
it’s hard to reverse it.

518
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:57,271
I can’t do anything about it.

519
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,758
But in my opinion,

520
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,839
it isn’t necessarily a bad thing
for Flying Snake to be here.

521
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,619
That demon who used
its malignant aura to trap Xuan Ji,

522
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,437
I’m sure he’s trying to
go after the God of War.

523
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,658
So, Flying Snake
can serve as an aid instead.

524
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:18,031
Am I right?

525
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,020
Now, the demons are getting stronger.

526
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:26,679
Some of them are even elders
of the Five Great Sects.

527
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,135
It’s hard to guard against them indeed.

528
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,456
Fine.

529
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:34,167
I’ll leave that annoying snake
around Xuan Ji for now.

530
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:36,078
At least he can protect her.

531
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:39,087
The most important thing now is to

532
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,399
find the demon with the malignant aura.

533
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,211
Only then, I can rest at ease.

534
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,097
Ling Long.

535
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,799
- You’re awake?
- Xuan Ji.

536
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,799
I brought you
your favorite osmanthus cake.

537
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,188
Xuan Ji, where’s Little Six?

538
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,539
Why isn’t he here to see me?

539
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,092
The Flower Session will be held soon.

540
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:14,433
Father wants Sixth Senior
to lead our juniors for the training.

541
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,807
Xuan Ji, stop lying to me.

542
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,199
I vaguely recall that
he went to Sky Hall to save me.

543
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,919
But I don’t remember anything else.

544
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,239
Did something happen to him?

545
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,342
- I...
- Tell me!

546
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,536
I...

547
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,410
Sixth Senior committed some mistakes.

548
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:32,508
And he broke our rules.
Now, he’s locked up in the cell.

549
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:35,239
What did he do to break our rules?

550
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,598
- Did Father make things difficult for him?
- No.

551
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,904
Don’t worry.

552
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:41,944
Although Father was angry,
he still cares for him.

553
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:43,679
He let us visit him often.

554
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,317
No! I need to find him!

555
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,870
Your favorite food isn’t
glutinous rice cake.

556
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:54,224
It’s osmanthus cake.

557
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,284
Send Min Yan some of your favorite
glutinous rice cake.

558
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,639
Ling Long, what’s wrong?

559
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,679
Ling Long, what’s wrong?

560
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,880
Don’t touch me!

561
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,733
Xuan Ji.

562
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,186
I... I want to be alone for now.

563
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:19,466
Please leave.

564
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,510
- Ling Long.
- Listen to me.

565
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,479
Please. Leave me alone.

566
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,799
Just go.

567
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,950
I...

568
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,175
Ling Long!

569
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,361
Ling Long, Sixth Senior
misses you as well.

570
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:34,867
He wants to see you too.

571
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:37,119
Ling Long, please don’t be like this.

572
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,670
I beg you! Leave me alone!

573
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,371
I knew it. That Yu Si Feng

574
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:21,279
must be hiding the food
he had made somewhere.

575
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,936
So, it’s here.

576
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,340
Who’s there?

577
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,559
I’m a heavenly officer!
Everyone here bows to me, you know?

578
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,679
- Be quiet!
- You’re stealing my food.

579
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,479
Someone! There’s a thief!

580
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,959
Stop shouting!

581
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,150
You’ll call stinky woman here, you know?

582
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,519
It’s lucky that she didn’t come.
I’ll be in trouble if she does.

583
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,722
She’ll nag at me all day!

584
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,150
You’re stinky woman’s sister, right?

585
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,799
My goodness. I retrieved
your primordial spirit, you know?

586
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,562
What’s wrong with
eating your osmanthus cake?

587
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:03,953
You’re so petty.

588
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,395
I’m sorry! I won’t eat them!

589
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,359
I’ll return them to you, okay?

590
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,430
Please don’t cry. I won’t eat them.

591
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,442
Sister, why are you so useless?

592
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,879
You’re crying over such trivial matters?

593
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,038
Do you know someone risked his life

594
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,206
and suffered tremendously

595
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:37,157
in order to
retrieve your primordial spirit?

596
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:39,367
If he sees you crying,

597
00:35:39,368 --> 00:35:41,598
I’m sure his tears will flood the room.

598
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,190
Stop crying.

599
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,704
I need to go now. Promise me this.

600
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:56,932
Promise me that you’ll not shout
after I undo the spell.

601
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,550
Blink twice if you agree.

602
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,723
Okay.

603
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,559
If you shout after I undo the spell,

604
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,550
I’ll burn your hair and make you go bald.

605
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,790
Okay. I’ll go now.

606
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,519
Wait!

607
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,868
You’re going back on your words?

608
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,719
You said someone risked his life for me.
That person is Min Yan, right?

609
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,517
Xuan Ji and the rest
wouldn’t tell me anything.

610
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:22,468
Do you know something? Tell me about it!

611
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,190
I only know a little bit.

612
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,067
That Zhong Min Yan, he
became a spy in Sky Hall

613
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,719
in order to
retrieve your primordial spirit.

614
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,098
A spy?

615
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,790
I think he became a spy
because he was deceived.

616
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,662
He killed someone in order
to acquire the villain’s trust.

617
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,950
He killed someone? Who did he kill?

618
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,470
It’s the stinky woman’s Second Senior.

619
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,119
He suffered a terrible fate.
He was chopped into pieces.

620
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,350
Second Senior?

621
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,146
Brother Wu Tong asked me
to bring you some food.

622
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:06,450
Have some food.

623
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,299
Here.

624
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,196
Are they nice?

625
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,909
What’s wrong with you?

626
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,906
Sixth Senior.

627
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,770
Xuan Ji?

628
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,439
Si Feng?

629
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,679
Sixth Senior, I’ve brought you some food.

630
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,599
Where’s Ling Long? How is she?

631
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,800
Is she awake?

632
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,883
She’s awake now. She’s doing well.

633
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:45,599
Sixth Senior, don’t worry.

634
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,959
This is great.

635
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,037
So, where is she?

636
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,879
Didn’t she follow you here?

637
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,879
Sixth Senior, the food is hot.

638
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,284
You should eat them now.

639
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:56,755
If not, they’ll get cold.

640
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,083
Ling Long...

641
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,026
Is she not willing to see me?

642
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,190
- It’s not like that! She...
- You don’t need to lie.

643
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:25,741
If she wants to see me,

644
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:28,371
she would’ve been here right away.

645
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,998
She’s right.

646
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:32,789
I was a fool.
I was deceived by Sky Hall.

647
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:35,408
It’s normal if she doesn’t want to see me.

648
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,463
If I were her,

649
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:40,214
I would’ve ignored a person like me.

650
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:43,654
Min Yan, don’t think too much.

651
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:45,726
Ling Long...

652
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,910
She’s very worried about you.

653
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,710
Yes, Sixth Senior.

654
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:53,313
She’s really worried about you.

655
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,139
She...

656
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,359
- She’s busy with something.
- I understand.

657
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,563
That’s why she...

658
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,450
Ling Long...

659
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,909
She always hates evildoers.

660
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,858
I’ve committed a grave mistake.

661
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:09,325
I have no right
to beg for her forgiveness.

662
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,628
But I don’t regret my decision.

663
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:15,602
If I could turn back time,

664
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,630
I would’ve made the same decision.

665
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,550
I’m willing to do anything

666
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,842
as long as I can save Ling Long.

667
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,070
The only thing I’m sorry about

668
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,727
is Second Senior.

669
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,839
Second...

670
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,270
Regarding Second Senior,

671
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,390
did you really kill him?

672
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,267
Yes.

673
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,662
I’m ashamed to face him.

674
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,830
My beloved Ling Long

675
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,199
was the one behind
your Second Senior’s death.

676
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,472
Me?

677
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,639
Si Feng, Xuan Ji,

678
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,927
I need you two

679
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,390
to pass a message to Ling Long, okay?

680
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,910
Tell her that

681
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:39,321
I was lying.

682
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,139
I didn’t love her at all.

683
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,092
My promises don’t count now.

684
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,285
I’ve committed a grave mistake.

685
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,990
I have no right to like her anymore.

686
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,817
Tell her that

687
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,310
she doesn’t need to be awkward.

688
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,270
It’s just that

689
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,830
I can’t accompany her
for the rest of her life.

690
00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:10,257
Ask her to take good care of herself.

691
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,430
If she meets someone
she likes in the future,

692
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,574
you must persuade her.

693
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,110
Tell her not to throw her tantrums
that often.

694
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,159
If not, people who
don’t understand her

695
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,840
may think she’s not good enough.

696
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,460
It’ll be painful for me.

697
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,560
I just hope that

698
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:40,651
Ling Long can stay happy

699
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,990
in the future.

700
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,349
That’s enough for me.

701
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,439
Why are you crying here?

702
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,550
You should go in since you’re here.

703
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,925
You’re too embarrassed?

704
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:31,196
- I’ll call them out then.
- Don’t!

705
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,150
I was the one who let down Little Six.

706
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,990
I’ve committed so many
atrocious acts in Sky Hall, yet he...

707
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,399
It’s all because of me.

708
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,670
