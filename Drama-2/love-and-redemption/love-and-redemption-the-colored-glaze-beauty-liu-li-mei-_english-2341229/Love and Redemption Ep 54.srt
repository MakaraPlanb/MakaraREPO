00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,914
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>EPISODE 54</i>

3
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,245
This is the medical book that I’ve copied.

4
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:43,701
Take it.

5
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:47,036
Your cultivation is not that advanced yet.
When you meet stronger demons,

6
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,716
don’t force yourself.

7
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,037
Be careful.

8
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:56,950
Mister Yi.

9
00:01:57,542 --> 00:02:01,749
I’m already very grateful to
be able to have this memento.

10
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,138
Ever since I first saw him,

11
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:11,061
I already know that I’m not for him.

12
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,460
I’m just

13
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,166
a half disciple to him and that’s it.

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,074
Chu Xuan Ji.

15
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,399
If both of you are married one day,

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,479
send me a wedding invitation.

17
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,828
No matter where I am,

18
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,726
I’ll go there and congratulate you.

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,020
Okay.

20
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,593
Mister Yi.

21
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,734
Go now.

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,117
I hope that everything will
go smoothly for you from now on.

23
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,904
I’ll pray for you here.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,127
Miss Ah Lan.

25
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,214
Take care of yourself.

26
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,393
Greetings, King Bailing.

27
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,860
Guards.

28
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:25,429
Detain Flying Snake in the Sky Prison.

29
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,479
King Bailing, what did I do wrong? Why
do I have to be detained in Sky Prison?

30
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,540
Look towards your left and right.

31
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:35,239
God of War has a deep anguish to her that

32
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,860
even 1,000 years can’t mellow it out.

33
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:41,274
You must have heard about the great
bloodshed that happened here back then.

34
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:45,926
Now, when I sent the Four
Sacred Beasts to capture her,

35
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:50,050
you foiled my plan and
chose to stand by her.

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,654
What is it?

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,437
Are you going to betray the heavens

38
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,100
and let her bring great disaster to
the heavens again just like before?

39
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:05,359
I did help her out for a little bit.

40
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,639
But I did it for our friendship.

41
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,672
I wasn’t trying to revolt against
the heavens.

42
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:11,989
Is that so?

43
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,279
You stole the scroll from my palace

44
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,660
and went to the human realm
to give her the information.

45
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:21,062
You foiled my plan to make her
destroy the Jade Cup.

46
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:22,724
Does that count as betrayal?

47
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:26,759
Make God of War destroy the Jade Cup?

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,980
Is that strange?

49
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,423
Flying Snake.

50
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:35,559
Actually, you had already
suspected my identity before this.

51
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,999
But I used the spell of deceit on you.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,060
So, you couldn’t tell.

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,633
So, that person is indeed you.

54
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,583
Yes. King Bailing.

55
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:02,239
Since you’ve already spent 20 years
with her in the human realm,

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,632
you should know that she’s kind.
She won’t attack the heavens.

57
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,253
But why can’t you spare her?

58
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,947
She is kind?

59
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:16,927
Since you’ve read the scroll, you
should know her identity by now.

60
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:21,023
Her kindness has
a time limit to it.

61
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:26,303
Her ego and arrogance have never changed.

62
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:29,199
I tried to help and save her.

63
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,174
But she’s being difficult.
All of my efforts have been wasted.

64
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:36,434
It’s hard to get rid of
her demonic character and anguish.

65
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,457
She is destined to bring chaos
to the three realms.

66
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:44,979
Now, she is even tempted
to open the Jade Cup.

67
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,360
If we spare her again, she’ll
eventually come for the heavens!

68
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:57,470
I did read the scroll before.

69
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,359
But it’s just a broken scroll.

70
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,859
I don’t understand why
the scroll stated that

71
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,616
the God of War is born from
the destruction of Star of Mosha.

72
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:08,639
I don’t understand why it stated that
God of War and Star of Mosha are the same.

73
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,184
Is the scroll mistaken?

74
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:13,915
You are asking too many questions.

75
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,620
You just need to know that

76
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,448
no matter it’s the Star of Mosha
or the God of War,

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,060
if they are a threat to the heavens,
they’ll have to be destroyed.

78
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:29,473
As for you, if you
help God of War again,

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,020
you’ll meet the same fate too.

80
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:35,513
Green Dragon.

81
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,399
Yes, King Bailing.

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,039
Take him to the Sky Prison.

83
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,936
Yes, King Bailing.

84
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,454
Chu Xuan Ji.

85
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:09,378
I know why you are going
to Mount Shaoyang.

86
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,315
Since you want to open the Jade Cup
to destroy the three realms,

87
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:18,045
don’t blame me for being so unforgiving.

88
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,695
Shaoyang Sect is just right ahead of us.

89
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:27,199
I think us demons shouldn’t go there.

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,239
We don’t want to ruin
other’s birthday party.

91
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,511
Si Feng.

92
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:33,239
Perform well when you go to
meet your father-in-law

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,940
so that he can marry off his daughter
to you without any worries.

94
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,799
Don’t worry, Brother Wu.

95
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,783
I’ll send you a letter
as soon as there’s good news.

96
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:43,318
Alright. We’ll wait for
your good news here. Go.

97
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,479
Wu Zhi Qi.

98
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,635
Where are you going?

99
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,556
I have something personal to do.

100
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,679
Don’t think that I can’t tell.

101
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,559
You were whispering with Xuan Ji.

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,461
You are planning to
open the Jade Cup, right?

103
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,727
So what if I am.

104
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,372
I won’t allow you to go.

105
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,526
Why do you have to let things
get out of hand?

106
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,199
Even if we don’t do anything,

107
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,271
those deities from heavens
will kill us.

108
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:20,561
When that happen, it’ll really be
out of our hands. Just wait for me here.

109
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,818
Please help me take care of
this little fox.

110
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,710
Something big will happen today.

111
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:27,211
Find a place to hide.

112
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,922
Wu Zhi Qi!

113
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,938
Senior Xuan Ji, you are back.

114
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,039
He is...

115
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,262
We are here to celebrate
father’s birthday.

116
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,799
Senior, let us go in and inform him first.

117
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,330
One is your senior and the other one
is Shaoyang Sect’s savior.

118
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,079
Why do you have to inform first?

119
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,076
- Ling Long.
- Xuan Ji.

120
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,090
You are finally back.
The party has started.

121
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:00,079
- I thought you couldn’t make it. Let’s go.
- Si Feng, how are you?

122
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,919
- Senior Ling Long.
- What senior?

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,620
Without them both,
Mount Shaoyang would be burnt to dust.

124
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,155
Let’s go.

125
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,159
It’s good that you came back this time.
Now, we have someone to talk to.

126
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,230
But Si Feng doesn’t look too well.

127
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,822
Maybe he’s tired from the long journey.

128
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:26,007
With your power, you won’t be
this weak even if you fly to the sky.

129
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:27,588
Did something happen?

130
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,980
Actually, besides celebrating
Father’s birthday this time,

131
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,886
Si Feng is here to ask Father for my hand.

132
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:36,987
Really?

133
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,033
After going through so much,
this day has finally come.

134
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:45,127
Don’t be so happy first.

135
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:46,783
Father hasn’t agreed yet.

136
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:50,244
He looks strict usually
but he’s actually very soft-hearted.

137
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,558
Just beg him and he’ll agree.

138
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,620
Let’s go.

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,919
Si Feng, the last time four of us
climbed this Mount Shaoyang

140
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,500
was a long time ago.

141
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,823
We’ll have to spend
more time together this time.

142
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:08,836
I’ve been keeping a few jars
of great wine for you.

143
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,168
Later, I’ll use your kitchen

144
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:14,839
and cook us some drinking dishes.
We’ll drink until we drop.

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,233
That’ll be for the best.

146
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,759
Si Feng, you are faltering in your steps.

147
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,605
Is it because of your old wound?

148
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,534
Yes. But I’ll be fine.

149
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,109
Si Feng.

150
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,899
I’m sorry.

151
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,625
Why are you suddenly apologizing to me?

152
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,999
I doubted you before this.

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,540
As your friend,
I didn’t believe in you or support you.

154
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:42,487
But you did so many things
for us in secret.

155
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,007
I’m really guilty about it.

156
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,799
This is a chaotic world.
It’s normal to be cautious.

157
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,543
I would do the same thing too
if I were you.

158
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,239
No need to feel guilty.

159
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,719
Everything is good now, right?

160
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,319
By the way,

161
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,887
I haven’t congratulated you
for your marriage with Ling Long.

162
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:03,355
She and I are already married,
when is your turn?

163
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,679
Don’t tell me that
you are here this time...

164
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,076
You’ll know about it soon.

165
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:12,227
Let’s go.

166
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:22,752
Si Feng, don’t leave anymore
since you are already back.

167
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,271
Si Feng.

168
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:27,767
Xuan Ji told me about your great news.

169
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:31,759
I was very lost before this because
I stayed with the demons of Sky Hall.

170
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,326
So, I told Xuan Ji
a lot of bad things about you.

171
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,589
Now,

172
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,396
I want to apologize to you.

173
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,293
You and Min Yan really think alike.

174
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:48,460
You each apologized to me.
It’s too much.

175
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,140
Alright now.
Everything is in the past now.

176
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,034
Luckily, after going through
so many hiccups, the four of us

177
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,217
are together again.

178
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:03,396
Luckily, we are still here together.

179
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,455
It’s a happy day today.
Let’s not talk about the past. Let’s go.

180
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:09,119
Time to greet our birthday boy.

181
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
Let’s go.

182
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,967
We hereby wishing you

183
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:20,159
- abundance of health and prosperity!
- Abundance of health and prosperity!

184
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,580
Thank you, everyone. Cheers.

185
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,411
Father.

186
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,792
Father.

187
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,856
Look who’s here.

188
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:33,895
Father.

189
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:39,759
Father.

190
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,175
I’m back.

191
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:46,100
I wish you good health and prosperity.

192
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,038
Okay.

193
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,479
It’s good that you are back.

194
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,000
I’m very happy.

195
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:57,944
Happy birthday, Sect Leader Chu.

196
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,559
Isn’t this the new palace lord
of that Lize Palace demon nest,

197
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,451
Hero Yu Si Feng?

198
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,567
Why is he here?

199
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:09,519
But he helped Shaoyang Sect before.

200
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,500
- And he guarded the Jade Cup for us.
- He’s still a demon.

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
Our sects kill demons and monsters.

202
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,439
But now, we have a demon here?

203
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,214
Are we going to dine together
with a demon?

204
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,230
The four of you, come with me.

205
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:46,879
Father, what is the meaning of this?

206
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,599
Si Feng is Shaoyang’s benefactor.

207
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,071
You brought us to this side hall
because of malicious comment.

208
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:53,406
This doesn’t conform to
Shaoyang’s etiquette.

209
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:58,365
Although this place is more secluded,

210
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,476
it’s easier for us to talk here.

211
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:04,359
It’s okay.

212
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,759
It’s tranquil here.

213
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,580
It’s more comfortable for us to talk.

214
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,078
Xuan Ji, you’ve slimmed down.

215
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,399
Since you are back this time, stay.

216
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,777
Your sister and I miss you so much.

217
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,126
Thank you, Father.

218
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,039
But

219
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,416
besides coming back to
wish you, I have a request.

220
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:36,386
If you agree, I’ll accompany you forever

221
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:39,095
at Shaoyang.

222
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:40,354
What is it?

223
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,743
Father, I beg you

224
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,569
to let me and Si Feng get married.

225
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,060
Sect Leader Chu, after so many years,
Xuan Ji and I

226
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,409
are deeply in love with each other.

227
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,580
Please give us

228
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:09,428
your blessing.

229
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,526
This thing...

230
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,534
This thing is a serious matter.

231
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,950
I have to consider it carefully.

232
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:35,103
Father, Si Feng risked his life for
Xuan Ji over and over again.

233
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:37,684
Nobody else in this world
will treat Xuan Ji as well as he did.

234
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,239
Marriage is no child’s play.

235
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,479
How can I just agree to it?

236
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,006
You have prejudice against him.
When Little Six proposed,

237
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:49,666
you agreed right away.

238
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:53,484
How can you compare Min Yan to Yu Si Feng?

239
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,647
Xuan Ji, I need
to think about it.

240
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,440
Father.

241
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:07,357
You still mind that Si Feng
is a demon, right?

242
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:14,428
It’s okay.

243
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:16,698
I won’t force you.

244
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:19,364
But I want to tell you that

245
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:23,814
in this life, I’ll only marry
Si Feng and no one else.

246
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,072
Xuan Ji.

247
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,493
I know that both of you are very close.

248
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:34,204
But just now... Just now, you heard
those malicious comments as well.

249
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:35,862
I know.

250
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,871
Si Feng is a good man.

251
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,678
And Shaoyang is indebted to him.

252
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,333
But in the end,
he’s still a demon.

253
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,900
You are still young. You don’t know that
gossip is a fearful thing.

254
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,860
I’m just afraid that it’ll be
hard on both of you in the future.

255
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:54,091
Father.

256
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,154
I know a lot of things now.

257
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,559
In this world, we’ll
meet a lot of people.

258
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,940
But only a few are important to us.

259
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,222
The important people
in my heart are you,

260
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,278
Ling Long and Sixth Senior.

261
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,730
As long as you don’t reject us,

262
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,270
it won’t be hard on me and Si Feng.

263
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,186
Sect Leader, your guests
are still waiting to drink with you.

264
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,119
Easier said than done.

265
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,688
Just like cultivation.

266
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,820
And it’s the same in life too.

267
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,999
Get up first, both of you.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,060
We’ll discuss about this later.

269
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,256
Si Feng.

270
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,349
Looks like it’ll be hard for
your father to agree.

271
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:13,799
Don’t think too much.

272
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,599
I’m sure that he just can’t
accept it for the moment.

273
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,902
- He’ll be fine after some time.
- Yes, Si Feng.

274
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:20,643
We’ll help you to convince him.

275
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,538
It’s okay, Si Feng.

276
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,014
I’m very clear about what I want.

277
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,343
If my father agrees, I’ll
marry you at Shaoyang.

278
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,673
If he doesn’t agree,

279
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:35,768
we can get married anywhere in this world.

280
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,860
Si Feng.

281
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,791
Si Feng, did you pull on your old wound?

282
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,199
I’ll get Auntie Ying Hong
to take a look at him now.

283
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,351
No need to do that.

284
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:51,447
Well...

285
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:55,079
I know Si Feng’s body well.
He’s just exhausted from the journey.

286
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,580
Go and celebrate Father’s birthday first.
We’ll be fine.

287
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:01,844
Let’s go then.

288
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,504
We’ll get going then.

289
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:12,879
Si Feng.

290
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,959
Hold on, Si Feng.
Let me help you suppress the curse.

291
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,039
King Bailing, you want us to open
the Heavenly Meteor Formation

292
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,927
to attack Mount Shaoyang
in the human realm?

293
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,087
Yes.

294
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:38,679
Heavenly Meteor Formation is a deadly
formation that uses the power of stars.

295
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,199
Every living thing that is inside it will
be annihilated. The hill will be crushed.

296
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,759
Isn’t it a bit excessive to
use it against the humans?

297
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,839
No.

298
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,039
God of War is already at Mount Shaoyang.

299
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,039
She’ll open the Jade Cup soon.

300
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,879
And then, Star of Mosha will be revived
and the three realms will be in chaos.

301
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,823
I’m opening this formation
to stop the God of War.

302
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,047
But this formation is not targeting
God of War alone.

303
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:03,855
It’s targeting the whole Mount Shaoyang.

304
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,039
To sacrifice millions of lives
to defeat her?

305
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,111
- This is too much.
- Yes.

306
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:11,100
Isn’t there any other way?

307
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:16,079
For the past few days, I’ve
been thinking about the solution.

308
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,063
But the Jade Cup and God of War
are not ordinary in the human realm.

309
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:22,524
Normal ways won’t be able
to hurt them at all.

310
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,140
So, setting up the Heavenly
Meteor Formation is our only choice.

311
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,319
Desperate situation calls for
desperate measure.

312
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,319
To bury the whole Shaoyang
and wrongly kill millions of lives

313
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,414
are better than letting Star of Mosha be
revived and brings ruin to three realms.

314
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:43,279
Back then, Jade Emperor asked us
to leave God of War alone.

315
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,183
He said that everything is
a preordained fate.

316
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:48,679
Don’t you think you should discuss this
with the Jade Emperor first?

317
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,239
We are out of time.

318
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,679
God of War is going to open
the Jade Cup soon.

319
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,265
If Jade Emperor wants to
blame someone in the future for it,

320
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,839
I’ll take full responsibility for it.

321
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,615
Please help me set up the formation
to destroy Mount Shaoyang,

322
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,403
seal the Jade Cup and kill Chu Xuan Ji.

323
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,918
Yes, King Bailing.

324
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,458
Why are you here?

325
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,592
Are you here to laugh at me?

326
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,319
- What are you doing?
- Here’s a dragon scale. Keep it well.

327
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,639
The path of heaven is closed now.
To go to human realm,

328
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,062
you have to go through Heaven Fire.

329
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:45,840
This dragon scale can help you with that.

330
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:52,100
Why do I have to go down?
King Bailing didn’t punish me, right?

331
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,639
When you reach there,
look for Chu Xuan Ji at once

332
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,620
and ask her to forget about the Jade Cup.

333
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,969
Ask her to leave Mount Shaoyang
at once without a delay.

334
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:06,559
What is the meaning of this?
Explain it to me.

335
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,359
King Bailing has ordered
Seven Emperors of North Heaven

336
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,239
to initiate Heavenly Meteor Formation.

337
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,879
He’s going to sacrifice Mount Shaoyang
to kill Chu Xuan Ji

338
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,937
and bury the Jade Cup forever.

339
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,559
What did you say?

340
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,399
I heard it myself. It’s true.

341
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,815
Seven Emperors of North Heaven
have already departed.

342
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:25,719
If you don’t go now,
Chu Xuan Ji will die.

343
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,540
If she dies, you’ll die too.

344
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:33,404
I can’t watch you die in vain.
Go now.

345
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,276
Green Dragon.

346
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,982
If I can come back here alive,

347
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:48,698
I’ll treat you to a drink
as an appreciation.

348
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,410
How is it, Little Beauty?
Are we going to start?

349
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,767
Back then, he used his life
to protect the Jade Cup.

350
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,599
But now, I’m going to open it.

351
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,220
Even if he blames me for it,
I still have to do this.

352
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,438
Wu Zhi Qi, later,
I’ll rip a hole through it

353
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,319
and you’ll keep it stable.

354
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,199
Then, I won’t alarm the
protection rock when I take out Jade Cup.

355
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,439
Don’t worry.

356
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,663
Although the divine weapons together with
the 12 Feathers are very powerful,

357
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:27,300
I’m still powerful enough
to buy you some time.

358
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,412
We got it. Let’s go.

359
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:08,269
Si Feng!

360
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:10,711
Why did you do this?

361
00:24:10,712 --> 00:24:11,811
I...

362
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,687
Si Feng.

363
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:19,119
I saw it.

364
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,423
I saw your lives starting from
the heavens to nine reincarnations.

365
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:24,519
I saw what you had gone through.

366
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,239
We’ve missed out on so many things.

367
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,839
It’s not easy for us
to meet each other again in this life.

368
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,063
I don’t want to give up yet.

369
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:32,569
I won’t let you die.

370
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:35,506
Give me the Jade Cup.
I want to open it.

371
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,482
Sorry, Xuan Ji.

372
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:40,942
We can’t open this Jade Cup.

373
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:43,017
And I won’t give it to you.

374
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,953
- Unless you kill me.
- You...

375
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,195
- Si Feng!
- Si Feng!

376
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:01,563
- Take care of him. I’ll chase after it.
- Okay.

377
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,359
- Xuan Ji.
- Si Feng.

378
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,719
Can you manage?

379
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,057
Brother Wu, stop her.
Don’t let her open the Jade Cup.

380
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,623
Sect Leader Chu.

381
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:18,004
- Go ahead and hit that Longevity Drum.
- Go ahead.

382
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,096
Run, mortals of Shaoyang.

383
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:25,068
King Bailing is going to sacrifice
Mount Shaoyang to seal Jade Cup.

384
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:27,260
All of you will die if you stay here. Run!

385
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,279
- Xuan Ji.
- Xuan Ji!

386
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,853
Why did you take out the Jade Cup?

387
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:41,644
Father, I want to save Si Feng.

388
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,039
Xuan Ji, run now.

389
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,759
- Why are you here?
- Forget about me.

390
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,079
Escape with these mortals first.
King Bailing has given his order...

391
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,399
- Flying Snake.
- Run!

392
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,462
Flying Snake!

393
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:20,155
Bailing.

394
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,263
Are you Bailing?

395
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:28,159
Where is Flying Snake?

396
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,919
Are you the one who took the Jade Cup?

397
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,823
He came here without permission and leaked
heaven’s secret to you. He’s unforgivable.

398
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:37,468
As for Jade Cup, why do you want it?

399
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:39,519
Have you forgotten about your vow?

400
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,982
What vow did I make with you?
I don’t remember you!

401
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:44,839
Is that so, Xuan Ji?

402
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,093
You promised me that
you’ll destroy Jade Cup

403
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:49,271
and kill the soul of Star of Mosha.

404
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:53,776
Do you still remember that you’ll protect
the world no matter the cost?

405
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,435
This voice.

406
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,959
What you said is...

407
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,839
Promise me.

408
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,799
Destroy the Jade Cup.

409
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,820
We can’t let the demon clan win.

410
00:27:08,347 --> 00:27:09,999
Promise me.

411
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,353
Promise me.

412
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:13,919
You are set on opening the Jade Cup.

413
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,279
You’ve already forgotten
about my teachings.

414
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,042
Today, I’m here to punish you for
bringing chaos to the world

415
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:21,178
and poisoning the people.

416
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:32,479
Hao Chen?

417
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,026
- Senior Hao Chen?
- This...

418
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:36,771
Senior Hao Chen.

419
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,419
Aren’t you already dead?

420
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,039
Why are you here?

421
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,380
Hao Chen

422
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:48,689
is just the identity I use
when I’m in the human realm.

423
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,570
I’m King Bailing.

424
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:10,180
- King Bailing.
- King Bailing.

425
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,076
Bailing?

426
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,866
Senior Hao Chen.

427
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,319
Until now, you still
don’t repent on your sins.

428
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,919
You hate the heavens
for betraying and tricking you.

429
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,448
You’ll always want to seek revenge, right?

430
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,439
Do you think I’ll forgive you?

431
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,320
For the harmony of the three
realms, I can’t keep you here anymore.

432
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,471
You’ll be punished now!

433
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,439
So, you are King Bailing.

434
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,079
Why?

435
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,639
Why did you lie to me?

436
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,206
I lied to you?

437
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:48,799
I took the form of mortals and descended
to the human realm to guide you myself.

438
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,719
I just hoped that you can get back onto
the right path and come back to heavens.

439
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,238
I did it for you.

440
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:57,839
I didn’t want you to die young.

441
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,319
But you were so stubborn
to accept my guidance.

442
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,319
You’ve wasted all of my efforts.

443
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,860
In the end, you can’t even
keep your promise to me.

444
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,759
Now, not only you
don’t want to destroy it,

445
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,159
you want to open it and release
Star of Mosha’s soul.

446
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,119
And as Hao Chen, our
relationship as senior and juniors

447
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,679
for so many years
means nothing to you.

448
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,927
What about you?

449
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:28,031
Is our relationship for
so many years real or fake?

450
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,940
Or is everything just a way
to help me reincarnate?

451
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,559
You used me so that
I feel depressed and guilty

452
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,959
for Senior Hao Chen’s death.

453
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,399
You purposely forced me to attack Si Feng!

454
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,359
You forced me to make a vow
to destroy the Jade Cup

455
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,270
even though I’ll die!

456
00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:48,646
Have you ever cared about me then?

457
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:51,150
This is your duty.

458
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:53,481
If you had valued our relationship

459
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:56,880
and listened to me
to let thing run its course,

460
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:59,068
it would not come to this today!

461
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,275
So, before this, you had indeed

462
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,289
accused Si Feng wrongly on purpose.

463
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,424
And I felt so sinful for not being
able to fulfill your dying wish.

464
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:17,587
But in the end, I’m just a pawn.

465
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,507
You still want to argue
so fallaciously and irrationally?

466
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,479
I’m disappointed in you.

467
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,159
I gave you a lot of opportunities.

468
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,745
But you insisted on going against
the heaven’s will.

469
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,790
Today, I’m going to
sacrifice Mount Shaoyang

470
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,159
by initiating this
Heavenly Meteor Formation

471
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,759
to bury you and Jade Cup forever!

472
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,069
What did you say?

473
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,905
- Please have mercy on us.
- Please spare us, King Bailing.

474
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,479
- Spare us.
- Stop! I’m the one who took out Jade Cup.

475
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,826
I’m the one who go against
the heaven’s will! Kill me if you want!

476
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:14,801
But why are you killing
these innocent people?

477
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,869
Chu Xuan Ji.

478
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,830
You brought this upon yourself.

479
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:21,531
How dare you ask me that!

480
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,623
As soon as the Jade Cup is opened,
Star of Mosha will be revived.

481
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:28,065
He’ll destroyed everything.

482
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:32,319
If you can’t let go of this obsession,
you’ll bring disaster to the three realms!

483
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,455
So, I’ll have to crush this
wild dream of yours to nothing!

484
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:40,075
Stop! I just want to save someone.

485
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:43,295
After I save Si Feng,
I’ll just seal him back in.

486
00:31:43,296 --> 00:31:47,159
I’m God of War. If I can catch him once,
I can catch him again!

487
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,679
- Impossible.
- Why?

488
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,879
The Jade Cup is getting
more and more unstable now.

489
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,566
There is no mythological object
that can seal Star of Mosha anymore.

490
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,206
I can only suppress it
with Mount Shaoyang.

491
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,375
Remember.

492
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,599
You are the cause of this calamity.

493
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,620
And these people will
die because of you.

494
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,212
What is it?

495
00:32:36,448 --> 00:32:38,762
This is bad. It’s the heaven’s wrath.

496
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:45,159
You can’t go.
Are you trying to die?

497
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,839
This is not something you can stop.

498
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,839
But...

499
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,660
If I’m not wrong,
this is Heavenly Meteor Formation.

500
00:32:52,815 --> 00:32:55,775
What formation is that?
That stupid monkey is still inside.

501
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,236
What about him?

502
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,519
Calm down. A small formation will not
be able to trap that stupid monkey.

503
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,079
Didn’t he ask us to take care of you
before he left?

504
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,780
He’ll be fine.

505
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:08,804
He did say that.

506
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,519
You once taught me to
take care of the people.

507
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,151
But why are you slaughtering
these innocent people?

508
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:47,495
To keep the peace of three realms,
some sacrifices are unavoidable.

509
00:33:47,496 --> 00:33:51,494
Instead of letting out Star of Mosha
to bring ruins to the world,

510
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,279
I will rather sacrifice Shaoyang

511
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,039
for hundreds and thousands
of years of peace.

512
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,094
By sacrificing themselves today,
the people of Shaoyang

513
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:03,275
will be blessed in the future.

514
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,358
What a joke!

515
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,754
The high and mighty King Bailing
treats us like a piece of dirt.

516
00:34:11,755 --> 00:34:15,319
Back then, you took care of me
at Xuyang Peak.

517
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,026
No matter what ulterior motives you had,

518
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:21,719
those memories are precious to me.

519
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,439
Thank you for your care for so many years.

520
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,918
From now on,
our past relationship is no more.

521
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,398
I won’t let you hurt Shaoyang Sect!

522
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,198
Today, I’ll fight to death with you!

523
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:44,575
Chu Xuan Ji!

524
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:48,143
Since you insist to side
the demons and go against me,

525
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:52,365
I’ll finish you off
once and for all today!

526
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,065
Xuan Ji!

527
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,986
Xuan Ji!

528
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,740
Xuan Ji.

529
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:52,612
Si Feng!

530
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,586
Si Feng!

531
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,396
Si Feng!

532
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,919
Si Feng. How are you feeling?

533
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,180
Si Feng!

534
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,919
How did this happen?

535
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,159
What happened?

536
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,279
This is bad.

537
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,719
The power of the divine weapons
is bursting because of outside impact.

538
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,399
Si Feng is seriously injured.
He can’t contain the power anymore.

539
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,674
No. I have to save Si Feng.
Give me the Jade Cup.

540
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,253
No.

541
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,198
You can’t open the Jade Cup.

542
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:41,980
- Promise me.
- Si Feng!

543
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:45,124
You have to open the Jade Cup.

544
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,257
Yuan Lang? You are still alive?

545
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:58,119
I’m not here to fight with you.

546
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,740
I’m here to tell God of War the truth.

547
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:04,879
Xuan Ji.

548
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,180
Don’t listen to him.

549
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:11,319
He’s just here to trick you
to open the seal of Jade Cup.

550
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,679
Don’t listen to him.

551
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,159
God of War.

552
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,945
Do you know why

553
00:37:15,946 --> 00:37:20,268
King Bailing is so unforgiving when
you want to open the Jade Cup?

554
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,863
Finally, you know the truth.

555
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:40,437
Chu Xuan Ji.

556
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,066
God of War is Star of Mosha.

557
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,971
Star of Mosha is God of War.

558
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,138
I am the Star of Mosha.

559
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,750
Yes. You are the Star of Mosha.

560
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:06,352
The soul inside Jade Cup is yours.

561
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:08,053
Goddess of War.

562
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:10,398
- No.
- Yuan Lang!

563
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,540
Shut up.

564
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,079
In this world, only Star of Mosha
can open the seal of Jade Cup.

565
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,584
No. You are lying to me.

566
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,728
You are lying to me.

567
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:24,582
- Xuan Ji.
- You are lying to me.

568
00:38:25,496 --> 00:38:29,039
It’s recorded very clearly on the mural
inside Demon Citadel. Or else,

569
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,340
why do you think that Yu Si Feng
will admit that he’s the Star of Mosha?

570
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:39,297
Xuan Ji, it’s not true.

571
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:43,197
Don’t believe in him.
He wants to destroy the three realms.

572
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,679
He must have an ulterior motive.

573
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,020
Don’t believe him.

574
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:53,042
Since young,

575
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,224
every one of you

576
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,574
asked me to kill demons to uphold justice.

577
00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:01,993
But the biggest devil in this world

578
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,342
is me.

579
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,331
Impossible.

580
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,151
Impossible.

581
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,999
Impossible.

582
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,559
- Xuan Ji.
- Impossible.

583
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,399
If you don’t believe me,
go and ask King Bailing.

584
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,559
He tricked Star of Mosha and
extracted his soul from him.

585
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,942
Then, he used the mythological object
made by its bones

586
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:28,070
to seal his soul inside this Jade Cup.

587
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:30,961
And his body was transformed
into God of War.

588
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:32,567
And God of War’s heart

589
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:36,474
is just a minor piece that King Bailing
took from the Jade Cup.

590
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,551
Demon.

591
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,562
That’s enough!

592
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,391
What he said...

593
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,232
Is what he said true?

594
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,772
It doesn’t matter that you know now.

595
00:40:00,391 --> 00:40:02,054
He is right.

596
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,316
But everything is going to end now.

597
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,423
Since the beginning,

598
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:15,606
the devil that you want to kill is me.

599
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:20,581
What a joke.

600
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:25,674
What is God of War then?

601
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,151
Bailing.

602
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:32,039
Why did you do it?

603
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,631
Why did you do it?

604
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,393
For the three realms.

605
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,182
You stopped me from
getting back my six senses.

606
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,220
You wanted me to feel nothing
so that I could become your puppet!

607
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,794
You can’t be corrupted
if you are heartless to begin with.

608
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:53,111
Only then can the three realms be safe.

609
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:58,021
But even after nine reincarnations,
your anguish is still here.

610
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:02,496
And this time, you even gained
a mortal heart because of Yu Si Feng.

611
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:05,511
I can’t let you turn into a demon again.

612
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,774
Si Feng.

613
00:41:16,912 --> 00:41:18,052
Si Feng.

614
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,888
Si Feng!

615
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,719
Si Feng.

616
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,824
Si Feng.

617
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,759
Yu Si Feng.

618
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,380
I’ll kill you first.

619
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,580
Let’s see if the Jade Cup
will be broken or not.

620
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,280
Si Feng!

621
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,980
Xuan Ji.

622
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:42,669
Si Feng!

623
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,020
Si Feng! I won’t let
anything happen to you.

624
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:01,952
Xuan Ji.

625
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,120
No!

626
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,959
I rather die than letting you
become a demon because of me!

627
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,238
Si Feng, I don’t care about that.

628
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,519
I just want to save you!

629
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,759
Star of Mosha or God of War.
I don’t care. I just want you to live!

630
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,103
Si Feng.

631
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:30,623
If I become Rahu Ketu,
don’t forget about me!

632
00:42:30,624 --> 00:42:33,020
You have to find me!

633
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:34,319
Xuan Ji.

634
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,638
Xuan Ji!

635
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:44,100
I’m willing to drink with you every day.

636
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:48,391
I’m sorry.

637
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,883
Rahu Ketu.

638
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,090
I’ll now bestow this life to you.

639
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,776
And for your whole
life, you’ll fight for me

640
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,355
and for the heavens.

641
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,639
Rahu Ketu.

642
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,545
Why did you kill your own people?

643
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,274
Xuan Ji!

644
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,649
Star of Mosha, Rahu Ketu.

645
00:45:07,008 --> 00:45:08,359
Xuan Ji.

646
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,789
Xuan Ji.

647
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,377
Brother Bailing.

648
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,199
Long time no see.

649
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,342
Ketu.

650
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,954
Xuan Ji.

651
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:42,595
Xuan Ji.

652
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,844
I am Rahu Ketu.

653
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,479
Xuan Ji!

654
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,740
Where are you going?

655
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:07,604
Xuan Ji.

656
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,492
The life of human is really hilarious.

657
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,629
This belongs to Chu Xuan Ji.

658
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,140
From now on,
she’s no longer related to me.

659
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,681
Where are you going?

660
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,784
I’m going back to where
I belonged in the past.

661
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,078
I’m going to get back everything
that I lost for the past 1,000 years.

662
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,591
Xuan Ji, don’t go.

663
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,250
- Xuan Ji!
- Xuan Ji!

664
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,314
You don’t know me anymore?

665
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,297
Xuan Ji.

666
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,186
Xuan Ji.

667
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,900
If you pests keep on
addressing me wrongly without respect,

668
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:12,159
I don’t mind to wash
this mountain with blood.

669
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,272
Xuan Ji.

670
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:17,646
Xuan Ji!

671
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:18,727
Xuan Ji.

672
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,596
Xuan Ji.

673
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,596
Xuan Ji.
