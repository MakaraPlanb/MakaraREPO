1
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,319
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,880
<i>EPISODE 46</i>

3
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,380
Now that Wu Zhi Qi has been saved,

4
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,229
my plan will succeed soon.

5
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,419
And everything will be clear.

6
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,970
I saw Xuan Ji’s background
within Demon Citadel.

7
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,116
She’s the God of War

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,582
and Star of Mosha as well.

9
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,623
Although I don’t know why,

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,794
I suspect that

11
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,053
the heavens was up to something.

12
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:05,755
That’s why Xuan Ji had to withstand
nine lives of torture.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,940
Maybe this was connected to everything.

14
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,238
It’s tough for her?

15
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,339
What about you?

16
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,479
Do you think you’re happy
when she’s suffering?

17
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,700
Yu Si Feng, you suffered
the same fate yourself!

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,580
Forget it. Just sever your ties with her.

19
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,020
If you continue this,
you’ll be dead next time.

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,548
In this life, as long as the two
stars do not align with each other,

21
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,798
she will never become Star of Mosha.

22
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,219
And she won’t suffer again.

23
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,458
If I die,

24
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,779
I will only miss out this life.

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,767
But if I do so, Xuan Ji

26
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,256
will never suffer again.

27
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,060
Are you silly or are you
pretending to be silly?

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,719
As long as the two stars
do not align with each other?

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,540
Do you think you can determine
the movement of the stars?

30
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,194
I can’t do it on my own.

31
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:05,290
So,

32
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,299
I need someone to help me.

33
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,679
Don’t say that.

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,168
I’m not that capable.

35
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,749
I can’t help you with this.

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,570
- Wu Zhi Qi.
- Wu Zhi Qi?

37
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:19,511
Are you kidding me?

38
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:21,291
He’s one of the strongest demon around.

39
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,542
Maybe it’s his wish to
revive the Star of Mosha too.

40
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:24,865
Why should he help you?

41
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,780
Are you saying that you can trick him
to help you?

42
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:39,003
Wu Zhi Qi is a loyal person.

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,810
If I want him to help me,
I need to be honest and sincere.

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,911
Brother Liu, please
prepare a feast for me.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,909
I’ll meet him.

46
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,473
Xuan Ji.

47
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:02,559
Our wedding dresses are done.

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,700
They just sent them to me.
Are they nice?

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,642
Both of our weddings
will be held in two days.

50
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,939
Everyone is busy preparing for that.

51
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,020
Xuan Ji,

52
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,759
what’s wrong?

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,220
Are you listening to me?

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,216
Xuan Ji!

55
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,180
Senior, why did you lie to me?

56
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,786
Seems like you still
can’t bear to kill him.

57
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:44,487
You did use the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,723
Yes.

59
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,521
I’ve asked myself 1,000 times.

60
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,559
But I really don’t want him to die.

61
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,519
That’s why I tried to cleanse his anguish
by using the bottle.

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,879
I just wanted to bring him back.
Even if I have to lock him up forever.

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,500
But, the Vermilion Bird Bottle
almost killed him instead!

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,740
I knew you would go soft on him.

65
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,580
That’s why I helped you out.

66
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,056
I’m doing this

67
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:11,378
for your sake.

68
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,134
For my sake?

69
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:17,105
You want me to master
the Sentimental Tactics,

70
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:18,486
yet you want me to be heartless?

71
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:21,963
Isn’t this ironic? I can’t do this.

72
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,039
Senior, I’m sorry.

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,191
Xuan Ji!

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,060
Initially, I wanted us to get married

75
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,471
and let everything return to normal.

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,671
But in the end,

77
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:40,809
it was only my wishful thinking.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,832
Fine.

79
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,837
Since it has come to this,

80
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,010
let’s end this once and for all.

81
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,135
For our wedding,

82
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,740
I won’t force you
if you’re not willing to marry me.

83
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,858
I will give everyone an explanation.

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,052
But no matter what happens,

85
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:11,373
I will always be your senior.

86
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,446
Senior, you’re always the person
I respect the most.

87
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,424
Fine.

88
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,572
I hope you can remember your vow
as a protector of the secret ground.

89
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,958
Protect the Jade Cup.

90
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,189
I will never forget my responsibility.

91
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,180
I won’t let anyone acquire the Jade Cup.

92
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,459
But now, I’m afraid
that isn’t enough.

93
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:37,416
Now that the Star of Mosha
has reincarnated,

94
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,521
the secret ground is easy to be invaded
as the barrier had disappeared.

95
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,891
The Jade Cup is in a dangerous position.

96
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,407
Promise me this.

97
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:49,022
If one day, you couldn’t
protect the Jade Cup any longer,

98
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:51,448
you must destroy it yourself.

99
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,639
If not, the world will be jeopardized
once Star of Mosha obtains

100
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,881
its soul.

101
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:01,598
The Shaoyang Sect has been protecting
the Jade Cup for many years.

102
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,798
Should I really destroy it?

103
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,740
The heavens wanted to
show mercy initially.

104
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:09,860
They wanted to purify
the soul of Star of Mosha.

105
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,740
So that he may return to
heavens one day.

106
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,102
But now,

107
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,982
it seems like he has no remorse at all.

108
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,803
And he has let
the heavens down again.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,497
Since that’s the case,

110
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:28,756
we have no choice but to destroy his soul.

111
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:31,130
And only the God of War

112
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:34,004
can do that.

113
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,229
Since

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,180
you can’t bear to kill Yu Si Feng,

115
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,620
you should never let him
obtain the Jade Cup.

116
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:48,235
You need to do this in order
to protect the world

117
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:52,886
and to prevent that kid
from making further mistakes.

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,634
If that day does come,

119
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:58,693
I will destroy the Jade Cup myself.

120
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,373
I heard that you’re
going to treat me to a feast.

121
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:10,349
I even skipped my lunch for this.

122
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,702
I was waiting for this.

123
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,843
- Brother Wu.
- Don’t need to be too courteous.

124
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:21,478
Your injuries haven’t healed yet,

125
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,099
but you’re treating me to a feast already?

126
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,279
Seems like this is not a free meal, right?

127
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,508
Honestly speaking,
I have a favor

128
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,196
to ask of you.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,536
Brother Wu, actually,
I didn’t save you

130
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,197
because I wanted to revive the demon clan.

131
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:48,505
It’s because of my own selfish desire.

132
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,879
You’re pretty interesting.

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,392
Everyone else would hide
their true intentions.

134
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:03,119
But you’re funny.
You tell me immediately.

135
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,587
It’s either you’re stupid, or
you’re the smartest person around.

136
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,999
But it’s fine.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,300
No matter which type you
belong to, you’re my benefactor.

138
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,879
I’ve laid out some rules before.

139
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,420
Anyone who save me will become my brother.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,679
I will promise you three wishes.

141
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,999
And I’ll do anything to accomplish them.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,999
So, just tell me what you need.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,300
Brother Wu, please promise me that

144
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,875
you’ll not give Yuan Lang the Juntian Loop
and Chehai Hook no matter what.

145
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,700
I think

146
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,814
that’s fine.

147
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,780
But I have three questions for you.

148
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,879
First question.

149
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,239
You don’t want him
to obtain the divine weapons

150
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,615
because you don’t want him
to unseal the Jade Cup, right?

151
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,367
Yes.

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,423
Second question.

153
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,518
You’re not the reincarnation
of Star of Mosha, right?

154
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,733
Yes.

155
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,940
Just like what I’ve thought.

156
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,730
The reincarnation of Star of Mosha

157
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:11,631
will never sustain such injuries
from the malignant aura.

158
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,259
Last question.

159
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,699
You know the identity of Star of Mosha.

160
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,406
But you don’t want to revive him, right?

161
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,660
Actually,

162
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,124
I just don’t want our clan

163
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,820
to be involved in an endless war.

164
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,879
Good!

165
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,541
I like people like you.

166
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:34,759
Don’t worry.

167
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,420
I’ll never let Yuan Lang obtain
Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,460
Brother Wu, thank you.

169
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,820
Brother Wu, I have another question
for you as well.

170
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,786
Actually,

171
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,772
you don’t want the Star of Mosha
to be revived as well, am I right?

172
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,559
Star of Mosha is the lord of all demons.

173
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,060
If he is revived, he’ll
surely invade the heavens

174
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:15,124
in order to pay them back
for our humiliations.

175
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,639
That would’ve been fun.

176
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,650
But I hate it when
people order me around.

177
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,501
As the Left Lieutenant, I need to
follow his orders if he’s revived.

178
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,804
And that troubles me.

179
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,220
Why don’t we just forget it?

180
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,479
Just let him stay dead then.

181
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,849
We should just enjoy our lives
and drink to our heart’s content.

182
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,476
Thank you, Brother Wu.

183
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,942
Stop thanking me.
Aren’t you tired of it?

184
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:55,449
By the way, Brother Wu,
I have something to ask.

185
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,244
The furnace that could absorb humans’
souls, where did Yuan Lang get that?

186
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:02,465
A furnace that can absorb humans’ souls?

187
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,359
Don’t tell me it’s the Soul Furnace?

188
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,319
What’s the use of this Soul Furnace?

189
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,328
For the Soul Furnace, if
you absorb 99 souls with it,

190
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,349
it’ll form a blood formation.

191
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,999
It enables the user
to absorb the powers of live humans.

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,170
And the victim will
turn into a dry corpse.

193
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,620
So, who is Yuan Lang targeting then?

194
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,023
Don’t tell me

195
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:34,065
this power has something to do
with the revival of Star of Mosha?

196
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,380
How could I forget this?

197
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,839
God of War used her own power
to seal Star of Mosha’s soul.

198
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,839
So, in order to unseal the Jade Cup,

199
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,357
besides using Juntian Loop
and Chehai Hook,

200
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,018
we need the God of War’s power as well.

201
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,620
Don’t tell me
Yuan Lang is targeting Xuan Ji?

202
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,860
It’s no wonder he’s trying to
wake Xuan Ji’s hidden power.

203
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,541
That old bird is devious indeed.

204
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,825
He even dares to target Little Beauty.

205
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:10,340
This is bad. Xuan Ji will be in danger.

206
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,514
I mustn’t let him succeed.

207
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,647
You’re wrong.

208
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:17,399
I think you should let him succeed.

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,737
Why?

210
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:20,239
Although the furnace
is immensely powerful,

211
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,100
Yuan Lang can’t control it by himself.

212
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,668
If I’m not mistaken,

213
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:28,755
he’ll try to lure me with his words.
He needs my power.

214
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:30,216
Brother Wu, are you saying that

215
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,280
we should turn his trick against him?

216
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:38,481
And destroy the Soul Furnace
while we catch him off guard?

217
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:39,651
Yes.

218
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,260
He wants to use the furnace, right?

219
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,681
We’ll make him understand
the consequences.

220
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:49,204
And give him a taste of his own medicine.

221
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:52,585
A great plan indeed.

222
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,816
Brother Wu, sorry for the trouble.

223
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,199
You don’t need to stand on ceremony.

224
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,438
You don’t need to
deal with him on your own.

225
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,815
I want to settle my debts
with him as well.

226
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:07,500
But to make sure we
succeed in our plan,

227
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:11,378
we still need to make him trust us.

228
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,005
You’ll handle that.

229
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:16,719
I’ll handle the fight.

230
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,159
Oh right.

231
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,879
I said I would grant you three wishes.

232
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,353
You only told me one wish.
What are the other two wishes?

233
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,923
I don’t dare to be greedy.

234
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:26,799
Brother Wu, I’m satisfied
with this one wish.

235
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,019
Great!

236
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,551
I love to make friends
with people like you.

237
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:31,955
But don’t worry.

238
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:35,479
Since I’ve promised you three
wishes, I will grant all three of them.

239
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,439
It’s fine. You can take your time.

240
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
Today, we’ll drink to our heart’s content.

241
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,319
Here.

242
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,060
You are brothers now?

243
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:51,813
Wu Zhi Qi, I thought you
need to drink with someone

244
00:14:51,814 --> 00:14:53,714
for at least 10 years
before he becomes your brother?

245
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,340
Can you stay away from me?

246
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,014
No.

247
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,399
Your injuries haven’t healed yet.
Go back and sleep.

248
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,959
No. I want to look at you.

249
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,660
My injuries will heal faster
when I look at you.

250
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:12,912
Fine.

251
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,558
But don’t look at me like that.

252
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,859
You’re really ugly.

253
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,673
Turn into a fox and eat your grapes.

254
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:21,278
Why are you so heartless?

255
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,499
I’m your benefactor, you know?

256
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,422
You need to grant me three wishes
from today onward.

257
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:31,219
First, you can only praise me from now on.

258
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,366
Don’t say I’m ugly.

259
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,159
- Annoying.
- Heartless person!

260
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,591
- Unreasonable.
- You!

261
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,137
What are you laughing at?
Are you not used to it?

262
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,456
No.

263
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:46,959
I’m really envious.

264
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,060
I hope every couple in the world
will have a happy ending like you two.

265
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:54,679
What happy ending?

266
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,511
Si Feng, listen up. If you spout nonsense
like these, I’ll leave.

267
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:58,791
Don’t leave!

268
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,500
Little Si Feng, continue. I love it
when you say words like these.

269
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:04,102
You’re such a drag. He...

270
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:33,518
- What kind of lousy wine is this?
- Wu Zhi Qi?

271
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,039
When did you come in?

272
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,774
I’m here to drink and chat with you.

273
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,559
What? You don’t welcome me?

274
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,580
How dare you give me such lousy wine?

275
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,655
I was waiting for you.

276
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,876
You made me wait a long time.

277
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,020
This is what you call a wine!

278
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,937
But it’s lousier than the ones
we drank in the past.

279
00:16:56,938 --> 00:17:00,535
When we were in Demon Citadel,
we enjoyed our lives.

280
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,378
We fought the heavens
once we finish drinking.

281
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,701
Those were the days.

282
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,999
I didn’t expect you
to still remember our past.

283
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,639
Of course. I was glorious then.

284
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,639
The troops in the heavens
were trembling when they saw me.

285
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,780
I almost demolished Mount Kunlun as well.

286
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,212
We were so close to success.

287
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:23,929
We would’ve been the ruler
of the three realms

288
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,831
if it weren’t for that pesky God of War!

289
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:29,159
That’s right.

290
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,090
That damned God of War
caught me off guard.

291
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,620
I must get my revenge.

292
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,879
If only there’s a way to kill her.

293
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,418
- I’ll do anything for that.
- Is that true?

294
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,759
I’ll gather all our brothers

295
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,839
and make preparations as long as
you’re willing to do so.

296
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,518
We’ll kill the God of War first.

297
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,908
We’ll invade
the heavens after that.

298
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:52,279
Great!

299
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,113
I’ll use this chance to
tell our brothers that

300
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:58,182
I, Wu Zhi Qi, have returned.
And we’ll invade the heavens together!

301
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,761
Nice!

302
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:16,239
My king.

303
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,433
What?

304
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,641
My king, you’re not meant
to be in the human realm.

305
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,893
Now, your human body has reach its limits.

306
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:28,364
You mustn’t stay here any longer.

307
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,940
Seems like I don’t have much time.

308
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:46,024
I gave her a chance before.

309
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,009
She wanted love.

310
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,908
I used love to guide her.

311
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:52,751
But she was obsessed with it.

312
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:59,480
I tried my best to get rid of her
obsession, yet she disobeys me

313
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,201
time and time again.

314
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,234
She’s walking towards the dark abyss.

315
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,639
And I can’t bring her back.

316
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,245
Seems like

317
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:15,663
she’s not the old her anymore.

318
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,700
Now, I’m powerless.

319
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:23,999
I can never guide her back.

320
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,420
My king, are you saying that
you’re going to give up on her?

321
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,349
This tribulation was her last chance,

322
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:35,487
yet she gave up on it.

323
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,539
Since that’s the case,

324
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,860
instead of witnessing her turning into
a demon and experience endless torture,

325
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:50,364
I would rather destroy her myself.

326
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,865
My king, could you bear to do so?

327
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,580
You brought her up on your own!

328
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,540
So what if I can’t bear to part with her?

329
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,780
My only concern is the three realms.

330
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,780
This all started because of me.

331
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:13,893
I should

332
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:16,478
end it personally.

333
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,079
Yuan Lang, I didn’t expect you
to be so resourceful.

334
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,020
You gathered so many of our brothers
within a short time.

335
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,300
Brothers, thank you all for being here.

336
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:47,500
It’s all thanks to our Right Lieutenant.
He has been planning this for 1,000 years.

337
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,509
And thank you, my brothers.

338
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,770
Thank you for helping me.

339
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,639
Here.

340
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,966
Let me give you all a toast.

341
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,560
- We’ve been waiting for you.
- We’ve been waiting for you.

342
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,683
- Demon Lord, we’ll serve you forever!
- Demon Lord, we’ll serve you forever!

343
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:02,842
Bottoms up!

344
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,254
In the past,

345
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:14,209
I’ve neglected our Right
Lieutenant and let him down.

346
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:19,660
But now, I know
who’s truly loyal to me.

347
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,660
Right Lieutenant,
I hope you can forget the past.

348
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,639
My lord, you’re too courteous.

349
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,879
In the past, I neglected you because
I didn’t know your true identity.

350
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,758
Now that the truth has been revealed,

351
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,639
my lord, I will do my best to assist you.

352
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,460
I’m relieved to hear that.

353
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:41,930
Right Lieutenant had
contributed so much to our clan.

354
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,335
I should reward him.

355
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,554
In the future, Right Lieutenant

356
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,040
will govern Lize Palace.

357
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,535
My lord, I will do my best.

358
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,060
But now, the thing I hate the most

359
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:02,441
is that God of War.

360
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,712
I truly loved her in the past.

361
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:08,973
But I didn’t expect her
to be so heartless.

362
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,740
She almost killed me
with the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,394
Since that’s the case,

364
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,294
I don’t need to

365
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,140
show her mercy any longer.

366
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,119
That’s right.

367
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,759
Now, we just need to retrieve
our lord’s soul.

368
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,308
How about this?

369
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,229
Let’s attack Shaoyang Sect.

370
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,779
We’ll acquire the Jade Cup.

371
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,239
After that, we’ll try to
force the God of War

372
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,559
to unseal the Jade Cup.
What do you think?

373
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,559
That’s too reckless.

374
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,861
I’m afraid it would fail.

375
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,759
Do you have any great ideas then?

376
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,020
Are you able to make her unseal
the Jade Cup willingly?

377
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,755
Oh right, Yuan Lang, you always
come up with the greatest ideas.

378
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:51,968
Why don’t you tell us your idea?

379
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,860
My lord, if you’re worried that

380
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
the God of War is hard to deal with,

381
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:07,341
I have a formation which you could try.

382
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,343
You have a formation as powerful as that?

383
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:14,239
Do you need my help?

384
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,598
Sure.

385
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,599
If my lord and Left Lieutenant
can assist me in this,

386
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,918
that’ll be the best.

387
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,646
No problem at all. We’re brothers, right?

388
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,079
We’ll do whatever you say.

389
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,039
My lord, please give me
three days to prepare.

390
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,819
By then, I will make sure
you acquire your soul

391
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,476
and recover your strength.

392
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:36,239
And the demon clan will dominate
the three realms.

393
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,314
With Right Lieutenant’s intellect,
I’m sure this plan will succeed.

394
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:43,176
We’ll attack Shaoyang Sect in three days.

395
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:46,237
We’ll capture the God of War
and retrieve my soul.

396
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,086
This tea is delicious.

397
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,467
Come, have another cup.

398
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,832
- The tea is nice.
- That’s right.

399
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,037
Vice Palace Lord?

400
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,506
Why are you still standing there?

401
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:41,279
Do you want to stay here forever?

402
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,900
I’m saving you even though
Yu Si Feng might discover us.

403
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,921
You know what to do
when you get out, right?

404
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,250
Vice Palace Lord, thank you for saving me.

405
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,991
I’ll do anything for you.

406
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,008
Great.

407
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,976
You may rise now.

408
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:04,197
Keep an eye on Yu Si Feng these few days.

409
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:06,604
I still don’t believe in him.

410
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,465
I only believe in my men.

411
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,150
Yes.

412
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,677
Let’s go.

413
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,696
My lord!

414
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:25,599
My lord, save me!

415
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,068
My lord, please save me!

416
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:36,656
I forgot about this.

417
00:25:37,374 --> 00:25:40,439
- Our North Superintendent is still here.
- My lord,

418
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,170
I know it was my fault.

419
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:44,159
I shouldn’t act on my own accord.

420
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,171
But my lord, please give me another chance
on account of

421
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,539
my contributions to Sky Hall.

422
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,400
This time, I will surely repent!

423
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,617
You’ve said that too many times.

424
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:56,598
I don’t know when
you’re telling the truth.

425
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,919
I won’t eat my words this time!

426
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,961
If not, I will suffer
a terrible death!

427
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,389
I wanted to kill you a long time ago.

428
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,530
I wanted you to be the last sacrifice
for the Soul Furnace.

429
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:09,705
But now that I think about it,

430
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:13,197
it’s more fun for me
if I bring you somewhere.

431
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,439
Is this the abandoned Demon Citadel?

432
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,899
Why is it filled with malignant aura?

433
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,519
1,000 years ago,

434
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,260
the Asura clan of the Demon Citadel
was massacred by the God of War.

435
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:30,844
The heavens demolished
Demon Citadel in one night.

436
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:33,930
And it became deserted.

437
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:38,262
The vengeful spirits of the Asura clan
were stuck here.

438
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,003
That’s why it is filled with
malignant aura.

439
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,460
Most of the malignant aura
had dissipated as Wu Zhi Qi

440
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,555
broke the gate.

441
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:50,096
If not, we would have no way
to survive in this place.

442
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,674
Why are you here then?

443
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,004
What?

444
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,848
Are you afraid now?

445
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:01,573
You’re under my control.

446
00:27:01,574 --> 00:27:03,834
You can’t escape from me.

447
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,308
And these vengeful spirits
will soon be mine.

448
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,540
So, you’re trying to
absorb the vengeful spirits?

449
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,260
You want to use me as your stepping stone?

450
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,852
No way!

451
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,460
General Asura,

452
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,543
we’re comrades, aren’t we?

453
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:11,694
Please borrow me your body.

454
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:15,735
I’ll use it to appease your
1,000-year-old hatred.

455
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:53,469
With my soul,

456
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:59,939
I summon yours!

457
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,999
I didn’t expect

458
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,988
Yuan Lang to still hide information
about the formation

459
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:28,719
even though he mentioned it to us.

460
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,188
He’s really cunning.

461
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:33,220
Seems like he doesn’t trust us completely.

462
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,608
Look at his smug face.

463
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,439
It doesn’t matter if he trusts us or not.

464
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,895
I’m sure he still has
some tricks up his sleeves.

465
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:44,759
But it’s fine. If he wants to
obtain God of War’s power,

466
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,449
he needs our help.

467
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,830
He’ll take our bait for sure.

468
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,741
Si Feng,

469
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:08,163
I’m relieved that you’re doing well.

470
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,093
Silver Snake?

471
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:20,068
Why are you here?

472
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:22,079
You are Sky Hall’s lackey!

473
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,940
I still haven’t settled my debts with you
for hurting Si Feng!

474
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,759
Silver Snake!

475
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,195
Go away!

476
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:30,474
Don’t come near me!

477
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,380
Don’t come near me!

478
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,959
You can hit me, scold
me or even kill me.

479
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,259
You’re welcome to do so.

480
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,675
But you’ve left Si Feng for too long.

481
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:45,720
Your spirit power is very weak now.

482
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,058
I need to transfer some qi to you.

483
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,798
You don’t need to care about me!

484
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,699
I will never believe you again.

485
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,032
I’ll kill you.

486
00:31:57,331 --> 00:31:58,911
I’ll kill you!

487
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,300
Silver Snake!

488
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:09,760
Silver Snake!

489
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,048
Silver Snake!

490
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:35,706
<i>LIZE PALACE</i>

491
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,110
You’re awake?

492
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,300
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

493
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,180
I was too rash that day.

494
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,228
I shouldn’t scold you like that.

495
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,060
Since you’ve returned,
you should never

496
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,519
disobey me again.

497
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,820
If not, I’ll punish you severely.

498
00:33:37,454 --> 00:33:40,554
Master, I’ll obey
your every command,

499
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,159
except for things related to Chu Xuan Ji.

500
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,795
I will never change my mind.

501
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:46,696
If that Chu Xuan Ji tries to hurt you,

502
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,840
I will never let her off.

503
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,618
I thought you understood
something after you left me.

504
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:56,018
But if you’re still insisting on doing so,

505
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:58,195
you shouldn’t return to me.

506
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,164
I don’t have a spirit beast
as willful as you.

507
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,974
Spirit beast?

508
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,860
In your eyes, I’m only a spirit beast.

509
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,519
Master,

510
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,140
I disobeyed your command because
I didn’t want you to be hurt.

511
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,660
My heart hurts when
you suffer time and time again

512
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:29,517
due to Chu Xuan Ji.

513
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,000
Because I only have you in my heart.

514
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,454
Master,

515
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:40,259
can’t you just notice the person
who has been around you all the time?

516
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,115
Silver Snake,

517
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,815
not only are you my spirit beast,

518
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:00,302
you’re one of my most important
friends as well.

519
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,532
There’s nothing
else besides that.

520
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:06,546
If you think I’m too cruel,

521
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,820
and you don’t know how to face this,

522
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,216
you may leave me.

523
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,724
From today onward, I
allow you to leave me

524
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,660
and lead your own life.

525
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,519
Fine.

526
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,614
Yu Si Feng, you’ll regret this.

527
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,876
Just wait and see. I’ll find a way
to terminate our contract.

528
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:38,657
After that, I won’t be your spirit beast!

529
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,196
My lord.

530
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,599
Vice Palace Lord, is your formation ready?

531
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,598
I’m here to tell you just that.

532
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,238
Everything is ready.

533
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,319
My lord, we just need you
to lure Chu Xuan Ji into the formation.

534
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,679
Good.

535
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,871
Tomorrow, you and I
will attack Shaoyang Sect.

536
00:36:23,872 --> 00:36:25,218
And retrieve my soul.

537
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,798
But my lord, if we want to
obtain God of War’s power,

538
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:32,239
we need to harm Chu Xuan Ji.

539
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,701
My lord, are you
really willing to harm her?

540
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,610
I’ve shown her mercy,

541
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:44,015
yet she tried to take my life
time and time again.

542
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,940
If Left Lieutenant
didn’t save me that day,

543
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:50,835
the Vermilion Bird Bottle
would’ve killed me.

544
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:52,905
I will seek my revenge.

545
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:56,700
I’m willing to kill her for this,

546
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,522
not to mention harm her.

547
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,326
Tomorrow, during our attack,

548
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:18,639
you should make sure
Chu Xuan Ji falls into our formation.

549
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,959
- Yes.
- And, although Yu Si Feng is acting according to our plan,

550
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,723
I need to make sure that
our plan is foolproof.

551
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,451
You’re pretty tough.

552
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,528
You even became a half-demon.

553
00:37:56,529 --> 00:38:00,060
You’re a human, yet you’re trying
to acquire the demon’s power?

554
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,340
I don’t want you to die on account of

555
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:25,927
you surviving the Black Pool.

556
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,399
I’ve stabilized the demon power
inside your body.

557
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,759
How about this?

558
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,802
Coincidentally, I lack someone
who could watch over the vengeful spirits.

559
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:37,481
Follow me and acquire the Jade Cup.

560
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,919
After you accomplish your mission,

561
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,860
I’ll teach you how to master
your power. What do you think?

562
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,592
Is that for real?

563
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,220
I’m the Right Lieutenant.
I’m not an imbecile like you.

564
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,964
You’ll die anyway.

565
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:54,385
It depends on you whether

566
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,780
to cherish this chance or not.

567
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,460
<i>SHAOYANG SECT</i>

568
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,299
Xuan Ji, help me out.

569
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,920
Which one of them is better?

570
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,047
Xuan Ji?

571
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,203
Xuan Ji.

572
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,439
What’s wrong?

573
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,493
You were supposed to get married
to Senior Hao Chen.

574
00:39:37,494 --> 00:39:39,478
Why did you reject the wedding?

575
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:43,079
If not, we could’ve been married
on the same day.

576
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,399
Senior Hao Chen is my senior.

577
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,049
He’s the person I respect the most.

578
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,597
But that’s all there is to it.

579
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,578
You still can’t let go of the past?

580
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,238
No.

581
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,271
It’s just that
you’re going to get married.

582
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:03,587
I can’t bear to part with you.

583
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,890
It’s fine.

584
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:12,766
Xuan Ji, anyway, I believe that
you can find someone who loves you

585
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:15,288
and deserves your love.

586
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,167
Just like Little Six and I.

587
00:40:17,168 --> 00:40:18,540
Anyway,

588
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,305
you should stop thinking
about sad things, okay?

589
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,376
Okay.

590
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:26,893
It’s almost time.

591
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:29,559
You should doll yourself up.

592
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,035
I’ll check on the decorations.

593
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:47,484
Si Feng?

594
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:18,955
Prepare the formation.

595
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,580
The vengeful spirits of Asura has awaken.

596
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,696
Shaoyang Sect,

597
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:25,189
I will get back

598
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:27,505
what you had taken from me!

599
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,630
Vice Palace Lord is all set to go.

600
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,955
Let’s start.

601
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,745
Attack Shaoyang Sect!

602
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,881
God of War, your
power is mine now.

603
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,719
Si Feng, it’ll be too late
for you if you don’t quit!

604
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,439
Do you think I would
still fall for your trick?

605
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,660
You want me to show you mercy?
In your dreams.

606
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:23,860
This time, I won’t
show you any mercy.

607
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:26,545
Demon Lord, save your breath.

608
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,220
Set up the formation.

609
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,081
Purple Fox?

610
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:43,302
My illusion spell is pretty good, right?

611
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,660
You plotted this together?

612
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:55,222
Plot? You’re the master of plots.

613
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:57,403
We’re just using your own trick
against you.

614
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,839
Yuan Lang, you underestimated me.

615
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,599
Do you think I don’t know
what you’re up to

616
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,071
if you hide everything from me?

617
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:08,935
What do you think?
I just altered some parts,

618
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,825
and now, you’re the one being absorbed.

619
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:12,770
Are you surprised?

620
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:14,271
He who is unjust is doomed to destruction.

621
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:16,459
Since you’ve created the Soul Furnace,

622
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:20,286
you’ll have a taste of
your own medicine today.

623
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,336
Yuan Lang, stop struggling.

624
00:44:29,337 --> 00:44:31,319
You created the Soul Furnace yourself.

625
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,199
It has absorbed 99 souls.

626
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,637
It has absorbed malignant aura
as well. It is immensely powerful.

627
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:38,540
I’m afraid you can’t escape
with your weak powers.

628
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,367
Strange.

629
00:45:27,368 --> 00:45:29,108
Why do I see this tree everywhere I go?

630
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,764
Who’s behind this?

631
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,158
Dingkun Sword!

632
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,199
Don’t slash me!

633
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,820
My god! Please show me mercy!

634
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,479
Brother Liu? Why are you here?

635
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,820
Why did you trap me here?

636
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,959
It’s...

637
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,559
I...

638
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,104
Did Si Feng ask you to come?
Where is he?

639
00:45:56,718 --> 00:46:00,799
You two should settle your own problem.

640
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,319
Si Feng!

641
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,974
Si... You...
