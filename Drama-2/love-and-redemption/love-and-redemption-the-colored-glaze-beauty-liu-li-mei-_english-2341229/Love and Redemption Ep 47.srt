1
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,319
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,880
<i>EPISODE 47</i>

3
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,039
You can’t do this to me.

4
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,319
Demon Lord.

5
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,960
I did everything for you!

6
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,159
For the past 1,000 years, I’ve
stayed loyal and endured hardships

7
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,279
for your sake!

8
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Is that so?

9
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,887
But why do I only see ambition
in you instead of loyalty?

10
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,919
I did everything for you.

11
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,479
For you to conquer the three realms!

12
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,119
That does make you sound useful to me.

13
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
In that case,

14
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,760
since I am still of some
use to you, release me.

15
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,920
Unfortunately, I am not the Star of Mosha.

16
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,200
I won’t be needing you anymore.

17
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
You’ve been doubting me, haven’t you?

18
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,200
Blame your ambition for
blinding you and making you hasty.

19
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,320
You deceived me.

20
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,839
You deceived me too!

21
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,720
How dare you say I deceived you?

22
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,600
Don’t fall for his tricks.

23
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,000
We are brothers.

24
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,319
Don’t you remember, Old Wu?

25
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,799
We traveled across the
three realms, drank together

26
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,359
and serenaded together.

27
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,399
For the past 1,000 years,
in order to save you,

28
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,279
I’ve put in so much
blood, sweat and tears.

29
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,919
You can’t betray me!

30
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
You betrayed me first!

31
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,519
Why did the heavens
arrest me 1,000 years ago?

32
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,639
You think I don’t know it was you?

33
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,919
It was the God of War!

34
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,519
It’s not me!

35
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,039
Are you still denying the truth?

36
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,204
Yuan Lang.

37
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:25,279
Who instigated King Asura 1,000 years ago
to attack the heavens?

38
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,231
And when the attempt failed,
who decided to protect himself

39
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,359
by securing a celestial position
and selling me out to the heavens?

40
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,519
Listen, Yuan Lang.

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,864
I’m here to avenge my 1,000-year grudge!

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,760
Wu Zhi Qi.

43
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,000
You’ve finally avenged yourself.

44
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,440
We were brothers.

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,400
Why did we end up like this?

46
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,360
The Soul Furnace is vicious.

47
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
If it were used on Xuan Ji,

48
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,480
it would be catastrophic.

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,479
This isn’t right.

50
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,759
Why has Yuan Lang become so weak today?

51
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,839
Stupid Monkey.

52
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,640
Stop making yourself
sound all high and mighty.

53
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,479
Oh no, I’ve forgotten.

54
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,640
Yuan Lang knows clone magic.

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Look there!

56
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,359
They must be attacking Shaoyang Sect now!

57
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,119
- Let’s go.
- Little Fox.

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,919
You shouldn’t follow us,
Si Feng and I can handle this.

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Protect yourself.

60
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,039
O Vice Palace Lord.

61
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,199
Yu Si Feng.

62
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,279
Wu Zhi Qi!

63
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,999
How dare you ensnare me!

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,119
Did something go wrong with the formation?

65
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,159
Even if I haven’t received
power from the God of War,

66
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,679
I must take the Jade Cup first.

67
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,639
Then, I’d still have another chance.

68
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,999
I’m going to take the Jade Cup.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,719
You two stand guard.

70
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,519
Make sure nothing happens.

71
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
Yes, my lord.

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,159
So many years have passed.

73
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
Aren’t you giving up yet?

74
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,479
My body is deteriorating day by day.

75
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,160
I may not last much longer.

76
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,559
I need to come up with a way quickly

77
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,400
for Xuan Ji to destroy the Jade Cup.

78
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,400
The Jade Cup.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,119
An asura?

80
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,639
Weren’t the Asuras
exterminated 1,000 years ago?

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,359
I am merely borrowing this body
to take the Jade Cup.

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,959
Anyone who blocks my way shall die!

83
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,079
Hand it over.

84
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,400
As long as I am here,

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,879
you shall not prevail!

86
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,199
When you took the Vermilion Bird Bottle,

87
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,559
I’ve already had an idea of who you are.

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,159
Not many people in
the three realms are capable

89
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,519
of taking the mythical treasures
in the heavens.

90
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Unfortunately, with your current
strength, you cannot defeat me!

91
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,999
Senior Hao Chen.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,640
I’ve brought you some
wine from my wedding.

93
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,320
Senior Hao Chen.

94
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,479
Wine? What wine?

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
Wu Tong?

96
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,320
Don’t you dare wreak havoc
in Shaoyang Sect!

97
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,079
Why are you wearing a wedding robe?

98
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,559
Who are you marrying?

99
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,999
Don’t you know whom I’m marrying?

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,839
I, Zhong Min Yan,
will only marry Ling Long.

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
Ling Long will only marry me!

102
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Ling Long is mine.

103
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,319
No one can snatch her away from me!

104
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,560
She’s mine!

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,599
- Min Yan!
- Ling Long!

106
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,679
Min Yan!

107
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,879
Don’t give chase.

108
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,239
You’re injured.

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,360
Ruo Yu.

110
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,759
You’re really alive.

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,600
So, what Si Feng said was all true.

112
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,159
And I treated you as my best friend.

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,520
You don’t deserve it!

114
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,199
Yes.

115
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,439
It was me who tricked you
to steal the spirit keys

116
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,959
and set Si Feng up.

117
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,119
Also, I was the one
who injured Elder Chu Ying Hong.

118
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,280
It wasn’t Si Feng.

119
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:39,200
So...

120
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,919
So it was you who injured
Elder Chu Ying Hong.

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Min Yan.

122
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,719
Yes, I have done all wrong and sinned.

123
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,719
That’s why I cannot see you die today.

124
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,159
Wu Tong is already half-demon,
you can’t defeat him.

125
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,639
I’ll go.

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,680
I won’t let him get near Ling Long.

127
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Min Yan.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,479
Ruo Yu.

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,079
Listen carefully.

130
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,119
I’ll get you for everything you’ve done.

131
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,239
Min Yan!

132
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
Min Yan, come back!

133
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,559
You’ve always meddled in my business.

134
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,239
I shall not spare you!

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,280
Leave him to me.

136
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
I sense demonic aura.

137
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Dingkun Sword!

138
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Someone is taking the Jade Cup!

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,720
Min Yan, you’re back.

140
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,320
What took you so long
at Hao Chen’s place?

141
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,279
What are you waiting for?

142
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,760
Remove my veil.

143
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,280
My dear Ling Long.

144
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,799
Are you so eager for me to unveil you?

145
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Scram.

146
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,480
Scram off!

147
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
I was the one who unveiled you.

148
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,760
You are now my bride.

149
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,720
I’m bringing you back home.

150
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,079
Why are you still haunting me?

151
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,239
Put me down!

152
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Scram!

153
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,820
Let go of me!

154
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:51,879
- Let go of me!
- Wu Tong!

155
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Let go of Ling Long!

156
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Min Yan.

157
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Min Yan!

158
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,879
Ling Long.

159
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,159
Zhong Min Yan.

160
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,759
Ling Long won’t follow me because of you.

161
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,760
As long as you’re dead,
Ling Long will be all mine!

162
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
No.

163
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:21,681
No.

164
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,760
Don’t kill him. Min Yan!

165
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Min Yan!

166
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,039
Let’s see how you can stop me now.

167
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,399
Dream on.

168
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,959
Don’t you ever take
Ling Long away from me!

169
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,120
Min Yan.

170
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
Let go of him.

171
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,440
You’d kill yourself like this.

172
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Wu Tong.

173
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,160
Please let go of him.

174
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
I beg you.

175
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,552
Please let go of him.

176
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:02,839
I’ll follow you back.

177
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,519
Please let go of him.

178
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,359
Don’t hurt him anymore.

179
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,319
I beg you.

180
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,039
Ling Long, don’t beg him.

181
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Ling Long.

182
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,640
To think you will follow me
back just for him.

183
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Fine.

184
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,759
I’ll still kill him anyway
so you’ll give up on him!

185
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,960
No!

186
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,439
Min Yan.

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
Min Yan.

188
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,520
- I’m sorry.
- I will be back to marry you.

189
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Father.

190
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,799
Min Yan.

191
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,760
Min Yan, how are you?

192
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,359
Ling Long.

193
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,760
Don’t be scared.

194
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,240
I will always stay by your side.

195
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,799
Min Yan!

196
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,959
Min Yan, wake up!

197
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,399
Min Yan!

198
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,919
It’s our wedding night.

199
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,440
You can’t leave me like this.

200
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,519
I won’t let you leave.

201
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,199
Don’t leave me like this.

202
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,719
Min Yan is seriously injured.

203
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,999
Take him to his room, now!

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,160
Min Yan.

205
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
Oh no. Someone is taking the Jade Cup.

206
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,520
This is bad.
Hao Chen is alone in the secret ground.

207
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,479
Si Feng.

208
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,799
This huge Asura is an undead spirit.

209
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,279
He is vulnerable to sunlight.

210
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,359
The golden light from
your Rose Gold Bird Wings

211
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,079
is similar to sunlight.

212
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Kill him.

213
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,759
As a Rose Gold Bird yourself,

214
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,999
you shall die from
the power of your own clan.

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,760
It’s a perfect ending for you!

216
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,400
It’s finally over.

217
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Yuan Lang.

218
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,480
I guess our 1,000-year grudge is settled.

219
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,520
Now that we’ve removed
this monster here,

220
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,680
you can finally explain
everything to Little Pretty.

221
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I’ve been waiting

222
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
so long for this.

223
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,880
What? You still care about this guy?

224
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,998
He’s Xuan Ji’s senior, after all.

225
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,880
I didn’t know you’re so kind.

226
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,919
I’m not trying to be a saint.

227
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,399
But if I don’t save him,

228
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,559
Xuan Ji will blame me
for the rest of her life.

229
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,480
I don’t want to carry this sin.

230
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,599
Besides, if her senior testifies for me,

231
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,799
I can explain everything to Xuan Ji.

232
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,119
You punk.

233
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,760
That’s a clever plan.

234
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Senior Hao Chen.

235
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,240
What’s going on?

236
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,920
Yu Si Feng.

237
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,560
Stop wasting your energy.

238
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,120
You are a good actor, Star of Mosha.

239
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,560
You’re trying to use this chance
to conquer the demons, right?

240
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,039
Regardless of your goals, do you
think what you’re doing is useful?

241
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,240
You’re just wasting your efforts.

242
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,919
What do you mean?

243
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,000
Senior Hao Chen!

244
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,120
Senior Hao Chen!

245
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,159
Senior!

246
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,159
Xuan Ji is in this state because of you!

247
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,479
- Where are you?
- Since there’s no return,

248
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,360
let me lend your identity
as the Star of Mosha!

249
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,520
Sect Leader!

250
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Senior!

251
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,720
You demon.

252
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,160
Even if you kill me,

253
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,800
you’ll never take the Jade Cup!

254
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,599
Senior!

255
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Senior!

256
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Senior!

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,920
Senior!

258
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:12,719
Senior!

259
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,159
You demon!

260
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,800
How dare you attack Hao Chen?

261
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,640
You people are an unreasonable bunch.

262
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,320
My brother was helping him.

263
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Senior Hao Chen.

264
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,319
I’m here to kill the undead Asura spirit.

265
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,519
I’m here to save you.

266
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,760
Why are you maligning me
when you know this?

267
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,720
Yu Si Feng wants to take the Jade Cup.

268
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,960
I can’t let him get his way.

269
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,400
You trusted the wrong person.

270
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,479
Senior!

271
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Senior!

272
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,999
You’ll be fine.

273
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
I’ll heal your wounds now.

274
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,080
Xuan Ji, that’s not it.

275
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,560
Don’t waste your spiritual power.

276
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,159
Xuan Ji.

277
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,639
Why didn’t you listen to me?

278
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,040
Everything has gone so awry now.

279
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,580
You’ll be fine, Senior.

280
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:23,648
I’ll listen to you.

281
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:26,039
I’ll listen to you, Senior!

282
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,599
I’ll listen to you.

283
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,920
It’s too late.

284
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,199
Xuan Ji, that’s not what happened.

285
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,679
When I reached here, your
senior was already seriously injured.

286
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,959
I saw the undead spirit attacking
him, so I decided to strike.

287
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,039
The spirit was possessed
by Yuan Lang’s soul.

288
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,640
He was here to take the Jade Cup!

289
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,119
When I finally killed him,

290
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,439
your senior...

291
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,000
I wanted to save him!

292
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,560
Promise me.

293
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,040
Destroy the Jade Cup.

294
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,800
Don’t let the demons get their way.

295
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Senior.

296
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,320
Promise me.

297
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,759
- Senior.
- Promise me.

298
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,879
I promise you.

299
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,119
I promise you, Senior.

300
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,199
I promise you.

301
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,639
I promise you, Senior.

302
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,199
Senior!

303
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,240
Sect Leader!

304
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
Senior!

305
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Senior.

306
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Senior!

307
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,520
Senior!

308
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,697
Senior!

309
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,840
Senior!

310
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,544
Senior!

311
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,120
Yu Si Feng.

312
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,654
You killed my senior.

313
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:18,295
Xuan Ji, I didn’t kill him.

314
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,248
Trust me!

315
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,760
When I knew you’re a demon,

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,560
I chose to trust you.

317
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:34,937
When you trespassed upon
our secret ground,

318
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,400
I trusted you too.

319
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,974
Even when I knew
you’re the Star of Mosha,

320
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:42,059
I still hoped that you would change.

321
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,904
I trusted you time and again.

322
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,265
And now?

323
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,600
My loved ones are hurt because of you!

324
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,734
You injured Auntie Ying Hong.

325
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:54,029
You killed my master and my senior.

326
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,870
How can I still trust you?

327
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Si Feng!

328
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Si Feng!

329
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,279
Xuan Ji.

330
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,919
I’m not the Star of Mosha.

331
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,800
I’ve never hurt anyone.

332
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,960
I came here today to kill Yuan Lang.

333
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,759
Now that Yuan Lang is no longer here,

334
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,360
no one can threaten the Jade Cup now.

335
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,520
I can tell you everything I’ve done.

336
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,520
Think about it.

337
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,320
If I did kill your loved ones,

338
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,724
why didn’t I run away?

339
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,325
Why did I stay here?

340
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,254
You think Hao Chen can stop me?

341
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,759
Shut up!

342
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Si Feng!

343
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Xuan Ji.

344
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,320
What should I say to make you trust me?

345
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,200
Have we ever trusted each other?

346
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,120
Senior Hao Chen was right.

347
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,680
I shouldn’t have
searched for my six senses.

348
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,720
Had I not done so,

349
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,560
I wouldn’t feel so painful
as I face you now.

350
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Yu Si Feng.

351
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
I regret meeting you.

352
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,440
Xuan Ji.

353
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,800
I regret taking the brunt
for you at Fuyu Island.

354
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,880
I regret loving you.

355
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,280
I regret everything
that happened between us.

356
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,680
I’d rather

357
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,800
not have anything to do with you, ever!

358
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,960
Si Feng!

359
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Si Feng.

360
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,800
I finally understand

361
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:11,665
why my past nine lives ended so.

362
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,720
Chu Xuan Ji.

363
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
You are after all

364
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,160
a heartless woman.

365
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,600
If I don’t have a heart,

366
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,160
I won’t feel pain.

367
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:46,489
For the years to come

368
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,680
and even lives to come,

369
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
I don’t want to see you again.

370
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,039
Si Feng, stop messing around.

371
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,520
You’re dying!

372
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
God of War.

373
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,839
To think I treated you as a friend
for the past 1,000 years.

374
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,880
Has time dulled your wits?

375
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,560
You’re a bore.

376
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,560
A real bore!

377
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,640
Si Feng, let’s go.

378
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,777
Hao Chen.

379
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:43,799
Hao Chen!

380
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,880
Sect Leader!

381
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Sect Leader!

382
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:59,073
- Sect Leader!
- Hao Chen!

383
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Hao Chen!

384
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,559
Sect Leader!

385
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,719
Hao Chen!

386
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,080
Sect Leader!

387
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,559
Xuan Ji.

388
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,840
Do you really want
to practice martial arts?

389
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,359
Will you follow me to
Xuyang Peak for training?

390
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,799
Xuyang Peak?

391
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,559
You are born with the talent
of eradicating demons.

392
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,999
You are also destined
to guard the secret ground.

393
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,359
Senior.

394
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,879
What does it mean to guard
the secret ground?

395
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,879
It is a mission borne by us,
the disciples of Xuyang Peak.

396
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,720
Our task is to guard
the secret ground with our lives.

397
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,199
You are the God of War, nemesis of evil.

398
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,080
You shouldn’t have fallen for him.

399
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,920
You’re just misguided by mortal desires.

400
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,440
It was him who planted
the seed of pain in you.

401
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,999
That’s right.

402
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,120
I am the Star of
Mosha, Rahu Ketu.

403
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,880
You think I’m just here for the Jade Cup,

404
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,160
but I’m actually here
to kill the God of War.

405
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,999
Xuan Ji.

406
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,959
Have you forgotten about
your mother and your master’s deaths?

407
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,687
Have you forgotten about
Elder Ying Hong’s injury?

408
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:06,200
Do you want to see him wreak
havoc or attack our brethren instead?

409
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,399
Yu Si Feng.

410
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,919
You broke your promise again.

411
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,079
Is there any shred of truth in your words?

412
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,719
He’s the one who should die.

413
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,039
Xuan Ji, don’t mind us!

414
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,686
Seize this chance
and kill the Star of Mosha!

415
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,847
Kill the sinful demons
in Lize Palace once and for all!

416
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,760
Why didn’t you listen to me?

417
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,640
Everything has gone so awry now.

418
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,680
Promise me.

419
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,359
Destroy the Jade Cup.

420
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,519
Don’t let the demons get their way.

421
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,574
I promise you.

422
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:52,159
I promise you, senior.

423
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,560
- Senior!
- Sect Leader!

424
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,920
Senior Hao Chen.

425
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
I’m sorry.

426
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,200
Everything started
because of the Jade Cup.

427
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,160
It’s all the cup’s fault.

428
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,663
I will destroy it.

429
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,080
<i>IN MEMORY OF HAO YANG</i>

430
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,359
Where are we?

431
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,639
We are at Fenru City’s
Path of Reincarnation.

432
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,360
You’re already dead.

433
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
Don’t jest, Brother Wu.

434
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,519
I say, you punk.

435
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,079
You didn’t even strike back when
that girl was about to kill you.

436
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,240
You’re a fool, aren’t you?

437
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,840
I’m probably the biggest fool
in the whole wide world.

438
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,239
In the end, it’s all wishful
thinking in my part.

439
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,559
So what’s your plan next?

440
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,800
Are you really ignoring her?

441
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,560
She said she regrets meeting me.

442
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,840
She regrets everything
that happened between us.

443
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,440
What else can I say?

444
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,080
Let’s go back to Lize Palace.

445
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,440
I have much work to do there.

446
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Sure.

447
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,359
The divine weapon is wailing.

448
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,399
Something must be happening
to the soul of Star of Mosha.

449
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,720
It’s in danger.

450
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,840
The soul of Star of Mosha
is sealed inside the Jade Cup.

451
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,040
Who can touch the Jade Cup

452
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,960
and threaten the Star of Mosha?

453
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,720
The God of War.

454
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,359
Before he died, Hao Chen told
Xuan Ji to destroy the Jade Cup

455
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,160
and erase the soul of Star of Mosha.

456
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,280
If the soul of Star of Mosha
is so easily destroyed,

457
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,039
those from the heavens
would have struck a long time ago.

458
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,799
They wouldn’t have to wait till now.

459
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,399
Everything happens for a reason.

460
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,639
I think that shameless pact from heavens

461
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,520
must have done something disastrous
towards the soul of Star of Mosha.

462
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,439
That’s why the soul
is filled with hatred.

463
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,239
It’s indestructible.

464
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,560
Although Xuan Ji has
the power of the God of War,

465
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,399
I think that
even if she sacrifices herself,

466
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
she still can’t destroy it.

467
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Guard!

468
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,759
Yu Si Feng, you stubborn demon.

469
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,999
How dare you trespass again?

470
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,039
Move.

471
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,679
I cannot hurt the innocent.

472
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,119
I want to save Xuan Ji!

473
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,199
Star of Mosha.

474
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,199
Today is the day you die.

475
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,999
Don’t you dare approach the Jade Cup!

476
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,119
Take him down!

477
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,159
Stop!

478
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,919
Listen, old man.

479
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,030
Xuan Ji can’t destroy
the soul of Star of Mosha.

480
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,030
Look at her!

481
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Xuan Ji.

482
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,280
Why are you doing this to me?

483
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,080
I won’t let you off.

484
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:40,639
Xuan Ji looks awful now.

485
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,439
- What should we do?
- Why is this happening?

486
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,759
Hao Chen did say that

487
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,479
Xuan Ji is the only one who can
destroy the soul of Star of Mosha.

488
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,079
Yu Si Feng, you must
have done something!

489
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,599
I told you, he didn’t!

490
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,039
What? You don’t believe me?

491
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,519
If that stinky woman destroys
the soul of Star of Mosha,

492
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,919
she’ll die as well.

493
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,119
Hao Chen said she’s the only one
who can destroy the soul

494
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,360
not because she’s
the God of War, but because...

495
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,200
Because what? Tell us.

496
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,908
She’s the...

497
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,051
She’s the one sealed inside...

498
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,279
Even the gods are
forbidding me from speaking.

499
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,639
It’s okay.

500
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,519
I have a jade inscription
about the God of War.

501
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,920
Read it and you’ll know.

502
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,000
Can’t I let them read too?

503
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:35,679
You people from the heavens
just love being sneaky and mysterious.

504
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,546
Shut up, who do you think you are?

505
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,999
You have no right
to comment on our affairs.

506
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,373
If it weren’t for
Hao Chen’s interference...

507
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:44,289
Hao Chen?

508
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,559
How did Hao Chen know that Xuan Ji

509
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,000
is the only one who can destroy
the soul of Star of Mosha?

510
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,319
Xuan Ji!

511
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Stop him!

512
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,260
Fool, you can’t beat him!

513
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:40,942
- Let me go.
- Don’t risk yourself!

514
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:42,239
I can’t afford to wait!

515
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,119
You can’t do anything, Si Feng!

516
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,919
Who is she? No one can battle him
other than she herself.

517
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,119
No, there must be another way.

518
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,960
I can’t let her die like this!

519
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Flying Snake!

520
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,119
Flying Snake!

521
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,720
I know you have another solution.

522
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
Tell me!

523
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,879
The divine weapons.

524
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,839
It used to be a part
of the Star of Mosha.

525
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,679
You can absorb its powers
to battle the Jade Cup.

526
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,159
No, Si Feng, you’re not a demon.

527
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,479
You can’t absorb all the powers
in the divine weapons.

528
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,800
This ape has a point.

529
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,119
If you do that, the
weapons’ powers will kill you.

530
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,640
I have only one question,
what’s the procedure?

531
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,040
Tell me!

532
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,879
The Rose Gold Birds absorb energy
below the ribs, right?

533
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,199
Stab the divine weapons there.

534
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,879
Shut up, you stupid snake!

535
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,319
I won’t let you do this, Si Feng.

536
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,399
Brother Wu.

537
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,119
You promised me three favors.

538
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,639
I can’t let you die!

539
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,760
Brother Wu, I’m begging you!

540
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,279
Fine.

541
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,480
I can’t stop you if that’s what you wish.

542
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Xuan Ji.

543
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Xuan Ji.

544
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,519
Oh no!

545
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,400
The soul of Star of Mosha is about
to gush out from the Jade Cup!

546
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,759
Flying Snake.

547
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,160
Please take care of Xuan Ji.

548
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,200
Si Feng, are you trying to kill yourself?

549
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,120
He’s using his wings
to reseal the Jade Cup.

550
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,039
Si Feng.

551
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Si Feng!

552
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,120
I’m fine.

553
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Flying Snake.

554
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,520
Don’t tell her what happened today.

555
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,760
Please.

556
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,600
From now on,

557
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,600
she is just a woman called Chu Xuan Ji.

558
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Brother Wu.

559
00:43:21,336 --> 00:43:22,359
Let’s go.

560
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,840
Very well, Si Feng.

561
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,759
The Star of Mosha
will bring calamity someday.

562
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,719
They must be still near, let’s go!

563
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,119
You’re an idiotic bunch!

564
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,559
Can’t you understand?

565
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,039
What are you after now?

566
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,959
It was Si Feng who saved Xuan Ji.

567
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,079
It was also Si Feng who resealed
the Jade Cup that you almost opened.

568
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,759
It was also Si Feng who killed Yuan Lang

569
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,759
so he won’t release the Star of
Mosha and destroy the three realms.

570
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,119
Right now, you’re still standing here,

571
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,999
and all is peaceful in the three realms.

572
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,159
And it was Si Feng the demon
who mended your mistakes.

573
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,719
If he is the Star of Mosha,
what can he get from this?

574
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,240
Can’t you think about it?

575
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
It’s over.

576
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,640
It’s all over.

577
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,288
You haven’t told me where my sister is.

578
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,680
How can you die like that?

579
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,000
I deceived the elders and our clansmen.

580
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,720
I no longer have spiritual power
to lead the Rose Gold Birds.

581
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
Elder Luo.

582
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,159
I shall leave this in your hands.

583
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,360
No, please don’t.

584
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,759
It is often said that we Rose Gold Birds
are violent and bloodthirsty.

585
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,719
But we want nothing
other than a peaceful life.

586
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,479
It’s just that our pact
with the demons still stand.

587
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,119
Of course we need
to follow through our promise.

588
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,439
Just now, you mentioned that
you are not the demon lord,

589
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,959
and you do not intend
to destroy the three realms,

590
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,000
so we do not have to fight for it.

591
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,320
This is a huge relief for all of us.

592
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,679
You are still the
12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird,

593
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,279
and you’ve been planning
the best for our clansmen,

594
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,839
seeking a safe sanctuary
for us to live in.

595
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:03,120
May I ask if there’s anyone else
who can lead the Rose Gold Birds?

596
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,719
You should keep the medallions.

597
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,720
Elder Luo.

598
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,080
- Actually, I...
- That’s enough.

599
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,839
Our clan still acknowledge you
as our leader.

600
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,359
Why are you still denying it?

601
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Exactly, so please don’t worry.

602
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,359
I will manage the clan with
the other three elders

603
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,199
and await your return.

604
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,040
I shall take my leave.

605
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,920
I wanted to pass
this position to Elder Luo.

606
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,200
Brother Liu, why did you stop me?

607
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,320
If I didn’t stop you,

608
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,999
I’d have to see you
bang your head on the wall,

609
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,879
put a Loveless Curse on yourself
and pretend to be the Star of Mosha

610
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,331
until you’re half-dead.

611
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:58,679
Now, I even have to see you
pass all your duties to someone

612
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,679
and find a place to die alone.

613
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,040
Isn’t that what you’re thinking,
Little Phoenix?
