00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,260
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,880
<i>EPISODE 11</i>

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,479
Kunyin Pill.

4
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,439
I made it myself.

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,180
I’m almost there.

6
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,119
Burn with Zhuyu Grass.

7
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,298
I’ve seen it before.

8
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,676
Where is it?

9
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:53,679
<i>KUNYIN PILL</i>

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,120
This is it.

11
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,585
Master.

12
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,839
Master.

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,337
Help me, Master.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,608
Ling Shi!

15
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:16,559
Sect Leader.

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,599
Where did you get this evil pill manual?

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,005
My disciples have become
like this because of it!

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,039
Sect Leader, I was wrong.

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,079
This has always been a trap!

20
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,882
They said this Kunyin Pill
could increase one’s skills.

21
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,424
And it’s true.

22
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:38,199
But unexpectedly, if one
doesn’t keep taking it, he’ll die!

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,830
Who are they?

24
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,839
Sky Hall.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,679
It’s that bunch of evildoers at Sky Hall!
I fell into their trap!

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,270
- They covet the spirit keys.
- You...

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,307
My disciples are in deep water
because of you!

28
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,319
Leave.

29
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,759
You’re no longer part of Xuanyuan Sect!

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,439
Sect Leader!

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,799
Please give me a few more days.

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,719
I’ll definitely produce the Kunyin Pill.

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,439
Our sect will be saved then.

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,199
Otherwise, Sky Hall will
attack our sect in three days.

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,679
There’s no way we can resist them!

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,239
Shut up!

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,439
- Master!
- Sect Leader.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,759
It seems that Sky Hall
is coming for the spirit keys.

39
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,608
For now, our disciples are
being controlled by Kunyin Pill.

40
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:24,839
I think we should ask
the other four sects for help.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,658
Since our sect has taken the pill,
how could we ask for their help?

42
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,258
But we can’t bow down to evil.

43
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:40,999
We can only solve this problem
by fighting to the death Ming Di.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,620
Get ready for the war.

45
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:53,799
Ling Long!

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,239
Ling Long, let me explain, please.

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,622
- There’s nothing to explain.
- Can you stop being so stubborn?

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,810
Yes, I am stubborn.

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,735
Ling Long!

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,588
She runs around whenever she’s mad.

51
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,159
Kid, why are you here alone?

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,559
- What’s wrong?
- Sister.

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,119
I live on the mountain.

54
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,720
My father is sick.
I came down to pick some herbs.

55
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,034
But I can’t go back
because I’ve sprained my foot.

56
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:46,439
Father must be very worried.
But it hurts so much!

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,839
Don’t cry.

58
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,479
- I’ll get you home, okay?
- You’re not a bad person, aren’t you?

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,759
Father said there’re
demons who trick children

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,959
by turning themselves into
beautiful sisters.

61
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,318
I’m not a demon. I’ll get you home, okay?

62
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,619
Come.

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,534
Come.

64
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,719
You’re quite heavy.

65
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,143
Anyway, where’s your home?

66
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,752
It’s in the forest ahead.

67
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,670
That’s a demon spirit.

68
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,879
Ling Long.

69
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,951
Ling Long. Wake up, Ling Long.

70
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,561
Something’s wrong with this rain.

71
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:32,210
Ling Long, let’s get out of here.

72
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,879
Yu Er.

73
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,379
Someone’s trying to seize my prey.

74
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,794
That gives us one more prey.

75
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,180
Min Yan!

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,380
Chu Xuan Ji.

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,538
Chu Xuan Ji.

78
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:30,165
Chu Xuan Ji.

79
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,959
What?

80
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,599
Are you recovered?

81
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,475
It’s time to set off for Xuanyuan Sect.

82
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,919
Si Feng.

83
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,159
I’ve got a stomachache.

84
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,319
I can’t get up.
Let’s not go to Xuanyuan Sect today.

85
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,759
We’ll do it tomorrow.

86
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,983
You can’t feel pain, can you?

87
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,959
I’m not feeling well.

88
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,399
And I feel weak.

89
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,439
Si Feng, since I can’t get up,
let’s just go there tomorrow.

90
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,255
Are you not feeling well?

91
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,799
All the more reason
why we should go there.

92
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,879
Let Sect Leader Zhu Shi check on you.

93
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,679
We can’t delay it.

94
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,153
I’m not going!

95
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,959
Si Feng!

96
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,357
Si Feng!

97
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,999
- Si Feng.
- What’s the matter?

98
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,599
I saw Ling Long and Min Yan
went out in the early morning.

99
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,319
I thought they’d be back very soon.

100
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,940
But it’s already noon.
And they aren’t back yet.

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,719
What did you say?
They’ve been out since this morning?

102
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,652
Si Feng,
did something happen to them?

103
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,599
Let’s go look for them.

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,359
Shaoyang Sect is really something.

105
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,159
He was hugging you yesterday night.

106
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,239
And he’s run away with
your sister this morning.

107
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,679
Si Feng, I think
we should stay out of this.

108
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,199
Let’s settle the problem
of Aoyin Band first.

109
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,452
No, I don’t find this urgent at all.

110
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,839
Ruo Yu.

111
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,279
Which direction did they go?

112
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,079
The went in the direction of
the forest at the west of Longshu Town.

113
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,754
Forest?

114
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,795
Are Ling Long and Sixth Senior in there?

115
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,199
Sixth Senior left this secret mark
with his Cangming Sword.

116
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,919
Is Ling Long with him? Are they in danger?

117
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,472
This is a strange place.
Let’s look separately for them.

118
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,512
Si Feng, are you alright?

119
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,186
It’s my fault.

120
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,334
It’s all my fault.

121
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,334
It’s not me.

122
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,679
Why are we back here?

123
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,153
Are we going around in circles?

124
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,129
Si Feng.

125
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,919
What’s wrong, Si Feng?

126
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,333
Si Feng.

127
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,246
Yan Ran.

128
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,420
Ruo Yu.

129
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,239
What’s going on?

130
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,773
Si Feng.

131
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,759
The four idiots have taken the bait.

132
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,100
Let’s take them back
and feed on their blood.

133
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,673
Si Feng!

134
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,639
Si Feng.

135
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,079
Wake up, Si Feng.

136
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,372
Si Feng.

137
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,199
Si Feng.

138
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,999
Si Feng!

139
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,199
What do I do?

140
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,269
Let’s try Si Feng’s Antipoison Pill.

141
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,839
It should be okay to have one.

142
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,159
This doesn’t seem to be it.

143
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,994
This should be it.

144
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:40,555
What are you doing?

145
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,776
I gave you water and pill.

146
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,033
Here’s what happened, Si Feng.

147
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,159
You got caught in the rain in that forest.

148
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,693
And you lost your consciousness
and couldn’t wake up.

149
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,839
I found this Antipoison Pill with you.

150
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,239
I thought you’d be get well by having it.

151
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,479
Don’t get mad, please.

152
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,775
I’m glad that you’re up.

153
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,778
You gave me this?

154
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,734
Isn’t this Antipoison Pill?

155
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:12,599
It’s not.

156
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,519
This is Truth Pill.

157
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,439
It took Lizhe Palace hundreds
of years to come up with one.

158
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,319
How could you waste such a precious thing?

159
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,400
Did...

160
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,584
Did I give you the wrong pill?

161
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,159
Will it affect you?

162
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,719
You fool.

163
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,239
Of course it’ll affect me.

164
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,039
Then... This... Fool?

165
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,365
Is the Truth Pill starting to take effect?

166
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,635
Oh no!

167
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,292
I’m in trouble.

168
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:51,999
You’re right.

169
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,719
I’m a fool.

170
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,959
And I always cause trouble for you.

171
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,067
That’s why you’re avoiding me.

172
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,679
No.

173
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,279
I’ve never seen you as a burden.

174
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,278
And I’ve never thought of avoiding you.

175
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,412
In my heart,

176
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:13,919
I’ve always wanted to be with you.

177
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,817
Really?

178
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,439
Then why did you...
Forget about the past.

179
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,399
I’m telling the truth.

180
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,879
Don’t you know what you gave me?

181
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,171
I...

182
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,079
I gave you the Truth Pill.

183
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,839
Are you telling the truth, Si Feng?

184
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,879
Yes.

185
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,334
I’ll answer your questions with truths.

186
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,652
From now on, stop talking to me.

187
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,919
Si Feng, why can’t I talk to you?

188
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,759
Because you don’t want to
tell me the truth, do you?

189
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,500
Did you lie to me?

190
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,254
That’s right.

191
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:57,559
I wasn’t telling the truth.

192
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,799
Chu Xuan Ji.

193
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,655
Don’t go too far.

194
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,479
I don’t.

195
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,479
I just want to know

196
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,119
if you meant it when you said that
you don’t want to see me

197
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,216
and refuse to be my friend?

198
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,483
That’s not the truth!

199
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:13,779
Ever since I met you,

200
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,660
I’ve been lying to myself.

201
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,039
I want to see you so badly.

202
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,220
You’re my most important friend.
And I don’t want to lose you.

203
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,706
I knew it. You haven’t changed, Si Feng.

204
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:33,639
But Si Feng,

205
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,660
why did you say that we should
stay away from each other?

206
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,839
If you ever fall in love again,

207
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,079
the Loveless Curse will grow in your body.

208
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,359
There’ll be three Green Feather marks
on your wrist.

209
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,519
Whenever you get hurt by love,

210
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,479
each Green Feather mark will turn into
a Red Feather on your chest.

211
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,149
When all three Green Feather marks
turn into Red Feather marks,

212
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,462
your blood will flow backwards.
And you’ll die.

213
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,386
Because...

214
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,730
Because... Because I...

215
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,252
I...

216
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,759
Because of what?

217
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,231
Say it.

218
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,128
Si Feng.

219
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,093
Because...

220
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:34,469
Go ahead.

221
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,325
Say it, Si Feng. I want to hear the truth.

222
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,177
- Because...
- Because... Because...

223
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,186
Because it’s none of your business.

224
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,399
Si Feng, has the pill effect gone away?

225
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,119
Why so soon?

226
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,719
I should’ve asked you more questions.

227
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,823
That’s very inappropriate of you.

228
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,719
Was it inappropriate?

229
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,394
Now that I know the truth,
you can’t lie to me anymore.

230
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,079
I think we should concern about others.

231
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,279
The rain in the forest
is probably strange.

232
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,166
It makes one lose his consciousness.

233
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,269
It gives one hallucinations and
makes him succumb to them.

234
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,719
Maybe it’s because I
wasn’t born with six senses.

235
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,738
This rain doesn’t affect me.

236
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,337
Who’s that?

237
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,879
Xuan Ji?

238
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,260
Si Feng?

239
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,199
I knew it. Demon spirits wait
the humans to lose their will

240
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,079
before capturing them with the blood vine.

241
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,919
Ling Long, that’s smart of you.

242
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,971
You kept yourself out of the rain
with this farmer’s hat.

243
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,799
Do you know the whereabouts
of Min Yan and others?

244
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,559
I can’t find Little Six anywhere.

245
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,919
And I don’t know what
this demon spirit is up to.

246
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,827
But I saw someone
being hanged upon a tree.

247
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,639
Judging from his outfit,
he seemed to come from a nearby village.

248
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,345
It seemed that he’s hanged to death
without any struggle.

249
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:27,199
Are Sixth Senior, Ruo Yu,
and Yan Ran in grave danger?

250
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,239
He’s hanged upon the tree with the vine.

251
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,919
Did you see anything else on the tree?

252
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,791
Nothing at all.

253
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,639
Si Feng, do you have any clue?

254
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,839
The vine.

255
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,279
The bewitching rain.

256
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,349
That reminds me of something.

257
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,519
- What is it?
- Jialuo blood vine.

258
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,199
It can release a kind of bewitching rain

259
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,079
which gives humans hallucinations.

260
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,119
It then wraps itself around them
and drink their blood.

261
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,119
It eventually bears Jialuo blood fruits.

262
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,359
The fruits can make a cultivator powerful.

263
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,679
Someone is coveting blood fruits.

264
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,159
That’s why he planted the blood vine.

265
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,679
That means they’re going to
drink Little Six’s blood.

266
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,599
- What do we do?
- Don’t panic.

267
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,359
Ling Long, we can’t delay anymore.

268
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,279
Let’s make some farmer’s hats first.

269
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,593
They can keep us dry.
We’ll go look for them afterwards.

270
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:49,279
Do you remember you once told
me that you’ll dote on me, love me,

271
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,159
and adore me?

272
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,959
I do.

273
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,839
Do you remember you
told me on our wedding day

274
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,079
that I’ll always be your only one?

275
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,239
I do.

276
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
But now you’re lying to me!
You’re hurting me!

277
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,839
Are you an unfaithful man?

278
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,505
- Yes.
- Since you know you’re unfaithful, what should you do?

279
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:18,644
I should take my own life.

280
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:21,768
Fine, do it here then.

281
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,740
Your daughter is here, Father.

282
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,860
Father.

283
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,710
Father.

284
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,294
Father.

285
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,519
Your daughter is here.

286
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,844
Daughter?

287
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:46,239
But I don’t have a daughter.

288
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,079
Don’t you remember, Father?

289
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,639
You gave me away to
the hunter family when I was born.

290
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,399
On my fifth birthday,

291
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,813
I found out that I’m not
their biological daughter.

292
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:59,719
That’s why I looked forward to
celebrating my birthdays with you.

293
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,839
And receiving a birthday cake from you.

294
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,479
But you never came.

295
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,159
For my seventh birthday,

296
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,879
I got myself a piece of birthday cake
with the apricots that I picked.

297
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,186
But

298
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:14,319
the hunter’s child bullied me.

299
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,279
He seized my cake and threw mud on it.

300
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,719
He called me a parentless brute.

301
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,359
I cried for help.

302
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,479
But everyone stayed out of it.

303
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,319
And I saw you peeking
outside the courtyard.

304
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,199
I cried out loud for your help.

305
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,839
But you’re like others.

306
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,945
You just stayed out of it.

307
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,412
Do you remember it now?

308
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,639
I do.

309
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,719
Do you deserve to be my father?

310
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,399
I don’t.

311
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,898
Then tell me,

312
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,111
what should you do?

313
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,900
I should take my own life.

314
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,238
Do it with this scarf then.

315
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,479
Little Six!

316
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,959
Little Six!

317
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,273
Little Six!

318
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,359
It’s not him.

319
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,514
We must find Sixth Senior and others now.

320
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,759
I remember this tree.

321
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,079
We went this way.
Why are we back here?

322
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,719
Is it a hallucination?

323
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,039
It’s not.

324
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,119
Because the trees are moving.

325
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,399
Moving? How could the trees be moving?

326
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,879
- This...
- There’s only one tree that moves.

327
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,519
It’s called Migu tree.

328
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,399
I read it from Demon Manual.

329
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,039
Jialuo blood vine and
Migu tree grow together.

330
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,599
They reinforce and resist one another.

331
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,359
Are these all Migu trees?

332
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,619
No, there’s only one.

333
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,759
There’s only one Migu tree
in every hundred miles.

334
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,159
This forest is just its imaginary root.

335
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,679
And the real Migu tree
contains spiritual power.

336
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,479
The blood vine covets the power.

337
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,239
Thus, it wraps its root
around the real Migu tree.

338
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,639
The blood vine loves blood.

339
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,879
Let me lure it here with my blood.

340
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,919
I have spiritual power too.

341
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,719
Surely it’ll drag me to the real tree.

342
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,919
You just remember
where I’ll be dragged to.

343
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,279
That won’t do.

344
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,479
I know you’re eager to save them.

345
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,775
I’ve got an idea.

346
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:13,155
Look over there.

347
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,359
Those are rain butterflies.

348
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,439
We just need to make the Migu tree bloom

349
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,239
and let the rain butterflies
smell the flowers.

350
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,079
They’ll lead us to the main tree.

351
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,799
And we’ll get rid of the root of
the blood vine and save them.

352
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,399
But it’s obvious that
the tree isn’t blooming.

353
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,510
That’s why the rain butterflies
are all here.

354
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:37,599
The Migu tree has
a special characteristic.

355
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,530
It loves songs. They makes it bloom.

356
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,999
Their spiritual power are not bad.

357
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,479
The blood fruits smell nice.

358
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,460
This should do.

359
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,050
It works.

360
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,056
Xuan Ji, here.

361
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,799
- You’re up.
- Ling Long.

362
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,799
Great, you’re alright.

363
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,879
Of course I’m alright.
I saved you after all.

364
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,478
Can you get up?

365
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,981
Both of these blood fruits are wasted.

366
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,293
Pay with your lives!

367
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,741
Watch out everyone!

368
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:22,770
Watch out!

369
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,424
Ling Long!

370
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,300
Si Feng!

371
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:27,374
Si Feng!

372
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,537
Let go of Si Feng! Come at me!

373
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,755
Si Feng.

374
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,039
Si Feng.

375
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,399
Wake up, Si Feng.

376
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,919
Si Feng! Wake up.

377
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,281
Are you alright?

378
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,539
Si Feng.

379
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,559
Si Feng!

380
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,919
Wake up!

381
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,359
You shouldn’t be here.
Why don’t you wake up?

382
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,799
What are you afraid of?

383
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,751
Why don’t you look at me?

384
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,999
Are you afraid of me?

385
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,439
Si Feng.

386
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,239
Look.

387
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,432
I’m here. Wake up and you’ll see me.

388
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,157
Si Feng, I’m here to save you.

389
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,228
I’m right here!

390
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,319
Si Feng.

391
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,413
I’m alright. Use Five Elements Spell
to summon the Golden Touch.

392
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,700
Dragon Cut!

393
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,448
Whenever you get hurt by love,

394
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:32,399
each Green Feather mark will turn into
a Red Feather on your chest.

395
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,079
When all three Green Feather marks
turn into Red Feather marks,

396
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,013
your blood will flow backwards.
And you’ll die.

397
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,716
Si Feng.

398
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,959
We’re saved.

399
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,919
Yes, we’re saved.

400
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,333
Xuan Ji!

401
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,239
- Ling Long!
- Si Feng!

402
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,999
Are you alright? How are you?

403
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,559
- Xuan Ji! Are you alright?
- Ling Long!

404
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,880
- I’m okay. - Did... Did you...

405
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:19,919
This isn’t the place to talk.

406
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,719
We’ll deal with those demon spirits first.

407
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,012
Let’s go.

408
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,999
Demon spirits are formless.
Quickly use the Demon Slayer Charm.

409
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,319
We’re in the middle of nowhere.
Where can we get the charm?

410
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,636
I have it.

411
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,993
It’s you! Your formation has killed many!

412
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:00,559
I’m going to kill you in the name of God!

413
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,238
Please spare her!

414
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,356
Who are you?

415
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,328
Wait, this is my friend.

416
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,719
Brother Liu.

417
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,132
What’s wrong with you?

418
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,583
Little Phoenix, it’s a long story.

419
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:19,679
It’s all her fault.

420
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,039
Admit that you’re wrong.

421
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,380
It’s none of your business!

422
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,399
None of my business?

423
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,239
If I hadn’t saved you from the bad guys,

424
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,479
you’d be hiding from me, wouldn’t you?

425
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,319
And they controlled and
made you hurt people again.

426
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,775
If I hadn’t gotten here in time,
you’d be dead by now!

427
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:35,448
You’re so annoying, Old Fogey!

428
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,239
I’m a good-looking and
charismatic young man.

429
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,019
And you called me an old fogey?

430
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,399
Brother Liu.

431
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:45,798
Is this Yu Er?

432
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,919
Si Feng, who is this Brother Liu?

433
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,639
Why is he on this demon spirit’s side?

434
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,199
We’re from the same sect. He’s my senior.

435
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,919
Little Phoenix,
you need not cover up for me.

436
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,239
Let me introduce myself.

437
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,387
I’m Liu Yi Huan,
the abandoned disciple of Lizhe Palace.

438
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:03,399
I see.

439
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,978
Brother, what’s your
relationship with this demon spirit?

440
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:13,679
This is my daughter.

441
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,020
Her name is Yu Er.

442
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,959
Your daughter?

443
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,479
She’s a demon spirit.

444
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,159
You seem very young.
She doesn’t look like your daughter.

445
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,775
- Did you...
- Don’t misunderstand me.

446
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:28,639
It’s just that I take good care of myself.

447
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,159
As for Yu Er, she’s
really a half-demon.

448
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,559
She’s had an accident some time ago.

449
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,689
And she died and became a demon spirit.

450
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,479
She’s a naughty and immature kid.
I apologise.

451
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,279
Anyway, an eye for an eye.

452
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,319
Your daughter has killed many people.
She should be executed.

453
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,679
That won’t do!

454
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,679
She’s died once.

455
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,608
She can’t die again.

456
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,999
You gave birth to her with a demon.

457
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,159
That’s irrational of you.

458
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,359
And it’s wicked of you that
you let daughter hurt people.

459
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,919
You’re so irrational and wicked.

460
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,279
Even though you’re a friend of Si Feng,
we’re not going to help you!

461
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,239
That’s very rude of you, miss!

462
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,799
Moreover, she didn’t mean to hurt them.

463
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,362
Look.

464
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,079
Do you see it?

465
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,279
This... This is the charm
used to control demon spirits.

466
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,999
Someone is controlling
these demon spirits.

467
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,759
They’re forced to do evil
and grow Jialuo blood fruits.

468
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,593
Yu Er, tell me. Who forced you to do this?

469
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,145
I’ll teach him a lesson.

470
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,807
Say it.

471
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,759
- I’m not going out!
- What’s wrong?

472
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,759
Help me, please!

473
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,999
Help me, please!

474
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,732
What’s going on?

475
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,255
Someone has summoned her back.

476
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,112
I can still smell the aura of
those demon spirits.

477
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,279
They’re not far from here.

478
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,310
- Let’s go after them.
- Let’s go!

479
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,759
The blood fruits have all been used up.

480
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,719
Give me yours.

481
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,559
There’re some troublemakers in the forest.

482
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,439
They’ve ruined the blood vine.

483
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,654
Please have mercy on me
and give me some time.

484
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:37,199
What did you say?

485
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,839
Give you more time?

486
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,679
Who would give me mine?

487
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,372
If there’s no blood fruit, I’ll
use you to cultivate my pill!

488
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:50,842
Over there!

489
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,893
Let me go!

490
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,384
Help!

491
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,919
Help!

492
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,115
Help!

493
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,799
You...

494
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,839
It’s Elder Ling Shi of Xuanyuan Sect.

495
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,006
Don’t you ruin my plan!

496
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,239
My pill.

497
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,599
My pill!

498
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,239
As a sect elder,

499
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,319
how could you control
the demon spirits and kill the innocent?

500
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,919
You’ve gone astray!

501
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,399
It’s too late.
There’s no blood fruit left.

502
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,399
There’s no blood fruit left!

503
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,693
He won’t tell the truth because
he’s been bewitched by evil.

504
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:03,839
We’re juniors.

505
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,519
- There’s none left.
- There’s nothing we can do.

506
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,514
Instead, we should let
Elder Zhu Shi interrogate him.

507
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:14,280
That’s a very strong demonic aura.

508
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,851
Watch out everyone!

509
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,159
Xuan Ji, are you alright?

510
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,140
Si Feng, you’re bleeding.

511
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,519
Just a small scratch.
It’s nothing serious.

512
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,974
- Si Feng!
- It’s nothing serious.

513
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:11,479
Si Feng.

514
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,439
Why do you risk your life for her?

515
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,719
Lu Yan Ran, stop talking nonsense.

516
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,919
I’m worried about you!

517
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,519
Why do you risk your life for Chu Xuan Ji?

518
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,039
- I...
- Little Six.

519
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,559
Little Six, don’t scare me!

520
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,679
Or I’ll tell Father on you!

521
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,941
Wake up, Little Six!

522
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:31,326
Don’t scare me!

523
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,039
Min Yan.

524
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,826
You frightened me.

525
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:43,606
Ling Long.

526
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,272
Were you crying for me?

527
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,439
No.

528
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,199
The wind made my eyes water.

529
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,997
We feel the same way about each other.
Why don’t you admit it?

530
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,500
You must have injured your head.
That’s why you mistook me for Xuan Ji.

531
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,495
I, Zhong Min Yan,
only care about Chu Ling Long.

532
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:19,726
I’m not apologising.

533
00:42:19,727 --> 00:42:22,199
You feel the same way about me.
Why don’t you admit it?

534
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,799
We care about each other.

535
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,858
Can we stop lying to ourselves?

536
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,399
You confessed to my sister.

537
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,519
And now you’re doing this to me.
Are you making fun of us sisters?

538
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,076
If you let Xuan Ji
down, I’ll kill you.

539
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,052
Ling Long.

540
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,319
Xuan Ji.

541
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,540
Let’s clear things clear today.

542
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,824
- I...
- Min Yan.

543
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,919
You should think before you say it.

544
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,622
- What do you mean?
- You’ve upset Xuan Ji.

545
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:57,635
If you don’t care about Xuan
Ji’s feelings, I won’t forgive you.

546
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,999
Brother Liu.

547
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,443
Are you alright?

548
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,288
Yu Er is alright.

549
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,273
That’s Xuan Ji?

550
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,660
You’re stubborn indeed.

551
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,519
Si Feng.

552
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,479
Si Feng.

553
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,319
Why is everyone upset?

554
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,340
Why did Ling Long fight with
Sixth Senior again?

555
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,279
You really live up to your name.

556
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,239
I’ve heard and seen it all.

557
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,839
They’re upset because of you.

558
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,639
- Brother Liu.
- I...

559
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,399
This is an urgent situation.

560
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,439
Let’s find Yu Er’s charm stone first.

561
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,127
That’s right, Old Fogey.
Stop minding other people’s business.

562
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,005
Yes, the charm stone.

563
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,159
It’s an explosion.
Surely it’ll still in there.

564
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,472
Let’s go.

565
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,033
Si Feng, I...

566
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,132
Brother Liu.

567
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,039
This is it.

568
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,841
The charm stone which controlled
the demon spirits.

569
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,679
Yes, this is it.

570
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,280
Break it and Yu Er will be free.

571
00:44:48,281 --> 00:44:49,384
Wait.

572
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:52,234
This demon spirit has hurt many.
We can’t let her go just like this.

573
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,199
A demon spirit was born a demon.

574
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,727
According to the rule of five sects,
we can’t just let her go.

575
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:09,279
Yu Er made the mistake because
she’s forced by Elder Ling Shi.

576
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,599
Now that Ling Shi has run off
and other demon spirits are dead,

577
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,940
There’s no reason for us to kill Yu Er.
She’s one of the victims after all.

578
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,839
Si Feng is right.

579
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,439
Demon spirits are made up of
the remaining spiritual power of demons.

580
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,252
They’ve died once.

581
00:45:27,253 --> 00:45:32,079
If we kill them again, there’s
no way for them to turn good.

582
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,101
I don’t see it a righteous act.
