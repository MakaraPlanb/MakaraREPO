00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,319
<i>LOVE AND REDEMPTION</i>

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,718
<i>EPISODE 18</i>

3
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,765
Where am I?

4
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,279
Where is Wu Tong?

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,910
Answer me.

6
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,560
Answer me!

7
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,465
You want to eat?

8
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,239
Beggar’s Chicken of Shaoyang.

9
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,366
I remember that a disciple of
Shaoyang once said that

10
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,515
this is your favorite dish.

11
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,273
Eat it.

12
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,456
I won’t harm you.

13
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:21,815
Eat it.

14
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,966
Eat it.

15
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,259
The way you eat
reminds me of the time

16
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,159
when I was hunted by the five sects.

17
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,439
I had to hide inside the deserted valley.

18
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,277
That place is completely barren.

19
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:13,019
Only some rotten carcasses.

20
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,253
Take a guess.

21
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:19,114
What did I survive on?

22
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,588
What is it? You already want to
vomit just by thinking about it?

23
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:32,479
I spent a year like that.
So, you’ll eat this.

24
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,759
If you spit it out, I’m going to let you
have a taste of what I had.

25
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,310
Eat it!

26
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:43,741
Yes.

27
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,218
Eat it.

28
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,668
This is the Young Lady Chu that I know.

29
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,620
Now, you look more energetic.

30
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,799
I’m tired.

31
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,537
I want to take a nap.

32
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,439
Are all the famous and
upright sects like this?

33
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,231
I don’t have the intention to kill you yet
and you already want to kill me?

34
00:05:59,232 --> 00:06:03,020
If I was that stupid, do you
think I’ll be able to live until today?

35
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,919
Don’t waste your energy to fight me.

36
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,533
You won’t be able to kill me.

37
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,639
Here are all the most powerful
mythological objects in heavenly realm.

38
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,911
Just take whatever you like.

39
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:16,757
God of War.

40
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:20,359
This Dingkun Sword is an ancient
ominous sword. It’s foul and evil.

41
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,581
You... You better...

42
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,812
I’ll take this.

43
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,514
King Bailing!

44
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,279
King Bailing!

45
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,879
King Bailing.

46
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,248
Are you okay?

47
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,587
Just now, I saw that the God of War’s
life pillar is flickering.

48
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:02,599
I didn’t know why.

49
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,957
So, it’s because you are
casting spell on Dingkun Sword.

50
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,737
This is just a false alarm.

51
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:12,509
At first, I wanted to break her tie
with Dingkun sword and take it away.

52
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,039
But I failed.

53
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,399
Why?

54
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,348
Her life pillar will be affected too
if I try to take away Dingkun Sword?

55
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,639
Of course.

56
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,685
But I’m afraid that Dingkun Sword
is too evil that

57
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,832
it’ll awaken God of War’s memories.

58
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,291
And I’m afraid that her power
will be awakened soon.

59
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:33,639
King Bailing, you shouldn’t have given
that sword so easily to her back then.

60
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,761
What were you thinking?
For just a moment of her happiness?

61
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:39,518
You brought this upon yourself.

62
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,776
You...

63
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,559
You are wise and great.

64
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,799
You’ll definitely find a way.

65
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,560
I’m worrying for nothing.

66
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,981
I’ll use a spell to seal
the power of this sword first and

67
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,922
suppress the evil in it.

68
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:29,157
Are you okay, King Bailing?

69
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,709
It’s quite difficult to use this body
in the human realm

70
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,897
to suppress this mythological object.

71
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,779
I don’t know how long I can suppress it.

72
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,263
Si Ming, go back to Siming Hall now

73
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:59,722
to seal her life pillar and
chain up her past.

74
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,239
No matter it’s Dingkun Sword
or other things,

75
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,386
I’ll not allow any another
power to stir up her memories.

76
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,779
King Bailing, this...

77
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,213
You can’t interfere with the human realm.

78
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:17,156
But protecting lives is your duty.

79
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,519
It’s best if she doesn’t remember

80
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,839
those incidents that
she shouldn’t remember.

81
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,651
Only then can she be safe.

82
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,460
Yes, King Bailing.

83
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,599
Finally.

84
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,054
Her life pillar is sealed up.

85
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,637
But her memories are chained too.

86
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,749
And King Bailing is
a stubborn and difficult person.

87
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,308
Looks like it’ll be hard for
them to mend their relationship.

88
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:21,598
I can only hope that King Bailing
can help her reincarnate sooner

89
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:24,145
and bring her back to the heavenly realm.

90
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:29,160
Then, I’ll be able to update this
Tales of the Three Realms.

91
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,941
Let me in! Old Guy.

92
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:38,042
Old Guy, hurry up!

93
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:43,523
Lord Flying Snake.

94
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,199
Old Guy.

95
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,879
Wait, who are you calling an old guy?

96
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,782
Do I look like an old guy?

97
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,854
Let me ask you.

98
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:56,893
Where did the God of War go
to pass through her trial this time?

99
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,639
God of War?

100
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,218
Why are you asking about her?

101
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,676
Of course I want to go there
to compete with her.

102
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,919
- Come over here.
- Tell me.

103
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,140
Come over here.
Something bad has happened.

104
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,608
What happened?

105
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,319
Let me tell you.
But don’t tell King Bailing about it.

106
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,159
I lost the Dingkun
Sword that I’m guarding.

107
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,277
God...

108
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,920
Such a major issue?

109
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,022
So, I must go and find
God of War and get back

110
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,930
the Dingkun Sword before
King Bailing finds out about it.

111
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:41,309
Hurry up and tell me where she is now.

112
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,890
I’m not going there to fight with her.

113
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,877
She has been reincarnated by God.

114
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:53,646
How can a powerless deity like me
find out where she is?

115
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:57,325
You are too useless. Forget it.

116
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:59,562
I’ll go and find out about this
elsewhere then.

117
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,904
Don’t tell anyone that
Dingkun Sword is gone.

118
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,599
You are just a stinky snake.

119
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,518
I’ll record it down.

120
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,919
You are awake?

121
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,359
Senior Hao Chen.

122
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,959
Where is Si Feng? How is he?
Did you see him?

123
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,276
Did the vice palace lord
take him back to Lize Palace?

124
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:28,725
He is fine.

125
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,402
You can be rest assured now.

126
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,439
Good.

127
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,799
Xuan Ji.

128
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,319
Do you still remember your vow
to master before you left the mountain?

129
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,439
You vowed that you’ll protect
the secret ground forever.

130
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,839
So, you should always
put the secret ground first.

131
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,719
How could you just promise
to marry someone without thinking?

132
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,988
But I took down Si Feng’s mask.

133
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,782
If I don’t take responsibility for it,
he’ll be punished.

134
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:51,239
Nonsense.

135
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,999
When did Lize Palace have this rule?

136
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,076
Besides, no matter what,
this is Lize Palace’s matter.

137
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:58,967
You may be able to interfere this time,

138
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:01,593
but will you be able to do that forever?

139
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:05,498
You agreed to marry a man
without serious consideration.

140
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,497
Are you just going to abandon
your father, your sister and...

141
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,439
You’ll spend the rest of
your life with someone just like that?

142
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,469
I... I haven’t thought
that far ahead yet.

143
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:25,519
Forget it. Later, I’ll bring you to
Lize Palace to explain it to them.

144
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,239
Tell them that you made that decision
on a whim and that doesn’t count.

145
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,821
No. I’ve promised them.
How can I break my promise?

146
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,968
I can’t just wash my hands off Si Feng.

147
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:38,000
You don’t even listen to me now?

148
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,013
Of course I do.

149
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:41,782
You do?

150
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:43,839
Fine. Let me ask you then.

151
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,484
Why were you at Mount Gao?

152
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,185
What were you looking for?

153
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:53,773
I... I went to Mount Gao to
look for the Mirror of Origin.

154
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,679
Senior, don’t be mad.

155
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,079
I know that I promised you

156
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,519
to not look for
the Mirror of Origin anymore.

157
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,278
But I really want to
restore my six senses.

158
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,679
I want to be like everybody.

159
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,732
I have a friend who said that
he knows this mirror well.

160
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,851
He said that it’s not an evil mirror.

161
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:12,845
It will just let you see your past.

162
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,739
A friend? It’s Yu Si Feng again.

163
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,799
I put so much effort to teach you
all those years

164
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,239
but you trust him more than you trust me.

165
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,136
Si Feng has the same thought as me.

166
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:26,199
I want to feel those senses for myself.

167
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,540
Moreover, human has a heart to think.

168
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,519
We have eyes to see.

169
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,288
We have a nose to smell
and a mouth to eat.

170
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:38,757
If I give up all of those,
what else can I do?

171
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:42,057
The world has myriads of things
and a man’s heart is incomprehensible.

172
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:43,984
Before you left, I taught you

173
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:47,437
to always reflect on yourself
and don’t be bewitched by others.

174
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:50,118
But in the end,
you still let your desire won out.

175
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,458
I’m really disappointed in you.

176
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,519
Looks like there’s no need to continue
with this trial anymore.

177
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,228
Go back to Shaoyang and continue
your cultivation in Xuyang Peak.

178
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,039
No. I still haven’t heard from
Ling Long and Sixth Senior.

179
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,239
I must go.

180
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,365
Min Xing and Min Jue has already
gone to Mount Gao to look for them.

181
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,259
You don’t need to do anything.

182
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,159
You’ll be grounded in Fuyu Island first.

183
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,322
Practice with Spell of Tranquility
for 20 hours every day.

184
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:16,901
After everything is settled here,

185
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,919
go back to Shaoyang with me at once
and don’t leave it anymore.

186
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,038
And be a dedicated protector
for your whole life.

187
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,537
- No, senior!
- Go back now!

188
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:44,671
Do you know what it means
by taking off this mask?

189
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,999
I took it off.
I’ll take the responsibility for it.

190
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,766
What should I do? Tell me.

191
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,768
Marry him. Are you willing to do that?

192
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:55,279
Do you still remember your vow
to master before you left the mountain?

193
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,387
You vowed that you’ll protect
the secret ground forever.

194
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,941
So, you should always
put the secret ground first.

195
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,013
How could you just promise
to marry someone without thinking?

196
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:08,434
Are you just going to abandon
your father, your sister and...

197
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:13,943
You’ll spend the rest of
your life with someone just like that?

198
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:20,239
Vice Palace Lord.

199
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,017
The disciples are still waiting.

200
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,797
Are we going to bring Si Feng back now?

201
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:26,639
No.

202
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,460
Since that girl is willing to
risk her life for him,

203
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:31,759
we’ll let him stay.

204
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,833
Did you bring me the shards
of the Loveless Mask?

205
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,139
They are here.

206
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,997
This is the bark of Kunlun Tree.

207
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,175
It won’t break so easily.

208
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,779
Interesting.

209
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,860
Aren’t you curious
whether or not that girl

210
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,559
truly loves Si Feng?

211
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,939
I don’t know.

212
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:02,439
Let’s conduct a test then.

213
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,520
Yes, Vice Palace Lord.

214
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,584
The immortal Kunlun Tree.

215
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,950
So, it’s the Loveless Mask.

216
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:26,277
The mask is removed.

217
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:28,173
But the curse is still there.

218
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:29,798
Yu Si Feng.

219
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,704
Looks like you have no choice
but to work hard for Xuan Ji’s love.

220
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,599
Good.

221
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,310
Senior Hao Chen is not
watching me in the yard.

222
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,191
I can check on Si Feng now.

223
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,557
Our fight is not over yet.

224
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,639
How about we give it a go now?

225
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,060
- I don’t want to fight you.
- Then, I’ll bring Si Feng back.

226
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,597
If I win, are you not going
to bring Si Feng back?

227
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:07,658
Depends on your capability then.

228
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,812
Xuan Ji, are you okay?

229
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:19,238
Could it be that she’s not
the master of this sword?

230
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,676
I’m fine.

231
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,919
Vice Palace Lord,
what is the meaning of this?

232
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,597
Is it because Xuan Ji talked back to you?

233
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:30,750
So, you are seeking revenge now?

234
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,879
Isn’t it too shameful
to treat a junior like this?

235
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,559
I saw that her sword is very powerful.
So, I wanted to test it out.

236
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,558
I thought that Shaoyang Sect
has a new talent.

237
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,379
She’s not that powerful though.

238
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,597
I hope that you can stay
away from her from now on.

239
00:20:47,598 --> 00:20:49,315
How dare you!

240
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,771
How dare you talk to
your superior like that for a girl?

241
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:56,119
I haven’t punished you for the mask yet.
You want to add another offense?

242
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,892
I’ve promised to marry Si Feng.
What else do you want?

243
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:01,742
It’s still a crying mask
after you took off Si Feng’s mask.

244
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:04,293
It means that you don’t
truly love Si Feng.

245
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:06,892
How am I going to explain that
to Lize Palace?

246
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:10,407
But since Si Feng is
Lize Palace’s first pupil,

247
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,010
I’ll give you a chance.

248
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:18,868
Vice Palace Lord, are you asking
Xuan Ji to grow the Heart Lantern?

249
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,999
Your life depends on this test.

250
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,677
Don’t you want to give it a try?

251
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:25,358
That way, I’ll be able to give
palace lord an explanation.

252
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,813
What is Heart Lantern?

253
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:29,320
Little girl,

254
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:33,679
bury this shard in the soil
and water it with your qi.

255
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,368
If you have someone you want to love
with all you have,

256
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,479
it’ll grow within two days and
bear the fruit of Heart Lantern.

257
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,248
After that, take that Heart Lantern
and put it in Si Feng’s hands.

258
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:46,045
If the Heart Lantern is
as bright as before on his hands,

259
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:49,747
it means that your love
for Si Feng is true.

260
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,455
Do you want to give it a try?

261
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,199
It’s just a Heart Lantern. I’ll plant it.

262
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,317
Fine. I’ll wait for the result then.

263
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,199
Xuan Ji, it was so dangerous just now.

264
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,399
Why didn’t you use the power of
Dingkun Sword to fight him?

265
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,974
I don’t know what’s wrong
with this Dingkun Sword.

266
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:15,279
It’s like it is throwing
a tantrum just now.

267
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,342
I don’t care about that now.
I must plant this first.

268
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:18,919
I must grow it.

269
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,873
Then, the vice palace lord and
the others won’t pester you again.

270
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,986
Hero Yu.

271
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,982
This is Shaoyang Sect’s courtyard.

272
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:41,917
It’s not right for you to just
barge in here, right?

273
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:43,599
Senior Hao Chen.

274
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,999
Long time no see.

275
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,773
Xuan Ji always mentioned about you.

276
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:51,230
She said that you are the one
who taught her all her skills.

277
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,599
She has really learned a lot from you.

278
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,077
But I never heard Xuan Ji
mentioned about you.

279
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:57,283
Looks like both of you are not that close.

280
00:22:57,284 --> 00:23:00,156
Xuan Ji is innocent, naive and
doesn’t know the way of life.

281
00:23:00,157 --> 00:23:04,022
It’s not surprising that she’ll
agree to anything just to help you.

282
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:06,695
Please don’t take it to heart.

283
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:11,052
And don’t hope for any
result for your one-sided love.

284
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:23,279
Xuan Ji.

285
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,588
Will you be able to grow
that Heart Lantern?

286
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,079
Junior.

287
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,627
Junior, eat something.

288
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:07,229
I don’t want to eat.
I don’t want to eat anything.

289
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,317
If you continue like this,
your body will not be able to take it.

290
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:14,189
I don’t want to eat. Don’t ask again.

291
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,006
What should I do? Time is almost up.

292
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:34,437
What if I can’t grow it?

293
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:37,253
What will happen to Si Feng
if I can’t grow it?

294
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,981
You don’t have a heart.

295
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:07,302
How can you grow a Heart Lantern?

296
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,705
Yu Si Feng is the one who seduced you.

297
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:11,766
He deserves this.

298
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:25,949
She managed to grow the Heart Lantern?

299
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,334
She was just away from me
for a few months.

300
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:30,932
And she already has the ability to love?

301
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,446
With this ability,

302
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,349
her last chance of passing this trial
will be destroyed.

303
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,180
Now, they won’t be able to tell.

304
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,599
Her two days will be up tomorrow.

305
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,507
Without the Heart Lantern, it’s
time for Yu Si Feng to give up.

306
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,400
<i>WEST WATER PAVILION</i>

307
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,799
Look how unhurried he is.

308
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,159
The daughter of a leader sect
wants to marry him.

309
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,686
How wonderful.

310
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:28,501
He has really brought pride
to Lize Palace.

311
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,719
Brought pride?

312
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,966
The rules of Lize Palace
have already become a joke.

313
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,573
He dragged the whole Lize Palace down
with his matter.

314
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,594
How thick-faced he is.

315
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,399
We are all from the same sect.
Why do you have to say that?

316
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,841
Although Si Feng doesn’t like to gossip,

317
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:51,578
it doesn’t mean that these remarks won’t
fall into the ears of our palace lord.

318
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:55,694
Don’t be bothered by them.

319
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,178
Ruo Yu.

320
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:01,618
Your scar...

321
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,737
You know about Lize Palace’s rules too.

322
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:10,252
Losing my mask is a grave crime.
Of course I’ll be punished.

323
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,428
This scar is just a minor punishment
as a warning.

324
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:15,614
The Sky Hall is going to
make a ruckus today.

325
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:17,839
And I’ve fought them before.

326
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,401
So, the palace lord allowed me to come
with the vice palace lord to deal with it.

327
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:24,382
After it’s done, I’ll be sent into
the 13 Punishments Lianyu Pagoda.

328
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,405
I still naively think that
maybe the palace rules

329
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:32,426
will be more humane now.

330
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:36,900
But by the looks of
it, I was too hopeful.

331
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:41,374
So, I’m even more worried about you,
Si Feng.

332
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,957
I didn’t know that
your mask was like that.

333
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,639
Today is the day.

334
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,033
Will Xuan Ji be able to
grow the Heart Lantern?

335
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:55,566
This is a first.

336
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,347
So, I don’t know.

337
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:00,723
I believe in Xuan Ji.

338
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:04,254
Since she could take off
my mask, her love for me

339
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,158
must be real.

340
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,226
When did I fall asleep?

341
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:25,894
Heart Lantern?

342
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:32,370
I managed to grow the Heart Lantern.

343
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,917
King Bailing!

344
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,998
King Bailing, so the Kunlun wood that
you planted

345
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:50,094
can grow into a Heart Lantern too.

346
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,199
That’s not right.

347
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,730
You practice Heartless Tactics in both
the heavenly realm and human realm.

348
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:56,437
How can you grow a Heart Lantern?

349
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:59,722
And it’s such a huge Heart Lantern.

350
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:03,079
When Chu Xuan Ji took your Heart Lantern,
not only it doesn’t wither,

351
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,822
it shines even brighter.

352
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:06,279
Interesting.

353
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,976
Interesting.

354
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,900
This is just a tactic to make
Yu Si Feng give up.

355
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,359
Si Ming, if you think that you have
too much time in Siming Hall,

356
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,520
I don’t mind throwing you into
Water of Forgetting

357
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:21,691
and let you go through the
Path of Reincarnation.

358
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,279
King...

359
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,584
Farewell, King Bailing.

360
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,134
Chu Xuan Ji is still not here.

361
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:42,277
Si Feng, looks like the true love
that you are hoping

362
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:43,807
is not going to happen.

363
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,446
Si Feng!

364
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,425
Si Feng!

365
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,438
Si Feng!

366
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,386
I managed to grow the Heart Lantern!

367
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:00,967
Look. I managed to grow the Heart Lantern.

368
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:07,740
I know that you’ll
be able to grow it.

369
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:12,079
Great.

370
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,559
This Heart Lantern is so pure.

371
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,464
It means that you really
have someone who you love.

372
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,741
I already grew the Heart Lantern.

373
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,518
So, you won’t take him away now, right?

374
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,185
Hurry up and give it to Si Feng.

375
00:30:31,186 --> 00:30:34,999
The disciples of Lize Palace
will be your witness today.

376
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,373
If the Heart Lantern still shines
like it is shining now,

377
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:41,073
it means that the one you love is Si Feng.

378
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:44,428
And Lize Palace will have nothing to say.

379
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,117
Don’t break your promise then.

380
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,909
Why is it like this?

381
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,060
The one you love is not Si Feng?

382
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:17,165
Si Feng, I’m the one
who grew the Heart Lantern.

383
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,265
Why will it wither? I...

384
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:25,018
Of course you are sincere to
save Yu Si Feng from danger.

385
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,599
Xuan Ji, let me ask you.

386
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,181
You agreed to marry him because
you want to help him and save him from

387
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:45,093
being punished by Lize Palace, right?

388
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,451
Yes.

389
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:51,479
I want to help Si Feng.
Isn’t that sincerity?

390
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,599
Yes.

391
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,010
Shaoyang Sect has always been
kind and righteous.

392
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:58,126
My junior was just feeling
compassionate towards him

393
00:32:58,127 --> 00:32:59,926
and wants to help him.

394
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,679
That’s it.

395
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,030
All the misunderstandings
have been resolved today.

396
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:08,805
Please forget about this
marriage agreement between them.

397
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:10,599
Let’s not talk about it anymore.

398
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,940
Thank you for your understanding.

399
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,709
Xuan Ji, let’s go.

400
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,273
But, Si Feng...

401
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,582
I...

402
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:22,825
I’m fine.

403
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:25,102
Xuan Ji.

404
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,399
You have already done a lot for me.

405
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,269
Next, I’ll settle it myself.

406
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,695
Go back.

407
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,119
Si Feng.

408
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,418
Did I screw this up?

409
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:47,839
Forget it.

410
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,501
Who can say that wanting
to save your friend is insincere?

411
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,493
This is so touching.

412
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:57,974
I won’t blame Si Feng on this then.

413
00:33:57,975 --> 00:34:02,565
Chu Xuan Ji, you don’t have to worry now.

414
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,725
Really?

415
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:08,143
Look. The vice palace lord
has already forgiven me.

416
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,026
I’ll be fine.

417
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,160
Don’t worry. Go back.

418
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:16,001
Xuan Ji, let’s go.

419
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,489
- Si Feng...
- I’m fine.

420
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:58,034
Si Feng.

421
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,693
What a pity. Your Loveless Curse
has no chance to be broken now.

422
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:25,223
Stay here if you want.

423
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:29,714
Nothing is more painful than having
your hope crushed by the one you love.

424
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,397
And no punishment

425
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:37,098
is more painful than the suffering
of the Loveless Curse.

426
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:44,025
Si Feng.

427
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:48,362
I’m fine.

428
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,671
Xuan Ji

429
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:54,599
is different from others.

430
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,039
Since the first time I met her,

431
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,141
she is very different from normal people.

432
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,291
I should’ve stayed away from her.

433
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,545
So,

434
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,497
unless it’s Xuan Ji’s personal choice,

435
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:18,319
I won’t believe in anything else.

436
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,519
Clear you mind.

437
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,621
The cloud is thin, and the wind is light.

438
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:36,399
This Star Cloud is very calm.

439
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,653
It means that my Spell of Tranquility
is working well.

440
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,134
I won’t be scolded by Senior Hao Chen now.

441
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,868
I’m fine.

442
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,354
You have already done a lot for me.

443
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,810
Senior Hao Chen said that
I made joke out of Si Feng.

444
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,639
Si Feng looked so sad just now.

445
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,779
Will vice palace lord trouble him again?

446
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,674
This is bad. I disrupted my qi
because I was distracted.

447
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,119
- Si Feng!
- Why were you so careless?

448
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,821
I was practicing the Spell of Tranquility
just now. But I kept thinking about you.

449
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:33,752
So, I accidentally disrupted my qi.

450
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,557
You kept thinking about me?

451
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:38,658
What about your heart then?

452
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,005
- I...
- Xuan Ji.

453
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:43,797
When you said that you’ll marry me,

454
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:47,138
did you say it out of
friendship and pity only?

455
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,140
Don’t you feel anything
different for me?

456
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,781
What kind of different feelings
are you talking about?

457
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,482
When we were at the wine
cellar, I’ve told you how I feel.

458
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,138
If you don’t understand,

459
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,020
I’ll...

460
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:15,510
make you understand it better then.

461
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:44,399
What’s wrong with me?

462
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,119
Why is my heart beating so fast?

463
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,700
I feel ill.

464
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,543
Si Feng, do you want to eat this fruit?

465
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:04,199
It’s especially sweet.

466
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,246
You’re scolded by vice palace lord today.
You must be in a bad mood.

467
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:09,133
You’ll be happier after eating this fruit.

468
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:10,555
Si Feng!

469
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,621
Si Feng, I...

470
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,133
Si Feng, why are you acting so weird?

471
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,358
Si Feng, I...

472
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,319
Xuan Ji.

473
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,109
I like you.

474
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,201
More than anyone and anything.

475
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,002
I don’t want to share you with others.

476
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,082
I hope that

477
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,939
you’ll always be mine alone.

478
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,319
This hairpin is a love token
from my father to my mother.

479
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,399
I’ll give it to you now.

480
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,046
Si Feng.

481
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:07,919
This hairpin is too precious.

482
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,790
You should keep it well.
How can you give it to me?

483
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:15,022
I give it to you
because it’s important.

484
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:20,300
I hope that you can understand
my feelings for you and yours for me.

485
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:24,324
There were many misunderstandings because
I took Sixth Senior’s thing last time.

486
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:26,790
I can’t simply take
someone else’s thing again.

487
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,959
Si Feng, I never thought that

488
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,319
you’ll become so strange after
taking off your mask.

489
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,217
If I had known that it’ll be troublesome,
I wouldn’t have taken it off.

490
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:38,500
I can’t take this hairpin. Keep it.

491
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,256
Xuan Ji.

492
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,293
Xuan Ji.

493
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:42,030
What are you doing?

494
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,557
Why is this cold water?

495
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:46,340
I...

496
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,029
It’s so hot and uncomfortable.

497
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,823
What happened?

498
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,541
Xuan Ji.

499
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,799
Yu Ning, is something wrong with my mind?

500
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,782
I can’t stop thinking about Si Feng.

501
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:13,742
I...

502
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:17,238
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

503
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:20,159
It’s so uncomfortable and hot.

504
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,773
Am I sick?

505
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:25,813
Or did someone cast a weird spell on me?

506
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:26,956
Yes.

507
00:42:26,957 --> 00:42:30,154
I think Si Feng cast a spell here.

508
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,879
Here? Really?

509
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,742
You really don’t know?

510
00:42:35,743 --> 00:42:38,471
This spell is called heartbeat.

511
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,534
Heartbeat?

512
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:46,962
It’s like when I see my
handsome Pian Pian,

513
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:51,318
my heart will beat so fast
like there’s a rabbit inside it.

514
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:00,119
Xuan Ji.

515
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,174
But I’ve never felt this way before.

516
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:05,365
And I don’t feel
the same way towards others.

517
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,949
That’s because Si Feng is different.

518
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,479
Different?

519
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,295
Is everyone the same as me?

520
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,097
You look innocent.

521
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:19,181
But you are actually very bold.

522
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:22,685
But, if it wasn’t because I’m worried
that it’ll affect my cultivation,

523
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,111
me and Pian Pian would have...

524
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,959
- It’ll affect my cultivation?
- Of course.

525
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,292
Do you know how many couples
have given up the chance to be deity

526
00:43:33,293 --> 00:43:35,172
in order to defend their love?

527
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:41,094
Looks like this is not something good.

528
00:43:41,095 --> 00:43:42,814
It’s our personal choice.

529
00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:45,359
It’s not up to others to decide
whether it’s good or bad.

530
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,066
You must decide.

531
00:44:05,822 --> 00:44:08,068
You should’ve been
heartless and senseless.

532
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:10,110
How did you fall in love?

533
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,295
I can’t let you fall into this love trap.

534
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,639
Xuan Ji, what’s wrong?

535
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,846
I don’t know why
I’m feeling hot and bothered.

536
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:25,797
I’m going to take a cold bath.

537
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,028
This is a symptom when your basics
for the Heartless Tactics are not stable.

538
00:44:33,029 --> 00:44:36,453
If someone goes too near to you
and says something seductive,

539
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:39,101
you’ll feel that kind of
weird feeling just now.

540
00:44:39,102 --> 00:44:41,449
Did you encounter that lately?

541
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,742
I...

542
00:44:44,743 --> 00:44:47,718
When I talked to Si Feng before this,

543
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,229
the same thing happened.

544
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,439
Is this really because of a mistake
during my training?

545
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,220
It happened to you too when
you were with Yu Si Feng?

546
00:44:57,726 --> 00:45:00,852
This is a symptom showing that
your cultivation is not stable enough.

547
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:03,479
Be careful not to go too near to him.

548
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,380
I don’t want you to overdo it
and harm yourself and the others.

549
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:09,199
So serious?

550
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,275
Why would I lie to you?

551
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:14,719
You should listen to me,
get rid of all distractions,

552
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,901
practice your Spell of Tranquility
and cultivate yourself well.
